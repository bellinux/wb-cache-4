5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit.|$|E
25|$|Cryptodomes {{are formed}} when viscous lava is forced upward causing {{the surface to}} bulge. The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens was an example; lava {{beneath the surface of}} the mountain created an upward bulge which <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> north side of the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Middlesbrough made {{an ambitious}} {{return to the}} Premiership and {{attracted}} expensively-signed big names like Nick Barmby and the Brazilians Juninho and Branco. They went fourth in the Premiership in October 1995, sparking hopes of UEFA Cup qualification, but an injury crisis severely demoralised the side and they <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table to finish 12th.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 2007, Laiho <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lane at {{a bowling}} alley after accidentally {{stepping}} over the foul line. He slammed hard into the wall, breaking his left shoulder. This rendered him unable to play guitar for six weeks. Due to this incident, Children of Bodom was forced to cancel their first 2007 tours and a festival that they were slated to headline.|$|E
25|$|Mark Martin {{dropped out}} on lap 160 with a blown engine. He {{was the first}} of the six {{championship}} contenders to drop out, and his chances for the title were over. After a strong first half, Harry Gant <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> standings, and he too fell out of contention for the title. Kyle Petty was still running at this point, but was nay a factor. The title would be settled between Allison, Elliott, and Kulwicki.|$|E
5000|$|The Helio Ocean was a dual slider Internet-enabled {{multimedia}} wireless {{mobile device}} sold by [...] mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) wireless carrier Helio, and manufactured by Pantech Curitel. A distinctive design {{feature of the}} Ocean was its dual sliding mechanism — when <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> vertical position, it revealed a telephone keypad. When <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> horizontal position, it revealed a 35-key QWERTY keyboard.|$|R
60|$|I <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> window-seat, {{and stood}} facing them, {{not knowing what}} else to do. They, too, seemed equally confounded.|$|R

25|$|While {{attempting}} the pickup, a Chinook {{transport helicopter}} crashed {{in the darkness}} at 10:09 PM when the rear rotor hit a tree, and the helicopter <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope and over a cliff, exploding in flames and killing all the crew and passengers. There was an element of ABLE Troop 3-71 CAV 2nd Platoon still left on the PZ after the crash that worked relentlessly to recover the bodies of their 10 comrades and destroy sensitive equipment left among the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The train's {{speed at}} the time of {{derailment}} was an estimated 65–70km/h. The F 1200 locomotive was the first to derail, sliding down the embankment until it came to rest on its right side on the road below. The cars between the locomotive and the dining car were completely destroyed while the dining car partially <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> embankment towards the road, ending up at a 45° angle on the slope between the embankment and the road. The last two cars remained standing on the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Remarkably for an {{unsuccessful}} car, in his only ever race, Marcus Winkelhock started last at the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring but after getting his tactics {{right at the}} start of the wet race (by changing tyres after the warm up lap), Winkelhock found himself leading the race with a 33-second lead after just two laps due to most of the field either pitting for wet tyres or spinning off. The race was stopped due to the dangerous conditions. Winkelhock officially led the race for 7 laps but as the conditions improved following the restart, he <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field in his uncompetitive car and eventually retired after 15 laps.|$|E

25|$|The first {{crash of}} the weekend {{occurred}} during the Friday afternoon session. Maurício Gugelmin crashed in turn 3. His car got loose exiting turn 2 and hit the inside wall at 66.2 Gs. His foot became lodged between the pedals, and the car accelerated. The car <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> backstretch and hit the outside wall in turn 3 with a force of 113.1 Gs. The car continued to slide until it reached the apex between turn 3 and turn 4. Guglemin claims to have blacked out during the crash, {{but he was not}} seriously injured. Gugelmin was wearing the HANS device. He withdrew, nursing bruised shoulders and ribs, and sat {{out the rest of the}} weekend.|$|E
25|$|By {{act of the}} Territorial Legislature, the vessel's {{official}} name was to be Lot Whitcomb of Oregon. She was launched on December 25, 1850 with a general celebration. Present for speeches and vote-getting were Oregon's territorial governor, John P. Gaines and Mayor Kilbourne of Milwaukie. The U.S. Army brass band from Fort Vancouver played patriotic tunes, and at 3:00 p.m. that day, the props were knocked out and she <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ways into the Willamette River. Unfortunately a tragic accident marred the celebration. Frederick Morse, captain of the schooner Merchantman, then loading lumber from Whitcomb's sawmill, had unloaded an old saluting cannon from his vessel, {{and was in the}} process of firing it when it burst. Shrapnel from the destroyed barrel flew through the air and hit Captain Morse in the neck, killing him instantly. No one else was hurt, and the celebration continued unabated for several days.|$|E
25|$|For the Giro d'Italia, Voigt rode {{in support}} of Basso. Following Team CSC's team time trial win on stage 5, Voigt found himself second, {{trailing}} race leader Serhiy Honchar by six seconds. During the first mountains, Voigt helped Basso take the overall lead, while he <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> board and finished 37th. On mountainous stage 19, Voigt and Julich were in a 20-man break, but as Team CSC was leading the peloton to defend Basso's first place, Voigt and Julich did not work. Up the last climb, Voigt was alone with Spanish rider Juan Manuel Gárate, but as Voigt did not think he had done enough to deserve the victory, he let Garate take the win. Voigt finally got his first win {{of the season in}} the Ster Elektrotoer race in June. There he won stage 4 and helped teammate Kurt Asle Arvesen to the overall win, two weeks before the Tour de France.|$|E
60|$|AS soon as {{they had}} passed, little Benjamin Bunny <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> road, and set off--with a hop, skip and a jump--to call upon his relations, {{who lived in the}} wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.|$|R

25|$|The Hutchinson Building {{was built}} in 1954 and was named after the hospital's late superintendent. Construction started in 1949, but was brought to a halt when the entire {{foundation}} <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill, creating a landslide {{much like the one}} that occurred in 2006. The construction site was moved to a different location and the building's design had to be altered to prevent further sliding. This building contained the intensive care unit, x-ray facilities, a small cafeteria, barber shop, isolation units, physical therapy areas, and observation rooms, and instrument sterilization equipment. Each floor had patient rooms on the ends of the building surrounding a nurses pod, all separated by half-glass walls so the nurses could easily observe all of the patients. Also in this building were the morgue, laboratory, and autopsy unit. Prior to the demolition of Dixmont, the building was assessed to decide whether it could be reused like the Cammarata Building. However, poor drainage had completely flooded the basement and renovation costs were figured to be greater than the value of the building itself, so it was demolished.|$|E
25|$|Sutil dived past Ericsson at the Loews hairpin to {{move into}} 16th on lap 13, as drivers {{struggled}} to keep heat in their tyres. The time deficit between Rosberg and Hamilton varied but held a larger advantage {{over the rest of}} the field. Sutil continued to move up the field after passing Chilton at the Novelle chicane to take over 15th on the 17th lap. Rosberg locked his tyres heavily driving into Mirabeau corner but the German driver avoided going into the turn's escape road on lap 18. Shortly afterwards, the stewards issued five-second stop-and-go penalties to Chilton, Ericsson and Gutiérrez for being out of position on the starting grid. Hamilton started to lap faster than teammate Rosberg before the latter responded by going two-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton to extend his lead. Ricciardo closed to within 1.1 seconds of Räikkönen by lap 22 upon going one second faster than Räikkönen. Cresting a rise leaving the tunnel on the 24th lap, Sutil's car became light under braking from , speared into the inside barrier, and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> escape road at the Novelle chicane. A marshal ducked under the barrier to avoid getting struck by debris. Sutil was unhurt but the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to remove debris from the track.|$|E
500|$|The {{wreck of}} Bismarck was {{discovered}} on 8 June 1989 by Dr. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer responsible for finding [...] Bismarck {{was found to}} be resting upright at a depth of approximately , about [...] west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some [...] above the surrounding abyssal plain, triggering a [...] landslide. Bismarck <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately, Uncle Alec {{came along}} at this crisis {{and said he}} thought we'd better come home now, since the fires were nearly out. We <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> fence and started, taking care to keep close {{together}} {{and in front of}} Uncle Alec.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{probably}} a wandering of the reasoning powers, {{created by the}} frequency of intoxicating drafts," [...] observed the surgeon, as he deliberately threw his left leg over the pommel of <b>the</b> saddle, and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> {{right side of his}} horse.|$|R
60|$|The road now {{ran along}} the side of a hill. Here the heavy fall of snow had <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> over <b>the</b> rocks and the going was {{anything}} but safe. The faithful old horses had all they could do to keep their footing.|$|R
500|$|The U-20 class {{boats were}} armed with two [...] torpedo tubes {{located in the}} front and carried a {{complement}} of two torpedoes. They were also equipped with a 66mm/26 (2.6in) deck gun and an [...] machine gun. The first of the class to be launched was U-21, when it <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ways on 15 August 1916; the final boat launched was U-22 on 27 January 1917. The boats entered service between August and November 1917.|$|E
500|$|Formidable {{was ordered}} {{as part of}} the 1937 Naval Programme from Harland & Wolff. She was laid down at their Belfast {{shipyard}} on 17 June 1937 as yard number 1007 and launched on 17 August 1939. Just before the launch ceremony was to begin, the wooden cradle supporting the ship collapsed, and the ship <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slipway while workmen were still underneath and around the ship. One spectator was killed by flying debris and at least 20 others were injured; Formidable, however, was not damaged. Because of the incident, the carrier was referred to as [...] "The Ship That Launched Herself". She was commissioned on 24 November 1940.|$|E
500|$|Jacques became {{pregnant}} in 1952, but worked {{though most of}} her pregnancy, appearing in the Players' revue The Bells of St Martins between August and November 1952: she <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table and did the splits at the end—something The Times thought was [...] "especially good", although The Manchester Guardian considered that she was [...] "monumental of person but surprisingly thin of voice". Le Mesurier reported that he was [...] "faintly relieved" [...] when the revue {{came to an end}} because of her exertions, added to which she appeared in the 27 episodes of the third series of Educating Archie between September 1952 and June 1953. She then directed—but did not appear in—the Players' Christmas pantomime of 1952, Babes in the Wood.|$|E
