50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{a design}} will often begin {{as a very}} high level block diagram, becoming more and more detailed block diagrams as the design progresses, finally ending in block diagrams detailed enough that each individual block can be easily implemented (at which point the block diagram is also a schematic diagram). This is known as top down design. Geometric shapes are often used in the diagram to aid interpretation and clarify meaning of the process or model. The geometric shapes are connected by lines to indicate association and direction/order of traversal. Each engineering discipline has their own meaning for each <b>shape.</b> <b>Block</b> diagrams are used in every discipline of engineering. They are also a valuable source of concept building and educationally beneficial in non-engineering disciplines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Preparation of {{semi-solid}} Sn– 58 Bi alloys by mechanical stirring casting {{method was}} investigated. The effect of temperature below the melting temperature on the microstructures and mechanical properties of semi-solid Sn– 58 Bi alloys was discussed. The experimental {{results showed that}} long plate <b>shape,</b> <b>block</b> shape and suborbicular Sn phases were formed by mechanical agitation during the casting solidification process. The non-lamellar Sn-Bi Microstructure improves prominently the elongation of Sn-Bi alloy. The elongation of semi-solid Sn-Bi alloy with suborbicular Sn phase is enhanced up to 37 % compared with the elongation of lamellar eutectic Sn-Bi alloy prepared by conventional die casting. After the agigation above 130 ℃, non-lamellar Sn-Bi eutectic structure is formed and lamellar Sn-Bi eutectic precipitates. When the agitating temperature was 135 ℃, the elongation of semi-solid Sn-Bi alloy mixed with non-lamellar and lamellar Sn-Bi alloy microstructure is enhanced up to 24 %...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{examination}} of the robustness of standard split-plot analysis for a two factors design with complete blocks under normality assumptions. For instance, in ceramics firing, the main factors are the oven temperature A and the clay mixture $B$. With a block factor it is possible to control different geometrical shapes of each piece. In a factorial design each piece would be treated separately and, in this case, at fixed temperature A for a particular clay mixture B. If the design is a split-plot, a batch (whole-plot) is defined with different clay mixture pieces (sub-plots) of the same <b>shape</b> (<b>block)</b> and is simultaneously treated at a fixed temperature in the oven. The simultaneous application of treatments to a group of experimental units violates the independence of error terms. The usual equicorrelation assumption, characterizing split-plot designs, may no longer be assumed when an unknown spatial dependence is acting on the error term. Under this general assumption it is proved that the usual tests for block and main effects of A are exact and equivalent to the standard case. The standard tests for the main effect of B and interaction A x B are not F-distributed. Nevertheless, with an approximation it is possible to recover robustly the well-known procedure...|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{separated}} BI-RL is {{to combine}} separately deblurred sub-image blocks into the resulting output image without block artifacts. Obviously, {{this is not}} a new approach. What is new in the proposed separated BI-RL is that the proposed method can suppress block artifacts efficiently for arbitrarily <b>shaped</b> <b>blocks.</b> This flexibility is important for the success of separated BI-RL; simulation results of this paper will show that diagonally <b>shaped</b> <b>blocks</b> produce better results than rectangularly <b>shaped</b> <b>blocks</b> for separated BI-RL in the deblurring problem modeled by a diagonal point spread function (PSF).|$|R

40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems, {{which provide}} {{a variety of}} popular services, such as file sharing, video {{streaming}} and voice-over-IP, contribute {{a significant portion of}} today’s Internet traffic. By building overlay networks that are oblivious to the underlying Internet topology and routing, these systems have become one of the greatest traffic-engineering challenges for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and the source of costly data traffic flows. In an attempt to reduce these operational costs, ISPs have tried to <b>shape,</b> <b>block</b> or otherwise limit P 2 P traffic, much to the chagrin of their subscribers, who consistently finds ways to eschew these controls or simply switch providers. In this paper, we present the design, deployment and evaluation of an approach to reducing this costly cross-ISP traffic without sacrificing system performance. Our approach recycles network views gathered at low cost from content distribution networks to drive biased neighbor selection without any path monitoring or probing. Using results collected from a deployment in BitTorrent with over 120, 000 users in nearly 3, 000 networks, we show that our lightweight approach significantly reduces cross-ISP traffic and, over 33 % of the time, it selects peers along paths that are within a single autonomous system (AS). Further, we find that our system locates peers along paths that have two orders of magnitude lower latency and 30 % lower loss rates than those picked at random, and that these high-quality paths can lead to significant improvements in transfer rates. In challenged settings where peers are overloaded in terms of available bandwidth, our approach provides 31 % average download-rate improvement; in environments with large available bandwidth, it increases download rates by 207 % on average (and improves median rates by 883 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of urban}} concept is {{cadastral}} area of Brno – Holásky. This area is designated area for development in spatial {{plan for the}} city of Brno. Area is designated for housing, social care and education. The area has size of 42 ha and it is defined by the railway in the east. From the south hit is V Aleji and U potoka street. The border continues along road towards shopping mall Olympia. The west border is consists by Holásky lakes. In the north the border goes through structure between V Aleji street and Ledárenská street. The area is relatively attractive mainly due the close connection nature sight Holásky lakes. Also interesting is location within the city of Brno. Altough the area is located outside the larger city center, there is a good accessibility to the center. The new residential housing area provides space for approximately 1400 inhabitants. The structure and vertical articulation is based on response of the surrounding buildings. The V Aleji street defines an axis that helps to create new space for central square. Another axis it the road from the V Aleji street towards Holasky lakes. This is major line connecting residential area and the surrounding with the area of lakes. This street also devide the area into two parts. Right part, northern, consisting with coherent block with dimension of 200 x 300 metres. Outside part of the block consists of blocks of flats. The inner part is filled with family houses and public space belonging to blocks of flats. Part of the block is also elderly house. The left, southern, part concludes the L <b>shape</b> <b>block</b> of current housing. Again the edge of block is formed by blocks of flats and family houses in inner part. At the end of the axis heading to Holasky lakes is kindergarten in direct relation to natural park. Next to the Holásky lakes there will be space for sports and recreation. Will include beach volley, football and wooden pier on lake. In this part also will starts cycling path to the city center. Stationa...|$|E

40|$|Concrete block paving is a {{cost-effective}} road construction method suitable for medium to low traffic roads. However, this {{concrete block paving}} technique is yet to develop as a fully fledged road construction method. Literature review has shown {{that there are some}} contradictions among past findings on <b>block</b> <b>shapes</b> and laying patterns. However, field performance has not been evaluated in selecting the most suitable <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and laying pattern. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate the most effective <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and laying pattern for roads with medium to low traffic. Under this study, concrete blocks were cast according to the specifications in predetermined shapes, and paving was done with different <b>block</b> <b>shapes</b> and patterns in a road that contains vehicular traffic with a high percentage of heavy trucks and buses. A selected 100 m road length was divided into 10 equal parts, and blocks were paved according to selected patterns and <b>block</b> <b>shapes</b> from a finite-element model (FEM) analysis of a previous study in each different section. Deflection was measured using the Benkelman beam deflectometer, and block displacement was measured using a vernier caliper. The most effective <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and pattern were selected by comparing deflections and block displacement in each combination of <b>block</b> <b>shape</b> and patterns. The analysis of results shows that the most effective combination of variables for cement concrete block laying are the unistyle <b>block</b> <b>shape,</b> the stretcher and herring block pattern, and the zero or 90 ° block angle.
