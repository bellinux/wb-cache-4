40|$|This bachelor's work {{entitled}} "Holding therapy by Prekop used {{in social}} work" {{deals with a}} topic which is in my opinion very up to date and interesting, for some people a little controversial. Therefore it was more interesting {{to carry out this}} work and in the practical part to map how this method is viewed by social workers in facilities offering social services according to the Act (Legal Gazette 108 / 2006) concerning social services in the South Bohemia. The first theoretical part is focused on the historical development of this method. Even if this method is relatively new. Then it is focused on the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holding</b> therapy by Prekop (HTP) in psychotherapy, where it belongs among alternative,potentially dangerous or problematic approaches in psychotherapy, conceptions with a tight connection to HTP, because this therapy is to rekindle love and bonds between the participants of the therapy, definition of the method, essential aims, forms and contraindications of the therapy, how the training of the therapists is provided and to the ethical codex. It further describes the current state of this method in the Czech republic and its connection with social work. The last chapter is dedicated to the social facilities, offering social services, defined in the Act mentioned above. Because the practical part of this work is focused on social workers and workers providing social services in social facilities according to the mentioned Act. For dealing with the practical part I determined two sub-objectives. The purpose of the first one was to find out, if the social workers and the workers in social services in social facilities know about HTP. The purpose of the second one was to find out, if the HTP method is used when working with clients anywhere in the South Bohemia. I set two hypotheses on the bases of these aims. The first hypothesis: "The method of the Holding therapy by Prekop is not widespread among the social facilities in the South Bohemia. " And the second hypothesis: "The workers in social services and social workers in the South Bohemia are not sufficiently informed about the¨ possibility of using the HTP method. " The data for my research were gained by making a survey using questionnaires. There were 22 questions altogether. 19 closed ones, 1 semi-closed one and 2 open ones. (see the attachment number 3). The representative sample was made of social workers and workers providing social services in social facilities in the South Bohemia according to the mentioned Act. I looked up the facilities in the Register of providers of social services, which is supervised by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The research was divided into two phases. In the first phase I chose 12 organisations out of 72 (the total amount) to make a pre-research. Then I addressed the 60 remaining ones. I was told to be given back the filled in questionnaires by 50 organisations. I distributed 250 questionnaires altogether, I left them in the facilities from one to two weeks and then I personally collected them. I got back 238 filled in questionnaires. I had to take out 12 questionnaires because of faults and missing information. Therefore the data were gathered from 226 questionnaires. I used the categorical data analysis and the statistical processing using second grade sorting to evaluate the gathered data. The correctness of the hypotheses was tested by chi-square test of compliance. The data from the survey are showed in graphs and tables and then more precisely in the discussion part. The first hypothesis: "The method of the Holding therapy by Prekop is not widespread among the social facilities in the South Bohemia. " was confirmed. And the second hypothesis: "The workers in social services and social workers in the South Bohemia are not sufficiently informed about the possibility of using the HTP method. " was disproved...|$|E

A sample of 90 randomly selected respondents of both farmers and fishermen were interviewed using a structured questionnaire so as to acquire their socio economic characteristics and all the matters related to climatic change food systems in their area. The research was conducted from July 2009 to June 2010. The data obtained were then coded and analysed by using SPSS computer program. The average respondent age was 37 years, average household size was 4. 7 and education <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>hold</b> was 23. 3 % have secondary education, 74. 5 % have primary education and 2. 2 % have no education. <b>The</b> average production <b>of</b> food crops was 5. 5 tons per year. The most vulnerable aspect of food system according to this study was production followed by distribution, exchange and consumption.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> immigrants in <b>the</b> Canadian labour market by focusing in two relatively new dimensions.

Weekly wage differences between immigrants and the native born are driven mostly by penalties associated with immigrants' lower returns to social skills, but not to analytical or manual skills. Interestingly, low linguistic proximity between origin and destination language imposes larger wage penalties to the university-educated, and significantly affects <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jobs they <b>hold.</b> <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> linguistic proximity on <b>the</b> skill content <b>of</b> jobs immigrants hold over time also varies by <b>the</b> educational level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> migrant. We also show that immigrants settling in Quebec and whose mother tongue is close to French have similar or better labour market outcomes (relative to native-born residents in Quebec) than immigrants with close linguistic proximity to English settling outside Quebec (relative to native born residents in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Canada).

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author. © 2003 Dr. Malcolm McKenzie ParkThis thesis {{began as an}} investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> adverse possession upon the land market where the adverse possession extends only to a small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abutting parcel and the subject land is under a title registration scheme. <b>The</b> consequence <b>of</b> such adverse possession on part only of a parcel is that <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary demarcating <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respective domains <b>of</b> two adjoining land parcels may be displaced. If part parcel adverse possession effectively transfers ownership of {{a small portion of}} an abutting parcel, the boundaries are shifted consequent to long term occupation, and will prevail over the strict technical legal boundary. In a registered title land system the occupational boundary then prevails over the legal boundary as certified in the register notwithstanding that registered title schemes purport to confer conclusiveness upon register entries. Alternatively, the registered proprietor’s estate is not paramount where any part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proprietor's parcel has been adversely occupied. Consequently the occupier has an interest in the proprietor's land that is not disclosed in <b>the</b> register. Inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register and reliance upon the inspection is insufficient to ascertain <b>the</b> complete legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular land <b>holding.</b> Inspection with consequent reliance upon the register is <b>the</b> major function <b>of</b> a registered title scheme. Alternatively, if part parcel adverse possession is ineffective to transfer ownership <b>of</b> registered land, <b>the</b> technical legal boundary prevails over the occupational boundary {{despite the fact that it}} is not the boundary accepted by the parties involved as governing. Both alternatives present a problem to <b>the</b> orderly conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land market. Where occupations prevail, the prudent market participant takes precautions besides relying on inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register. Where the legal boundary prevails, the participant seeks confirmation that the occupational and legal boundaries coincide. Another alternative utilised in some registered title jurisdictions empowers a court to transfer small sections to an adjoining landholder where a building or similar improvement is erected so that it encroaches upon <b>the</b> adjacent <b>holding.</b> This alternative was included within <b>the</b> ambit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis as it developed. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this research was <b>the</b> formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best solution suitable for a registered land system with particular reference towards a uniform solution suitable for adoption in all Australian jurisdictions. The existing systems utilising adverse possession and statutory encroachment were evaluated against three recent law cases that illustrate <b>the</b> workings <b>of</b> these systems including perceived shortcomings. These lawsuits serve as a test against which the existing systems are compared and evaluated and were also used to evaluate the proposed solution. The results suggest that adverse possession alone should not override <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register which is to fully disclose the proprietary interests in land parcels. It was concluded that a necessary step in acquiring title to land through adverse possession involves <b>the</b> registration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interest acquired. Whereas <b>the</b> present modes <b>of</b> dealing with <b>the</b> boundary problem are adequate, it is concluded that the best mode is that of statutory encroachment because it best serves several competing interests. Adopting the proposed solution would involve change and compromise in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian jurisdictions; these being necessary to adopt a uniform scheme throughout Australia. The proposed solution has added benefits of removing an illogicality from some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present systems, eliminating encouragement for an off-register land market, and fosters an accurate public land register.
