5000|$|An Australian work boot (or generically elastic-sided boot) is a {{style of}} work shoe, {{typically}} constructed with a leather upper bound together with elastic sides and pull tabs {{on the front and}} back of the boot. The shoe lacks a tongue, and laces, and often contains a <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> for occupational health and safety reasons. When the shoe contains a steel cap they are often known as [...] "safety boots" [...] or [...] "steel toe boots". The boots generally lack an inner lining. The sole is generally polyurethane and the leather uppers are treated to be resistant to hot water, fats and mild alkaline and acid solutions.|$|E

50|$|A {{deal with}} Stiff Records was secured, {{with the band}} being told to record their cover of the Glitterbands 1975 hit Goodbye My Love at 12 hours notice. Dumbfounded as to why an {{original}} song had not been chosen Goodbye My Love was released in February 1981 and declared by journalist Carol Clerk Pop with <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>caps</b> and became a turntable hit, spending several weeks in the National Airplay charts. But despite radio and press promotion and a national tour with the UK Subs and Anti-Pasti, distribution problems ensued, in addition the single was difficult to obtain and sales were not sufficient to interest Stiff Records in a follow up. By mid 1981, 6 months after being hailed as a Slade for the 1980s, The Stiffs were now 2 years too late, by mid 81 the original line-up split.|$|R
5000|$|... 1800s: During the 19th century {{football}} became {{extremely popular}} in Britain. People who played would wear their heavy {{and hard work}} boots to play. These were the first ever boots with the <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> at the front, long laces and ankle support. These boots also had metal studs or tacks put in the sole the bottom so the players would have more stability on the pitch. In the later part of the 19th century the first ever football-specific boot was designed, made of thick and heavy leather which ran right to the ankle for increased protection, the first boot weighed 500 g and would double in weight when it was wet.|$|E
50|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment can {{be categorized}} by {{the area of the}} body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high reflectivity and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical resistivity for protection from electric shock.

40|$|Auto Focus is an {{exploration}} of the contemporary photographic self-portrait featuring 75 international photographers. The editor catechises photographers’ compulsions to make self-images framed by the observation that such image-making thus renders the ‘self’ in some respects always an ‘other’ (Bright, 2010 : 8). The book’s fourth chapter, ‘Studio & Album,’ includes the series work 'Health & Safety,’ which comprises nine photographic performance self-stagings. ‘Health & Safety’ alludes to the apparent absurdities of contemporary regulations for safety at work. In these images the body is the object whilst utilitarian objects themselves 'act' for the camera., The focal point of the series is the wilfulness of a fifty-year-old woman who performs for the camera at a time when, in further areas of popular media, women of this age are removed or must contrive a youthful appearance. The research utilises Bonnell’s aesthetic of ‘Wilful Amateurism’ and her research of human behaviour to situate a boiler-suited older woman ‘dressing for work’ under generic EU guidelines but utilising domestic kitchen items as clothing. These domestic items are attached to the figure with red tape (jelly moulds act as <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>capped</b> boots etc.). The series builds to culminate in a vision of domestic madness. The performance uneasily straddles farce, absurdity and tragedy, drawing vitality from the instability of its foundation...|$|R
5000|$|As the 1920s were approaching, {{football}} {{had yet to}} get a real stranglehold on the county. Along {{the lanes}} and streets of Tralee and {{in the fields of}} north Kerry, some fine hurlers were emerging,. Jackie Ryan was still a teenager in 1919 when the county board called a special meeting to discuss the state of Gaelic games in Kerry. Din Joe Baily - a man under whose gentle and politically-neutral watch the games in the county prospered - was influential on the board at the time and after this meeting had concluded, Kerry saw a clear road ahead. Importantly; the backbone of the team that would dominate the coming decade - with Jackie Ryan as a vital cog - was also forming. [...] On the field, Ryan was regarded as a crafty, scientific forward. 'When Mikey Sheehy was growing up, people in Austin Stacks used to say he's going to be another Jackie Ryan,' says Barrett. 'That was the cut of a player he was. Total style. He had this extraordinary talent for chipping the ball when it was rolling away from him,' he says. 'That was his trademark. And we're talking about a time when players wore cumbersome, orthopaedic boots with big <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>caps.</b> [...] Tipp came surging back in search of victory but Barrett held his ground and kept them at bay. When Tipperary started to tire John Joe Sheehy took the lead forKerry with a point from a free and then Jackie Ryan blasted an unstoppable shot into the back of Tipperary's net.Still the initiative had been very definitely taken from Mayo, {{and by the end of}} the third quarter Kerry had gone five points ahead. Three of the points, by Jackie Ryan, came. off frees to Tim Landers, and the other two were scored by Con Brosnan and Miko Doyle. [...] (1932 All Ireland Final)One ball rules all others in Kerry though and it is the love and respect for that ball which is why they rule. For every hour Tadghie Lyne spent on the hardfloor, he'd spend countless others in his garage, kicking and catching a football suspended by its laces from the rafters, or in Fitzgerald Stadium, attempting points from thecorner flag. Jackie Ryan would hone on Rock Street the knack of chipping the rolling ball.|$|R

5000|$|The Dunlop KT26 {{became a}} lasting favourite. In 2003, Dunlop Footwear {{calculated}} it had {{sold more than}} 5 million pairs since release. Versions were made in synthetic with suede, full suede and vinyl uppers and with lace up or Velcro tab closing. In addition to sport and recreational uses, the KT26 became a standard clothing issue item for many Australian factory workers and was widely used by construction and other outdoor workers. Dunlop Footwear later made a [...] "safety" [...] version with a <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap.</b> Its sole tread pattern made it a choice for bushwalking, canoeing, rafting and rock fishing where it was also valued for its low saturated weight and quick drying. A version, the Dunlop KT Centurion, was made for the Australian Defence Forces. Dunlop KT Walker shoes, in leather or canvas uppers, used the same wedge and sole design. Dunlop KT26 Osaka was a specialty line. The Dunlop KT XLC is a cheaper, lighter and fully synthetic variation.|$|E

50|$|Harness {{boots are}} {{designed}} to protect the motorcycle rider from the heat of the exhaust pipes and the engine block and from injury to the foot and leg {{in the case of an}} accident while riding and may include a built-in <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and metal shank in the heel. Whereas engineer boots have a rounded toe, harness boots typically have a square toe. Unlike engineer boots that have an adjustable leather strap across the ankle, harness boots have a non-adjustable system of four leather straps and two metal rings: one strap goes across the top of the foot at the ankle, one strap wraps around the rear of the foot at the ankle and two more straps rise from sole on either side ankle. The four straps are held in place by the two metal rings that are located on either side of the ankle. Typically, these boots possess a pair of pull-straps on either side of the tops of the shafts. Some manufacturers replace these straps with an adjustable leather strap located on the outside top of the shafts, similar to engineer boots. Soles and heels are usually made of hard rubber and may either be relatively flat or may have lugs for increased traction.|$|E

Field {{studies were carried out}} for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in real wear situation. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Even low sweat rates (3 g/h) can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 %).

40|$|Present {{standard}} on safety footwear (EN 344) checks the insulation only {{at one point}} in the shoes by means of measuring the temperature change. A method that uses thermal foot model allows to measure footwear insulation simultaneously at various locations and for whole footwear as well. In the present work the method of heated foot model was developed further. It is possible to simulate sweating and evaluate reduction of insulation of footwear due to wetting and evaporative heat loss. The conditions with various sweat rates, wear length and foot motion were tested. Footwear with various insulation levels (from thin rubber boots to thick winter boots) was evaluated. Some footwear was manufactured both with and without <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and this allowed to study the thermal effect of <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> in different conditions. Comparative studies between various methods (thermal foot model, humans, EN 344) for evaluating footwear thermal properties/insulation were carried out. Field studies were carried out for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in real wear situation. The insulation of footwear can vary depending on region and insulation level of the footwear. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Sweat rates of 3 g/h can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 % depending on initial dry insulation). At higher sweat rates (10 g/h) the reduction could be up to 36 %. Combined effects of sweating, walking and wind could reduce insulation by about 45 %. Reduction was bigger in warm winter boots. Only small amount of moisture evaporates from winter footwear during use. Insulation reduction levelled off over longer periods of use. The reduction can be calculated by simple equations. The thermal foot model gave similar insulation values as measured on human subjects in thermal comfort. The insulation values were used for validation of a mathematical model for foot skin temperature prediction. The results obtained with a thermal foot model give more useful information on footwear than does the present standard for footwear thermal testing. Thus, the thermal foot method is recommended for use as a standard. A <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> in a footwear seems to have no influence on insulation, but may modify the heat losses from the foot. The influence could be related to the “after effect” that probably depends on the mass of <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap</b> and its thermal inertia.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} cold weather safety footwear {{and the possible}} thermal effects of steel toe caps in footwear. Two models of boots were used. Both models were manufactured in two variants - with and without <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap.</b> The boot insulation was measured with an artificial, heated foot (AHF). One model was used in experiment with subjects (n= 6). Cold exposure consisted of sitting for 60 minutes at - 10 °C. There were no differences between insulation levels of boots with and without steel cap for one boot model, but the differences were statistically significant for the second model showing slightly higher insulation values for the boot without steel cap. No significant differences due to insulation dissimilarities could be found from the measurements on subjects. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} for both models regarding the rate of change of heat loss from AHF when its location was changed from warm to cold and back to warm. The rise and decrease of heat loss from AHF depended on the rate of temperature change of the boots. The results showed that a faster change in heat loss from AHF occurred for boots without steel toe caps. Data from subjects seemed to confirm this by a somewhat faster, though not significant, rise in toe skin temperatures after cold exposure in boots without steel toe caps. The effect may be attributed to the higher mass and heat contents of the boots with <b>steel</b> <b>toe</b> <b>cap...</b>|$|E
