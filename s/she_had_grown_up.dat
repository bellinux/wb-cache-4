The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning slavery in the United States. Stowe's opposition to slavery sprang from a moral passion based on her Christian faith. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> {{the daughter of a}} Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.|$|E

Lavish court display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from into an ornamental and honorific cult.

It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated {{the image of a}} philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine. After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.|$|E

500|$|The {{first song}} {{completed}} in Los Angeles for Paramore, [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] {{was produced by}} musician Justin Meldal-Johnsen. Development for the song started in a hotel room, where Taylor York created an audio loop with his keyboard, which Williams likened to works by Siouxsie and the Banshees and Paula Abdul. Upon hearing it, Hayley Williams proposed that they should write lyrics to it. Later, Williams and York started layering their voices to imitate those of gospel choir members. Six months later, they recorded with a gospel choir composed of six individuals: Brandon Hampton, Joslyn James, Katherine and Sean Dancy, Talitha Manor and Yolanda Harris-Dancy. Williams, who was familiarized with gospel music, linked {{the inclusion of a}} gospel choir in the song to her upbringing, in which she frequently went to churches.

[...] Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her [...] "slow speed, other projects and family matters" [...] delayed [...] its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, would think of ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga [...] "a bit ironic," [...] because she [...] "wanted to do something different from manhwa or manga," [...] which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year. However, in May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American branch, with the status of global manga titles left unclear. 12 Days is also published in Germany by Tokyopop Germany.|$|E

500|$|Nina was {{originally}} written {{as a bad}} girl character, but when the writers rewrote the role for Goodrem, she became a painfully shy school student who was described as being the [...] "quintessential girl-next-door". Nina learned to be independent {{from an early age}} as she was travelling with her parents all over the world. She has a complicated relationship with her mother, who she sees as an embarrassment to her. In 2004, her personality underwent a change, and she was no longer shy; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> and had become more assured. Goodrem's manager suggested that Nina should be an aspiring singer and Neighbours developed the character to suit her. Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show. One of Nina's longest running storylines was her relationship with Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan). They began their relationship while they were seeing other people and they break up twice. However, Nina realises that she loves Jack and returns from India to tell him. Goodrem believed Nina and Jack were soulmates. Nina was well received, and Goodrem won the Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award for the role.|$|E
500|$|During her brief {{personal}} rule, Mary, Queen of Scots {{brought with}} her many of the elaborate court activities that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> with at the French court. She introduced balls, masques and celebrations designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. The most elaborate event was the baptism of the future James VI at Stirling Castle in 1566, organised by her French servant Bastian Pagez. This combined complex imagery, incorporating classical themes of the goddess Astraea and {{the revival of the}} classical golden age, with the chivalry of the Round Table. The ceremony was followed by a banquet, hunts, feasting, poetry, dance and theatre, cumulating in a staged siege and fireworks. The court returned to being a centre of culture and learning under James VI. He cultivated the image of a philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine that were seen in his [...] "joyous entry" [...] into Edinburgh in 1579. The grandest event of his reign was the baptism of his son and heir Prince Henry in 1595. For this the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle was rebuilt to mirror the proportions of the Temple of Solomon. There were three days of feasting, a staged tournament and a masque featuring a ship of state crewed by classical deities and muses. Masterminded by William Fowler, it was pointedly designed to build the image of the king and support his claim to the English and Irish thrones.|$|E
