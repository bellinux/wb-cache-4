40|$|Most studies {{involving}} cement-stabilized soil blocks (CSSB) concern material properties, such as {{the characteristics}} of erosion and strength and how {{the composition of the}} block affects these properties. Moreover, research has been conducted on the performance of various mortars, investigating their material properties and the tensile bond strength between CSSB units and mortar. In contrast, very little is currently known about CSSB <b>masonry</b> <b>structural</b> <b>behavior.</b> Because structural design codes of traditional masonry buildings were well developed over the past century, many of the same principles may be applicable to CSSB masonry buildings. This paper details the topic of flexural <b>behavior</b> of CSSB <b>masonry</b> walls and whether the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) code can be applied to this material for improved safety of such buildings.

30|$|As {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} {{research}} project, {{a review of the}} technical literature on experimental research on the deformation capacity of <b>structural</b> <b>masonry</b> was conducted.

30|$|In general, the {{deformation}} {{capacity of}} <b>structural</b> <b>masonry</b> is influenced {{not only by}} the failure mechanism but also by many other factors, such as constituent materials, geometry, pre-compression level, etc. Hence, despite the inherent randomness associated with masonry as a material, the classification of the URM piers based only on their failure mechanisms seems to be the main reason for the observed scatter in the values of the ultimate drift capacity. Unfortunately, due to inhomogeneous experimental data and a lack of reliable mechanical models (as described in the following sections), we are still not able to properly take into account the influence of all factors affecting the deformation capacity of <b>structural</b> <b>masonry.</b> Furthermore, the assignment of a specific failure mechanism to a test is often a fairly subjective matter. Obviously, to get a clearer picture of the problem, in addition to conducting more tests, we need to develop reliable mechanical models to describe the load-deformation behaviour of <b>structural</b> <b>masonry.</b>|$|R

All common materials have environmental impacts during their production process, but designers may choice the materials and techniques with less impact among the viable options. The objective of this work is to examine embodied energy in materials of two traditional constructive alternatives, {{in the region of}} São Leopoldo, a city in southern Brazil. Construction options considered are the reinforced concrete structure and the <b>structural</b> <b>masonry.</b> The study was developed under investigation of a social housing project typical in the region.

40|$|Masonry is a non-homogeneous material, {{composed}} of units and mortar, {{which can be}} of different types, with distinct mechanical properties. The design of both masonry units and mortar {{is based on the}} role of the walls in the building. Load-bearing walls relate to structural elements that bear mainly vertical loads, but can serve also to resist to horizontal loads. When a <b>structural</b> <b>masonry</b> building is submitted to in-plane and out-of-plane loadings induced by an earthquake for example, the masonry walls are the structural elements that ensure the global stability of the building. This means that the walls should have adequate mechanical properties that enable them to resist to different combinations of compressive, shear and tensile stresses. The boundary conditions influence the resisting mechanisms of the structural walls under in-plane loading and in a buildings the connection at the intersection walls are of paramount importance for the out-of-plane resisting mechanism. However, it is well established that the masonry mechanical properties are also relevant for the global mechanical performance of the <b>structural</b> <b>masonry</b> walls. Masonry units for load-bearing walls are usually laid so that their perforations are vertically oriented, whereas for partition walls, brick units with horizontal perforation are mostly adopted...|$|R

The data has been statistically analysed and the results discussed: the central and dispersion measures were calculated and several probability distributions have been fitted to the sample data and subsequently tested using standard methods of statistical theory. Further, the results obtained from all four building sites have been compared, thus providing quantitative information {{about the quality of the}} work on different sites.

40|$|The current {{acceptance}} criteria for <b>structural</b> <b>masonry</b> {{in accordance with}} International Building Code allows for the prism test method to be used. However, without a proper understanding {{of the effects of}} variable material properties such as individual masonry unit compressive strength and the various material moduli of elasticity, as well as the effect of field conditions on the unit’s performance, masonry prisms may “fail” to reach the design compressive strength (f’m). By identifying causes of failure and evaluating the failure magnitude, it is concluded that when the masonry prism test method is utilized for acceptance testing of as-built masonry structures, additional testing should be performed on the grout in order to fully understand the influence that grout strength and possible grout deformation on the concrete masonry unit during the uniaxial compression test. If grout and block characteristics indicate it is appropriate, some combination of the unit test method and the prism test method may be appropriate to provide a determining reliability of test result implications.

It is worth noting here that even the conventional force-based seismic design approach is strongly connected to the deformation capacity parameter through the force-reduction factor which is used in the estimation of design force of structures in the force-based seismic design approach. Furthermore, the deformation capacity plays a crucial role in the seismic assessment and retrofitting of existing structures, which has become one of the main research topics in structural engineering.|$|R
30|$|A {{substantial}} amount of theoretical work has been invested in modelling <b>structural</b> <b>masonry.</b> Simple models are based on linear theory of elasticity and its application to <b>structural</b> <b>masonry.</b> Regarding the serviceability limit state, i.e. when investigating the behaviour of masonry subjected to load levels up to 40 - 50 % of the ultimate load, {{the applicability of the}} linear theory of elasticity is beyond dispute. However, when approaching higher load levels nonlinear modelling is generally required. Hereby, both geometrical and material nonlinearities must be taken into account. In general, there are three sources of nonlinearity in the in-plane response of URM piers: geometrical nonlinearity due to the evolutionary partialization of cross-sections as cracking spreads within the panel, material nonlinearity in the elastic range and material nonlinearity in the plastic range (Augenti and Parisi 2009 a). Hence, a reliable model must be able to consider all the above-mentioned sources of nonlinearity in a proper way. Since only very few closed-form solutions for nonlinear problems are available, numerical solution methods must be applied. Such solutions are usually obtained by means of Finite Element Method (FEM) procedures. However, the main problem when applying FEM is related to the modelling of the material. Since masonry is composed of two components, i.e. masonry units and mortar, and is highly anisotropic and nonlinear, modelling the physical reality is very demanding.|$|R
40|$|No Brasil há uma crescente demanda por projetos de edifícios em alvenaria estrutural, com a progressiva elevação do número de pavimentos, impondo a necessidade de aprimoramento dos modelos de cálculo. Uma questão pouco estudada é o comportamento da interseção de paredes sob carregamento vertical, fenômeno que influencia a distribuição das ações ao longo da altura do edifício. Alguns autores admitem a transferência de forças de uma parede para outra, desde que haja o intertravamento dos blocos ao longo das {{interfaces}} das paredes. Há pelo menos duas formas de considerar a interação no dimensionamento estrutural: durante a distribuição das ações verticais ou na consideração do enrijecimento da parede.

Realizou-se a modelagem numérica via MEF dos painéis de alvenaria ensaiados, para comparação do comportamento.

Some authors argue that there is a transfer of forces from one wall to another in as much as there exist interlocking between the blocks along the wall interface. There are at least two ways to consider the interaction of walls in the structural design: during the distribution of the vertical load or on considering the stiffening of the wall. In order to verify the interaction of wall and thus investigate the force transfer ratio, full-scale specimens were tested at the EESC-USP laboratory.

40|$|A {{viscoelastic}} {{constitutive model}} is proposed {{to evaluate the}} evolution in time of historical <b>masonry</b> <b>behavior.</b> <b>Masonry</b> structures may be subject, over time, to damage due to creep phenomena, accompanied by a consequent redistribution of stresses and strains. Two models are presented and compared. A discrete element model and a continuous model based on analytical homogenization procedures. Both models {{are based on the}} following assumptions: (i) the structure is composed of rigid blocks; (ii) the time dependence of <b>masonry</b> <b>behavior</b> is concentrated in mortar joints, modelled as viscoelastic interfaces. The rigid block hypothesis is particularly suitable for historical masonry, in which stone blocks may be assumed as rigid bodies; the hypothesis of viscoelastic mortar is based on the observation that nonlinear phenomena may be concentrated in mortar joints. The continuum homogenized model provides, in an analytical form, constitutive equivalent viscous functions; the discrete model describes masonry as a rigid skeleton such as to evaluate both its global and local behavior. A parametric analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of (i) mortar-to-brick thickness ratio; (ii) masonry texture (running versus header bond); and (iii) size of heterogeneity (block dimensions) with respect to panel dimensions. Elementary cases are proposed to directly compare constitutive functions of continuum and discrete models. In addition, a meaningful case is proposed: a masonry panel in which the principal stresses are both of compression and the no-tension assumption may therefore be discounted.

The work is actually {{the first step of}} a wider research into the seismic retrofitting of historical masonry buildings through base isolation systems. In detail, two different approaches to masonry modeling have been adopted: a homogenized model and a heterogeneous model. Homogenization procedures allow modeling masonry as an equivalent continuum but with account for the real configuration of masonry material. Instead, in the heterogeneous modeling strategy, masonry units and mortar are distinctly described using continuum or discontinuous elements, blocks, joints and/or interfaces. Although the heterogeneous modeling allows a better description of the <b>masonry</b> <b>behavior,</b> the need of modeling separately bricks and mortar limits its applicability to small panels, while continuous modeling may be easily applied to large portions of masonry structures. A parametric analysis has been carried out on simple wall panels in order to evaluate the reliability of the two approaches and their capability to take into account some parameters that influence the <b>structural</b> <b>behavior</b> of <b>masonry,</b> such as the quality of constituent materials, the arrangement of bricks, the presence of openings.

40|$|The R. Guastavino Company {{constructed}} <b>structural</b> <b>masonry</b> vaults for wings E and H of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (the Museum) between 1910 and 1912. In {{the early}} 1960 s the Museum relocated the Egyptian and Near- and Far-Eastern galleries to these wings, which {{in combination with}} growing numbers of visitors doubled the design live load for the vaults. To accommodate this change, the Museum demolished the Guastavino vaults {{and replaced them with}} steel beams even though consulting engineers had not performed a thorough structural assessment prior to demolition. The vaults were a part of a landmark McKim, Mead and White building and warranted appropriate analysis to determine their capacity under increased loading demand. This thesis investigates both history and structural analysis. Primary sources reveal that the consulting engineers hired by the Museum were unfamiliar with the structural analysis of unreinforced masonry vaults, leading to the decision to demolish them. These historical events contextualize the quantitative focus of the thesis, which is to provide engineers with accessible techniques to structurally assess unreinforced masonry systems. This enables decisions based on evidence rather than a lack of comprehension of structural behavior. Three important assumptions about <b>masonry</b> <b>behavior</b> are adopted: <b>Masonry</b> has no tensile strength, it has unlimited compression capacity, and it will not fail from sliding between blocks or segments. With these assumptions, masonry analysis is primarily a problem of stability rather than elasticity. Analytical equilibrium and graphical techniques are used to determine vault stability under dead and live loading. Two vaults are investigated: A scaled Guastavino vault built for a recent exhibit, and a representative cross-vault from wing H of the Museum. Two methods of modeling structural behavior are used for each analysis technique: The triangle-arch and sliced parallel arches methods. Analysis shows that the Museum vaults had the capacity to resist the increased live load. by Jonathan Calman Ellowitz. Thesis: M.
