25|$|When {{the genetic}} {{abnormalities}} {{that occur in}} advanced colorectal cancer were first identified, {{one of the most}} frequent events was found to be loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of region 18q21. One of the first genes sequenced in this region was DCC, and it was subsequently analyzed for tumour <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity.</b> However, the lack of somatic DCC mutations made it seem likely that the nearby SMAD2 and SMAD4 genes were the reason for 18q21 LOH. The fact that DCC heterozygotes had no increased rates of cancer, even when crossed with mice carrying Apc mutations, solidified this viewpoint. The finding that DCC was a receptor for netrin-1 involved in axon guidance initially moved research away from DCC in cancer. It was later realized that DCC may be involved in directing cell motility, which has direct implications for metastatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of IGF2 RNA expression when H19 RNA was downregulated provides {{further evidence that}} IGF2 expression is tightly coupled to and dependent on the absence of H19 expression. As well, the loss of H19 in adrenal cancers may be indicative of tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> by H19, leading Gao et al. {{to suggest that the}} loss of H19 and subsequent gain of IGF2 may be involved in adrenal cancer induction. Although Gao et al. found that there was not one CpG methylation site that was more important than the others in downregulating H19 expression, they did find that the increase in CpG methylation in adrenal carcinomas followed the pattern of methylation of the normal, hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals. The mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs peaked at sites 9 and 10 in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals and the lowest mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs dipped at site 7 in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals.|$|E
25|$|The pRb {{protein is}} inactivated by E7 in HPV+OPC, but in HPV-OPC {{it is the}} p16 tumour {{suppressor}} part of the pRb tumour suppressor network that is inactivated. Also the pRb pathway is inactivated by E7 instead of Cyclin D1 amplification. CDKN2A is a tumour suppressor gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein, p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependant kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest. p16 expression is cell cycle dependent and is expressed focally in only about 5â€“10% of normal squamous epithelium. Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a diagnostic marker for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity,</b> they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.|$|E

In accordance with the oncogenic role of CIP2A, overexpression of CIP2A promotes Ras-elicited cell growth and transforms immortalized human cells (HEK-TERVs). More recently CIP2A has been shown to regulate phosphorylation and activity of many other oncoproteins and to drive malignant cell growth and tumorigenesis in various human cancer types. Importantly, CIP2A deficient mice are viable, suggesting that targeting of oncogenic function of CIP2A would not results in serious side-effects.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{development}} of immunological donor-specific hyporeactivity {{may account for}} the low incidence of chronic rejection after clinical liver transplantation. We investigated whether hyporeactivity commonly develops after liver transplantation by analyzing precursor frequencies of donor-reactive cytotoxic (CTLp) and helper (HTLp) T lymphocytes and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactivity in liver allograft recipients. We further studied whether CTLp hyporeactivity correlated with changes in donor-specific HTLp frequencies or <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity.</b> Methods. CTLp and HTLp frequencies and MLC reactivity against donor and third-party spleen cells were determined in pre- and posttransplantation peripheral blood samples from 18 recipients with good graft function 2 years after transplantation. By mixing posttransplantation samples (with "putative" <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity)</b> with pretransplantation samples tin which normal CTL <b>activity</b> with no <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity</b> is expected), the presence of <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity</b> in peripheral blood was analyzed. Results. Two years after transplantation, all but one (94 %) of the recipients had developed CTLp hyporeactivity as evidenced by reduced donor-specific CTLp frequencies. The {{development of}} hyporeactivity was not specific for any particular underlying disease. The occurrence of HTL hyporeactivity, however, was less frequent: 38 % and 20 % of recipients were HTLp and MLC hyporeactive, respectively. Decreases in CTLp frequencies did not correlate with decreased donor-specific HTL function or <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity</b> in peripheral blood samples. Conclusions. Donor-specific CTLp hyporeactivity can develop in the majority of liver allograft recipients, irrespective of underlying disease. Donor-specific HTL hyporeactivity, however, occurs infrequently. A reduction in donor-specific CTLp frequencies was found to be independent of changes in donor-specific HTLp or <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity,</b> suggesting that other mechanisms (e. g., clonal deletion) are operative in the reduction of donor-specific CTLp after liver transplantation...|$|R
50|$|Ribosomes, the organelles that {{catalyze}} protein synthesis, {{consist of}} a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit.

This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is {{a component of the}} 40S subunit {{and a member of the}} S14P family of ribosomal proteins. The protein, which contains a C2-C2 zinc finger-like domain that can bind to zinc, can enhance the tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of Ras-related protein 1A (KREV1). It is located in the cytoplasm. Variable expression of this gene in colorectal cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues has been observed, although no correlation between the level of expression and the severity of the disease has been found.

The GTPase region has a high homology to mammalian and yeast (GAPs) which would suggest that neurofibromin plays a role in negative regulation of RAS signal transduction pathways. It is thought that editing therefore would result in the loss of the protein's tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity.</b> This corresponds to the observed increase in editing in tumors compared to normal tissue, however further research into the role of mRNA editing of NF1 mRNA in pathogenesis in tumours needs to be undertaken.

Recently further evidence of the role of editing in pathogenesis in tumors.It was observed that C to U editing of NF1 mRNA occurs in a fraction of tumor samples of NF1 patients where APOBEC-1 is also expressed. This was an important find as was the first time APOBEC-1 expression was proven experimentally outside the luminal cells of the tract. The N-terminus of the protein has a region demonstrated to be able to bind microtubules.

40|$|In {{studying}} T cell regulation, {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells from normal subjects were examined for 'spontaneous', rather than mitogen-induced, <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity.</b> Normal blood leucocytes from 30 subjects included a subpopulation of cells capable of suppressing {{the response of}} lymphocytes to the T cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin by 21 - 35 %. The indicator system for these studies consisted of fresh normal lymphocytes stimulated by three concentrations of PHA in {{the presence or absence of}} normal but mitomycin C treated peripheral blood lymphocytes. To measure accurately the spontaneous <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity,</b> additional cultures were needed to control for the suppressive effects of crowding and metabolic competition. Allogeneic, cryopreserved 'B' cell enriched populations, supplied satisfactory control cells for this purpose. While allogeneic culture systems could induce significant <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity</b> after 7 days of co-culture, they could not induce this activity in the 3 days required to assay spontaneous suppressor cell effects. In developing this assay we noted that (a) crowding became a factor in the cellular response to mitogens with concentrations higher than 2 X 10 (4) cells/well, (b) spontaneous <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity</b> decreased rapidly once cells were placed in culture and (c) both spontaneous and concanavalin A (Con A) activated suppressor cells could significantly reduce the response to PHA even when added to cultures established with mitogens 72 hr earlier.

40|$|Whereas {{three members}} of the ErbB family of {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ErbB 2, and ErbB 3) have been well characterized as oncogenes, the role of ErbB 4 in tumorigenesis has not yet been well defined. We hypothesize that ErbB 4 functions as a tumor suppressor. We have generated constitutively active ErbB 4 mutants to study the effects of ErbB 4 signaling in human prostate tumor cell lines. We found that the ErbB 4 Q 646 C mutant inhibits the colony formation on plastic of several prostate tumor cell lines. We showed that kinase activity is required for this tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity.</b> The ErbB 4 Q 646 C CT-b isoform fails to inhibit colony formation, indicating that tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> is isoform dependent. The putative ErbB 4 phosphorylation site at Tyr 1056 lies within the 16 amino acid region missing in the CT-b isoform, suggesting that this phosphorylation site might be critical for the tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of ErbB 4 Q 646 C. Indeed, substitution of a phenylalanine residue for Tyr 1056 abolishes the tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of ErbB 4 Q 646 C, whereas substitution of a phosphomimic glutamate residue for Tyr 1056 rescues the tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of the ErbB 4 Q 646 C mutant lacking tyrosine kinase activity. We have also developed and validated a modified EGFP tagged ErbB 4 Q 646 C mutant that we subsequently used to evaluate the subcellular localization of various mutants in prostate cancer cells. The V 673 I mutation, which is predicted to disrupt ErbB 4 cleavage and affects trafficking of the ErbB 4 cytoplasmic domain, disrupts tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of the ErbB 4 Q 646 C mutant. Likewise, mutations that abrogate ErbB 4 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Tyr 1056 also affect trafficking of the ErbB 4 cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, some mutations that disrupt an ErbB 4 LXXLL motif or an ErbB 4 BH 3 motif affect ErbB 4 Q 646 C tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity,</b> but not trafficking of the ErbB 4 cytoplasmic domain. Thus, ErbB 4 tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> appears to be dependent on proper trafficking of the ErbB 4 cytoplasmic domain and on interactions of the ErbB 4 LXXLL and BH 3 motifs with signaling effector proteins. ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the nature of an antigen-specific suppressor factor generated by antigen-stimulated herpes simplex virus (HSV) -immune splenocytes. Factor SF- 200, a 90, 000 - to 100, 000 -dalton fraction obtained after Sephacryl gel filtration, suppressed the generation of HSV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and lymphoproliferative responses. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis of SF- 200 indicated that it contained an I-J+, anti-idiotypic protein. It was possible to adsorb the <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of SF- 200 to an anti-I-J immunoaffinity column. The <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> could be eluted from the immunoaffinity column with a low-pH buffer. The acid-eluted material was determined to be both I-J+ and reactive with anti-HSV antiserum by Western blot analysis. Both SF- 200 and the I-J+ <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> suppressed only HSV-specific cell-mediated immunity responses. However, it was possible to generate nonspecific <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> by incubating the I-J+ suppressor factor with Lyt 1 + splenocytes from HSV-immune mice. The implication of these results with respect to the model for a suppressor cell circuit regulating HSV-specific cell-mediated immunity responses is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We found {{previously}} that immunosuppressive macrophages (MÏ†s) {{induced by}} Mycobacterium intracellulare infection (MI-MÏ†s) transmitted their suppressor signals to target T cells through cell contact with target T cells. In this study, we examined {{what kinds of}} MÏ† surface molecules are required for such cellâ€“toâ€“cell interaction. First, {{it was found that}} a B 7 - 1 -like molecule (B 7 â€“ 1 LM) recognizable with one of three test clones of anti-B 7 - 1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was required for expression of the MÏ† <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity.</b> Neither anti-B 7 - 2, anti-ICAM- 1, nor anti-VCAM- 1 mAb blocked the MÏ† <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity.</b> Second, MI-MÏ†s increased the expression of B 7 â€“ 1 LM in parallel with the acquisition of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity.</b> Moreover, MI-MÏ†s bound with target T cells in a B 7 â€“ 1 LM-dependent fashion. Third, mAb blocking of CTLA- 4 on target T cells did not reduce the <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of MI-MÏ†s, suggesting the role of a putative molecule on target T cells other than CTLA- 4 as the receptor for B 7 â€“ 1 LM of MI-MÏ†s. Fourth, concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation of MI-MÏ†s was needed for effective cell contact with target T cells and subsequent expression of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of MI-MÏ†s. Fifth, the Con A-induced increase in the <b>suppressor</b> <b>activity</b> of MI-MÏ†s was inhibited by KN- 62 but not by herbimycin A, H- 7, nor H- 88, indicating that Con A-induced up-regulation of MI-MÏ† function is mediated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or ATP/P 2 Z receptors, but independent of protein tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A. These findings indicate that a B 7 /CTLA- 4 -independent mechanism is needed for the transmission of the suppressor signals from MI-MÏ†s to target T cells...|$|E
40|$|T cell subsets bearing Fc-receptors {{for either}} IgG (TG) or IgM (TM), and <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity</b> of {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells on in vitro lymphoproliferative response were studied {{in patients with}} untreated psoriasis. The proportions of TG and TM cells were unmodified in 15 patients compared to 15 control subjects studied in parallel experiments. The concanavalin A-induced <b>suppressor</b> cell <b>activity,</b> as well as the spontaneous suppressor cell function of in vitro short-lived adherent cells, were in the normal range for 7 out of 8 psoriatic patients investigated. The data argue against the possibility that a generalized suppressor cell defect occurs in psoriasis...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{of samples}} from {{patients}} with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{have shown that}} ADAR1 is frequently upregulated and ADAR2 is frequently downregulated in the disease. It {{has been suggested that}} this is responsible for the disrupted A to I editing pattern seen in HCC and that ADAR1 acts as an oncogene in this context whilst ADAR2 has tumor <b>suppressor</b> <b>activities.</b> The imbalance of ADAR expression could change the frequency of A to I transitions in the protein coding region of genes, resulting in mutated proteins which drive the disease. The dysregulation of ADAR1 and ADAR2 {{could be used as a}} possible poor prognostic marker.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that after appropriate activation by antigen, T cells can specifically suppress an antibody response (reviewed in reference 1). The cellular {{basis of this}} is not understood. Possibly a single T-cell subclass can suppress or help, depending on the circumstances of immunization. Or exposure to antigen may generate <b>suppressor</b> and helper <b>activities</b> by different T-cell subclasses. This latter alternative {{is supported by the}} finding that help and suppression are properties of different T-cell subclasses belonging to T-cell populations activated polyclonally by concanavalin A (2). In this report we examine the question whether T cells mediating specific helper and <b>suppressor</b> <b>activities,</b> after immunization with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC), belong to different subclasses. Materials and Methods Animals. B 6 mice and Ly-congenic stock were obtained as described previously (2). Antisera.
