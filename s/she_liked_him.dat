500|$|Nina was in {{her first}} {{relationship}} with fellow student Taj Coppin (Jaime Robbie Reyne), when, during a trip away to the beach, Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan) realised he was attracted to her. When Nina was cast in Harold's play, Mission Erinsborough, alongside Jack, she realised that <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> too and they begin an affair. Peter Mattessi of The Age said their love [...] "bubbled until it almost erupted". Nina broke up with Taj so she could be with Jack, but before Jack could break up with his girlfriend Lori Lee (Michelle Ang), she was paralysed during an accident. Jack became torn over whether to leave Lori and be with Nina. Both Lori and Taj found out about Nina and Jack, so Nina decided to remain single, but eventually she and Jack began their relationship properly. When Nina told Jack {{that she was not}} ready to consummate their relationship, Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez (Lucia Smyrk). Taj told Nina about Jack's cheating and she broke up with him. She later kissed Connor in front of Jack to make him jealous. Jay Bunyan commented, [...] "Jack gets really angry, especially with Connor, who is supposed to be his mate. He threatens to tell Nina about Connor getting Lori pregnant, as a way of getting back at him." [...] Nina became confused about her love life and was unsure whether she still had feelings for Jack. She then decided to depart Erinsborough to go to India.|$|E
2500|$|In the Cold War, Thatcher {{supported}} Ronald Reagan's {{policies of}} Rollback {{with the goal}} of reducing or ending Soviet Communist power. [...] This contrasted with the policy of détente which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies still wedded to the idea of détente. US forces were permitted by Mrs. Thatcher to station nuclear cruise missiles at British bases, arousing mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, declaring <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> and [...] "We can do business together" [...] after a meeting three months before he came to power in 1985. This was a start in swinging the West back to a new détente with the Soviet Union in his era, as it proved to be an indication that the Soviet regime's power was decaying. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and voices who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and détente postures.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I copper your bet to lose." [...] He {{was almost}} gay, now, for success was coming faster than his fondest imagining. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> without a doubt; {{and without a}} doubt <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> well enough to let him hold her hand, well enough to be not {{repelled}} by the nearness of him.|$|E
50|$|Dugall Quin wooes Lisie Meanes, {{asking her}} how <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> in his ragged dress; she answers that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> and asks how he likes {{her in her}} fine clothing; he likes her and asks her to come with him. Her father asks her not to go. She defies him. Dugall tells her that if he comes with him, he will make her a lady. She goes, and he marries her.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, and {{abruptly}} <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> enormously. She {{felt this}} was the sensible {{way out of this}} oddly sinister situation.|$|E
60|$|Poor Lady Molinda {{could not}} but {{be hurt by}} the prince's {{preference}} for death over marriage to her, little as <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> all {{the better}} for that frank {{outburst}} of manlike ill-temper which, after all said and done, was only a very flattering form of masculine jealousy.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will have}} time, before she {{is free to}} find out whether <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> or not. There will be a great fuss in the family over the scandal." ...|$|R
5000|$|Risa starts {{developing}} {{feelings for}} Ōtani and soon admits to herself that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> then starts trying to confess. Failing the first time, Nobuko and Nakao {{try to help}} with Nobuko often giving Risa advice on what to do. Finally she very directly tells him. She immediately regrets it, and tells Ōtani to pretend it never happened, {{but in spite of}} herself she tells Ōtani once again that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him.</b> Ōtani responds that he cannot see her as a girlfriend yet, so her new goal is to make Ōtani regret that and make <b>him</b> <b>like</b> her as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! in {{choosing}} her mate! Some mincing artificer, I trow, fiddling away with wood and wire to make gauds for the fair-day! Hast got him here? If I <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him,</b> I'll {{bring her back}} when her work is done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is real devotion," [...] said Victoria. The {{more she}} saw of young Tom, the better <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> {{although}} his conversation was {{apt to be}} slightly embarrassing.|$|E
6000|$|She {{bent over}} the {{carriage}} languidly towards him. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "What, you, Clive?" [...] she said. [...] "How come you away from school of a Thursday, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sally did not {{press the}} point. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> {{the better for}} a rugged independence, which {{in the days of}} his impecuniousness her brother Fillmore had never dreamed of exhibiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame de Bernstein has her {{likes and}} dislikes, takes up people and forgets people; and {{she chooses to}} profess a mighty fancy for this young man. Because <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> to-day, is that any reason why <b>she</b> should <b>like</b> <b>him</b> to-morrow? Before company, and in your aunt's presence, your ladyship will please to be as civil to him as necessary; but, in private, I forbid you to see him or {{encourage}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Like him? Of course, <b>she</b> will <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Why should <b>she</b> not <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> Young, and good-looking, {{with a fine}} business, doesn't owe a sou, I'll be bound, {{and with}} a houseful of furniture. Of course, she'll <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I don't suppose {{there is so much}} {{difficulty}} about that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] said Susan. [...] "Why shouldn't <b>she</b> <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> He's {{just the}} sort of man to get on with a woman left, as she is, with no one to look after her." ...|$|R
60|$|Another splendid feast was prepared, {{and when}} the {{stranger}} had eaten and drunk {{as much as he}} was able, and had taken his departure, the king asked Cannetella how <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely," [...] said Flora. [...] "No {{one could}} look at her without seeing that <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> I had left her {{to be the only}} {{effective}} one at home, and she sacrificed herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Lane, {{will you}} dance with me?" [...] she asked, almost wistfully. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> {{and was not}} ashamed of it. But she seemed pondering over {{what to make of}} him--how far to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's the difficulty. <b>She</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> well enough; I'm sure of that. And {{she has no}} stuck-up {{ideas about}} herself. She isn't {{one of those who}} think that almost nothing is good enough for them. But--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She'll ken," [...] Blinder {{answered}} after {{thinking it}} over, [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> and fears him at one breath, {{and has a}} sort of secret dread that he's getting a power ower her that she canna resist." ...|$|R

6000|$|Though they quarrelled and {{disagreed}} on innumerable things, deep down, underlying all, {{there was}} a permanent unity. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for a certain stern soberness that was his, and for his saving grace of humor. Seriousness and banter were not incompatible. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for his gallantry, made {{to work with and}} not for display. She liked the spirit of his offer at Happy Camp, when he proposed giving her an Indian guide and passage-money back to the United States. He could do as well as talk. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for his outlook, for his innate liberality, which she felt to be there, somehow, no matter that often he was narrow of expression. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for his mind. Though somewhat academic, somewhat tainted with latter-day scholasticism, it was still a mind which permitted him to be classed with the [...] "Intellectuals." [...] He was capable of divorcing sentiment and emotion from reason. Granted that he included all the factors, he could not go wrong. And here was where she found chief fault with him,--his narrowness which precluded all the factors; his narrowness which gave the lie to the breadth she knew was really his. But she was aware that it was not an irremediable defect, and that the new life he was leading was very apt to rectify it. He was filled with culture; what he needed was a few more of life's facts.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him. He was very earnest, and earnestness was always rather ridiculous, commonplace, to her. It {{made her feel}} unfree and uncomfortable. Yet <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> so much. But why drag in the stars.|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} fingers {{for a moment}} without reply. Quite {{suddenly}} she decided that <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> Then he lifted Graham, who was half asleep, half unconscious, to his feet, and assisted him from the car.|$|E
50|$|The next day, Charlie Brown tells Peppermint Patty, that he {{is upset}} over Linus' moving away. She tells Marcie {{that they have to}} help him get over his sadness. Marcie asks her if <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>she</b> {{naturally}} denies it. She walks home trying to convince herself that <b>she</b> could not <b>like</b> a loser <b>like</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The girls often {{meet the}} boys from a nearby {{boarding}} school. One of them, Tommy, (Jackie Moran), has a crush on her, and <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> as well. At a church service, Gloria sings, [...] "Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)" [...] with a boy's choir.|$|R
5000|$|Swingley (voiced by Maria Bamford) - Swingley {{is a new}} kid in Dylan's class {{whom she}} has a crush on. In Season 2, <b>she</b> admits <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> only for Swingley to reveal that he is gay and already has a boyfriend.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for himself, {{which is}} quite {{different}} from liking the parts which went to compose him. For it is no miracle for two things, added together, to produce not only the sum of themselves, but a third thing which is not to be found in either of them. So with him. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for himself, for that something which refused to stand out as a part, or a sum of parts; for that something which is the corner-stone of Faith and which has ever baffled Philosophy and Science. And further, to like, with Frona Welse, did not mean to love.|$|E
60|$|Miss Fosbrook {{was glad}} {{to get away from}} the dining-room, where it was rather awful to sit without her work and be talked to by Mr. Merrifield, even though <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> much better than she had expected.|$|E
60|$|Ginger Kemp's face darkened. He frowned. Sally, {{watching}} him, {{felt that}} she had been right when she had guessed that he had a temper. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> none the worse for it. Mild men did not appeal to her.|$|E
50|$|Emmanuelle {{lives in}} Bangkok {{with her husband}} Jean, who is several years older. <b>She</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him</b> because he's taught her much sexually, and he <b>likes</b> her because <b>she</b> is very eager to learn. Although both have had extramarital affairs, they {{tolerate}} it as they are content with their arrangement.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, Lewandowski {{admitted}} to Rosell {{that he told}} the guy—a gym instructor at the gym where the couple goes—that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him.</b> According to Rosell, Malaya did not come clear about the reason of the breakup, but he deduced that she chose the other guy over him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yesterday morning?--O, I remember. You know I always tease {{her about}} Gilfil, who is over head and ears {{in love with}} her; and she is angry at that,--perhaps, because <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>him.</b> They were old playfellows years before I came here, and Sir Christopher has set his heart on their marrying.' ...|$|R
