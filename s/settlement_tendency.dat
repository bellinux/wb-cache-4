40|$|Though China has {{experienced}} multiple and severe disasters since ancient times, its approaches to addressing mass claims issues through mediation by courts and grassroots entities {{is undergoing a}} process of reform and change. The selection of recent disasters, whether natural or human-induced, include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic (‘the SARS Incident’), the earthquake that struck Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province in China in 2008 (‘the Wenchuan Earthquake’) and the Sanlu contaminated milk powder incident (‘the Sanlu Milk Contamination Incident’). The mass claims arising out of these disasters illustrate the continued preference for settling wide-scale claims outside of court. This <b>settlement</b> <b>tendency</b> alongside continued attention to strengthening {{the rule of law}} in China, naturally gives rise to questions regarding how such processes might simultaneously advance due process, transparency and avenues for appeal. Through examining China’s mediated response to disaster events experienced in recent years, this essay aims to provide a brief overview of China’s recent approaches to post-disaster governance, an evaluation of the country’s achievements to date, an analysis of challenges ahead and some suggestions for improving the existing approaches and mechanisms drawing on existing lessons learned [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Ethnicity is a sociological {{construct}} {{that has}} immense value if placed {{within the field}} of archaeology. By defining the Essenes as an ethnic group, two purposes are served: to provide further evidence that may link the Essenes to the Qumran community, and to display the usefulness of other, less acknowledged concepts for archaeology. In addition, this paper argues for a fluid definition of the Essenes as a solution to discrepancies between the Essenes found in classical literature and the archaeological remains of the Qumran <b>settlement.</b> The <b>tendency</b> to assign the Essenes by default to the Qumran community and whether there are sufficient grounds for this identification is also examined...|$|R
40|$|Transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve {{and related}} {{documents}} provide {{new insights into}} how macro-policy makers characterized the labor market. Over {{the period of the}} 1980 s and the 1990 s, the Federal Reserve seemingly overemphasized the significance of union settlements, characterizing them in wage-push terms out of proportion to declining union density. Fed policy makers expressed surprise that the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) dropped during this period and offered various ad hoc explanations to explain the drop. The underlying common element of these explanations is that they were based on a rhetorical bargaining framework, explicit or implicit, that workers bargain as active agents for wages. Along with ongoing direct discussion of union <b>settlements,</b> this <b>tendency</b> suggests a view of worker bargaining power that seems at variance with union decline and the reality of an increasingly nonunion labor market. While worker bargaining models can be reconciled in a formal sense with various theories of nonunion wage determination, the ability of such models to realistically explain the macro outcomes that puzzled and challenged policy makers can be questioned...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{represents}} one of the humankind's most socially devastating diseases. Despite a long history of medical research and the development of effective therapies, this disease remains a global health danger even in the 21 st century. Tuberculosis may cause death but infected people with effective immunity may remain healthy for years, suggesting long-term host-pathogen co-existence. Because of its antiquity, a supposed association with human <b>settlements</b> and the <b>tendency</b> to leave typical lesions on skeletal and mummified remains, tuberculosis has been the object of intensive multidisciplinary studies, including paleo-pathological research. During the past 10 years molecular paleo-pathology developed as a new scientific discipline allowing the study of ancient pathogens by direct detection of their DNA. In this work, we reviewed evidences for tuberculosis in ancient human remains, current methods for identifying ancient mycobacterial DNA and explored current theories of Mycobacterium tuberculosis evolution and their implications in the global development of tuberculosis looking into the past and present at the same time...|$|R
40|$|Ranging {{behaviour}} {{and sleeping}} site selection are important primate behavioural traits likely to vary under environmental changes. We tested {{the role of}} ecological (predation avoidance) and anthropic (human proximity) factors in Macaca fascicularis range use, an edge species known to prefer living along forests borders and {{in the vicinity of}} human settlements. Data result from 56 day follows of one group of Macaca fascicularis exploiting a human-modified landscape within Bali Barat National Park (Indonesia). Observations allowed identifying and describing 17 sleeping sites and the characteristics of 37 sleeping trees. Despite a large forest area available, the group’s home range centred around human settlements. The home range size, average daily range and daily travel decreased over the study period, while the human presence inside the park increased over the corresponding months. The proximity with humans also influenced the pattern of sleeping sites use; macaques slept more than expected close to human <b>settlements</b> and this <b>tendency</b> increased over the study period. In contradiction with the predation avoidance assumption, macaques did not choose sleeping trees significantly taller and larger than other trees available. We conclude that the observed sleeping site strategy (sleeping near humans) could be advantageous in terms of predator avoidance and proximity with human food, but additional influences should not be neglected...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Nereocystis luetkeana forms {{extensive}} kelp beds in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Salinity and turbidity gradients apparently regulate kelp {{bed distribution}} throughout this estuary. The beds are large {{at the entrance}} of the bay, only solitary stands occur in the inner bay, and no kelp is found {{at the head of the}} bay. The role of salinity and turbidity on Nereocystis sporophyte growth was investigated by performing reciprocal transplants among three beds along the bay axis and regularly measuring stipe growth. The effects of salinity and light on spores were studied in the laboratory by recording sinking <b>tendency,</b> <b>settlement</b> success, germination success, and germ tube length under different salinity and light levels. Grazing effects of Lacuna vincta impacted the survival of Nereocystis transplants in-situ and on plants of different age classes in the laboratory. Overall, this study suggests a possible negative estuarine effect on sporophytes transplanted from the outer to the inner bay and on certain aspects of spore development. Herbivory pressure had significant localized effects on Nereocystis survival and was most pronounced on juvenile plants. The dynamics of Nereocystis kelp beds in Kachemak Bay results from large-scale environmental factors and local-scale biological processes...|$|R
40|$|The park of the Madonie is {{an ideal}} place to reflect on {{contemporary}} forms of <b>settlement.</b> The Italian <b>tendency</b> to associate the protection of its cultural heritage with {{a return to the}} past is accompanied by the widespread belief that the past is the Paradise Lost, and that consequently, the identity of a place - along with that of its inhabitants - is to be found solely in its ancient history. In the case of the Madonie, its ‘glorious’ time goes back to a period when it was predominantly populated by sedentary shepherds and farmers. Today, however, we no longer think of an anthropized environment as being stable or immutable. Instead, we view it as the outcome of transcultural experiences that are shaped by successive layers and continuous displacements. This is the most interesting aspect of the relationship between global and local cultures, experimenting with unusual lifestyles, and making comparisons between varied behavioural models. Unlike the Madonie, Brunello Cucinelli’s “cashmere factory”, in the medieval town of Solomeo, Umbria, is a successful example of a fruitful synergy between the protection of cultural heritage and innovative models of life and production. Not only has Brunello Cucinelli transformed Solomeo into his company headquarters, he has also turned it into a place where it is possible to find a high quality of life...|$|R
