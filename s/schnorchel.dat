5|$|Kuhnke assumed {{command of}} the 33rd U-boat Flotilla upon {{arriving}} at Flensburg. He relinquished command of U-853 back to Frömsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure U-853 was fitted with a <b>Schnorchel,</b> a retractable air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The <b>Schnorchel</b> reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1942 U-255 sailed from Bergen, {{arriving}} back at Kiel on 3 October. There the submarine was {{fitted with a}} <b>Schnorchel</b> underwater-breathing apparatus before sailing again on 7 January 1943, and arriving at Hammerfest in northern Norway on the 18th.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 and 1945, U-boats {{became less}} and less effective. They {{remained}} at sea to tie down as much Allied air and sea forces as possible, to relieve pressure on the other two services (Heer and Luftwaffe). When the Allies launched Operation Overlord in June 1944, U-boats attempted to interdict shipping, but lost 24 of their number from 6—30 June. A further 12 submarines from Norway joined 35 from French ports for operations, only to suffer 50 attacks on the first day. Six returned due to damage. On 25 August 1944, owing to the Allied advance toward U-boat ports, all submarines were ordered to Norway. This evacuation from France was complete by 30 September. Between 6 June and 31 August 20 out of 30 <b>Schnorchel</b> boats were lost. For Coastal Command, the end of 1944 witnessed the interception of 47 percent of all sighted U-boats, {{which resulted in a}} 20 percent of those attacked being sunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the <b>Schnorchel,</b> a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E

25|$|Early on, the Germans {{experimented with}} the idea of the <b>Schnorchel</b> (snorkel) from {{captured}} Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The <b>Schnorchel</b> was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today. Speed was limited to , lest the device snap from stress. The <b>Schnorchel</b> also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the <b>Schnorchel</b> mast could be detected beyond visual range.|$|E
25|$|U-539 {{departed}} Lorient on 2 January 1944, as {{the first}} U-boat to sail on combat patrol equipped with the <b>Schnorchel</b> breathing device. She sailed across the Atlantic to the waters south of Newfoundland, but had no successes. She returned to Saint-Nazaire on 21 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} reassigned to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for combat duties in the Atlantic on 1 January 1944, departing Kiel on 22 January 1944, with a three-day {{stopover}} at Marvika in Norway. After forming {{up with the}} Gruppe Igel 1 (Group Hedgehog) north-west of Scotland on 3 February 1944, U-546 commenced a patrol in the North Atlantic with other boats {{to the west of}} Ireland on anti-convoy duties. At 1229 on 16 February U-546 reported she had been attacked by a British Sunderland flying boat from No. 201 Squadron RAF, killing one crewman. On 20 February 1944 she was again attacked by an aircraft. On 17 April while returning to base in France, the U-boat was caught on the surface by a Leigh light -equipped Liberator of 53 Squadron in the Bay of Biscay, steaming south-east, ahead of convoy HX-278 and was attacked with depth charges, but shooting down the attacker with the 3.7cm gun. She returned to Lorient for service and refit on 23 or 25 April 1944. The crew was given leave while the boat was overhauled and the <b>Schnorchel</b> was fitted.|$|E
500|$|On 23 February 1945 Germany sent U-853 on {{her third}} war patrol to harass US coastal shipping. Under {{the command of}} Oberleutnant zur See Helmut Frömsdorf, U-853 did not sink any targets during the first weeks of her patrol. Her {{crossing}} of the Atlantic was slow because she used her <b>Schnorchel</b> to remain submerged to avoid being spotted by Allied aircraft. [...] On 1 April 1945 U-853 was ordered to the Gulf of Maine.|$|E
2500|$|U-1278 left on her first, and only, war patrol on 11 February 1945.

She was sunk on 17 February 1945, by depth charges, killing all 48 of her crew.|$|E

Thirty days into her patrol she was spotted and attacked by the British frigates , , the British sloop [...] and a US Liberator aircraft from VPB-112 in the English Channel east of the Scilly Isles. She was sunk on 27 February 1945, by depth charges, killing all 48 of her crew.|$|E
2500|$|U-873 was {{commissioned}} [...] on 1 March 1944 {{under the command}} of Kapitänleutnant Friedrich Steinhoff and assigned to the 4th U-boat Flotilla for training in the Baltic Sea from the base in Stettin. The crew of the new submarine was assembled around a nucleus of Engineering Officer Helmut Jürgens, Quartermaster Albert Finister, and ten other survivors from , which had been sunk off the coast of Brazil on 11 August 1943. On 29 July 1944 a small aerial bomb struck the control room of U-873 during a bombing raid on Bremen which injured four of the crew. Crewman Fritz Grusa died of his injuries. U-873 completed repairs in November. A Deschimag Type I <b>schnorchel</b> was fitted in December.|$|E
2500|$|During 1943, {{the war in}} the Atlantic {{turned against}} the Germans, but Dönitz {{continued}} to push for increased U-boat construction and entertained the notion that further technological developments would tip the war once more in Germany's favour, briefing the Führer to that effect. At the end of the war, the German submarine fleet was by far the most advanced in the world, and late-war examples such as the Type XXI U-boat served as models for Soviet and American construction after the war. The <b>Schnorchel</b> (snorkel) and Type XXI boats appeared late in the war because of Dönitz's personal indifference, at times even hostility, to new technology he perceived as disruptive to the production process. His opposition to the larger Type IX was not unique; Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines at the outbreak of the Pacific War, opposed fleet boats like the Gato and Balao classes as [...] "too luxurious".|$|E
50|$|U-58, {{along with}} , were both used for testing a new {{flooding}} valve <b>schnorchel</b> head during August 1943, that Deutsche Werke had constructed in June. For the test the <b>schnorchel</b> replaced the aft periscope. The initial trial was successful and a collapsible <b>schnorchel</b> {{forward of the}} bridge was envisaged for Type VIIC boats.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason the}} boat had been {{recalled}} (Werner had initially {{thought it was}} for the fitting of a <b>schnorchel),</b> became clear when he and his flotilla commander discussed the invasion threat. While U-415 underwent re-fit, Werner tried Lorient, St Nazaire and even a freight yard in Paris in his quest for a <b>schnorchel,</b> all with no success.|$|E
5000|$|U-1308 was {{the last}} Type VIIC/41 to be built {{and would have been}} fitted with a <b>schnorchel,</b> (This {{apparatus}} enhanced the U-boats' performance below the surface and made its position more difficult to detect).
