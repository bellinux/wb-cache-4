500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade</b> more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..."

500|$|On April 15, 1923, at New York City's Rivoli Theater, {{came the}} first {{commercial}} screening of motion pictures with sound-on-film, the future standard: a set of shorts {{under the banner of}} De Forest Phonofilms, accompanying a silent feature. That June, De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee, Freeman Harrison Owens, for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents. Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts, Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field. The following year, De Forest's studio released {{the first commercial}} dramatic film shot as a talking picture—the two-reeler Love's Old Sweet Song, directed by J. Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel. However, phonofilm's <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade</b> was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries, popular music acts, and comedy performances. President Calvin Coolidge, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker, Ben Bernie, Eddie Cantor and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm's pictures. Hollywood remained suspicious, even fearful, of the new technology. As Photoplay editor James Quirk put it in March 1924, [...] "Talking pictures are perfected, says Dr. Lee De Forest. So is castor oil." [...] De Forest's process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions, a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures, which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets. By the end of 1930, the Phonofilm business would be liquidated.|$|E

40|$|Why do {{large firms}} in Japan hold small {{percentages}} of <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> <b>trading</b> partners? A firm that holds <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> a <b>trading</b> partner weakens its own bargaining position, for {{a portion of}} its own gain from trade then includes a share interest in the partner's gain from trade. But precisely for this reason the firm can at any time penalize the trading partner by divesting its share interest. Cross-shareholding therefore strengthens the penalties for opportunism and this may be its purpose. Opportunism here means substituting products of lower quality than claimed or misrepresenting investments that lower the other party's costs. Econometric analysis of the pattern of cross-shareholding within Japan's keiretsu groups in 1980 reveals evidence that is consistent with this argument. (J. E.

50|$|Day trading {{refers to}} buying and then selling or selling short and then buying back the same {{security}} on the same day.

If you buy <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> one <b>trade</b> and sell the position <b>in</b> three <b>trades,</b> that is generally considered as one day trade if all trades are done on the same day. Three more day <b>trades</b> <b>in</b> the next four business days will subject your account to restrictions (you can only close existing positions or purchase with available cash up front) for 90 days, or until you deposit $25,000 into your account, whichever comes first.
