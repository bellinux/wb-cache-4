5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in <b>size</b> <b>in</b> the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

5|$|With Craig Kundrot, Richards {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on protein structure, using hen-egg lysozyme crystals, finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body <b>size</b> <b>in</b> males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|A massive {{influx of}} Palestinian {{refugees}} swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population {{had grown to}} about six times its 1948 <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 515,556 in 2012, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City {{has one of the}} highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km² (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km² – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km² – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in <b>size</b> <b>in</b> 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows a contrast to that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E
5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore <b>size.</b> <b>In</b> oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
