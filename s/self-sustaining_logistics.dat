40|$|What is {{the fully}} {{burdened}} cost of supply to combatant ships in remote locations? Currently, there are directives that require {{an estimate of}} the fully burdened cost of energy in a number of analyses in acquisition, but the approved method(s) for estimating this cost are still being developed. Several analyses fail to account for the indirect costs associated with supplying logistics assets. Therefore, we propose a method for estimating the fully burdened cost of supply in a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>logistics</b> network in which local infrastructure cannot be counted on to supply logistics assets. This thesis develops this method for the US Navy by building a model of Navy supply transport and using it to estimate the Total Resource Requirement of supply at various points in the network, and explore how that cost changes {{as a function of the}} force protection required for the logistics vessels.
