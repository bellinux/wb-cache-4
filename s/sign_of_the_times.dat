25|$|Mirko Reisser also {{acted as}} the artistic {{director}} for <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> The work also got an {{entry into the}} Guinness {{book of world records}} for the highest graffiti of the world. Together with Darco, Loomit and others and under the organisational lead of Lothar Knode the graffiti with an overall wall-space of 300 m² was realised at a skyscraper in Hamburg-Lohbrügge in December 1995. The artists for the 30-meter high and 11-meter wide artwork used 1000 spray cans. Besides his height the work also impressed with its exciting composition of script and picture elements as well as citations from masterpieces of painting.|$|E
25|$|Scott had longed {{opposed the}} {{prohibition}} of alcohol, but the war made it all but impossible to resist the pressure of temperance advocates. In a March 1915 speech in Oxbow, Scott announced that all drinking establishments in Saskatchewan would be closed as of July 1, {{to be replaced by}} provincially run liquor stores. This move would prove inadequate in the following months, as both Alberta and Manitoba enacted Prohibition. Sensing the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> Scott held a provincial referendum on the topic – the first time women had been allowed to vote in Saskatchewan – and in December 1916, 80% of Saskatchewan voters voted to ban alcohol in the province.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the bounds}} of this fairly {{comfortable}} provision, monastic discipline was apparently quite good. In 1323-4 Bishop Roger Northburgh, recently appointed and at war {{with much of the}} ecclesiastical establishment in his diocese, instigated a series of canonical visitations that took in all of the abbeys and smaller houses around Shrewsbury. While criticisms were, in many cases, severe, Shrewsbury's shortcomings were fairly minor or very general: too many monks were missing meals in the refectory, novices were allowed out before they had properly learnt the Rule, and the accounts of the obedientiaries, the abbot's under-managers, were inadequate – this last a complaint made of nearly all religious houses in the diocese. Thirty years later, {{in the wake of the}} Black Death, Northburgh found buildings on many manors were in poor repair, but this was a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> not the fault of the monks.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, the IWW in Canada {{supported}} the Spanish Revolution {{and began to}} recruit for the militia of the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), in direct conflict with Communist Party recruiters for the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, a conflict {{which resulted in a}} number of violent clashes at recruitment rallies in Northern Ontario. Several Canadian IWW members were killed in the Spanish Civil War and the CNT's ensuing defeat at the hands of both Fascist and Stalinist forces. By the middle of the Second World War, IWW membership had dropped to 500, but had rebounded to 2000 by 1946. After this, the IWW entered a long period of decline, with the Canadian Administration slowly shrinking back to its traditional strongholds in Port Arthur and Vancouver, and becoming more of a social club and mutual aid society of mostly Finnish members in Port Arthur and the co-operative businesses they controlled. An Education Workers Industrial Union branch was established at the University of Waterloo in 1968, but failed to achieve success and dissolved. As well, in 1970 La Presse Populaire du Montréal, an IWW-run print shop, was shut down under the War Measures Act due to its support for the FLQ during the October Crisis. As a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> the old Canadian Administration in Port Arthur was dissolved in 1973 and replaced by a Canadian Regional Organizing Committee, meaning that Canadian branches would be administrated by the General Administration in the United States. IWW activity in Canada began to shift largely toward strike support and labour activism, such as support for the Artistic Woodwork strike in Toronto in 1974. By the 80s, the Vancouver branch was supporting unemployed activism through the Vancouver Unemployed Action Centre by helping to shut down the scam operation Vancouver Job Mart and supporting the campaign for a fixed-income transit pass.|$|E

500|$|Influenced by his {{honeymoon in}} the Caribbean, Jarrell became {{interested}} in the effects of man-made and natural sunlight on the environment. Experimentation with pigments, media, imagery and design allowed him to create artworks that fully expressed his intended messages. Referring to works such as Nassau (1968) and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> (1966), Jarrell commented: [...] "The colors of the Bahamas influenced my use of color and my approach to my work." [...] With <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> he shows a street scene, his first attempt at a painting involving social interaction. In 1968, Jarrell became art director at Sander Line Graphics, only to quit shortly thereafter to become self-employed. Aside from creating his art he also started a successful mail-order photo processing business. Soon after Jarrell and Jae decided to open a gallery space below their studio: WJ Studio and Gallery. While the studio and gallery flourished, Jarrell taught part-time art classes at Wadsworth Elementary School and considered moving to New York, seeking refuge {{in the heart of the}} art world.|$|E

Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list.

2500|$|Despite {{the popular}} enthusiasm that greeted the February Revolution, Franco's {{government}} lacked a clear program. In a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> Franco practiced his Mussolini-style spellbinding oratory from a balcony. But when he published his distinctly fascist-sounding Decree Law No. 152 promising a [...] "totalitarian transformation" [...] {{similar to those}} in Europe, protests erupted. The youthful, idealistic elements that had come together to produce the Febrerista movement were actually a hodgepodge of conflicting political tendencies and social opposites, and Franco was soon in deep political trouble. Franco's cabinet reflected almost every conceivable shade of dissident political opinion, and included socialists, fascist sympathizers, nationalists, Colorados, and Liberal cívicos.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} week of December 2012, the final printed issue of Newsweek (under its then owners) was {{published}} with a 31 Dec date. A cover headline reflected its plans for an all-digital future, {{in the form of a}} Twitter hashtag: [...] "#LastPrintIssue." [...] An editorial column by Brown and several articles in the issue reflected on the magazine's history of reportage, with a special emphasis on the two years between Harman's takeover and the end of the print magazine, which featured extensive coverage of a number of major world events, including the Arab Spring, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the US presidential election of 2012. This dramatic abandonment of print was a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> and short lived: the print edition returned with the sale of the magazine after Tina Brown's departure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman {{wrote of the}} subject matter of [...] "See Yourself" [...] and other songs on Thirty Three & 1/3: [...] "This isn't a very 'immediate' record ... But as proved by All Things Must Pass, Harrison's {{material}} is deep and requires the listener to persevere. Two or three spins bring out a musical and lyrical warmth from an artist who refuses to stand still." [...] In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner described the [...] "tastefulness" [...] of Harrison's performance on synthesizer as [...] "unmatched in rock". Referring to Harrison's gift to Kissinger in November 1976, in relation to the era when the song was written, Schaffner added: [...] "Another <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> perhaps. Back in 1964 even the thought of such a meeting would have been preposterous; in 1967 it would have seemed the pinnacle of the surreal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cartoons {{and short}} {{subjects}} were a major <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> as Warner Brothers Studios and Disney Studios gave unprecedented {{aid to the}} war effort by creating cartoons that were both patriotic and humorous, and also contributed to remind movie-goers of wartime activities such as rationing and scrap drives, war bond purchases, and the creation of victory gardens. Warner shorts such as Daffy - The Commando, Draftee Daffy, Herr Meets Hare, and Russian Rhapsody are particularly remembered for their biting wit and unflinching mockery of the enemy (particularly Adolf Hitler, Hideki Tōjō, and Hermann Göring). Their cartoons of Private Snafu, produced for the military as [...] "training films", served to remind many military men of the importance of following proper procedure during wartime, for their own safety. Hanna Barbara also contributed {{to the war effort}} with slyly pro US short cartoon The Yankee Doodle Mouse with [...] "Lt." [...] Jerry Mouse as the hero and Tom Cat as the [...] "enemy".|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Paul VI {{decided on}} the {{creation}} of a joint working group with the World Council of Churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation. In the following three years, eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals. It was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and Third World Issues such as hunger and poverty. On the religious side, it was agreed to share together in the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, to be held every year. The joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all Christians. [...] On 19 July 1968, the meeting of the World Council of Churches took place in Uppsala, Sweden, which Pope Paul called a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> He sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner: [...] "May the Lord bless everything you do for the case of Christian Unity."
