50|$|Scyllaea pelagica {{is nearly}} always a pelagic species but is {{occasionally}} found on brown seaweed {{anchored to the}} seabed. It spends its life among <b>sargasso</b> <b>weed</b> (Sargassum spp.) floating in tropical seas where it is well camouflaged. It feeds by grazing on the hydroids that grow on the weed and if it gets detached from the fronds can swim to a limited extent by flexing its body.|$|E
50|$|Fishing {{charters}} {{most often}} look for floating debris and frigatebirds {{near the edge}} of the reef in about 120 ft of water. Mahi-mahi (and many other fish) often swim near debris such as floating wood, five gallon bucket lids, palm trees and fronds, or <b>sargasso</b> <b>weed</b> lines and around fish buoys. Frigatebirds dive for food accompanying the debris or sargasso. Experienced fishing guides can tell what species are likely around the debris by the birds' behavior.|$|E
5000|$|A typical fishing {{technique}} {{is to take}} a sport fishing boat {{to the edge of a}} reef in about 120 ft of water and troll near a line of floating <b>sargasso</b> <b>weed</b> [...] Mahi-mahi often congregate around marine debris such as floating boards, palm trees and fronds, often found in association with such weed lines. Sargasso sometimes holds a complete ecosystem from microscopic creatures to seahorses, small crabs, juvenile triggerfish and other bait fish. Frigate birds dive for the food accompanying the debris or sargasso. Other fish may be present in the area. Experienced fishermen can tell what species are likely around the debris by the birds' behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|The protagonist, Roger Stetworth, unwillingly joins a slave ship {{called the}} Golden Hind captained by Luke Chilton. (When Chilton demanded that Roger [...] "sign aboard" [...] he refused and was clubbed {{on the head}} and thrown overboard.) He is rescued by the Hurst Castle and doctored by a painfully stereotyped Irishman. The Hurst Castle is {{abandoned}} but does not founder in a gale and the crew, unable to get to him, are forced to leave Stetworth marooned aboard. The ship drifts {{into the center of the}} Sargasso Sea where Stetworth finds himself in a ships' graveyard in which survivors of previous shipwrecks still inhabit the forgotten ships. Stetworth must rely on his own ingenuity to get free from the choking <b>sargasso</b> <b>weeds.</b>|$|R
40|$|Significance of {{fish for}} food webs in the Wadden sea Moritz Pockberger, Florian Kellnreitner, Harald Asmus The Wadden Sea, an UNESCO world {{heritage}} site since 2009, is widely known as a nursery ground for commercially important fish of the North Sea, and also provides a habitat for small-sized fish species. Recently the fish fauna of the North Sea shows profound alterations respecting species compositon, standing stocks and migration behavior. Therefore, {{in the frame of}} long term observations of biological parameters in the Sylt-Rømø Bight (=SRB), a fish survey was conducted since 2007, to document possible changes of species composition and stock size, considering the rise of temperature on a local scale. Sampling takes place monthly on seven locations inside SRB using a bottom trawl, which is designed to be deployed also as flyde trawl for pelagic fishing. On every location a benthic and on deeper sites additionally a pelagic haul is performed. To achieve a clear picture of trophic positions and interactions between fish species inside the SRB gut content analysis and feeding experiments are carried out. Most of the long term data will be used to portray a food web for the total SRB {{as well as for the}} particular habitats of this area. This food web will reflect certain scenarios of environmental conditions and biological status to give a holistic view of the current as well as the expected changes. Until now, fish species are underrepresented in this food web and due to the lack of basic data only eight fish species could be included. Increasing temperatures in summer may lead to immigration of lusitanian species, such as the sand smelt (Atherina presbyter), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) into the Wadden Sea. Additionally a higher proportion of thermophile species is expected to visit the Wadden Sea, whereas boreal species may move to more northern regions. During a warm summer period in 2003 a high immigration of small thermophile fish, such as sand smelt and anchovy and emigration of indigenous fish was observed in the SRB. Considering the above described changes and varying residence times during seasons, shifts in the food web can be expected. In winter, higher temperatures may delay the migration of fish species into depths that have more stable environmental conditions. Several findings indicate ongoing changes in the SRB, e. g. sand smelt was found rarely, but is now found regularly in summer during sampling and it is assumed that reproduction takes place inside the SRB. In autumn, hatchlings of grey mullets (Chelon labrosus) were caught both in beach seine and bottom trawl. This species was only recorded as a summer guest before. Furthermore, catches of black goby (Gobius niger), may be an example for ongoing faunal changes occurring in the area. To identify potential seasonal differences in species abundance and the role of southern species in the Wadden sea food web, an analysis of guild structures was conducted. Another subject of investigation will be the impact of new established habitats, like reefs of the Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Japanese <b>Sargasso</b> <b>weed</b> (Sargassum muticum) on fishes. These two species occur densely in high numbers and are able to change abiotic factors. Identification of feeding relationships and of key prey species provide important information for coastal area management and may help to explain structural variations of fish community in an area that is subject to constant change. ...|$|E
