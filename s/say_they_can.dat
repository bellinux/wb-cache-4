500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E
2500|$|John Berman for ABC News {{reported}} in 2006 that [...] "Grown Iraqi men get misty-eyed by {{the mere mention}} of his name. 'I love Lionel Richie,' they <b>say.</b> <b>They</b> <b>can</b> sing an entire Lionel Richie song." [...] Berman wrote that Richie said he was told that Iraqi civilians were playing [...] "All Night Long" [...] the night U.S. tanks invaded Baghdad. Richie was against the war, but says he could see a day when he would come and perform in Baghdad.|$|E
60|$|L. I can't help that. If they {{understand}} by dressing, buying dresses, perhaps they also understand by drawing, buying pictures. But when I hear them <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> draw, I {{understand that they}} can make a drawing; and when I hear them <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> dress, I understand {{that they can make}} a dress and--which is quite as difficult--wear one.|$|E
60|$|TIMOTHY. They're <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{go down to}} the shipyards, where they'd {{be getting}} five dollars and thirty cents a day.|$|R
30|$|G is <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be trusted}} {{to work out the}} details {{essentially}} and then I didn’t. I really tried to. I thought no I’m going to labor the point.|$|R
5000|$|The {{peace of}} Quahog is {{disrupted}} when the leaves start turning fall colors and [...] "leafers" [...] from New York invade town. When the family drives to church, the kids start arguing. Stewie tries to control them, but Lois {{tells them to}} stop, or else they wouldn't {{get to go to}} McDonald's after church. Peter <b>says</b> that <b>they</b> would still {{be able to go to}} McDonald's, but wouldn't be able to get the supersize. When Chris objects Peter <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get the supersize but no apple pie. When Meg objects Peter <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get an apple pie but can't blow on it to cool it down. Lois asks Peter not to contradict her in front of the kids.|$|R
60|$|ROBERTS. Ah! So they <b>say!</b> <b>They</b> <b>can</b> {{remember}} the women when their own bellies speak! The women never {{stop them from}} the drink; but from a little suffering to themselves in a sacred cause, the women stop them fast enough.|$|E
60|$|MORRIS. And you {{reckoned}} I shouldn't know. [Laughs {{with a high}} crowing laugh.] That's how the derned dirty Spiritualists do {{all their}} tricks. They <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> make the furniture move of itself. If it does move they move it; and we mean to know how.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{you want}} is to use me, to enjoy me and turn me out when {{you get tired of}} me--the way you've done with other women. It's just the same with these mill hands, they're not human beings to you, they're--they're cattle. If they don't do as you like, you turn them out; you <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> starve for all you care." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{making a}} touch, the {{defending}} team must retreat the distance the referee marks, {{at least five}} metres from the mark where the touch occurred and stay there until the Half touches the ball, or until the referee <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> 'play on'.|$|R
50|$|Hiyama {{developed}} this reaction in 1988. He says he {{developed this}} method {{in order to}} overcome the shortcomings of Grignard reagents. While Grignard reagents are powerful, Hiyama <b>says,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be hard to use in total synthesis as {{they are not as}} tolerant of other functional groups.|$|R
50|$|In the present, Zoom is {{imprisoned in}} the Iron Heights. Hunter Zolomon speaks to him, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{help each other}} be better. In Gorilla City, one of the apes warns that Professor Zoom has done {{something}} horrible to their jungles, something even they do not know.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Mademoiselle!’ said I, {{and indeed}} {{my voice was}} scarce under command, ‘if you knew how your generous words—how even the sight of you—relieved the horrors of this place, I believe, I hope, I know, you would be glad. I will come here daily and look at that dear chimney and these green hills, and bless you from the heart, and {{dedicate}} to you the prayers of this poor sinner. Ah! I do not <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> avail!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Captain Bayley said, [...] "we {{will travel}} together, my dear sir; for {{of course we}} shall go {{straight}} back to England now. We have been dawdling about in this wretched country long enough. Besides, {{everything has to be}} arranged, and we have got {{to get to the bottom}} of this matter; so if you have no objection, we will travel home together. If the young people here want to dawdle about any longer they can do so; I dare <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> look after themselves, or if not, I can make an arrangement with some old lady or other to act as Alice's chaperon." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{are many}} Christies, willing to work, yet unable {{to bear the}} contact with coarser natures which makes labor seem degrading, or to endure the hard {{struggle}} for the bare necessities of life when life has lost all that makes it beautiful. People wonder when such as she <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find little to do; but to those who know nothing of the pangs of pride, the sacrifices of feeling, the martyrdoms of youth, love, hope, and ambition that go on under the faded cloaks of these poor gentle-women, who tell them to go into factories, or scrub in kitchens, for there is work enough for all, the most convincing answer would be, [...] "Try it." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the group}} resumes {{work on the}} raft, Walt notices a column of black smoke in the distance. The {{survivors}} then tell Rousseau about the hatch, and their need to open it. Rousseau offers {{to take them to}} the [...] "Black Rock", where she <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find dynamite.|$|R
50|$|Sheldon meets up with Penny to go jogging and she {{attempts}} {{to get him to}} warm up. After he fails to touch his toes, she <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> warm up on the run. Sheldon jogs down the stairs and falls; when Penny tries to help him up, he farts again.|$|R
50|$|Celia and David, however, have {{a secret}} of their own: years ago, Harold killed their daughter, {{and they have been}} {{tracking}} him down ever since. They lure him into a trap and exact their revenge. David <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> torture him 10 to 14 more days, and Harold's frightened reaction appears behind the end credits.|$|R
6000|$|... "Umph! no, no; that I {{would not}} do, if I could help it. But they <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> whiles get folk cannily {{away to the}} {{plantations}} {{from some of the}} outports, and something to boot for them that brings a bonny wench. They're wanted beyond seas thae female cattle, and they're no that scarce here. But I think o' doing better for this lassie. There's a leddy, that, unless she be a' the better bairn, is to be sent to foreign parts whether she will or no; now, I think of sending Grace to wait on her--she's a bonny lassie. Hobbie will hae a merry morning when he comes hame, and misses baith bride and gear." ...|$|E
60|$|If, in {{conjunction}} with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you could send a force from your right {{to cut off the}} enemy's supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000 men; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not do this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy bridges? McDowell and Shields both <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and positively will, move Monday morning. I wish you to move cautiously and safely.|$|E
6000|$|... “As to any papers {{left behind}} him, I dare <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be but few; [...] for this reason, he never wrote out of vanity, or thought much of [...] the applause of men. I know an {{instance}} {{when he did}} his utmost to [...] conceal his own merit that way; and if we join to this his natural [...] love of ease, I fancy we must expect little of this sort: at least, [...] I have heard of none, except some few further remarks on Waller [...] (which his cautious integrity made him leave an order {{to be given to}} [...] Mr. Tonson), and perhaps, though it is many years since I saw it, a [...] translation of the first book of Oppian. He had begun a tragedy of [...] Dion, but made small progress in it.|$|E
5000|$|Gomez {{said that}} Wall once {{told him that}} most {{appearing}} before the legislature regarding retirement benefits [...] "consider themselves experts on retirement. They're not. They're just hired guns trying to milk the system. Some of them are actuaries, [...] [...] [...] [...] <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> predict the future. They can't. They lie[...] [...] [...] [...] " ...|$|R
40|$|This week’s {{interview}} is with Charles Hurburgh, Iowa State University professor {{of agriculture and}} biosystems engineering. He talks {{about the issues that}} farmers face this harvest season. He <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> expect a huge corn and soybean harvest, but some parts of the state may face quality issues. In general, producers will be dealing with high moisture corn at harvest and some corn won’t make maturity...|$|R
5000|$|The men's wives, having learnt of the deception, {{arrive at}} the Bangkok hotel where the group are staying. Pervez tries to commit suicide by jumping off the hotel but is saved when he lands in a {{swimming}} pool. Sherry tells the wives that the trip was the men's idea and not his. The wives demand divorces from their husbands, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> no longer trust them.|$|R
60|$|The Parisian travels but little, {{he knows}} no {{language}} but his own, reads no literature but his own, and consequently he is pretty narrow and pretty self-sufficient. However, {{let us not}} be too sweeping; there are Frenchmen who know languages not their own: these are the waiters. Among the rest, they know English; that is, they know it on the European plan--which is to <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> speak it, but can't understand it. They easily make themselves understood, but it is next to impossible to word an English sentence {{in such a way}} as to enable them to comprehend it. They think they comprehend it; they pretend they do; but they don't. Here is a conversation which I had with one of these beings; I wrote it down at the time, in order to have it exactly correct.|$|E
60|$|My time is {{become so}} short, now, that I doubt if I get to California this summer. If I manage {{to buy into}} a paper, I think I will visit you a while and not go to Cal. at all. I shall know {{something}} about it after my next trip to Hartford. We all go there on the 10th--the whole family--to attend a wedding, on the 17th. I am offered an interest in a Cleveland paper which would pay me $2,300 to $2,500 a year, and a salary added of $3,000. The salary is fair enough, but the interest is not large enough, and so I must look a little further. The Cleveland folks <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be induced {{to do a little}} better by me, and urge me to come out and talk business. But it don't strike me--I feel little or no inclination to go.|$|E
60|$|But here now, {{the wise}} men of our days are so well skilled as {{that they have}} both the manner and matter of their prayers at their finger-ends; setting such a prayer for such a day, and that twenty years before it comes. One for Christmas, another for Easter, and six days after that. They have also bounded how many syllables must be said {{in every one of}} them at their public exercises. For each saint's day, also, they have them ready for the generations yet unborn to <b>say.</b> <b>They</b> <b>can</b> tell you, also, when you shall kneel, when you shall stand, when you should abide in your seats, when you should go up into the chancel, and what you should do when you come there. All which the apostles came short of, as not being able to compose so {{profound}} a manner; and that for this reason included in this scripture, because the fear of God tied them to pray as they ought.|$|E
5000|$|We {{first meet}} the lead character, a {{teenager}} (who is not given a {{name in the}} story) shoplifting a copy of Catcher in the Rye from a London bookshop. He says, [...] "I hate the rain. Everything bad happens in the rain." [...] His reason for stealing the book is not clear beyond him <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find {{it in his pocket}} [...] "when this is all over".|$|R
60|$|But William <b>says</b> that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> dig {{the grass}} {{up with their}} little spades. They had tried it, and found {{that they could do}} so.|$|R
50|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (such as ibuprofen or naproxen), and aspirin may decrease redness and pain. Local anesthetics such as benzocaine, however, are contraindicated. Schwellnus et al. {{states that}} topical steroids (such as hydrocortisone cream) do not help with sunburns, although the American Academy of Dermatology <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be used on}} especially sore areas. While lidocaine cream is often used as a sunburn treatment, {{there is little evidence}} for the effectiveness of such use.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a floorwalker {{who never}} let me alone the whole time I was at Pratt's--he put me in mind of a pallbearer. His name was Selkirk, {{and he had a}} family in Westerly, out on the Grade Suburban.... Some of the girls never came back at all, except to swagger in and buy {{expensive}} things, and tell us we were fools to work. And after a while I noticed Florry was getting discouraged. We never had so much as a nickel left over on Saturdays and they made us sign a paper, when they hired us, that we lived at home. It was their excuse for paying us six dollars a week. They do it at Ferguson's, too. They <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get plenty of girls who do live at home. I made up my mind I'd go back to Madison, but I kept putting it off, and then father died, and I couldn't! ...|$|E
60|$|But turn to {{the broader}} and simpler {{question}} of work itself. In my time one hated it. It was viewed as the natural enemy of man. Now the world has {{fallen in love with}} it. My friends, I find, take their deep breathing and their porch sleeping because it makes them work better. They go for a week's vacation in Virginia not for its own sake, but because they <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> work better when they get back. I know a man who wears very loose boots because he can work better in them: and another who wears only soft shirts because he can work better in a soft shirt. There are plenty of men now who would wear dog-harness if they thought they could work more in it. I know another man who walks away out into the country every Sunday: not that he likes the country--he wouldn't recognize a bumble bee if he saw it--but he claims that if he walks on Sunday his head is as clear as a bell for work on Monday.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} stood up before that crowd," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Chipperton, [...] "and I {{would have told}} the people what I thought of them. I would have asked them how, living in a land like this, where the blue sky shines on them for nothing, where cocoa-nut and the orange stand always ready for them to stretch forth their hands and take them, where they need but a minimum of clothes, and where the very sea around them freely yields up its fish and its conchs,--or, that is to <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get such things for a trifling sum,--I would have asked them, I say, how--when free citizens of a republic, such as we are, come from our shores of liberty, where kings and queens are despised and any throne that is attempted {{to be set up}} over us is crushed to atoms,--that when we, I say, come over here, and out of the pure kindness and generosity of our souls raise from the dust a poverty-stricken and down-trodden queen, and place her, as nearly as possible, on the throne of her ancestors, and put upon her head a crown,--a bauble which, in our own land, we trample under foot----" ...|$|E

I came down to look for her, for when I sat by Gridley this afternoon, I seemed to hear the roll of the muffled drums." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the season's second half, Hank accuses Walt {{of being}} Heisenberg, which Walt neither {{confirms}} nor denies. Walt {{says that his}} cancer has returned and he will likely be dead in six months, making an arrest pointless. Hank <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> talk if Walt gives up his children, but Walt refuses and tells Hank to [...] "tread lightly". Walt eventually forces Hank to remain silent by crafting a fake confessional videotape in which he states that Hank is Heisenberg.|$|R
50|$|Although it's Christmas Day 1940, Captain Mainwaring can't {{forget his}} sense of duty and orders his men to parade as normal. Sergeant Wilson, being more relaxed about the festive affair, <b>says</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> wear civvies. Mainwaring doesn't like the sergeant's sudden burst of {{decision}} making and subsequently, the men arrive at the parade all dressed as Father Christmas, with various reasons why. Mainwaring views this as proof that you cannot be seen to let discipline drop for one moment.|$|R
