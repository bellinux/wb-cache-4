40|$|The {{prevalence}} of asthma {{and the role}} of occupational exposures was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 498 Montreal adults aged 20 to 44 years. Prevalences of asthma standardised for age and gender, using four definitions were: current wheeze: 23 8 %, asthma symptoms and/or medicine: 12. 9 %, airway hyper-responsiveness: 15. 1 %, airway hyper-responsiveness and current wheeze: 7. 0 %. Imputation to adjust for non-response to airway challenge gave similar results. 56. 9 % of subjects reported occupational exposure ever to <b>sensitisers</b> and 10. 8 % to irritants. Current wheeze was associated with exposure to irritants (OR: 2. 12 (1. 03, 4. 34)), and airway hyper-responsiveness with exposure to <b>sensitisers</b> (OR: 2. 20 (1. 10, 4. 38)). Childhood asthma and atopy did not affect the associations. Population attributable risk was about 30 % for airway hyper-responsiveness with exposure to <b>sensitisers,</b> and 5 % for current wheeze with exposure to irritants.

RDX crystals physically coated with gold nanoparticles or recrystallised from a solution containing gold nanoparticles were tested for optical sensitisation by micro-imaging with a scanning electron microscope, and high-speed video was used to experimentally observe the enhanced laser ignitibility. The gold nanoparticles achieved effective optical sensitisation and significantly enhanced the laser ignitibility of RDX, reducing the laser ignition threshold power from more than 45 W to as little as 1 W.

30|$|The {{initiation}} {{reaction of}} the oil oxidation can proceed through the formation of singlet oxygen by photosensitised oxidation (Choe & Min 2006). Singlet oxygen could be generated from triplet oxygen in chlorophyll photosensitisation, inducing the formation of 2 -pentyl furan, trans- 2 -heptenal and 1 -octen- 3 -ol in linoleic acid samples (Lee & Min 2010). Chlorophyll, commonly found in vegetable oils, serves as a photosensitiser. Photosensitisers absorb light energy very rapidly and convert the singlet state to excited triplet state <b>sensitisers.</b> The {{reaction of the}}se excited <b>sensitisers</b> with triplet oxygen produces singlet oxygen (Choe & Min 2006; Min & Boff 2002; Rawls & Santen 1970). The reactions involving singlet oxygen are probably responsible for initiating the self-heating of linseed oil.

Therefore, the goal of a working group was to design a road map to develop an ASAT approach for respiratory <b>sensitisers.</b> This approach should aim at (i) creating a database on respiratory functional biology and toxicology, (ii) applying data analyses to understand the multi-dimensional sensitization response, and how this predisposes to respiratory inflammation and irritation, and (iii) building a systems model out of these analyses, adding pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling to predict respiratory responses to low levels of <b>sensitisers.</b> To this end, the best way forward would be to follow an integrated testing approach. Experimental research should be targeted to (i) QSAR-type approaches to relate potential as a respiratory sensitizer to its chemical structure, (ii) in vitro models and (iii) in vitro-in vivo extrapolation/validation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of scalable and cost-efficient solar cell technologies constitutes {{a priority in}} the field of photovoltaics research. Semiconductor sensitised solar cells (SSSC) and hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (HOPSC) are two emerging technologies that have been actively pursued in the search for the most efficient, cost-competitive, stable and nontoxic photovoltaic devices. The HOPSCs have been polarising the attention of the photovoltaics community {{in the past three years}} due to their ever-increasing efficiencies, currently exceeding 20 &# 37; while SSSCs have increased in popularity in the last decade, showing a steady increase of their efficiency and emergence of new materials implemented as light <b>sensitisers.</b> Improvement of these novel technologies relies on understanding of the physical properties of the materials components and on efficient strategies towards the discovery of novel compounds. In this thesis, we address these requirements by modelling the electronic structures of novel light <b>sensitisers</b> from first principles. We focus on the analysis of two groups of materials, the hybrid organic-inorganic lead-iodide perovskites and the metal chalcogenides of the stibnite family. We study the electronic structure of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 within density functional theory and obtain the quasiparticle band gap for this material within the GW method in good agreement with experiment. Further, we conduct a systematic study of the interplay between the electronic properties of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and the structure of the inorganic perovskite network. As a result, we obtain a simple strategy for tuning the band gap of perovskite light absorbers by changing the size of the central cation, and propose AsH 4 PbI 3 and SbH 4 PbI 3 as potential novel light <b>sensitisers</b> for HOPSC. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of the electronic structure of four isostructural metal chalcogenides of the stibnite family, stibnite, antimonselite, bismuthinite and guanajuatite. A study of the quasiparticle band gaps of these materials is conducted, similar to the approach used for CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3. By using the Shockley-Queisser analysis, we obtain that all four materials are promising for application as light <b>sensitisers.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|Efaproxiral (INN) is an {{analogue}} of the cholesterol drug bezafibrate {{developed for}} the treatment of depression, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypoxia, sickle cell disease, hypercholesterolemia and as a radio <b>sensitiser.</b> The chemical is a propanoic acid in the class of amphipathic carboxylic acids. Most propanoic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. One use for efaproxiral is to increase the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs which have reduced efficacy against hypoxic tumours, and can thus be made more effective by increased offloading of oxygen into the tumour tissues. No benefit was seen for efaproxiral in phase III clinical trials. The increased oxygenation of tissues could theoretically also produce enhanced exercise capacity in feline, rat and canine models for approximately 100 min. immediately after a high dosage 45 min. intravenous infusion. This has led World Anti-Doping Agency to categorise efaproxiral under a prohibited method to artificially enhance the uptake, transport or delivery of oxygen. There is no existing evidence that efaproxiral can effectively enhance performance in humans. Efaproxiral can be absorbed via transdermal, rectal, inhalation and gastrointestinal routes, though not at plasma concentrations great enough to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. Efaproxiral is explicitly excluded from the 2012 World Anti-Doping Agency list of Prohibited Substances and is explicitly included in the Prohibited Methods section M1 as a forbidden procedure to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve in order to allosterically modify haemoglobin.|$|E

The in vivo screening, consisting of cytotoxicity, phototoxicity (red light) and subcellular localisation studies, revealed two <b>sensitisers</b> (porphyrin 7, molecular weight 863 Da and porphyrin 8, molecular weight 889 Da), which had greater photoactivity than porphyrin C and similar photoactivity to haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) although at a 5 -fold higher dose than HpD. Both <b>sensitisers</b> showed intracellular localisation to discrete organelle sites and exhibited considerably less 'dark' cytotoxicity than HpD. The kinetics of uptake of porphyrins 7 and 8 was studied in the mouse C 6 glioma model {{as well as in}} biopsy samples from normal brain, liver, spleen and blood. Maximal drug uptake levels in tumour occurred 9 and 6 h after intraperitoneal injection for 7 and 8 respectively, at which time the tumour to normal brain ratios were 15 : 1 and 13 : 1 respectively. The effect of PDT using porphyrin 7 activated by the gold metal vapour laser tuned to 627. 8 nm was studied in Wistar rats bearing intracerebral C 6 glioma. At a drug dose of 10 mg porphyrin 7 kg- 1 body weight and laser doses of up to 400 J cm- 2 light, selective tumour kill with sparing of normal brain was achieved, with a maximal depth of tumour kill of 1. 77 +/- 0. 40. mm.
