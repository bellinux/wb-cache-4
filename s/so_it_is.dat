5|$|For example, the Grötzsch graph is 4-chromatic and triangle-free (it has girth 4 and odd girth 5), <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{incomparable}} to {{the triangle}} graph K3.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{course it}} wasn't.

5|$|In 2006, the US141 {{expressway}} {{was extended}} northward near Beaver, {{and the former}} route of US141, plus a connector roadway southwest of downtown Coleman was designated as a business loop. This route does not appear on the official Wisconsin Department of Transportation maps, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a locally designated business loop under local maintenance.|$|E
5|$|No other {{francolin}} {{share this}} bird's restricted range (although the yellow-necked francolin occurs elsewhere in Djibouti) <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{unlikely to be}} confused with any other species.|$|E
5|$|The City of Manchester {{is governed}} by the Manchester City Council. The earlier Greater Manchester County Council was {{abolished}} in 1986 <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> effectively a unitary authority.

5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid ima artery {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772. Hence, it was named the thyroid artery of Neubauer. The artery {{originates}} lower than the inferior thyroid arteries, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{also known as the}} lowest thyroid artery.|$|E
5|$|This norm {{satisfies}} the parallelogram law, {{and so the}} dual space is also an inner product space. The dual space is also complete, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} funnel clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult to discern {{the difference between a}} funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Two of Vermigli's {{former colleagues}} in Lucca—Lacizi and Tremellius—would {{join him in}} Strasbourg. In 1544 he was elected canon of St. Thomas Church, Strasbourg. In 1545 Vermigli married his first wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from Metz. Catherine knew no Italian, and Peter very little German, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> assumed that they conversed in Latin.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{as if you are}} playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Also {{starting}} with Endubis these coins were 2.11-2.5grams in weight which {{is half the}} weight of a Roman antoninianus of 3.5-4.5 grams. A Denarius in the early 3rd century was 2.5-3.00grams of 52 percent or less of silver, but the Aksum coins were almost pure silver at first later debased. The name is unknown <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> referred to as an AR Unit.|$|E

5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a good place for}} beginner hiker to start from, as you may struggle with altitude sickness in the first few days. Punakha is also the center of Bhutan’s longest suspension bridge (Punakha Suspension Bridge) and is about 7.5km (4.5 miles) by car to Chimi Lhakhang, the Divine Madman’s fertility temple.|$|E
