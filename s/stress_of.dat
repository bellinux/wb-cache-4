5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the {{grooming}} hypothesis {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly {{suited for the}} mechanical <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more {{important role in the}} use of the toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E

40|$|Flocs were {{produced}} by adding three cationic polymers (10 % charge density, 3. 0 × 10 ⁵ g/mol molecular weight; 40 % charge density, 1. 1 × 10 ⁵ g/mol molecular weight; and 100 % charge density, 1. 2 × 10 ⁵ g/mol molecular weight) to 90 nm diameter silica particles. The compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the consolidated sediment beds from settled and centrifuged flocs were determined using the volume fraction profile method. The polymer charge density {{plays an important}} role in influencing the compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediment beds. The compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediment beds fromflocs induced by the 10 % charged polymer were observed to increase with an increase in polymer dose, initial solids concentration, and background electrolyte concentration at all volume fraction. In comparison, polymer dose has marginal effect on the compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediment beds from flocs induced by 40 % and 100 % charged polymers. Initial solids concentration has no influence on the compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediment beds from flocs induced by either 40 % or 100 % charged polymers at the polymer doses used. The compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediments from flocs induced by the 40 % charged polymer are independent of salt concentration whereas the addition of salt decreases the compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediments from flocs induced by the 100 % charged polymer. It is found that the shear intensity during aggregation only affects the compressive yield <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> sediments from flocs induced by the 10 % charged polymer. When flocculated at the optimum dose for each polymer (12 mg/g silica for the 10 % charged polymer at 0. 03 M NaCl, 12 mg/g for 40 % and 2 mg/g for 100 %), compressive yield stress increases as polymer charge increases. The effects observed are related to the flocculation mechanism (bridging, patch attraction or charge neutralisation) and the magnitude of the attractive force...|$|R

40|$|Micro {{residual}} <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> {{the second}} and third order {{play an important role in}} the fracture mechanical analysis of thermally-cycled materials, and thus in lifetime analysis of such effected components. For example, forming rollers in a rolling plant made of white cast iron can develop cracking due to stress risers caused by thermal-induced residual stresses. After long-term service exposure of the low-alloy, heat-resistant ferritic steels damage was observed during operation, caused by the precipitation of copper particles ranging from 1 to 3 nm in size which are surrounded by coherent residual microstresses of third order. In multi-phase materials can exist two kind of micro residual stresses: thermal-induced residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the second order and coherent residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> third order. In multi-phase materials, thermal-induced <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the second order appear when individual material phases exhibit different thermal expansion coefficients. Such differences in temperature-related expansion coefficients of cementite and ferrite in steel and white cast iron promote the development of these types <b>of</b> residual <b>stresses.</b> These differences below the Curie point of cementite grow with decreasing temperature and therefore, the largest variations <b>of</b> the residual <b>stresses</b> can be assumed at ambient temperatures. In multi-phase materials, coherent residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the third order appear when the lattice parameter of the second phase particles embedded coherently in the matrix and the lattice parameter of the matrix are different. Such differences in the ferritic Cu containing materials between the lattice parameters of coherent Cu particles and the lattice parameters of the matrix yield to distortion of the lattice around the Cu particles that causes the coherent residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> third order. The main objective of the here discussed research was to develop a micro-magnetic non-destructive method for quantitative characterisation and separation <b>of</b> microscopic residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> second and third order in multi-phase, iron-based material...|$|R
50|$|This can be {{interpreted}} as the <b>stress</b> tensor <b>of</b> the composite material minus the stresses carried by the reinforcement at yielding. This formulation is accurate for reinforcement ratio's smaller than 5%. It is assumed that the brittle material has no tensile strength.

Therefore, the principal <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the brittle material need to be compression. The principal <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> a <b>stress</b> tensor are its eigenvalues.|$|R
5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
