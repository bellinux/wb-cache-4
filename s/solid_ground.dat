5|$|Solitary {{places are}} the best venues for yoga. A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25%–30% {{the length of the}} lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively <b>solid</b> <b>ground.</b> Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E

25|$|Cassini {{released}} the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004, {{by means of}} a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on <b>solid</b> <b>ground.</b> Although Cassini successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from Huygens of its descent and landing site, a software error failed to turn on one of the Cassini receivers and caused the loss of another 350 pictures. While landing, for caution, NASA loaded Huygens with 3 parachutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Wright brothers' design of a controllable airplane that could fly against a strong wind and land on <b>solid</b> <b>ground,</b> Langley sought safety by practicing in calm air over the Potomac River. This required a catapult for launching. The craft had no landing gear, the plan being to descend into the water after demonstrating flight which if successful would entail a partial, if not total, rebuilding of the machine. Langley gave up the project after two crashes on take-off on October 7 and December 8, 1903.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} {{coastal areas}} were originally amphibious flood plains and swampy land. In areas {{especially vulnerable to}} storm surges, people settled behind elevated levees and on natural areas of high ground such as spits and geestland. As early as 500 BC, people were constructing artificial dwelling hills higher than the prevailing flood levels. It was only around {{the beginning of the}} High Middle Ages, in 1200 AD, that inhabitants began to connect single ring dikes into a dike line along the entire coast, thereby turning amphibious regions between the land and the sea into permanent <b>solid</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August {{the balloon}} was {{commissioned}} to fly despite known technical flaws. The commissioners {{emphasized that the}} crew, although equipped with personal parachutes, had few chances of bailing out in case of emergency: the sole airtight hatch was held in place with twelve wing nuts. Opening it, even on <b>solid</b> <b>ground,</b> required minutes. The crew did not wear pressure suits (they simply did not exist at that time) or individual breathing sets, relying on stored supplies of compressed oxygen and carbon dioxide absorber cartridges. Crew survival depended on the gondola's integrity; bailing out without breathing sets was feasible only at altitudes below 8,000 metres.|$|E
25|$|The {{tunnelling}} {{work was}} done by hand. The usual danger from the extensive use of explosives in the tunnels and cuttings was increased by the unstable nature of the rock and the steep drop {{down the side of}} the Barron Gorge. The average slope of the ground was 45 degrees, covered with a disjointed layer of decomposed soil and rock varying in depth from 5 to 8m. Robb had to dig deep into hillsides to find <b>solid</b> <b>ground,</b> and multiple deviations from the original surveyed route also increased his costs. Red Bluff and Glacier Rock were exposed when earth, rocks and trees were removed, again by hand, from above the line (escarpments had to be cleared and levelled back).|$|E

25|$|In 111 Bithynia et Pontus {{was known}} for being in disorder, and Pliny was {{selected}} by Trajan because of his legal training and his past experience. Pliny {{was familiar with the}} region, having defended two of their proconsuls for extortion in the Senate, one case being around AD 103. However, Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians, and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> regarding his actions, and saved his letters and Trajan's replies. The way he expressed his lack of familiarity with the procedure may indicate that such prosecutions against Christians had taken place before (namely in Rome), but Pliny had not been involved in them.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of the new}} bridge {{began in}} November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the bridge {{abutment}} encroached on its right-of-way; eventually the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, {{and the federal government}} paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction of a cofferdam and extensive excavation and investigation of the riverbed. A major flood in 1888 damaged some of the work, and caused further delays.|$|E
25|$|In France {{during the}} chaotic {{years of the}} French Revolution and its aftermath, the younger Audubon {{grew up to be}} a {{handsome}} and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer's qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He was cheerfully back on <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} intention for Gemini was {{to land on}} <b>solid</b> <b>ground</b> {{instead of}} at sea, using a Rogallo wing rather than a parachute, with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft. To facilitate this, the airfoil did not attach just to {{the nose of the}} craft, but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield. This cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches. This design was ultimately dropped, and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in Mercury. The capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal, so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first. This eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the Mercury capsule.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell height}} {{is up to}} 41.1mm, 1.65 times as long as wide, umbilicate and deeply perforated, conical, with {{slightly}} convex sides and <b>solid.</b> <b>Ground</b> colour is uniformly whitish-corneous, the upper whorls are lighter, with four spiral light chestnut-brown bands, a small one below the white-lined suture, two broader ones {{above and below the}} periphery (which in some specimens are faintly subdivided into two equally broad bands) and a fourth band encircling the umbilicus. The surface is lustreless, with growth striae and spiral lines of fine, punctuate granulation, starting shallowly on the postnepionic whorl, but becoming rapidly more conspicuous on the following and fading away inside the umbilicus. The protoconch is pit-reticulate. The shell has 6.3 whorls that are somewhat convex. The last whorl is saccate. The suture is impressed, somewhat crenulate, at the aperture ascending in front. The aperture is large, ovate, glossy white inside with the pattern visible in banded specimens. Apertural margins are converging. The aperture is 1.30 times as long as wide, 0.70 times the total height. The peristome is broadly expanded and backwardly reflexed, glossy whitish. Columellar margin is straight, broadly expanded and merging into the rather thick parietal callus.|$|E
