The same week, similar rallies {{took place in}} major Australian cities and in Wellington, New Zealand. MUA workers in Sydney observed one minute's silence in solidarity. Speakers at a Brisbane rally argued that Wotton should {{have been given a}} bravery award for what they saw as <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> racist oppression of Palm Islanders. Benefit concerts were also held in support of him.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela, {{was a local}} {{chief and}} {{councillor}} to the monarch; he {{was appointed to the}} position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House {{and a member of the}} amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. <b>Standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{initially}} {{struggled against}} the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling {{from the other}} end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. <b>Standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him.

5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Arthur Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was thus deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He had never opened at Test level, but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman {{after the fall of}} the first wicket late on a day's play. He was unable to make an impact—Bedser removed him for one, caught by Evans at chest height off the inside edge from a ball that reared from the pitch. It was a difficult catch as Evans was <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps and he had little time to react to the ball's change of direction. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach. Johnson's dismissal brought Bradman in to face the new ball. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman lbw with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot for seven to leave Australia in trouble at 13/2. This provoked a strong cheer from the crowd in support of Pollard, the Lancashire local. Australia were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming for leg stump to stifle the scoring. He was partnered by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes.|$|E

25|$|When Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff formed The New Blood, Huffman {{eventually}} {{completely changed}} his in-ring persona, helping lead Captain Rection's military-themed Misfits In Action stable as G.I. Bro, reprising his gimmicks {{from his days}} in the WWA. He defeated Shawn Stasiak at the Great American Bash in a Boot Camp match. He returned to the Booker T name on the June 19th Nitro, promoting Rection {{to the status of}} General and demanding the Misfits start <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Blood.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} wicketkeeping {{reputation}} <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps and taking tricky spin bowling from Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson, and later Colin McCool, {{but in his}} 40s he proved he was no slouch standing back to faster bowlers as Somerset's attack turned successfully to seam in the early 1960s. He set the county records for stumpings in a season, in 1949, and for catches in a season, in 1963, {{as well as for}} the most dismissals in a season. He also set the county record for the number of career dismissals, was the first to make six dismissals in an innings, and equalled the county record of nine dismissals in a match.|$|E
25|$|According to Ashley Mallett's {{biography}} of Ian Chappell, Chappelli Speaks Out, Bill Lawry was considering selecting Jordon {{to play in}} the fourth test instead of Taber because of the former's superior batting. Chappell said he would not play in the side if Jordon was picked because the wicketkeeper was a cheat. This was based on an incident during a game on the recent Indian tour when Australia was playing South Zone. E. A. S. Prasanna was facing Alan Connolly with Jordon <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps – he appeared to miss the ball and his off stump was knocked forward. Jordon appealed and Prasanna eventually walked but Chappell believed the ball had missed Prasanna's stumps and rebounded off Jordon's pads to break the wicket – and that Jordon knew this.|$|E

25|$|Aymes was a {{technically}} correct batsman who prided {{himself on}} not giving his wicket away, and was often required to shore up batting inadequacies in the side. Hampshire struggled in their two seasons in Division 1 (in 2000 and 2000); this unfortunately coincided with Aymes' hand and knee injuries. Aymes was regarded as the best wicket-keeper in the County Championship, being equally adept at standing back to the West Indies fast bowler Malcolm Marshall and <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leg spin of Shane Warne. It was in standing up to his medium pace bowlers that brought the downfall of David Ward in the 1991 Natwest Trophy Final, which turned {{the fate of the}} match. Aymes was also unlucky not to participate in the 1998–99 tour of Australia after a slight dip of form {{towards the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Wood's {{good form}} for Lancashire {{led to his}} {{selection}} for his first Test against Australia at The Oval in 1972. Against a fearsome Australian bowling attack, spearheaded by the great Dennis Lillee, he made a very fine score of 90 which led to his selection for a tour of India and Pakistan. However, he had a lean time in the subcontinent and was dropped from the side. He was again selected as a replacement in a New Zealand tour as a replacement but failed again. The lateness of his selection was a contributing factor as he completed a 63-hour trip from the West Indies to New Zealand just before the first Test. In 1975, he played Tests against Australia, <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> menacing duo of Lillee and Thompson scoring a half century. His final Test was against Pakistan in 1978. In his prime, Wood was {{widely regarded as the}} finest player of fast bowling in the country.|$|E
25|$|The MCC stopped off on {{the journey}} between Melbourne and Sydney to play another Bush game. The local team won the toss and Max Rudd made 82 adding 139 {{for the first two}} wickets. Unfortunately John Murray was <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wicket to Geoff Pullar's rare bowling and the future Australian Wallabies {{international}} Ken McMullen caught him with the end of his bat while hooking the ball to the boundary. Murray was helped off the field and needed three stitches in his forehead, but reports that his jaw had been broken and that his tour was over were exaggerated. Ted Dexter was the best bowler with 2/29 and Southern New South Wales declared on 186/6 in this one innings, one day game. The MCC made the runs despite losing David Sheppard, Peter Parfitt and Tom Graveney as Geoff Pullar made 81 in 66 minutes and Dexter 108 in 71 minutes with 3 sixes and 13 fours. They passed the winning line with the score on 187/3, but carried on batting {{for the rest of the}} day's play to finish with 272/6.|$|E

25|$|He {{played his}} debut first class match against South Africa on 1 June 1960, {{appearing}} as keeper for a Minor Counties XI. He scored 11 and a duck {{and did not}} take any catches behind the stumps. Thanks largely to recommendations by Cliff Gladwin, {{he went on to}} make his County Championship and Derbyshire debut on 7 June the follow year, scoring another duck and eight as well as taking two catches as Derbyshire drew with Sussex at the County Ground, Derby. His first victim was Sussex's Ken Suttle, yet several players observed that he had much to learn; many bowlers condemned him for <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps and missing edges. Taylor would go on to play 17 matches in his debut 1961 season for his county, scoring 20 runs at 11.38 with a best of 48, taking 47 catches and 6 stumpings behind the wicket. 29 more games followed in 1960, however his batting remained unimpressive, scoring 300 runs at 10.71 with a best of 44. He remained dependable behind the stumps, with 77 catches and three stumpings. His 77 catches set a new Derbyshire-record. He notched his first half-century in the 1963 season, though averaged under 10.00. His 32 first-class games that season, what would be a career high, and a career-best season total of 81 catches behind the timbers. This included all ten wickets in a match against Hampshire falling courtesy of his glove-work.|$|E

500|$|Hamence had {{one last}} chance {{to make his case}} for Test {{selection}} in the match against Sussex at Hove, the last county fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to declare at 5/549. Bradman said that Hamence was [...] "the unlucky player of the match" [...] and that he was standing on the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over. Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with Ray Lindwall. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by Ron Saggers <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps.|$|E
