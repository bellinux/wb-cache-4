This {{globally}} distributed species has been reported down {{to a depth of}} , making it the deepest-living shark known. It inhabits lower continental slopes and abyssal plains, usually staying near the bottom. Stocky and dark brown in color, the Portuguese dogfish can be distinguished from similar-looking species (such as the kitefin shark, Dalatias licha) by the small spines in front of its dorsal fins.

50|$|Many {{sperm whales}} have scars on their backs, {{believed}} {{to be caused by}} the hooks of colossal squid. Colossal squid are a major prey item for sperm whales in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the colossal squid, which indicates that colossal squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. Many other animals also feed on colossal squid, including beaked whales (such as the southern bottlenose whale), pilot whales, southern elephant seals, Patagonian toothfish, <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Somniosus antarcticus), and albatrosses (e.g., the wandering and sooty albatrosses).

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> or Whitley's <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus antarcticus) is a deepwater benthopelagic <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Somniosidae found in the southern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.

50|$|Because food is {{relatively}} scarce on {{the deep sea}} floor, the <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> is able to store food in its capacious stomach. The sleeper shark's jaws are able to produce a powerful bite due to their short and transverse shape. The upper jaw teeth of the <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark</b> are spike-like, while the lower jaw teeth are oblique cusps and overlapping bases. This arrangement allows grasping and sawing of food too large to swallow. Pacific sleeper sharks have a short caudal fin, which allows them to store energy for fast and violent bursts of energy to catch prey.|$|E
40|$|Herein, we use {{genetic data}} from 277 <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> to perform coalescent-based {{modeling}} {{to test the}} hypothesis of early Quaternary emergence of the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) from ancestral <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> in the Canadian Arctic-Subarctic region. Our results show that morphologically cryptic somniosids S. microcephalus and Somniosus pacificus can be genetically distinguished using combined mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Our data confirm the presence of genetically admixed individuals in the Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic, and temperate Eastern Atlantic regions, suggesting introgressive hybridization upon secondary contact following the initial species divergence. Conservative substitution rates fitted to an Isolation with Migration (IM) model indicate a likely species divergence time of 2. 34 Ma, using the mitochondrial sequence DNA, which in conjunction with the geographic distribution of admixtures and Pacific signatures likely indicates speciation associated with processes other than the closing of the Isthmus of Panama. This time span coincides with further planetary cooling in the early Quaternary period followed by the onset of oscillating glacial-interglacial cycles. We propose that the initial S. microcephalus–S. pacificus split, and subsequent hybridization events, were likely associated with the onset of Pleistocene glacial oscillations, whereby fluctuating sea levels constrained connectivity among Arctic oceanic basins, Arctic marginal seas, and the North Atlantic Ocean. Our data demonstrates support for the evolutionary consequences of oscillatory vicariance via transient oceanic isolation with subsequent secondary contact associated with fluctuating sea levels throughout the Quaternary period—which may {{serve as a model for}} the origins of Arctic marine fauna on a broad taxonomic scale...|$|R
50|$|Due {{to living}} in frigid depths, the <b>sleeper</b> <b>shark's</b> liver oil does not contain squalene, which would solidify into a dense, nonbuoyant mass. Instead, the low-density {{compounds}} in the sharks' liver are diacylglyceryl ethers and triacylglycerol, which maintain their fluidity even at the lowest temperatures. Also, they store very little urea in their skin (like many deep sea sharks), but like other elasmobranchs, have high concentrations of urea and trimethylamine oxide (nitrogenous waste products) in their tissues as osmoprotectants and to increase their buoyancy. Trimethylamine oxide also serves to counteract the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea and pressure. Its presence in the tissues of both elasmobranch and teleost fish {{has been found to}} increase with depth.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Many {{theoretical}} and experimental studies sug-gest that synergistic interactions between resources and predators influence foraging decisions and their fitness consequences. This framework, however, has been ignored almost completely by hypotheses on {{causes of the}} population decline of Steller sea lions (SSLs) (Eumetopias jubatus) in western Alaska. By comparing predictions from a dynamic state variable model to empirical data on the behaviour of individuals instrumented with satellite-linked time-at-depth recorders, we develop and find preliminary support for the hypothesis that, during winter in Prince William Sound, juvenile SSLs (a) underutilise walleye pollock, a predictable resource in deep strata, due to predation risk from Pacific <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks,</b> and (b) underutilise the potential energy bonanza of inshore aggregations of Pacific herring due to risk from either killer whales, larger conspecifics, or both. Further, under conditions of resource scarcity—induced by overfishing, long-term oceanographic cycles, or their combination—trade-offs between mortality risk and energy gain may influence demographic parameters. Accordingly, computer simulations illustrated the theoretical plausibility that a decline of Pacific herring in shallow strata would greatly {{increase the number of}} deep foraging dives, thereby increasing exposure to <b>sleeper</b> <b>sharks</b> and mortality rates. These results suggest that hypotheses on the decline of SSLs should consider synergistic effects of predators and resour-ces on behaviour and mortality rates. Empirical support for our model, however, is limited and we outline tasks for empirical research that emerge from these limitations. More generally, in the context of today’s conservation crises, our work illustrates that the greater the dearth of system-specific data, the greater the need to apply principles of behavioural ecology toward the understanding and management of large-scale marine systems...|$|R
