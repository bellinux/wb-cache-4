5|$|In {{a series}} of <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> engagements over 29days, the 2nd Raiders killed almost 500Japanese {{soldiers}} while suffering only 16killed, although many were afflicted by disease.

5|$|The first Corps was a <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> {{that served}} in the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810, {{recruited}} from former slaves to address the shortage of military manpower in the Caribbean.

The Corps followed {{the practice of the}} British Army's West India Regiments in recruiting slaves as soldiers.|$|E
40|$|DE 10246088 A UPAB: 20030616 NOVELTY - Process for sorting <b>small</b> <b>units</b> (1) such as cells, {{particles}} or molecules comprises {{producing a}} liquid stream containing the small units; and accelerating the units from the liquid stream using impulses. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: The <b>small</b> <b>units</b> are accelerated from the liquid stream using different strong impulses and fly into defined chambers. Differently marked <b>small</b> <b>units</b> are separately identified and controlled and then sorted into different chambers via {{the strength of}} the impulse. The impulses are generated using compressed air, via laser vapors and via ultrasound. The <b>small</b> <b>units</b> are located on magnetic supports (2) and the impulses are accelerated using particles from the liquid stream and electromagnetically induced. USE - Used for sorting <b>small</b> <b>units</b> such as cells, particles or molecules. ADVANTAGE - Fine adjustments are not required...|$|R

5|$|When the Black Hawk War {{began in}} the spring of 1832, the {{settlers}} at Buffalo Grove were notified of Black Hawk's victory at Stillman's Run and ordered to leave the grove. Most of the settlers went to Peoria where they remained {{for the duration of the}} war. On May 19, 1832 a <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> was detailed to carry dispatches from Colonel James M. Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry (present-day Dixon, Illinois). The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and mail contractor John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19.|$|E
5|$|The last-ditched {{effort by}} the Germans {{to win the war}} came to a {{grinding}} halt in mid-July and after that there followed a brief period of lull, during which time the Australians undertook a series of <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> actions aimed at capturing parts of the German line with limited support. These actions became known as Peaceful Penetrations and were essentially a cross between trench raids and patrolling. Their success relied heavily upon the leadership and initiative of junior commanders and the ability of soldiers to employ principles of fire and manouevre. This lull did not last long, however, as the Allies were soon ready to launch their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which would ultimately bring about an end to the war.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Potemkin's {{scheme to}} develop a Russian {{presence}} in the rapidly disintegrating state of Persia failed. Plans for a full-scale invasion had previously been cut back and a <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> sent to establish a trading post there was quickly turned away. Potemkin focused instead on Russia's southern provinces, where he was busy founding cities (including Sevastopol) and creating his own personal kingdom, including his brand new Black Sea Fleet. That kingdom was about to expand: under the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji, which had ended the previous Russo-Turkish war, the Crimean Khanate had become independent, though effectively under Russian control. In June 1782 it was descending again into anarchy. By July 1783, Potemkin had engineered the peaceful annexation of the Crimea and Kuban, capitalizing {{on the fact that}} Britain and France were fighting elsewhere. The Kingdom of Georgia accepted Russian protection a few days later with the Treaty of Georgievsk searching for protection against Persia's aim to reestablish its suzerainty over Georgia; the Karabakh Khanate of Persia initially looked as though it might also, but eventually declined Russian help. Exhausted, Potemkin collapsed into a fever he barely survived. Catherine rewarded him with one hundred thousand roubles, which he used to construct the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, two new {{trends in}} wargaming emerged: First were small-unit rules sets which allowed {{individual}} players to portray <b>small</b> <b>units</b> down to {{even a single}} figure.

5|$|Finally, {{late in the}} war, the {{battalion}} received orders to deploy overseas again. Boarding the Duntroon on 24 November 1944, a week later {{the battalion}} arrived at Aitape in New Guinea. There, the 6th Division took over from the American garrison in order to free up the US troops for further fighting in the Philippines. Following disembarkation, the 2/5th concentrated around Tadji airstrip. In December, the Australians began offensive operations against the Japanese forces that were operating in the surrounding areas. For the next seven months until the war ended the 2/5th undertook patrols through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountain ranges, as the 17th Brigade worked to initially establish and hold the Australian base around Aitape, before moving inland towards Maprik {{and then on to}} Kiarivu to pursue the Japanese forces that had withdrawn into the interior. Although only intended as a mopping up campaign, it was an arduous and costly period. Consisting primarily of <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> actions which resulted in disproportionately heavy casualties for the Australians, throughout the course of the campaign the 2/5th suffered 146 casualties, including eight officers killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, Eichelberger was {{informed}} {{that he would be}} in charge of the next operation, a landing at Hansa Bay with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions. However, in March this was cancelled in favor of Operation Reckless, a landing by the same force at Hollandia. The operation meant leapfrogging the Japanese defenses at Hansa Bay, but was risky because it was outside the range of land-based air cover. Cover was instead provided by aircraft carriers of the United States Pacific Fleet, but this meant that the operation had to adhere to a strict timetable. Hoping to avoid a repeat of Buna, Eichelberger meticulously planned the operation, and implemented a thorough training program that emphasized physical fitness, individual initiative, <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> tactics and amphibious warfare. The operation went well, mainly because surprise was achieved and few Japanese were present in the area. However, poor topographical intelligence led to an inability to clear some beaches due to their being backed by swamps. Supplies piled up on the beaches, with fuel and ammunition being stored together in some instances. On 23 April a single Japanese plane ignited a fuel dump, which caused a fire that resulted in 124 casualties and the loss of 60 per cent of the ammunition stockpile. An appalled Krueger felt that Eichelberger had been let down by his staff, and offered to transfer Byers to an assistant division commander's post, but Eichelberger turned down the offer.|$|E
5|$|Since December 1974, the North Vietnamese {{prepared}} for the offensive by conducting raids on various South Vietnamese outposts and broadcasting fake radio messages to keep South Vietnamese commanders guessing about the location of their next assault. While the South Vietnamese units were kept occupied by Communist diversions, North Vietnamese General Hoang Minh Thao began moving his troops into attacking positions. The VPA 7th Combat Engineer Regiment was tasked with connecting Route 14 at North Vo Dinh with Highway 19 near Mang Yang Pass, which surpassed the district of Kontum. The VPA 10th Infantry Division began withdrawing from Duc Lap, and only left a small force behind to continue the bombardment of Pleiku, as artillery and tanks units took positions north of Kontum. The 320A Infantry Division deployed a <b>small</b> <b>unit</b> west of Pleiku to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese positions at La Son, Thanh An, and Don Tam. Elements of the 95th Regiment conducted blocking operations along Highway 19 to stop South Vietnamese reinforcements from reaching their destination. The 198th Special Forces Regiment raided South Vietnamese depots at Pleiku, while the main formation of the 10th and 320A Infantry Divisions marched on Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
