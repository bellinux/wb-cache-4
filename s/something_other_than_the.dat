This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.|$|E

He was never pleased that the policy he influenced was associated with the arms build-up of the Cold War. In his memoirs, Kennan argued that containment did not demand a militarized U.S. foreign policy. [...] "Counterforce" [...] implied the political and economic defense of Western Europe against the disruptive effect of the war on European society. Exhausted by war, the Soviet Union posed no serious military threat to the United States or its allies {{at the beginning of the}} Cold War but rather an ideological and political rival.|$|E

[...] Millikan eventually cast individuals who could play a [...] "subtle kind of evil", as well as display [...] "arrogance" [...] and [...] "vulnerability". Rodney Scott was cast as Tony Reed. Scott, at the time, was more notable for his roles as David Cassidy in the 1999 television movie Come On, Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story, and for his role as William [...] "Will" [...] Krudski on the popular show Dawson's Creek.|$|E
500|$|For the tour, Gaga told Capital FM {{that she}} wanted <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Monster Pit" [...] {{arrangement}} she previously had in the Born This Way Ball tour, since she was always limited to performing on one portion of the arena. Hence Gaga and her team thought of building two stages, one main stage and an accompanying one on {{the far end of}} the arena. It would be enhanced by the addition of a catwalk which would wind all around the arena floor, enabling the singer to interact with the audience. In March 2014, Gaga tweeted a picture of the stage which showed a runway extending from the main platform up to the general admission seats and then bifurcating into two additional runways, ending in small stages within the audience. At the end of the first runway, another platform was constructed which descended into the crowd directly. Gaga noted that the [...] long runways would be made of lucite rendering them translucent, so that the crowd can dance underneath it while still being able to watch the show. The main stage was described as a white cave, reminiscent of Atlantica from the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid, and featured a digital backdrop showing stars and the moon.|$|E

2500|$|American {{historian}} Arthur Waldron, the Lauder Professor of International Relations in the History Department at the University of Pennsylvania, {{published a}} review of Feigon's book on the website of U.S. conservative think-tank, the Claremont Institute. Waldron noted that Feigon's book represented the first [...] "serious attempt to depict [...] as <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> monster he undoubtedly was", and that it came from an author who had clearly had sympathies for Mao during the 1960s. Believing that the text was [...] "at best quixotic" [...] for attempting to portray Mao as [...] "a highly positive historical figure", he denigrated it as being [...] "wildly wrong". Nevertheless, he noted that Feigon was right in emphasising the influence of Stalin and the Soviet Union over Mao's early political thought. In her review of Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's [...] (2005), Jude Blanchette of the Foundation for Economic Education (an American free market think tank), compared it favourably to Feigon's work. She criticized Dow Jones' review in the Far Eastern Economic Review, believing it too positive and remarking [...] "Can one imagine a respected scholar publishing and receiving praise for a book entitled Hitler: A Reinterpretation?".|$|E
2500|$|The prose {{was first}} {{published}} in chapbook form some time between 1736 and 1764 by Cluer Dicey under the title The History of Titus Andronicus, the Renowned Roman General (the ballad was also included in the chapbook), however it is believed to be much older than that. The copyright records from the Stationers' Register in Shakespeare's own lifetime provide some tenuous evidence regarding the dating of the prose. On 19 April 1602, the publisher Thomas Millington sold his share in the copyright of [...] "A booke intitled a Noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus" [...] (which Danter had initially entered into the Register in 1594) to Thomas Pavier. The orthodox belief is that this entry refers to the play. However, the next version of the play to be published was for Edward White, in 1611, printed by Edward Allde, thus prompting the question of why Pavier never published the play despite owning the copyright for nine years. Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr. believes that the original Danter entry in 1594 is not a reference to the play but to the prose, and the subsequent transferrals of copyright relate to the prose, not the play, thus explaining why Pavier never published the play. Similarly, W. W. Greg believes that all copyright to the play lapsed upon Danter's death in 1600, hence the 1602 transferral from Millington to Pavier was illegitimate unless it refers to <b>something</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> play; i.e. the prose. Both scholars conclude that the evidence seems to imply the prose existed by early 1594 at the latest.|$|E
