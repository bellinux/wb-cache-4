Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state, but by that time, increased demand from development in the Deep South created a large internal market for slavery.

60|$|The seed of the long-stapled cotton, now {{cultivated}} in America, was sent there in 1786 from the Bahama Islands, {{by some of}} the royalist refugees, who had settled there. The inferior <b>short-stapled</b> cotton had been previously cultivated for domestic purposes. The seeds of every other variety have been tried without success. The kind now grown was first introduced into Georgia. Thus to the refugees America owes as much of her prosperity as is due to the cotton-crops, and much of whatever harm is to result from slavery.|$|R
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. <b>Short-stapled</b> Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|R

50|$|The Poll Dorset {{is a short}} wool, meat {{producing}} sheep {{that was}} developed in Australia between 1937 and 1954 {{with the aim of}} breeding a true Dorset type sheep without horns. The poll gene was introduced into Dorset Horn flocks from two other polled breeds and following a strict back-mating programme achieved close to 100% of Dorset Horn blood. Its main distinguishing features are its hornless appearance, long, lean square body set on short legs, pink skin and 'spongy' <b>short-stapled</b> wool. The Poll Dorset produces a fleece of white, dense downs type wool of 30 microns fibre diameter and it has a white wool-free face. The breed was developed at a property called Valmore in Whitemore, Tasmania, a noted centre for pedigree livestock stud farms. The Poll Dorset resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset Horn.|$|R

40|$|The Suffolk is {{the most}} {{well-known}} of the English lowland sheep breeds. A black-faced sheep with <b>short-stapled</b> wool, the breed is used primarily for meat production. The Suffolk is classified {{as one of the}} breeds with the best ability to fatten and its meat yield is approximately 60 %. The breed is characterised by its good adaptability to different climate and breeding conditions and overall good health. The ewes are known for their high fertility rate, shorter oestrus cycle, excellent maternal instincts, and high milk production. As a result of these characteristics, the Suffolk has become a very popular breed around the world. This thesis focuses on the breeding of Suffolk sheep {{as one of the best}} breeds for the production of slaughter lambs. The thesis also looks at reproduction as a part of sheep breeding, as well as at the factors that have an effect on pregnancy, the birthing process, and the newborn lamb. The main objective of this thesis was to process the lambing data for a specific herd of Suffolk sheep, including performing an evaluation of the basic reproductive indicators, calculating the birth weight of lambs, and determining the ideal age for including ewes in the breeding herd. The basic reproductive indicators include fertility, fertilisation, breeding intensity, and weaned lamb production. In the studied herd of sheep, these indicators were calculated as follows: fertility 182 %; fertilisation 91 %; breeding intensity 155 %; and weaned lamb production 159 %. The average birth weight of the lambs was 3. 9 kg and the average optimal age for inclusion in the breeding herd was determined to be 17. 5 months...|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{importation}} of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of cotton, sugar cane and rice production in the Deep South and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to King Cotton throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a commodity by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.|$|E
25|$|Although Columbia {{replaced}} {{it as the}} state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous as Eli Whitney's 1793 invention of the cotton gin sped the processing of the crop over 50 times. The development made <b>short-staple</b> cotton profitable and opened the upland Piedmont region to slave-based cotton plantations, previously restricted to the sea islands and Lowcountry. Britain's Industrial Revolution—initially built upon its textile industry—took up the extra production ravenously and it was swiftly Charleston's major export commodity. The Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building {{in the nation to}} be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. Branches of the First and Second Bank of the United States were also located in Charleston in 1800 and 1817.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the cotton gin in 1793 enabled the cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> cotton {{in a wide variety}} of mainland areas, leading in the 19th century to the development of large areas of the Deep South as cotton country. Tobacco was very labor-intensive, as was rice cultivation. In South Carolina in 1720, about 65% of the population consisted of enslaved people. Planters (defined by historians in the Upper South as those who held 20 enslaved people or more) used enslaved workers to cultivate commodity crops. They also worked in the artisanal trades on large plantations and in many southern port cities. Backwoods subsistence farmers, the later wave of settlers in the 18th century who settled along the Appalachian Mountains and backcountry, seldom held enslaved people.|$|E
40|$|This (revised) study {{seeks to}} examine the rise, expansion, and {{ultimate}} decline of the Italian wool-based textile industries {{over a period of}} six centuries (from ca. 1100 to ca. 1730). An international trade model combining transaction costs and comparative advantage is employed to explain the changing fortunes of the Italian cloth industries over these six centuries, in competition with their major northern rivals, in the Low Countries and England, who fought for market dominance both within Europe and abroad, in the Islamic world, in particular the MamlÅ«k and then Ottoman domains in the Levant (eastern Mediterranean). The transaction costs model is used to explain in particular which branches of this textile industry fared better and which fared worse during the Commercial Revolution era (ca. 1100 -ca. 1320), the so-called Great Depression era (ca. 1320 -ca. 1460), the ensuing economic recovery and Price Revolution era (ca. 1460 -ca. 1620), the General Crisis of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (ca. 1620 -ca. 1740), to the eve of the Industrial Revolution era. One of the major errors in the literature is the failure to distinguish between the two main branches of the wool-based cloth industries, the technology of their industrial production, their relative prices, and markets, and the impact of transaction costs in international trade. For much of this era, the leading branch was the luxury-oriented woollens industry (Old Draperies), based on very fine, <b>short-stapled</b> English and then Spanish merino wools, producing fulled, heavy-weight, and generally high priced cloths. In the earlier and later periods, the other branch prevailed (New Draperies) : the lighter-weight (unfulled), generally coarser and cheaper fabrics that were either full worsteds (cheap, coarse, long-stapled wools) or serges (hybrids with worsted warps and woollen wefts). The transition from a predominance of the lighter, worsted-style fabrics to the heavy-weight woollens, throughout western Europe, took place from the 1290 s, with a rapid rise in transaction costs that were the direct and indirect result of a spreading stain of international warfare, especially injurious to overland trade routes, combined with a drastic fall in population, that engulfed most of Europe and the Mediterranean basin until the 1460 s. That rise in transportation and transaction costs (determined by market scale economies) set a cost-price floor below which international trade in cheaper textiles became unprofitable: so much so that most West European wool-based industries re-oriented their production towards luxury markets, with far higher prices sustained by price-making monopolistic competition better able to withstand the rise of such costs, an impossible solution for those marketing cheap textiles as price-takers in Mediterranean markets. Such problems were less severe for the Italian industries, whose markets were chiefly in the Mediterranean; and thus the transition to luxury production was far less complete than in the north. The comparative advantage model is based on the price that woollen-cloth producers in both the Low Countries and Italy had to pay in that luxury re-orientation: a total dependence on the finest English wools as the prime component of luxury quality. From the late 1330 s, English monarchs took advantage of that dependence by imposing exorbitant taxes on wool-exports, with even higher taxes imposed on Italian merchants, ultimately depriving them of almost all such wools by the early fifteenth century. At the same time, English clothiers were able to weave luxury-quality cloths from the very same wools, but free of any such taxes, giving them an almost insuperable cost advantage over all foreign woollen manufacturers. But England's comparative advantage in its wool supply, though finally giving them mastery of northern markets for luxury woollens, was undermined, during the later fifteenth, early sixteenth century, by the development of fine but much cheaper merino wools in Spain, which Italians could acquire with lower transport costs. The other change undermining the supremacy of English and other woollens industry was the sharp fall in transaction costs by the late fifteenth, early sixteenth centuries: with the decline in warfare, the recovery and growth of population, and with technological advances in both ocean and land transport, especially the latter with a major transition in long-distance trade from maritime to overland continental routes. Along with that decline in costs came a revival and expansion of the lighter, cheaper textile industries, though chiefly in the Low Countries and England, more so than in Italy, despite the continued predominance of Mediterranean markets. For woollens, the Italian industries, especially the Venetian, gained the comparative advantage in wools: with much cheaper access to (now more expensive) Spanish merinos. But in the Mediterranean and especially Ottoman markets the English finally gained supremacy over both the Florentine and Venetian woollens industries, by the later seventeenth century, from a new comparative advantage, in capital formation: from superior business organization (the new joint stock companies) and naval power (large, heavily gunned, swift carracks). The so-called General Crisis era of the later seventeenth century had again favoured maritime routes, and thus sea-power, over land routes. At the same time the Tudor-Stuart enclosure movements, in transforming English sheep [...] from small sheep with fine <b>short-stapled</b> to larger (meatier) sheep with coarser, long-stapled fleeces, gave England's worsted-style New Draperies a comparative advantage in wool supplies over all its continental rivals, including the Italian; and by the 1730 s, both branches of the Italian wool-based textile industries had succumbed to foreign competition, and become moribund. wools; woollens; worsteds; serges; rascie; dyestuffs; scarlets; transaction costs; comparative advantage; Florence; Tuscany; Lombardy; Venetia; Venice; Ottoman Empire; Old Draperies; New Draperies; Spain; merino wools; Enclosures; Levant Company...|$|R
25|$|Slater {{constructed}} a new mill in 1793 {{for the sole}} purpose of textile manufacture under the name Almy, Brown & Slater, as he was now partners with Almy and Brown. It was a 72-spindle mill; the patenting of Eli Whitney's cotton gin in 1794 reduced the labor in processing cotton. It also enabled profitable cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, which could be grown in the interior uplands, resulting in a dramatic expansion of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South in the antebellum years. The New England mills and their labor force of free men depended on southern cotton, which was based on slave labor. Slater also brought the Sunday School system from his native England to his textile factory at Pawtucket.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{the state had}} voted to reopen its ports to {{importing}} slaves from Africa; this decision was highly controversial and opposed by many planters in the Lowcountry, who feared the disruptive influence of new Africans on their slaves. Planters in Upland areas were developing new plantations of <b>short-staple</b> cotton and needed workers, so the state approved the trade. The profitability of this type cotton had been {{made possible by the}} invention of the cotton gin. From 1804 to 1808, Charleston merchants imported some 75,000 slaves, more than were brought to South Carolina in the 75 years before the Revolution. Some of these slaves were sold to the Uplands and other areas, but many of the new Africans were held in Charleston and on nearby Lowcountry plantations.|$|E
25|$|Settlers, {{mostly from}} Georgia and the Carolinas, flooded into the fertile land that the Creeks {{had been forced}} to give up. With its {{strategic}} location at the river confluence, Wetumpka quickly became an important center of agricultural trade. The city was formally incorporated in 1834. Cotton was the commodity crop of the new state of Alabama, with cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> cotton in the upland areas made possible by Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, which reduced the labor of processing. From the scattered fields and large plantations worked by slave labor in the interior, cotton was carted overland to Wetumpka. Located at the fall line of the Coosa River, the port shipped out cotton bales by steamboats which went downriver to the markets at Mobile for sale.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the population in South Carolina was black, with concentrations in the plantation areas of the Low Country: by 1860 the population of the state was 703,620, with 57 percent or slightly more than 402,000 classified as enslaved African Americans. Free blacks numbered slightly less than 10,000. A concentration of free people of color lived in Charleston, where they formed an elite racial caste of people who had more skills and education than most blacks. Unlike Virginia, where most of the larger plantations and slaves were concentrated {{in the eastern part of}} the state, in South Carolina plantations and slaves became common throughout much of the state. After 1794, Eli Whitney's cotton gin allowed cotton plantations for <b>short-staple</b> cotton to be widely developed in the Piedmont area, which became known as the Black Belt.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{economic}} {{enterprise of}} the county was rice planting, particularly along the Satilla River. Sea Island cotton was grown on Cumberland Island, and <b>short-staple</b> cotton was grown on the mainland along with sugar cane. Various forest products including turpentine and timber were produced, mainly for consumption in the naval industry and the West Indies. Camden County {{also served as a}} hub of backcountry trade with American settlers and various Indian groups, and as a shipyard and shipping center centered around the town of St. Marys. The land in Camden County was owned by fewer than 300 people throughout the colonial and antebellum eras. Most of the white population worked in trades or as tenant farmers, while nearly all black residents were slaves. Until the 1840s (and increasingly strict black codes), Camden County had a small population of free black workers, mainly involved in day labor or maritime industry.|$|E
25|$|After {{invention}} of the cotton gin made profitable the processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, {{there was a major}} push by whites to develop lands in the Deep South for such cultivation. This greatly increased the demand for slave labor, especially after the US ended the legal Atlantic slave trade in 1808. The rate of manumission fell sharply in southern states. Through the domestic slave trade, some one million slaves were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the following years. Most southern states tightened restrictions on manumission, effectively ending it. They enacted laws requiring legislative approval for each act of manumission, making it so difficult that few slaveholders pursued this, even for their own mixed-race children. At the same time African Americans attempted to resist racialized definitions of freedom. Petitions for freedom suits were {{one of the most powerful}} strategies to redefine racial categories, claim freedom, and reconstitute families in the face of enslavement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} decades, the colony {{cultivated}} cotton on plantations {{of the sea}} islands and Low Country, along with rice, indigo and some tobacco as commodity crops, all worked by African slaves, most from West Africa. In the 19th century, invention of the cotton gin enabled profitable processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, which grew better in the Piedmont than did long-staple cotton. The hilly upland areas, where landowners were generally subsistence farmers with few slaves, were much poorer; a regional conflict between the coastal and inland areas developed in the political system, long dominated by the Low Country planters. With outspoken leaders such as John C. Calhoun, the state vied with Virginia as the dominant political and social force in the South. It fought federal tariffs in the 1830s and demanded that its rights to practice slavery be recognized in newly established territories. With the 1860 election of Republicans under Abraham Lincoln, who vowed to prevent slavery's expansion, the voters demanded secession. In December 1860, the state seceded from the Union; in February 1861, it joined the new Confederate States of America.|$|E
2500|$|Augusta {{developed}} {{rapidly as}} a market town as the Black Belt in the Piedmont {{was developed for}} cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, {{with hundreds of thousands}} of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade. Many of the slaves were brought from the Lowcountry, where their Gullah culture had developed on the large Sea Island cotton and rice plantations ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{during the}} 1820s and 1830s the Creek, Cherokee, and {{virtually}} all the southeastern Indians were removed to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The Cherokee removal is remembered as the Trail of Tears. [...] The Cherokee capital city of New Echota was located on the headwater tributaries of the Coosa River, in Georgia, until the tribe's removal. The Creek and Choctaw removals were similar to the Cherokee Trail of Tears. After the removals, the Coosa River valley and the southeast in general was wide open for American settlers. The cotton gin made <b>short-staple</b> cotton profitable to process, {{and it was a}} new cotton hybrid that could be grown in the upland regions; large-scale migrations known as [...] "Alabama Fever" [...] filled Alabama with new settlers.|$|E
2500|$|The growing {{international}} {{demand for}} cotton led many plantation owners further west {{in search of}} suitable land. In addition, {{the invention of the}} cotton gin in 1793 enabled profitable processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the War of 1812, fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it. As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prohibition}} of the African slave-trade after 1807 limited {{the supply of}} slaves in the United States. [...] Slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women {{as part of their}} productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. The invention of the cotton gin enabled expanded cultivation in the uplands of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the Black Belt. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and an internal slave market expanded. At the same time, the Upper South had an excess supply of slaves because of a shift to mixed crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. During this time period, the terms [...] "breeding slaves", [...] "child bearing women", [...] "breeding period", and [...] "too old to breed" [...] became familiar.|$|E
50|$|Settled {{first because}} of its coastal access, the Lowcountry had the greater population. It had {{achieved}} early economic dominance because of wealth derived from the cultivation of both rice and long-staple cotton, a major crop. This was easier to process by hand than <b>short-staple</b> cotton. In the Upcountry's soil, only <b>short-staple</b> cotton could be cultivated. It was extremely labor-intensive to process by hand.|$|E
50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, colonists used enslaved African Americans to clear land, {{cultivate}} plantations, and process cotton in this area. Long-staple cotton would not grow in this area and <b>short-staple</b> cotton required much labor to process. In 1793, Mount Pleasant, a cotton plantation east of Washington, was the site where Eli Whitney first perfected his revolutionary invention, the cotton gin. It allowed mechanization of processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton, making its cultivation profitable in the upland areas. As a result, there was a dramatic increase in the development of new cotton plantations throughout the Deep South to cultivate <b>short-staple</b> cotton. Settlers increased pressure on the federal government to remove Native Americans, including the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830.|$|E
5000|$|Woolen is a soft, <b>short-staple,</b> {{carded wool}} yarn {{typically}} used for knitting. [...] In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently {{combined with a}} worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.|$|E
50|$|Although {{planters}} {{tried to}} grow {{it on the}} uplands of Georgia, the quality was inferior, {{and it was too}} expensive to process. The invention of the cotton gin {{by the end of the}} 18th century utterly changed the production of cotton as a commodity crop. It made processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton profitable. This cotton, known as upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), could be grown successfully in the interior uplands. <b>Short-staple</b> cotton became the prime commodity crop of the developing Deep South, and King Cotton was the basis of southern wealth in the antebellum years. This cotton in the early 21st century represents about 95% of U.S. production.|$|E
50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, the districts and {{counties}} were developed chiefly as cotton plantations for <b>short-staple</b> cotton. This development followed {{the invention of}} the cotton gin in the late eighteenth century, which made the processing of <b>short-staple</b> cotton profitable. The county became a center of labor by black slaves on the plantations, who were transported from coastal areas and the Upper South to cultivate and process cotton. Those brought from the coastal areas were likely of the Gullah culture and language. The enslaved African Americans greatly outnumbered the white planters and non-slaveholding whites. Reflecting the patterns of nineteenth-century settlement, the area is still chiefly agricultural and majority-African American in population.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} {{developed}} for the cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> cotton after Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in 1793, which made processing {{of this type of}} cotton profitable. Previously it was considered too labor-intensive. <b>Short-staple</b> cotton was widely cultivated on plantations in upland areas throughout the Deep South, through an interior area that became known as the Black Belt. The increased demand for slave labor resulted in the forced migration of more than one million African-American slaves into the area through sales in the domestic slave market. By the time of the Civil War, the county's population was majority black and majority slave.|$|E
50|$|Bulloch also {{developed}} a plantation in the uplands, where his workers cultivated and processed <b>short-staple</b> cotton, the chief commodity crop. This cotton had been made profitable by invention of the cotton gin, and was planted throughout the piedmont.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{this area}} was {{developed}} for the cultivation of <b>short-staple</b> cotton in the antebellum era after {{the invention of the}} cotton gin. The area was also a center of lumbering and turpentine production in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The city of Bennettsville {{was founded}} in 1819 on the Great Pee Dee River and named after Thomas Bennett, Jr., then {{governor}} of South Carolina.

Many {{were brought to the}} upland area from the Lowcountry, carrying their Gullah culture with them. Others were transported from the Upper South by slave traders. This shift to cotton cultivation in the uplands was based {{on the development of the}} cotton gin, which made <b>short-staple</b> cotton, cotton with relatively short fibers, profitable. The advent of the gin in turn led to development of large cotton plantations throughout the Deep South.|$|E
