40|$|A {{new system}} for the {{measurment}} of turbulent fluxes is developed. This system {{will be used in}} the Sino-Japan Cooperative Program on Atmosphere-Land Surface Process HEIFE. The concept of this system is to perform turbulent fluxes observation without difficult maintenance or special skill. An inclinometer is accepted to correct the incliment of the observing sensor. A computing recorder enables automatic data recording and analyzing. A new infrared hygrometer (AH- 300) is also developed. Test observation of this new hygrometer has proved that it has enough response upto 10 Hz. It can have enough frequency range for the turbulent flux measurment when it is used with a humicap and a Pt resistant thermometer equipped to AH- 300 and <b>sonic</b> <b>thermometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Measurements {{were made}} of the energy loss in a superconducting wire coil {{subjected}} to an axial magnetic field consisting of a ripple field superimposed on a steady field. The loss was measured calorimetrically using a <b>sonic</b> <b>thermometer</b> consisting of a resonance tube filled with helium gas in thermal contact with the superconducting wire under test. An adiabatic calorimeter and an almost isothermal calorimeter were constructed to measure the losses and their respective results were compared. The critical state theory of Kim, Hempstead and Strnad predicts the experimentally determined loss characteristics. The loss-vs-steady field characteristic was measured for Niobium, 25 wt percent Zirconium, 10 MIL wire. General agreement with Kim's theory was found with a maximum loss occurring at 254, 000 ampere-turns per meter, such loss falling to a lower and constant value at fields above 795, 000 ampere-turns per meter...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sonic</b> <b>thermometer</b> is a {{specialized}} application of well-known sonic anemometer technology. Adaptations {{have been made}} to the circuit, including the addition of supporting sensors, which enable its use in the high-altitude environment and in non-air gas mixtures. There is a need to measure gas temperatures inside and outside of superpressure balloons that are flown at high altitudes. These measurements will allow the performance of the balloon to be modeled more accurately, leading to better flight performance. Small thermistors (solid-state temperature sensors) have been used for this general purpose, and for temperature measurements on radiosondes. A disadvantage to thermistors and other physical (as distinct from sonic) temperature sensors is that they are subject to solar heating errors when they are exposed to the Sun, and this leads to issues with their use in a very high-altitude environmen...|$|E
40|$|A system {{designed}} to measure the vegetation response to environment was constructed {{on the basis of}} the eddy correlation method. It consisted of two sets of a small rapid response sensors; three dimensional <b>sonic</b> anemometer <b>thermometers</b> and infrared CO 2 -humidity fluctuation meters,and a personal computer for data acquisition. Field tests of the system were made over a barley field in April and May, 1990. The turbulent fluxes obtained by two sets of flux measuring system mounted at the same height were in fair agreement. The turbulent fluxes(momentum,sensible heat,latent heat and carbon dioxide) measured at two height wihtin and above plant cannopies and their differences showed realistic diurnal variations. The direction and magnitude of each flux varied depending on the srength or distribution of source and sink within plant canopies. These findings confirmed that this measureing system is promising for quantitative estimate of vegetation response such as transpiration, photosynthesis and respiration in certain canopy layers to environmental variations. 植物群落内外の二高度で運動量、顕熱、炭酸ガス、水蒸気量の乱流輸送量を同時に測定し、二高度間の輸送量の収束、発散量を評価できる群落生物環境反応測定装置の概要とオオムギ群落における試験観測の結果について報告した。以下に得られた結果の主なものを列挙する。 1 ）群落上の同一高度に二組の乱流輸送測定機器を設置し、乱流輸送量の比較観測を行った。それぞれの装置で得られた運動量、顕熱、潜熱などの輸送量の間には系統だった差異のないことが示された。 2 ）オオムギ群落内外に機器を設置して、二高度で乱流輸送量を測定し、その収束量や発散量の経時変化も調べた。得られた結果は植被層上部の能動層の存在など群落で期待される定性的な特性と一致した...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{velocity}} and temperature fluctuations were observed at Syowa Station {{by means of}} an ultra <b>sonic</b> anemometer <b>thermometer</b> during JARE 12 (1971 - 72). In this paper the power spectra and the probability density distribution are mainly studied. The behaviour of the power spectra in changing stability is consistent with the precedent observations. The power spectra pattern of vertical wind component is not always similar to the temperature spectra. Especially in the high frequency range the decrease of power density with frequency in vertical wind spectra is steeper than that in temperature spectra. Moreover, some peaks are seen at the frequency higher than the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. The cause of this phenomenon has not been ascertained yet. The probability density distributions of the wind and temperature fluctuations are similar to the Gaussian distribution, and the joint distributions of them also may be approximated by the Gaussian distribution. The presumed semi-normal joint probability distribution, which is used for the closed system of the correlation tensor equations, has been verified...|$|R
40|$|A fast-response {{temperature}} sensor for measuring atmospheric temperature was constructed and is described. The sensor {{was based on}} the thermocouple principle, connected to a thermocouple conditioner (AD 595) : the cold junction was compensated via an electrical reference and the signal amplified. This reference compensation was built into the sensor itself. The time constant of the thermocouple was decreased by rolling out a circular wire. The mean temperatures measured by the sensor were compared with those measured by an accurately calibrated Pt 100 resistance thermometer. The agreement between both sensors for outdoor measurements gave a standard error of estimate of 0. 20 K. The fast outdoor temperature excursions around the running mean, measured by the sensor, were compared with those measured by a fast-response <b>sonic</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The agreement of the temperature variances between both sensors was better than 2 % (standard error of estimate 0. 05 K) and was dependent on measuring height and mean windspeed. The 3 dB point of the instrument was about 2 Hz...|$|E
