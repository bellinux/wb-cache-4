2500|$|The Pike first flew on 14 March 1927, with Frank Courtney at the {{controls}} and having made a few earlier hops at Parnall's Yate factory airfield. [...] From there {{it went to the}} MAEE at Felixstowe for trials on water. [...] The Naval test pilots who flew it there were not enthusiastic about its handling, described as sluggish, nor about its cockpit which they found cold and draughty. [...] Though the view over the nose was good, [...] rearwards and downwards it was not. [...] They also commented that the large separation between pilot's and gunner's cockpits made communication difficult. [...] Plans to build a second Pike were abandoned when the Air Ministry rejected both it and its competitor, the Sturgeon as not meeting the <b>specification</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Article 23 Directive 2004 / 18 {{requires}} that procuring entities formulate its standards ‘sufficiently precise’. This implies a <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> for government contracts. The question {{that remains is}} what {{the scope of the}} <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> is. In other words, how precise should a standard be formulated. The scope of the <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> should be interpreted {{in the light of the}} general principles of EC law and more particular Directive 2004 / 18. All products and services should be granted access to the common market and therefore accepted by the contract documents. Consequently, standards cannot be too specific as this would exclude a lot of products and services. For this article we analysed our experiences with article 23 Directive 2004 / 18 and its corresponding case law...|$|R
2500|$|The {{choice of}} Hitachi units, which would see little final {{manufacturing}} in the UK over the foreign-owned but domestically manufactured Bombardier option, was controversial, {{particularly in the}} area that would have manufactured them, leading to a campaign to reverse the decision. It was, however, economics which became a sticking point with the weight of the design creeping up (though some accused the Dft of producing impossible <b>specification</b> <b>requirements)</b> and reportedly difficult negotiations over the final unit price and production balance between the different power options. The inability or reluctance of the financial markets to provide the necessary capital was the final straw, leading to the announcement in February 2010 of a three-month independent review into the value for money of the programme [...] and looking at alternative options such as life extension of existing IC125 stock.|$|E

40|$|Requirements {{engineering}} {{in the new}} millennium is facing an increasing diversity of computerised devices comprising an increasing diversity of interaction styles for an increasing diversity of user groups. Thus the incorporation of user interface requirements into software <b>requirements</b> <b>specifications</b> becomes more and more mandatory. Validating these <b>requirements</b> <b>specifications</b> with hand-made, throw-away prototypes is not only expensive, but also bears the danger that validation results are not accurately fed back into the <b>requirements</b> <b>specification.</b> In this paper, we propose an enhancement of the <b>requirements</b> <b>specification</b> method SCORES for an explicit capturing of user interface requirements. The advantages of the approach are threefold. First, the user interface <b>requirements</b> <b>specification</b> is UML-compliant and integrated into the functional <b>requirements</b> <b>specification.</b> Second, prototypes for validation purposes can semi-automatically be generated. Third, the model-based generation of prototypes allows for ‘round-trip prototyping’ such that manual changes of the prototype during the validation process are automatically fed back into the <b>requirements</b> <b>specification.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Test {{cases are}} built around <b>specifications</b> and <b>requirements,</b> i.e., what the {{application}} {{is supposed to}} do. Test cases are generally derived from external descriptions of the software, including <b>specifications,</b> <b>requirements</b> and design parameters. Although the tests used are primarily functional in nature, non-functional tests may also be used. The test designer selects both valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output, often {{with the help of}} an oracle or a previous result that is known to be good, without any knowledge of the test object's internal structure.|$|R
30|$|A way to {{validate}} a <b>requirements</b> <b>specification</b> should be shaped {{so that the}} users can validate the <b>requirements</b> <b>specification</b> sufficiently and intuitively because the users are not experts of a software development generally.
