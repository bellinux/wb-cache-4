50|$|Besides large plants, {{domestic}} waste-to-energy incinerators also exist. For example, {{the refuge}} de Sarenne has a domestic waste-to-energy plant. It {{is made by}} combining a wood-fired gasification boiler with a <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
30|$|Starting {{from the}} results of the {{previous}} work another system to convert the thermal energy into electrical one has been studied: the <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b> The goal is to compare the conversion capacity of the ORC plant with that of the <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the use of energy from the biogas. Energy from biogas can be used to produce electricity, heat or the {{combined}} production of electricity and heat. In this work we describe some of the technologies which are used to produce electricity and heat. Such as cogeneration units, gas Otto motors, diesel engines with flammable jet, <b>Stirling</b> <b>motors,</b> microgas turbines and fuel cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} in Stirling engine {{technology}} is {{embodied in the}} base engine now being developed at <b>Stirling</b> Thermal <b>Motors,</b> Inc. This is a versatile energy conversion unit suitable for many different applications and heat sources. The base engine, rated 40 kW at 2800 RPM, is a four-cylinder, double-acting variable displacement Stirling engine with pressurized crankcase and rotating shaft seal. Remote-heating technology is incorporated with a stacked-heat-exchanger configuration and a liquid metal heat pipe connected to a distinctly separate combustor or other heat source. High efficiency {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions, long life, low manufacturing cost and low material cost are specifically emphasized. The base engine, its design philosophy and approach, its projected performance, and some of its more attractive applications are described...|$|R
40|$|The STM 4 - 120 Stirling engine, {{currently}} under development at <b>Stirling</b> Thermal <b>Motors,</b> Inc., is a 40 kW variable stroke engine with indirect heating using a sodium heat pipe. The engine is functionally separated into an application independent Energy Conversion Unit (ECU) {{consisting of the}} Stirling cycle and drive heated by condensing sodium and the application dependent External Heating System (EHS), designed to supply the ECU with sodium vapor heated by the particular energy source, connected by tubes with mechanical couplings. This paper describes an External Heating System for the STM 4 - 120 ECU designed for the combustion of liquid fuel, comprised of a recuperative preheater, a combustion chamber, and a heat exchanger/evaporator where heat is transferred from the flue gas to the sodium causing it to evaporate. The design concept and projected performance are described and discussed...|$|R
30|$|Two {{different}} {{systems have been}} selected to convert the thermal power into electrical one: an organic Rankine cycle power plant and a <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
30|$|In the {{evaluation}} of the performance of the <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor,</b> the working fluid is the air. The maximum volume of the gas is 150  l and a minimum one is 50  l.|$|E
30|$|The net {{electrical}} power is 121  kW with an ORC power plant and 152  kW with a <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b> The Stirling engine has an efficiency greater than 25  % {{compared to a}} system ORC.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} data of experimental Stirling engines are considered along {{with questions of}} exhaust-gas composition, engine noise, engine volume and weight, engine control, and the engine-starting process. The Stirling engine can use practically any liquid or gaseous fuel for its operation. It is found that technically a use of the <b>Stirling</b> engine in <b>motor</b> vehicles is feasible. Economic questions related to an introduction of the Stirling engine are discussed along with possible new developments which could improve the economic situation {{in favor of a}} use of Stirling engine...|$|R
40|$|Stirling-cycle engines {{have been}} {{identified}} as a promising technology for the conversion of concentrated solar energy into usable electrical power. A 25 kW electric system takes advantage of existing Stirling-cycle engines and existing parabolic concentrator designs. In previous work, the concentrated sunlight impinged directly on the heater head tubes of the <b>Stirling</b> Thermal <b>Motors</b> (STM) 4 - 120 engine. A Sandia-designed felt-metal-wick heat pipe receiver was fitted to the STM 4 - 120 engine for on-sun testing on Sandia`s Test Bed Solar Concentrator. The heat pipe uses sodium metal as an intermediate two-phase heat transfer fluid. The receiver replaces the directly-illuminated heater head previously tested. The heat pipe receiver provides heat isothermally to the engine, and the heater head tube length is reduced, both resulting in improved engine performance. The receiver also has less thermal losses than the tube receiver. The heat pipe receiver design is based on Sandia`s second-generation felt-wick heat pipe receiver. This paper presents the interface design, and compares the heat pipe/engine test results to those of the directly-illuminated receiver/engine package...|$|R
40|$|This paper treats of a {{numerical}} dynamic model of Stirling engine crank mechanism. The model {{is included in}} the complex model of combined heat and power unit. The unit is composed of the Stirling engine and of attached threephase synchronous generator. This generator should start the <b>Stirling</b> engine in <b>motor</b> mode as well. It is necessary to combine the crank shaft dynamic model and the complete thermal model of Stirling engine for simulations and analyses of engine run. Our aim is to create a dynamics model which takes into account the parameters of crankshaft, piston rods, pistons, and attached generator. For unit working, the electro-mechanical behaviour of generator is also important. That is why we experimentally verified the parameters of generator. The measured characteristics are used in a complex model of heat and power unit. Moreover, it is also possible to determine the Stirling engine torque by the help of these electro-mechanical characteristics. These values can be used e. g. for determination of optimal engine working point or for unit control...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is the {{analysis}} of the power production of the WBHX in time and the comparison between two different conversion systems of the thermal energy into electrical one: the ORC plant and the <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
40|$|Before {{conversion}} to solar operation {{to serve as}} a solar receiver test bed a Stirling Power System V 160 F natural gas-fired co-generation <b>stirling</b> <b>motor</b> was tested. The total natural gas to electric energy conversion efficiency was measured to be 23 % above full power, 20 % efficiency was achieved down to 1 / 3 power...|$|E
30|$|According to Kolin et al. (2000) when {{compared}} to the classic Clausius–Rankine cycle, mostly used in the present geothermal plants, Stirling cycle offers many theoretical and practical advantages. From thermodynamic point of view, Stirling cycle is equivalent to the optimal Carnot cycle, having the highest possible efficiency. The thermodynamic <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor</b> model follows the indications of Lloyd (2009).|$|E
40|$|The {{campaign}} {{to measure the}} optical and thermodynamic efficiency of the system will be presented. The optical quality was determined with a classical flux-mapping using a lambertian target and a CCD camera system, which also leads to the energy input to the PCU. For the thermodynamic analysis all the data necessary for a complete energy balance around the Stirling engine, i. e. efficiency of the <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor,</b> the cavity and the receiver {{as well as the}} parasitic losses were measured. Such a detailed performance analysis helps to quantify all significant losses of the system and to identify the most rewarding future improvements...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{generation}} of electrical and useful thermal energy (hot, cold, or both) {{is an obvious}} way to optimize the consumed energy efficiency. In the last decade, cogeneration has had, in a world level, a big deployment, thanks {{to the use of}} gas and the fact of taking advantage of biomass and other waste products energetically valuable. However, there are possibilities to extend cogeneration applications by means of new technologies of multiple {{generation of}}: electrical power, heat, cold, desalination and/or regeneration of water and chemical products in general. The priority performances about this context are being centered in the development and researching of a distinguished group of electrical micro-generation technologies, which energetic benefits highlight because of a high global index of efficiency. In this group of advanced technologies Fuel Cells, <b>Stirling</b> <b>Motor</b> and Gas Microturbines are included...|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} geothermal {{power plants}} use the reinjection wells mostly {{to avoid the}} depletion of the geothermal reservoir gathering in the underground of the produced brine. Nevertheless, reinjection operations entail high economic costs and some risks. An alternative is the extraction of the heat without geothermal fluids production, the wellbore heat exchanger. The goal of the present paper is {{the analysis of the}} power production of the wellbore heat exchanger (WBHX) in time and the comparison between two different conversion systems of the thermal energy into electrical: the organic ranking cycle (ORC) plant and the <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor.</b> The selected case study is the oil field of Villafortuna Trecate, a medium enthalpy geothermal resource. The simulation results show a substantial decrease of the wellhead temperature in the first 6  months. After 1  year, the thermal power extracted with the WBHX is greater than 1.3  MW. The design parameters are 20  m 3 /h for the flow rate, outlet temperature 100.38  °C and the inlet temperature is 40  °C. The R-C 318 has been selected as working fluid in the ORC plant: the net electrical power is 121  kW. The air is the working fluid in the Stirling motor: the evaluated net electrical power is 152  kW. The Stirling engine has an efficiency greater than 41  % compared to a system ORC.|$|E
40|$|The {{excess heat}} of a {{photovoltaic}} concentrator cell {{can be used to}} drive a thermal power engine (as e. g. a <b>Stirling</b> <b>motor)</b> such that the thermal engine is an active cooling device for the solar cell. The efficiency of the solar cell decreases with increasing temperature T, whereas the efficiency of the thermal engine increases with T. The combined efficiency of a solar cell coupled to a thermal engine, Eta, was calculated {{as a function of the}} bandgap energy of the solar cell, Eg, and of T. The efficiency of the thermal engine was assumed to be one half of that of a Carnot engine. For solar cells the present state of the art is taken into consideration. The maximum of the combined efficiency is found in the range of Eg = 1. 3 to 2 eV depending on T. The efficiency lies between 35 and 40 % for a concentration factor of sunlight C = 1000. For GaAs solar cells (Eg = 1. 42 eV) a broad maximum of the combined efficiency is found at T between 200 and 500 degree C with eta = 39 % for C = 1000. I n the temperature range around 250 degree C the solar cell and the thermal engine contribute each about half to the total efficiency...|$|E
