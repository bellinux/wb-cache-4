50|$|In those extreme situations, {{in which}} kidney stones are {{too large to}} pass on their own, {{patients}} may seek removal. Most of these treatments involving kidney <b>stone</b> <b>removal</b> are done by a urologist; a physician who specializes in the organs of the Urinary system. A common way of removal is shock wave lithotripsy, in which the urologist will shock the kidney stone into smaller pieces via laser, allowing these pieces to further pass through the urine on their own, as a normal case of kidney stones. Larger, more serious cases may demand Cystoscopy, Ureteroscopy, or Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy, in which the doctor will use a viewing tool or camera to locate the stone, {{and based on the}} size or situation, may either chose to continue with surgical removal, or use the shock wave lithotripsy treatment.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the ultrastructural {{features of the}} urinary stonesremoved with endoscopic stone surgery, using micro computed tomography(micro-CT). Materials and Methods: Patients who had endoscopic surgery for renalor ureteral <b>stones</b> <b>removal</b> were included in this study. After surgery, thestones were classified into three groups and investigated with Skyscan 1174 micro-CT. Group I underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) withultrasonic lithotripsy; group II had ureteroscopic stone surgery (USS) withpneumatic lithotripsy; and group III (the control group) had stone removalwith USS or PNL without lithotripsy. Stone homogeneity, voids, and theinternal structure of the stones were evaluated. Chi-square test was used to{{evaluate the}} difference statistically.

5000|$|Cystinurics {{can also}} {{experience}} chronic pain in one, or both, kidneys {{due to the}} scars that the jagged edges of the stones can leave or damage from multiple <b>stone</b> <b>removal</b> surgeries. This can leave a cystinuric in constant pain which often requires medical intervention, such as long-term use of analgesics or surgical procedures, including T11, T12 or T13 nerve blocks (although, these procedures are often not successful, they can provide some relief). Aside from the chronic pain, a cystinuric will often have severe breakthrough pain from passing stones. People with cystinuria pass stones monthly, weekly, or daily, and need ongoing care.

The therapeutic effects of mineral waters are determined by their anion and cation content, the presence of undissociated salts and also by the presence of oligoelements. Additionally, the effects of a mineral waters are connected with physical constants: osmotic pressure and temperature. Many researches showed activity of the mineral waters on intestinal autonomic nerves and plexus (CIA), motility, exocrine, endocrine and paracrine digestive secretions and therapeutic properties belonging to evidence based medicine. Mud and bath therapy are effective in treatment of osteoartrhitis. During and after mud-therapy effects on diencephalic-pituitary-adrenal axis were displayed, producing increase of endogenous opioids and cortisol. Clinical controlled trials showed significant improvement of symptoms as pain and stiffness.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} endoscopic papillary balloon intermittent dilatation (EPBID) and endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) {{in the treatment of}} common bile duct stones. METHODS: From March 2011 to May 2012, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed in 560 patients, 262 with common bile duct stones. A total of 206 patients with common bile duct stones were enrolled in the study and randomized to receive either EPBID with a 10 - 12 mm dilated balloon or EST (103 patients in each group). For both groups a conventional reticular basket or balloon was used to remove the stones. After the procedure, routine endoscopic nasobiliary drainage was performed. RESULTS: First-time <b>stone</b> <b>removal</b> was successfully performed in 94 patients in the EPBID group (91. 3 %) and 75 patients in the EST group (72. 8 %).

40|$|Introduction: Taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDC), a new natural {{hydrophilic}} bile salt, dissolves human cholesterol gallstones {{in vitro}} {{and may be}} effective as a litholytic agent in vivo. We thus, investigated in man the effects of short-term oral administration of THDC on lipid composition and physical-chemical features of bile. Methods: Three patients with a nasobiliary drainage (positioned after sphincterotomy for bile duct <b>stones</b> <b>removal)</b> were given 3 g of THDC (1 g every 12 h). At {{time of the study}} patients had an intact entero-hepatic circulation and minimal signs of cholestasis. Bile was collected before each THDC administration, the last sample being obtained 14 h after the final THDC dose. All specimens were analyzed for individual bile salts (HPLC) and lipids. Biliary lipid carriers were separated by gel-chromatography on Superose- 6 and analyzed by quasielastic light scattering (QLS) and electron microscopy (EM). Results: biliary THDC concentration represented 30. 3, 27. 2 and 29. 2 % of total bile salts, respectively. Lecithin and cholesterol concentration in bile did not change significantly during the study. In all bile lipids were almost exclusively eluted in a single gel-chromatographic peak, with an average molecular weight between 20 and 100 kDa QLS analysis of THDC-rich biles, demonstrated an average hydrodynamic diameter of this lipid-carrier of 300 nm. In THDC-free biles fractionated using the same conditions, the predominant lipid-carrier had an average hydrodynamic diameter of 250 nm. This difference in size was confirmed at EM. Conclusions: THDC is efficiently secreted in human bile, without causing changes in the concentration of biliary lipids. The latter, however, are assembled in structures larger than those found in THDC-free biles. The size and spherical appearance of these aggregates are consistent with those of large unilamellar vesicles or multilamellar structures...|$|R

Treatment has dramatically changed in the past 20 years, shifting from resection of the salivary gland towards a minimally invasive gland sparing approach. Including sialoendoscopy, shock wave lithotripsy, interventional radiology, sialoendoscopy assisted "combined approaches" (trans-oral <b>removal</b> of submandibular <b>stones</b> and external <b>removal</b> of parotid calculi) and sialoendoscopy assisted stenosis management. These are all recently validated minimally invasive therapeutic modalities. When appropriately combined, a surgical adenectomy can be avoided in up to 95 % of obstructive sialadenitis cases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the effectiveness of}} ureteroscopy (URS) performed with the smallest caliber (4. 5 F) semirigid ureteroscope in children younger than 3 years. Materials and methods: URS was performed with a 4. 5 F semirigid ureteroscope (Mini-URS). The operative outcomes of 16 children [7 females, 9 males; mean age 30. 5 months (range 10 - 36 months) ] who underwent URS in our clinics were evaluated retrospectively. Results: The mean stone diameter was 5. 1 mm (range 3 - 15 mm). A Holmium: YAG laser lithotripter was used. Double J stents were inserted in 3 patients, while ureteral catheterization was performed in 6. In 7 patients, {{we were unable to}} insert a double J stent. At {{the end of the first}} postoperative week, 13 (84 %) patients were completely stone-free. Double J stents were inserted in two patients because of poor endoscopic visualization and inadequate stone fragmentation. In these patients repeat URS was performed to retrieve residual <b>stones</b> during <b>removal</b> of the double J stents. After 1 month, 15 (93. 75 %) patients were stone-free. No perioperative or early postoperative complication was observed in any patient. Conclusion: URS performed with a 4. 5 F semirigid ureteroscope is an ideal alternative for retrieving ureteral stones, with lower complication rates, faster ureteral engagement, and shorter operating times, even in very young patients...|$|R
