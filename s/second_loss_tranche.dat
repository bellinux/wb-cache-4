40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{transfer}} the loss rate risks in motor insurance to the capital market, we use the tranche technique to hedge the motor insurance risks. This paper illustrates AXA and their securitization of French motor insurance in 2005 as an example. Though this application is new, this transaction {{is based on a}} concept similar to CDOs. Tranches of bonds are constructed {{on the basis of the}} expected loss ratio from motor insurance policy holders' groups. As a consequence we develop motor loss rate bonds using the structure of synthetic CDOs. The coupon payments of each tranche depend on the level of the loss rates of the underlying motor insurance pool. We show the integral formulas for the <b>loss</b> <b>tranche</b> contract where the loss distribution is modelled with discounted compound Poisson process. Esscher transform is chosen for a risk adjusted measure change and Fourier inversion method is used to calculate the price of the motor claim rate securities. The pricing methods of the tranches are illustrated, and possible suggestions to improve the pricing method and the design of these new securities follow.

40|$|A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) is {{a credit}} {{derivative}} that creates fixed in-come securities, which {{are known as}} tranches. A CDO is called a synthetic CDO if the risky assets in the underlying pool are credit default swaps. An {{essential part of the}} valuation of a synthetic CDO tranche is how to estimate accurately and efficiently the expected value of the <b>tranche</b> <b>loss</b> function. It is known that the expected value of a func-tion of one random variable is completely determined by the distribution of the random variable and the function itself. A standard approach to estimate the expected value of a function of one random variable is to estimate the distribution of the underlying random variable, the pool loss in our case, and then to evaluate the expected value of the given function, the <b>tranche</b> <b>loss</b> function for our problem. Following this approach, we introduce three methods for estimating the distribution of the pool loss: a stable recursive method for computing the distribution of the pool loss exactly, an improved compound Poisson approximation method and a normal power approximation method for approximating the distribution of the pool loss. We also develop a new method that focuses on the <b>tranche</b> <b>loss</b> function directly. Th...|$|R

40|$|Market quotes of CDO tranches {{constitute}} a market view on correlation {{at different points}} in the portfolio capital structure and thus on the shape of the portfolio loss distribution. We investigate different calibrations of the CreditRisk+ model to examine its ability to reproduce iTraxx tranche quotes. Using initial model calibration, CreditRisk+ clearly underestimates senior <b>tranche</b> <b>losses.</b> While sensitivities to correlation are too low, by increasing PD volatility up to about 3 times of the default probability for each name CreditRisk+ produces tails which are fat enough to meet market <b>tranche</b> <b>losses.</b> Additionally, we find that, similar to the correlation skew in the large pool model, to meet market quotes for each tranche a different PD volatility vector has to be used. ⋆ Rachev gratefully acknowledges research support by grants from Division of Mathematical...|$|R
