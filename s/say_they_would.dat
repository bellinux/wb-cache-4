5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> attend to something and then let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E

Hydro power is the most popular energy source for large scale projects in Scotland, with an overwhelming majority (80%) being in favour.|$|E

The cellists <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> someday like to go on tour with both a classical and a contemporary orchestra. Their second studio album, entitled In2ition, came out early 2013, and featured new twists on a diverse range of classic tracks with a few surprise vocal and instrumental duet partners including Elton John, Lang Lang, Naya Rivera, Steve Vai, Sky Ferreira and Zucchero. The album was produced by Bob Ezrin.|$|E

Slemmer asked Chase {{how many men}} he had, whether he could take the fort by storm and how many men {{he thought he would}} lose. Chase replied that he could take the fort but supposed he might lose half of his force. Slemmer responded that he did not believe Chase was willing to make that sacrifice. Chase said that Slemmer must know that Florida could not permit the fort to be held and that an attack would start a civil war. Slemmer said he wanted to consult with the captains of two U.S. Navy vessels in the harbor. The next day, as the Navy vessels withdrew, Slemmer refused the demand for surrender of the fort. He refused a similar demand from Chase on January 18, 1861.|$|E
25|$|Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates {{taken by}} his Majesty Ship the Greyhound, Captain Solgard, were {{executed}} here. Some of them delivered {{what they had}} to say in writing, and most of them said something at the Place of Execution, advising all People, young ones especially, to take warning by their unhappy Fate, and to avoid the crimes that brought them to it. Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called Old Roger, and us'd to <b>say,</b> <b>They</b> <b>would</b> live and die under it.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E

500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} years of Spanish {{colonization}} of the Philippines (c. June 1582), Miguel de Loarca, one of Legaspi's men made a brief reference to one of these alliances of sovereign barangays, the Confederation of Madja-as. Writing a report about the people of the Philippines, Loarca was describing the various beliefs in the archipelago regarding the dead. After indicating where the Pintados <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> go when they die, he went on to note that [...] "... the [...] "Arayas" [...] (which is a certain alliance of villages), they say, go to a very high mountain in the island of Panay, called [...] "Mayas", where their god Sidapa [...] "possesses a very tall tree"...

Later in the night a newspaper reporter arrived and said the whole party was missing. It was only on Monday afternoon when the parents were gathered at the school that the news came that five children were dead. The father explained that the boy who survived was the smallest child in the party – maybe the others (two women leaders, four girls and one boy) had been huddling round him to protect him from the cold.

Analyst Michael Schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused [...] "more roads to open up in Congress for individual representatives to influence decisions". Norman Ornstein suggested that media prominence led to {{a greater emphasis on}} the negative and sensational side of Congress, and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage. Others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty-second soundbite. A report characterized Congress in 2013 as being unproductive, gridlocked, and [...] "setting records for futility". In October 2013, with Congress unable to compromise, the government was shut down for several weeks and risked a serious default on debt payments, causing 60% of the public to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> [...] "fire every member of Congress" [...] including their own representative. One report suggested Congress posed the [...] "biggest risk to the US economy" [...] because of its brinksmanship, [...] "down-to-the-wire budget and debt crises" [...] and [...] "indiscriminate spending cuts", resulting in slowed economic activity and keeping up to two million people unemployed. There has been increasing public dissatisfaction with Congress, with extremely low approval ratings which dropped to 5% in October 2013.|$|E
