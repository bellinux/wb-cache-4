5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of <b>snails</b> <b>and</b> <b>slugs,</b> the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous <b>snails</b> <b>and</b> <b>slugs.</b> In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
40|$|CCardiac {{fibrosis}} {{is a major}} facet {{contributing to}} cardiac dysfunction following a myocardial infarction. Persistent and excessive collagen deposition via cardiac myofibroblasts {{is the hallmark of}} cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac myofibroblasts, absent in the normal heart, appear after a myocardial infarction and are an invasive and pathological cell type. Excessive collagen produced by these cells reduces the flexibility of the cardiac muscle and contributes to the progression of heart failure. Cardiac myofibroblasts are a major source of proremodeling factors, expressing Angiotensin II (angII), Transforming Growth Factor-[beta] 1 (tgf-[beta] 1), and Endothelin- 1, which facilitate the remodeling of the heart after MI. At the site of myocardial infarction, thirty-percent of the recruited myofibroblasts are of epithelial origin and arise by the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is well documented that the process of EMT is required and dependent on the transcription factors SNAI 1 (<b>snail)</b> <b>and</b> SNAI 2 (<b>slug).</b> <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> contribute to fibrosis through the process of EMT or generation of the myofibroblast population; however, a continued regulatory role of <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> in cardiac myofibroblasts has not been investigated. The present investigation began by evaluating the gene expression of <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> in Sprague-Dawely rat myocardial infarction (MI) models, in which we found <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> to be differentially expressed in MI tissue relative to non-MI tissue. The effects of proremodeling factors angII and tgf-[beta] 1 on <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> expression in cardiac myofibroblasts was then investigated. After evaluating the influence of angII and tgf-[beta] 1 on <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> expression, the regulatory role of <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> on type I collagen and type III collagen in cardiac myofibroblasts was investigated. The synergistic regulation of collagen turnover by angII and tgf-[beta] 1 in cardiac myofibroblasts was also evaluated. The majority of this study determined a role for transcription factors <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> in cardiac myofibroblasts and a role in cardiac remodeling. <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> gene expression was found to be inversely regulated in the post-MI rat heart tissue, snail gene expression being elevated <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> abated. Proremodeling factors angII and tgf-[beta] 1 demonstrated temporally regulated <b>snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>slug</b> gene expression in cardiac myofibroblasts in early time course experiments. Slug protein expression was found to be elevated in response to tgf-[beta] 1 treatment and attenuated in response to angII treatment in cardiac myofibroblasts. Snail protein expression failed to be detected by multiple primary antibodies. Transfections using anti-snail and anti-slug siRNA revealed a regulatory role of snail in the suppression of type III collagen in cardiac myofibroblasts. Furthermore, synergetic regulation of collagen turnover with respect to angII and tgf-[beta] 1 in cardiac myofibroblasts was further elucidated. Disruption of angII signaling, via Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), demonstrated that tgf-[beta] 1 induced collagen production in cardiac myofibroblasts is dependent on angII and corresponding signaling pathways.

40|$|<b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> play {{important}} roles in cancer progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although Snail is well studied, its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its regulatory relationship with Slug remain unclear. We aimed to determine whether <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> interplay occurs in transforming growth factor-߱ (TGF-߱) -initiated EMT of OSCC cells, and to assess the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in this process. Three OSCC cell lines, SCC 9, SCC 15 and SCC 25 were treated with recombinant TGF-߱ for 0 - 6 days. Activities of the EMT regulators, <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug,</b> <b>and</b> of extracellular hallmarks, MMP 2 and 9, were detected using real-time PCR and Western blots. An in vitro wound healing assay then assessed short-term EMT, whilst phenotypic changes associated with the above gene expressions were evaluated by immunocytochemistry. Results showed that <b>Slug</b> <b>and</b> MMP 9 were up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels, while <b>Snail</b> expression rose <b>and</b> fell, in concert with expression of MMP 2. In the wound healing assay, Snail was seen alone at the invasive front in SCC 9 and SCC 15 cultures, while both <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> appeared at wound margins in SCC 25. Both MMP 2 and MMP 9 were detected at wound edges in all cell lines, with MMP 2 localised in cell nuclei, MMP 9 was restricted to the cytoplasm. The study suggests that both <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> act as regulators of TGF-߱-trigged EMT in OSCC cells. Snail may up-regulate MMP 2 or MMP 9 initiating EMT, while Slug may share a role with Snail in maintaining longer-term EMT, by stimulating MMP 9 expression.

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} repressors <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> {{are situated}} {{at the core of}} several signaling pathways proposed to mediate epithelial to mesenchymal transition or EMT, which has been implicated in tumor metastasis. EMT involves an alteration from an organized, epithelial cell structure to a mesenchymal, invasive and migratory phenotype. In order to obtain a global view of the impact of <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> expression, we performed a microarray experiment using the MCF- 7 breast cancer cell line, which does not express detectable levels of Snail or Slug. MCF- 7 cells were infected with Snail, Slug or control adenovirus, and RNA samples isolated at various time points were analyzed across all transcripts. Our analyses indicated that <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> regulate many genes in common, but also have distinct sets of gene targets. Gene set enrichment analyses indicated that <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> directed the transcriptome of MCF- 7 cells from a luminal towards a more complex pattern that includes many features of the claudin-low breast cancer signature. Of particular interest, genes involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway are upregulated, while genes responsible for a differentiated morphology are downregulated following Snail or Slug expression. Further we noticed increased histone acetylation at the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta-receptor II (TGFBR 2) gene following Snail or Slug expression. Inhibition of the TGF-beta signaling pathway using selective small-molecule inhibitors following Snail or Slug addition resulted in decreased cell migration with no impact on the repression of cell junction molecules by <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug.</b> We propose that there are two regulatory modules embedded within EMT: one that involve...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Carcinoma {{progression}} {{is linked}} to a partially dedifferentiated epithelial cell phenotype. As previously suggested, this regulation could involve transcription factors, <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug,</b> known to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during development. Here, we investigate the role of <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> in human breast cancer progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed <b>Snail,</b> <b>Slug,</b> <b>and</b> E-cadherin RNA expression levels and protein localization in large numbers of transformed cell lines and breast carcinomas, examined the correlation with tumor histologic features, and described, at the cellular level, <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> localization in carcinomas using combined in situ hybridization and immunolocalization. RESULTS: In contrast with transformed cell lines, Slug was found to colocalize with E-cadherin at the cellular level in normal mammary epithelial cells and all tested carcinomas. Snail also colocalized at the cellular level with E-cadherin in tumors expressing high levels of Snail RNA. In addition, Snail was significantly expressed in tumor stroma, varying with tumors. <b>Slug</b> <b>and</b> <b>Snail</b> genes were significantly overexpressed in tumors associated with lymph node metastasis. Finally, the presence of semidifferentiated tubules within ductal carcinomas was linked to Slug expression levels similar to or above normal breast samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Snail or Slug expression in carcinoma cells does not generally preclude significant E-cadherin expression. They emphasize a link between <b>Snail,</b> <b>Slug,</b> <b>and</b> lymph node metastasis in a large sampling of mammary carcinomas, and suggest a role for Slug in the maintenance of semidifferentiated structures. <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> proteins seem to support distinct tumor invasion modes and could provide new therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|Claudin- 1 is an {{integral}} membrane protein component of tight junctions. The Snail family of transcription factors are repressors that {{play a central role}} in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, a process that occurs during cancer progression. <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> members are direct repressors of E-cadherin and act by binding to the specific E-boxes of its proximal promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate that overexpression of Slug or Snail causes a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance. Overexpression of <b>Slug</b> <b>and</b> <b>Snail</b> in MDCK (Madin–Darby canine kidney) cells down-regulated Claudin- 1 at protein and mRNA levels. In addition, <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> are able to effectively repress human Claudin- 1 -driven reporter gene constructs containing the wild-type promoter sequence, but not those with mutations in two proximal E-box elements. We also demonstrate by band-shift assay that <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> bind to the E-box motifs present in the human Claudin- 1 promoter. Moreover, an inverse correlation in the levels of Claudin- 1 <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> transcripts were observed in breast cancer cell lines. E-box elements in the Claudin- 1 promoter were found to play a critical negative regulatory role in breast cancer cell lines that expressed low levels of Claudin- 1 transcript. Significantly, in invasive human breast tumours, high levels of <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> correlated with low levels of Claudin- 1 expression.

40|$|TP 63 is a p 53 -related {{gene that}} {{contains}} two alternative promoters, which {{give rise to}} transcripts that encode proteins with (TAp 63) or without (DeltaNp 63) an amino-transactivating domain.

Here, we investigated the role of <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> transcription factors, known to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions during development and cancer, in the regulation of p 63 isoforms in human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In the present study, we observed that the expressions of DeltaN and TAp 63 isoforms were, respectively, down- and up-regulated by both <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug.</b> However, the induction of TAp 63 was not directly caused by these two transcription factors but resulted {{from the loss of}} DeltaNp 63, which acts as dominant-negative inhibitor of TAp 63. In SCC cell lines and cancer tissues, high expression of <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> was also significantly associated with altered p 63 expression. Finally, we showed that DeltaNp 63 silencing reduced cell-cell adhesion and increased the migratory properties of cancer cells. These data suggest that the disruption of p 63 expression induced by <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> plays a crucial role in tumor progression.

40|$|Background: Chemoresistance {{has become}} a an {{important}} worldwide problem to cancer treatment. Understanding the mechanism of drug resistance {{is the key to}} solve this problem and improve the survival of the patient. Doxorubicin and its analogues are widely used as antitumor drugs but many doxorubicin resistant cases have been identified in recent years. Doxorubicin (Dox) resistance is a very serious phenomenon in lung cancer treatment. As we could show previously, Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC) can effectively reverse H 69 AR cells resistance to Dox, thus, the present study was designed to explore the mechanism underlying the effects of the main ingredient Emodin on chemosensitivity of H 69 AR cells to Dox. Methods: First, the growth inhibition rate of lung cancer cells and normal bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) was determined by MTT. Then, the resistance-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of H 69 AR cells was examined by western blot and the effect of Emodin on Twist, Snail or Slug was assayed by Real-time PCR and Western blot. The activation of NF-kappa B was assayed by Western blot. Proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of H 69 AR cells induced by Twist, <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> were also assayed by flow cytometry and transwell chamber. Results: The results showed that after administration of Dox (10 µM) with different concentrations of Emodin, the cells exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition action to H 69 AR cells at 48 hours. H 69 AR induced the expression of Twist, <b>Snail,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> when compared with Dox-sensitive H 69 cells. The expression of Twist, <b>Snail,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> can be effectively inhibited by combination of Dox and Emodin. The reversal of resistance was associated with the inhibition of NF-kappa B. Twist, <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug</b> promoted proliferation, migration and invasion and inhibited apoptosis.

Subsequent transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 3 signaling increases LEF- 1 gene expression causing formation of β-catenin–lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) - 1 complexes that initiate EMT. TGF-β 1 or TGF-β 2 stimulates this signaling mechanism by up-regulating synthesis of <b>Snail</b> <b>and</b> <b>Slug.</b> TGF-β 1 - and TGF-β 2 -induced EMT were found to be TGF-β 3 dependent, establishing essential roles for multiple TGF-β isoforms.
