5|$|Gandhi's {{vision of}} an {{independent}} India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs {{made their way to}} their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide <b>solace.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.|$|E

25|$|In the Calcutta {{scene of}} {{the mid to late}} nineteenth century, Ramakrishna was opinionated on the subject of Chakri. Chakri can be {{described}} as a type of low-paying servitude done by educated men—typically government or commerce-related clerical positions. On a basic level, Ramakrishna saw this system as a corrupt form of European social organisation that forced educated men to be servants not only to their bosses at the office but also to their wives at home. What Ramakrishna saw as the primary detriment of Chakri, however, was that it forced workers into a rigid, impersonal clock-based time structure. He saw the imposition of strict adherence to each second on the watch as a roadblock to spirituality. Despite this, however, Ramakrishna demonstrated that Bhakti could be practised as an inner retreat to experience <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of Western-style discipline and often discrimination in the workplace.|$|E

25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E

They credited their music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music. Oxfordshire and the Thames Valley had an active independent music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive.|$|E

This is followed (1774 only) by a solo which celebrates happiness in eternal bliss ("Cet asile"), sung by either an unnamed Spirit or Euridice, and repeated by the chorus. Orfeo arrives and marvels at {{the purity of}} the air in an arioso ("Che puro ciel"/"Quel nouveau ciel"). But he finds no <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beauty of the surroundings, for Euridice is not yet with him.

However, he became dissatisfied with ministry, considering it hypocritical and racist, and ultimately left the church. The difficulties of his life, including his stepfather's abuse, led Baldwin to seek <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> religion.

500|$|By {{the time}} of Shaw's birth, his mother had become close to George John Lee, a {{flamboyant}} figure well known in Dublin's musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father; {{there is no consensus}} among [...] scholars on the likelihood of this. The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply. He found <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine mezzo-soprano voice and was much influenced by Lee's unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws' house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} years Henson's lifelong sense of {{loneliness}} was compounded by the growing deafness of his wife, making their conversation difficult. He found some <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> friendship of her companion, Fearne Booker, who lived with the Hensons for more than thirty years. He occupied a considerable part of his retirement writing a substantial work of autobiography, published in three volumes under the title Retrospect of an Unimportant Life. Both {{at the time and}} subsequently many of his friends and admirers regretted his publishing the work; they thought he had done his reputation a disservice. Despite what Williams calls the [...] "peculiar interest and vivacity" [...] of the books, his survey of his many campaigns and controversies, seemed to others to be self-justifying and wilfully to deny many changes of stance that he had manifestly made during his career. In Williams's view the posthumous publication of Henson's edited letters were a better legacy: [...] "delightful in both form and content, and, barbed though they often are, they do him fuller justice".|$|E

500|$|Despite another mid-table {{finish in}} 1971–72, Stoke beat Chesterfield, Tranmere Rovers, Hull City and Manchester United to reach another FA Cup semi-final. They again faced Arsenal, {{and once more}} a draw at Hillsborough meant a replay at Goodison Park. The Gunners' goals in a 2–1 victory came from a disputed Frank McLintock penalty and a John Radford goal that {{television}} replays showed was clearly offside. In a May 2011 interview, Banks said that he still felt [...] "cheated" [...] out {{of a chance to}} play for the club in an FA Cup final. Stoke and Banks found <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> League Cup, though it took them 11 matches to reach the final after overcoming Southport, then Oxford United in a replay, Manchester United in a second replay, Bristol Rovers, and then West Ham United in a second replay following an aggregate draw after two legs. In extra-time of the second leg with West Ham, Banks fouled Harry Redknapp, conceding a penalty, and then saved Geoff Hurst's powerful spot-kick to keep City in the competition. They then faced Chelsea in the final at Wembley. Peter Osgood beat Banks with a hooked shot just before half-time, but goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham won Stoke the game 2–1.

Chuck Campbell of The Daily News was also positive stating the song was a [...] "grandiose" [...] album-closer. Steve Jones of USA Today wrote that Carey excelled in the song. Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Carey found <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song. Anthony Johnson, also of the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote that the track is a [...] "surefire winner". However, a few other critics deemed the song as forgettable. Dan DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer dismissed the song as a [...] "colorless quality romance". Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times was also negative in his review, calling it as an [...] "overwrought ballad" [...] and wrote it was un-listenable. Dara Cook of MTV Southeast Asia [...] named the song as [...] "a big-production tragicomedy of hilarious histrionics and absurdly dramatic lyrics." [...] While reviewing Carey's compilation The Ballads (2009), Chuck Campbell of The Press of Atlantic City wrote {{that at some point}} in Carey's career, the quality her songs got [...] "iffier" [...] and commented that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] is such an example. He {{went on to say that}} the song was a [...] "trifle". In 2005 Andrew Unterberger of Stylus gave a negative review, writing the song was [...] "a sub-par, extremely lazy example of an artist reaching the top spot almost solely on reputation."

His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op.114, Clarinet Quintet, Op.115 (1891), and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op.120 (1894). Brahms also wrote at this time his final cycles of piano pieces, Opp.116–19, the Vier ernste Gesänge (Four Serious Songs), Op.121 (1896) (which were prompted by the death of Clara Schumann), and the Eleven Chorale Preludes for organ, Op.122 (1896).
