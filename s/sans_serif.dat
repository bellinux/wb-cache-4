40|$|Reading on the World Wide Web {{has become}} a daily habit nowadays. This {{can be seen from}} the {{perspective}} of changes on readers’ tendency to be more interested in materials from the internet, than the printed media. Taking these developments into account, it is important for web-based instructional designers to choose the appropriate font, especially for long blocks of text, in order to enhance the level of students’ readability. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the effects of <b>serif</b> and <b>san</b> <b>serif</b> font in the category of screen fonts and print fonts, in terms of Malay text readability on websites. For this purpose, four fonts were selected, namely Georgia (<b>serif)</b> and Verdana (<b>san</b> <b>serif)</b> for the first respondents and Times New Roman (<b>serif)</b> and Arial (<b>san</b> <b>serif)</b> for the second respondents. Georgia and Verdana were designed for computer screens display. Meanwhile, Times New Roman and Arial were originally designed for print media. Readability test on a computer screen was conducted on 48 undergraduates. Overall, the results showed that there was no significant difference between the redability of <b>serif</b> and <b>san</b> <b>serif</b> font of both screen display category and print display category. Accordingly, the research findings and the literature overview, suggest that Verdana and followed by Georgia as the better choice in displaying long text on websites. Likewise, as anticipated, Times New Roman and Arial fonts provide good readability for print media, which reinfoces their status as the printing font category. However, with the current computer screen capability, it can still be an alternative option for instructional web developers. </p...|$|R

This paper presents an eye tracking study of how font size and font type affect online reading. In a between-subjects design, we collected data from 82 subjects reading stories formatted {{in a variety of}} point sizes, <b>san</b> <b>serif,</b> and serif fonts. Reading statistics such as reading speed were computed, and post-tests of comprehension were recorded. For smaller font sizes, fixation durations are significantly longer, resulting in slower reading – but not significantly slower.

25|$|<b>Sans</b> <b>serif</b> (lit. without serif) designs {{appeared}} relatively {{recently in}} the history of type design. The first, similar to slab serif designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. <b>Sans</b> <b>serif</b> fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage, headings, and other situations demanding legibility above high readability. The text on electronic media offers an exception to print: most web pages and digitized media are laid out in <b>sans</b> <b>serif</b> typefaces because serifs often detract from readability at the low resolution of displays. Many have minimal variation in stroke width, creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design.|$|E

In general, style amounts {{to the use of}} <b>serifs</b> versus <b>sans</b> <b>serifs.</b> A serif is, by definition, a cross-line {{at the end of a}} stroke along a letter. On a map, the text that is chosen should be consistent. Generally, serif fonts are utilized to give a more regimented block body of text—similar to those used in traditional printing.

25|$|Typefaces with serifs {{are often}} {{considered}} easier {{to read in}} long passages than those without. Studies on the matter are ambiguous, suggesting that most of this effect {{is due to the}} greater familiarity of serif typefaces. As a general rule, printed works such as newspapers and books almost always use serif typefaces, at least for the text body. Web sites do not have to specify a font and can simply respect the browser settings of the user. But of those web sites that do specify a font, most use modern <b>sans</b> <b>serif</b> fonts, because it is commonly believed that, in contrast to the case for printed material, <b>sans</b> <b>serif</b> fonts are easier than serif fonts to read on the low-resolution computer screen.|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2010. Major: Design. Advisor: Dr. Barbara Martinson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvii, 202 pages, appendices A-C. This study examined font and layout alternatives for mild special education children in third through sixth grade. Of this group, twelve were boys {{and two were}} girls, seven were suburban students and seven were urban students. During the first phase, the students were observed reading four different fonts, then the participant named the easiest font to read and the preferred font. During the second phase, an alternative math assignment format was designed by applying universal design guidelines. The student was then observed solving math problems on a traditional and an alternative format to see if format appeared to enhance the educational focus and performance of the special education student being observed. The data was analyzed in three ways: student reading behavior, student performance, and student perception and preference. Reading behavior was measured by noting behavior such as enthusiasm, boredom, restlessness, frustration, and engagement. Overall the following results were found. Participants were more restless while reading Comic Sans and Times. Incorrect words were evenly distributed across all of the fonts, however the students skipped more words while reading serif fonts. Times had the most skipped words but, curiously, the fewest misread words. Participants paused before words more often with the <b>san</b> <b>serif</b> fonts yet skipped entire words less often. Participants had read two sentences together more often while reading <b>sans</b> <b>serifs,</b> most noted with Comic Sans. Twelve out of 13 students chose a <b>san</b> <b>serif</b> as their favorite font from the group of four fonts. Of those 12, eight students chose Comic Sans as their favorite. Only four of fourteen participants said the easiest font was indeed the font where they missed the least number of words, sat the least restless, or {{appeared to be the}} most engaged. Of interest is whether the students' preference for <b>san</b> <b>serifs</b> is partially because many of their electronic devices such as game systems, iPods, computers, and cell phones feature <b>san</b> <b>serif</b> fonts. Perhaps students feel good about the font style featured on pleasurable devices and experiences. The curriculum format study showed a minimal difference in performance (an average of 9. 5 / 12 for the traditional layout and 10 / 12 for the alternative layout) but a clear difference in preference. Ten out of 12 students (the two pilot study students were not given both format options) stated that they preferred the alternative curriculum design. This format featured less problems on a page to decrease distraction and integrated workspace for each problem. Students who worked out problems on the worksheet had more problems correct than the students who did most of the work in their heads, regardless of the curriculum format design. This alternative format has promise if teachers encourage students to work out problems using the workspace provided...|$|R

50|$|Steile Futura was Paul Renner's {{attempt to}} create a {{typeface}} that would be closer to the nineteenth century <b>sans</b> <b>serifs</b> than to the geometric model. During the course of development, Renner developed several intermediate versions. Some of the early design could be found in the experimental font called Renner-Grotesk, which appeared as a trial type casting from the Stempel type foundry in 1936. Renner kursiv, a true italic companion to the regular version, was made after Stempel had been taken over by Bauer in 1938.|$|R
25|$|Great variety exists {{among both}} serif and <b>sans</b> <b>serif</b> typefaces.

25|$|Ligatures {{began to}} fall out of use due to their {{complexity}} in the 20th century. <b>Sans</b> <b>serif</b> typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include Gill Sans and Futura.

25|$|A {{well-known}} and popular <b>sans</b> <b>serif</b> font is Max Miedinger's Helvetica, popularized for desktop publishing by inclusion with Apple Computer's LaserWriter laserprinter and having {{been one of}} the first readily available digital typefaces.

50|$|A subtle {{change in}} {{proportion}} impacts weight, perception, measure, and legibility. The letterform height compared to its stroke width modifies the aspect; this slight change in weight sometimes helps to create emphasis. The disparity between {{thick and thin}} strokes, known as stress, alters optical perception. As an example, the initial <b>san</b> <b>serif</b> typefaces used a constantly thin stroke. The technological advances allow drawing thinner strokes. Condense type occupies less space than expanded type, then the text written on a page {{can be reduced to}} half a page.The capline and x-height ratio improve or decrease word legibility.|$|R

25|$|Typeface superfamilies {{began to}} emerge when {{foundries}} began to include typefaces with significant structural differences, but some design relationship, under the same general family name. Arguably the first superfamily was created when Morris Fuller Benton created Clearface Gothic for ATF in 1910, a <b>sans</b> <b>serif</b> companion to the existing (serifed) Clearface. The superfamily label does not include quite different designs given the same family name for what {{would seem to be}} purely marketing, rather than design, considerations: Caslon Antique, Futura Black and Futura Display are structurally unrelated to the Caslon and Futura families, respectively, and are generally not considered part of those families by typographers, despite their names.|$|E

Univers is {{one of a group of}} neo-grotesque sans-serif typefaces, all released in 1957, that includes Folio and Neue Haas Grotesk (later renamed Helvetica). As all are based on Akzidenz-Grotesk, these three faces are sometimes confused with each other. These typefaces figure prominently in the Swiss Style of graphic design.|$|R
