40|$|The {{flow-through}} {{leaching test}} {{is a test}} method employed to study the leaching behavior of monolithic stabilized/solidified (S/S) hazardous wastes {{under the condition that}} the leachate flows through the sample. This method simulates the leaching process of the S/S hazardous waste disposed under a particular landfill condition when the S/S waste is more permeable than its surrounding materials or when the deterioration of the <b>solidified</b> <b>waste</b> form has reached a state that ground water can flow-through the waste via the porosity system of the S/S waste matrix. This paper describes a study on the long-term performance of the cement-based S/S heavy metal wastes using a flow-through leaching test method. Two series of leaching tests with different synthetic heavy metal waste samples were carried out. The S/S samples were made from five types of heavy metals with two kinds of binders. The metals were Pb 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + (positive ions as nitrates), and Cr 6 + (a negative ion as potassium dichromate), and the binders were type I ordinary portland cement (OPC) and pulverised fuel ash (PFA). The model developed by Godbee and Joy for simulating the leaching behavior was modified to estimate the diffusivity parameter in this study. The results obtained indicate that since the matrix of the <b>solidified</b> <b>waste</b> in a flow-through leaching tests is always being degraded, the values of diffusivities increase continuously during the leaching period.

40|$|A {{demonstration}} of the disposal of high-level radioactive waste solids {{to be carried out}} in a salt mine at Lyons, Kansas, will have as its objectives: (1) the {{demonstration of}} required waste-handling equipment and techniques, (2) the determination of the stability of salt under the influence of heat and radiation, and (3) the collection of information on creep and plastic flow of salt which is needed for the design of an actual disposal facility. As presently conceived, 14 irradiated fuel assemblies from the Engineering Test Reactor will serve as a source of radiation in lieu of actual <b>solidified</b> <b>wastes.</b> The assemblies will be placed in a circular array of holes in the floor with one can in the center and other six cans located peripherally, spaced 5 ft on centers. During the course of the 2 -year test, four sets of assemblies will be used to achieve a peak dose to the salt of about 8 x 10 /sup 8 / rad and the temperature of the adjacent salt will be maintained at 200 deg C with electrical heaters. A second array, consisting only of heaters, will be operated as a control to determine those effects due solely to heat. In addition to the radioactive and control arrays, a ribpillar located between the two arrays will be heated electrically around its base to produce significant information on salt flow characteristics at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The Field Lysimeter Investigations: Low-Level Waste Data Base Development Program is obtaining {{information}} {{on the performance of}} radioactive waste forms. Ion-exchange resins from a nuclear power station were <b>solidified</b> into <b>waste</b> forms using Portland cement and vinyl ester-styrene. These waste forms are being tested to develop a low-level waste data base and to obtain {{information on}} survivability of waste forms in a disposal environment. This paper reviews radionuclide releases from those waste forms in the first 9 years of sampling. Included is a discussion of the recently discovered upward migration of radionuclides. Also, lysimeter data are applied to a performance assessment source term model, and initial results are presented...|$|R
