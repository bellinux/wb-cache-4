40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{research}} the decomposition of leftover cooking oil and biomethane potential. To determine the anaerobic digestion we first used batch device Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS II). The methane production was significantly different when we used just the leftover cooking oil compared to controlled reactor. The latter was dosed the primary sludge and we created the same conditions {{as they have in}} the central cleaning plant Domžale - Kamnik. To be able to compare it to the real reactor we monitored the function of the anaerobic reactor in CCP Domžale – Kamnik.

40|$|AbstractThe Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), {{founded in}} April 2008, is Singapore's {{national}} laboratory for applied solar energy research. The institute conducts industry-oriented {{research and development}} (R&D) as well as use-inspired basic {{research in the field}} of solar energy conversion. A cornerstone of the silicon wafer solar cell R&D at SERIS is a <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> based on industrial equipment. SERIS has worked closely with industrial equipment vendors to build a <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> that combines the flexibility required for R&D with the throughputs and process robustness required for production. By utilising industrial equipment SERIS is able to conduct industry relevant research with a direct roadmap to production, by rapid prototyping of novel solar cell structures and processes using production-proven tooling. The approach removes the need to migrate processes from lab-scale tools to the production environment, which commonly limits lab-to-production technology transfer and increases the risk of technology transfer. Moreover, SERIS’ industrial <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> focuses not only on device-oriented R&D but also enables R&D programmes with equipment manufacturers to test new process tool prototypes and extend the capabilities of existing tool designs. The <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> has been established on a short timeline and has quickly achieved good average efficiencies with standard industrial Al-BSF solar cells: 16. 7 % for multi-Si and 18. 2 % for mono-Si. This paper presents an overview of SERIS’ R&D <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> for silicon wafer solar cells and its capabilities. We also present selected R&D results, including 18. 3 % inline-diffused mono-Si cells and 19 % local Al-BSF mono-Si cells...|$|R

This thesis {{will focus on the}} experimental setup and results collected at the University of Guelph [...] Campus d'Alfred from a series of Biochemical Methane Potential assays and six 30 L semi-continuous anaerobic digesters operating under mesophilic conditions. The co-substrates investigated during the study include: corn silage, canola meal, whey, glycerine and dissolved air floatation sludge. The use of liquid dairy manure proved to be beneficial for the anaerobic digestion process by supplementing necessary buffering capacity, nitrogen, micro and macro elements for the co-digestion of high carbon organic wastes. Biochemical Methane Potential assays of the co-substrates increased the biogas yield from 5 to 250 %.

40|$|Thin film {{photovoltaic}} modules {{based on}} Cu(In,Ga) Se{sub 2 } {{have been shown}} to possess attributes that should enable them to compete effectively with silicon-based modules, and that should ultimately allow realization of a much lower $/Wp cost figure. These attributes are stability, high efficiency, and low materials cost. Energy Photovoltaics has explored novel CIGS formation recipes that can be implemented on a unique <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> constructed to coat substrates 4300 cm{sup 2 } in area. One particular feature of this line is the use of proprietary linear sources capable of downwards evaporation. After experimentation with several types of recipe, a so-called {open_quotes}hybrid{close_quotes} process was found to simultaneously yield the desired combination of properties, namely good adhesion, device efficiency, uniformity, and reproducibility. The steps involve precursor formation, compound formation, and termination. Diagnostic techniques used to study and improve the CIGS films included spatial mapping of thickness, composition (using Auger analysis), resistance, V{sub oc} and I{sub sc}. The last three items are determined by quick tests designed to provide rapid feedback on plate quality. Problem areas were broken down and isolated through use of techniques involving substitution of different pieces of equipment for certain processing steps. For example, <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> precursors were selenized in both the <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> and smaller scale R&D equipment...|$|R
