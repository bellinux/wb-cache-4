50|$|In the Roadblock, {{one team}} member had to load a bicycle cart with six tanks of propane gas, {{pedal to the}} two {{addresses}} listed on their order <b>slips,</b> deliver three <b>tanks</b> to each address, and collect receipts as proof of delivery. Once their deliveries were complete, they had to hand the foreman their two order slips and two receipts to receive their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Tambellini took {{a series}} of odd jobs, picking {{potatoes}} with migrant workers and painting gasoline tanks in Oil City in Syracuse, New York. While stepping on wet paint, he <b>slipped</b> toward the <b>tank's</b> unsecured edges and stopped {{a few inches from}} a sixty-foot drop - a plunge that could have killed him. After that, Tambellini enrolled in a local vocational college to learn English. While there, he won numerous prizes and awards in art.|$|R
50|$|In {{the example}} shown below, a tugboat was {{positioned}} {{on the left}} side of the barge (our right in the apron view), pulling it with a stout rope called a springline. Nearly identical structures were used around San Francisco Bay. Unlike the electric motor drive used here and elsewhere, the Point Richmond ferry <b>slip</b> used water <b>tanks</b> as a portion of the counterweight, with the amount of water (provided by gravity from a local creek) regulated to move the apron up or down by admitting or draining water from the tanks.|$|R

2500|$|Misoa {{embarked}} {{tanks of}} the Canadian Armoured Corps at Tilbury Docks and sailed for northern France on 4 June 1944. The invasion was then postponed for 24 hours {{owing to the}} poor weather, so Misoa remained at sea, finally arriving off [...] "Juno Beach" [...] at dawn on [...] "D-Day" [...] 6 June. She disembarked her men, tanks and equipment the following day, {{and then returned to}} Tilbury for a second load, returning to [...] "Juno" [...] to disembark them immediately. Unfortunately a <b>tank</b> <b>slipped</b> sideways off the ramp, blocking it and delaying operations. The tide went out and stranded the ship on the beach until the following morning.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the contemporary commercial dance music scene in Sydney, incorporating an analytical framework that revolves mainly around {{the work of}} DJs and the commercial scene they operate within. In using the terms =dance music` and =dance culture`, I am referring to the =commercial` music played by DJs in such Sydney clubs as Home, The ArtHouse, <b>Slip</b> Inn, and <b>Tank,</b> and at various bars, pubs, festivals and events within the city area, all {{of which would be}} seen as constituting =mainstream` dance culture in the city. Dance music has a central role not just in the culture of the city, but also socially and economically, and on a wider geographical scale. The paper is intended to complement and add to analysis that has previously been conducted on Sydney, and Australian, dance music culture (examples being Murphie and Scheer, 1992; Homan, 1998; Gibson and Pagan, 2000; Brookman, 2001; Luckman, 2002; Brennan-Horley, 2007). More generally, the paper is intended to contribute to the growing literature on DJ culture around the world (examples being Fikentscher, 1991, 2000; Klasco and Michael, 1992; Langlois, 1992; Rietveld, 1997, 1998; Haslam, 1997, 2001; Poschardt, 1998; Reynolds, 1998, 1999; Brewster and Broughton, 2000; Farrugia and Swiss, 2005) ...|$|R
2500|$|At Afragola the {{regiment}} received 18 Sherman tanks and then loaded all tanks onto trains {{to be taken}} across country to Foggia and from there moved into a brigade harbour area {{near the village of}} Lucera. By now, Lord O'Neill had been given command of {{the regiment}}, with Colonel Dawnay moving on to brigade staff. After a week in harbour, the regiment was sent on tank transporters to Mignano near Monte Cassino, which had fallen some days earlier {{along with the rest of}} the Gustav Line. The fighting was not over, however, as the Adolf Hitler Line, now renamed the Senger Line, lay just six miles north, and it would be the next objective. The Horse was briefed for Operation Chesterfield, which was an assault by the 1st Canadian Division supported by tanks of the North Irish Horse and the 51st Royal Tanks. H Hour was to be at 6am on 23 May. The plan required the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigades, supported by the two tank regiments, to break through the Hitler Line on a 3,000-yard front. The assaulting troops came under a withering hail of fire on the well-prepared killing grounds of the heavily defended German positions. The Horse took heavy casualties and had to regroup by merging depleted squadrons together. One <b>tank</b> <b>slipped</b> off a track and fell 50 feet into a ravine, rolling over on its turret and then back onto its tracks. The crew were shaken but unhurt, and the incident gave them another chance to display the marvellous climbing skills of the Churchill as they crawled slowly up the almost sheer walls of the ravine to re-enter the battle. During this battle, Major Griffiths again displayed great heroism and was later awarded the only bar to the MC that an officer of the regiment received. The total cost to the Horse in the engagement was 36 men killed in action and 32 tanks lost. This represented 60% of the regimental strength. The date of 23 May was later chosen as a [...] "Regimental Day" [...] to commemorate the bloodiest day in the history of the North Irish Horse, which lost more men than on any other day in two world wars. he breakthrough happened, however, and the German defenders began evacuating the position on the night of 23 May. Meanwhile, the allied advance continued.|$|R
