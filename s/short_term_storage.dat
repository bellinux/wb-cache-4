In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Supercapacitors are {{increasingly}} used as <b>short</b> <b>term</b> energy <b>storage</b> elements in distributed generation systems.

This paper therefore, presents a novel direct integration scheme for supercapacitors and thereby eliminates associated costs and power losses of interfacing converters. The idea is simply to replace ordinary capacitors of three-level flying-capacitor rectifiers with supercapacitors and operate them under variable voltage conditions. An analysis on the reduction of power losses by the proposed system is presented. Furthermore, supercapacitor sizing and implementation issues such as effects of the variable voltage operation and resistive behavior of supercapacitors at high frequencies are also discussed.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} duration of storage of soybean meal (SBM) on variables that define the quality of the protein fraction. Urease activity, protein dispersibility index (PDI), KOH protein solubility (KOHsol), and trypsin inhibitor activity were determined. In experiment 1, 8 samples of SBM, ranging in CP content from 55. 4 to 56. 5 % DM, were collected from a US crushing plant at weekly intervals and analyzed at arrival to the laboratory and after 30, 60, 90, and 120 d of storage. In experiment 2, 7 samples of SBM, ranging in CP content from 49. 0 to 55. 0 % DM, were collected from different Argentinean crushers and analyzed at arrival and after 24, 48, 80, and 136 wk of storage. In both experiments, samples were stored in hermetic glass containers in a laboratory room at 12 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 70 ± 3 %. Duration of storage did not affect urease activity or trypsin inhibitor activity values in either of the 2 experiments. However, PDI values decreased linearly with time of storage in both experiments (P menor que 0. 001). Also, KOHsol decreased linearly (P menor que 0. 05) with duration of storage in experiment 2 (long-term storage) but not in experiment 1 (<b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> <b>storage).</b> Therefore, PDI values might not be adequate to compare protein quality of commercial SBM samples that have been stored for different periods of time.

40|$|For {{effective}} clinical uptake {{of the lab}} on a chip/point of care technology (LOC-POC), {{in addition}} to cost advantages LOC-POC devices should offer multiple patient screening panels for related diseases as well as cold-chain transportation and storage abilities. We recently described a device that performs polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to simultaneously screen raw clinical samples from up to 16 patients for multiple infectious agents (Manage et al., Lab Chip, 2013, 13, 2576 – 2584). This cassette contains glass capillaries with desiccated semi-solid acrylamide gels that include all the reagents except for the sample, with integrated quality control. Here we report the development of protocols to store assembled PCR cassettes at room temperature, 4 uC or 220 uC {{as well as at}} + 40 uC. We show that our cassettes are stable, with no loss of activity for at least 3 months at RT and at least 7 months at 4 uC and 220 uC. However, the activity of desiccated cassettes degrades when stored for more than 2 weeks at 40 uC, insufficient time for postmanufacture delivery and use of cassette PCR. To address this, we have evaluated two stage storage protocols. PCR cassettes can initially be stored at 4 uC and 220 uC for prolonged periods of time and removed for <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> <b>storage</b> at RT, retaining activity for at least a month, which would facilitate transport to remote areas for testing. Effective use of cassette PCR in high temperature regions of the world, for experimental purposes defined here as 40 uC, appears to be feasible only after a first stage storage in the cold, followed by no more than 1 week at 40 uC. This should allow sufficient time for delivery by the manufacturer to a central area well served by power and refrigeration, for later ambient temperature transport and use in under-resourced areas that lack refrigeration...|$|R
