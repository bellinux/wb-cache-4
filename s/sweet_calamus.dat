40|$|Background: Acorus <b>calamus</b> (<b>sweet</b> flag) is a {{well-known}} traditional herb used in India. There were only limited studies done on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic extracts of A. calamus and the biological activities of phenolic and flavonoid compounds as well as alpha-asarone in the sweet flag. Objective: The present {{study was designed to}} explore the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic of A. calamus leaf and rhizome extracts. Lastly, the correlation between the biological activities and total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) as well as total alpha-asarone content (TAC) of three different extracts (water, hexane and methanol extracts) was revealed. Method: TAC was determined through using HPLC method, while TPC and TFC were determined through spectrophotometric method. DPPH-free radical scavenging assay (DPPH-FRS) and ferric reducing power assay (FRAP) were used to analyze antioxidant activity, whereby disc diffusion method was used to analyze the antibacterial activity. Results: Methanol extracts had significantly (p< 0. 05) highest levels of antioxidant activities, antibacterial activity TPC (4. 466 % 1; 3. 603 % 2) and TFC (12. 819 % 1; 7. 411 % 2) content. The significant (p< 0. 05) highest TAC was observed in hexane extracts (0. 762 % 1; 2. 975 % 2). TPC (p< 0. 05; r= 0. 855) and TFC (p< 0. 05; r= 0. 855) correlated to FRAP, while DPPH-FRS solely correlated to TFC (p< 0. 05; r= 0. 873). Conclusion: Both of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic extracts of A. calamus could be potent antioxidant agents for nutraceutical application and antibacterial agent for food application. Lastly, flavonoids and phenols extracted from sweet flag could be a good potent source of antioxidants for nutraceuticals or food additives as those compounds are correlated to the antioxidant activity. 1 Leaf extract; 2 Rhizome extrac...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} into flooding tolerance and oxygen shortages in plants has been motivated largely by cultivation problems of arable crops. Unfortunately, such species are unsuitable for investigating the physiological and biochemical basis of anoxia-tolerance as selection has reduced any tolerance of anaerobiosis and anaerobic soil conditions that their wild ancestors might have possessed. Restoration of anoxia-tolerance to species {{that have lost}} this property is served better by physiological and molecular studies of the mechanisms that are employed in wild species that still possess long-term anoxia-tolerance. Case studies developing these arguments are presented {{in relation to a}} selection of crop and wild species. The flooding sensitivity and metabolism of maize is compared in relation to rice in its capacity for anaerobic germination. The sensitivity of potato to flooding is related to its disturbed energy metabolism and inability to maintain functioning membranes under anoxia and postinoxia. By contrast, long-term anoxia-tolerance in the American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) and the arctic grass species Deschampsia beringensis can be related to the provision and utilization of carbohydrate reserves. Among temperate species, the <b>sweet</b> flag (Acorus <b>calamus)</b> shows a remarkable tolerance of anoxia in both shoots and roots and is also able to mobilize carbohydrate and maintain ATP levels during anoxia as well as preserving membrane lipids against anoxic and post-anoxic injury. Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora, although anoxia-tolerant, are both sulphide-sensitive species which can pre-dispose them to the phenomenon of die-back in stagnant, nutrient-rich water. Glyceria maxima adapts to flooding through phenological adaptations with a seasonal metabolic tolerance of anoxia confined to winter and spring which, combined with a facility for root aeration and early spring growth, allows rapid colonization of sites with only shallow flooding. The diversity of responses to flooding in wild plants suggests that, depending on the life strategy and habitat of the species, many different mechanisms may be involved in adapting plants to survive periods of inundation and no one mechanism on its own is adequate for ensuring surviva...|$|R
40|$|Diseases play an {{important}} role in rice production. In modern agriculture, application of hazardous chemicals is a common practice allover the world. But organic rice production system does not allow synthetic agro-chemicals due to its adverse effect on environment as well as human health. Thirty six fungal, twenty one viral, six bacterial and six nematode diseases have been recorded in rice. In Bangladesh, 31 rice diseases have been so far identified of which ten are considered as major. Sheath blight, blast, bakanae etc. are the major rice diseases in Bangladesh. Organic amendment works effectively under organic field production. Many researchers have already reported that application of silicon (Si) and potassium (K) reduce sheath blight and blast incidence. Plenty of different types of ashes are available in rural household and rice mills across the country which is the cheap source of Si and K. Application of ashes during final land preparation is a good practice for disease management. Farmer’s of northern region of Bangladesh are now applying rice mill ash in their field to control sheath blight disease. Hot water treatment of rice seeds at 54 0 C is another option of successful control of bakanae disease and also to increase seedling vigor. Water management in rice field may be also an effective way of major disease control. Drain out the water helps decreasing sheath blight incidence. On the other hand, stagnant water helps decreasing blast incidence. Organic matter amendment in soil also helps decreasing brown spot disease of rice. There is a great scope on the development of Trichoderma based bio-fertilizer that may be used commercially for disease control and to increase rice yield. Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) has already developed BAU-bio-fungicides which are Trichoderma based. It needs to be commercialized for organic rice production.

It will also be helpful to avoid heavy expenses being spent on the import of pesticides. The focus of the project was to provide a secure IPM protocol to the farmers for the easy and organic control of stored grains insect pests, at farm level. For this purpose, oils of Acorus <b>calamus</b> (<b>Sweet</b> flag), Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Ricinus communis (Castor) were applied individually and as combinations in various concentrations @ 15 - 18 ml solution per sq. ft. area of the jute/cotton bags of different densities. Infestation free wheat was packed in respective treated bags and stored under prevailing ambient conditions of the flourmills. Antixenotic and antibiotic effects of the botanical oils were determined at different storage intervals i. e. 30, 60 and 90 days against Rhizopertha dominica, Sitophilus granarius, Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma granarium. Statistical examination of the data regarding percent mortality and population build up of the target insects has indicated that different concentrations, storage periods and packing materials have a momentous effect on the insects mortality and their penetration into the bags. Degree of antixenosis and antibiosis has a linear correlation with the concentration of the oils but inversely with the storage periods. Moreover, penetration into the bags was inversely but the mortality was directly proportional to the density of the packing materials. It was observed that fine packing material with 20 % concentration, Neem oil conferred 90 %, sweet flag oil 94 % and castor oil 82 % mortality up to one month. Afterwards a gradient decrease in percent mortality was found in second and third months. Whereas, mixture of three oils in 10 % concentration of each exhibited 100, 95. 55, and 91. 55 % mortality for 30, 60 and 90 days respectively, in cotton bags, having mesh size of 0. 1 x 0. 1 mm. Farinographic studies indicated non significant differences on the water absorption of the dough made from the respective flours of the treatments and the control. Furthermore, sensory evaluation established that there was no distinguishable taste or taint found in the chapatties made from the respective flours of the treatments and the control. It is concluded that oils of Acorus calamus, Azadirachta indica and Ricinus communis are effective, with the selected dosage levels, to save the stored grains from insect pests, the food from toxic residues and the environment from chemical pollution. Mixture of three oils in 10 % concentration showed a better performance than the rest of treatments.
