The Revenge of the Cybermen head was reshaped and recut by Richard Gregory of the freelance company Imagineering to add more details. There was a transparent section in the face through where the actor's moving jaw could be seen. New chest units were made in fibreglass, and they were decorated with ammunition trays. Also worn with the costumes were padded zip-back gloves and Tecnica Moon Boots. For The Five Doctors and Attack of the Cybermen, the jaw area was <b>sprayed</b> <b>silver,</b> and less ostentatious boots were worn. Anushia Nieradzik was the costume designer on Attack of the Cybermen. A specially modified Cyber Controller costume with a tall silver dome on its head was made for Attack of the Cybermen; as with the Controller costume used in The Tomb of the Cybermen, its helmet had no handles. For Silver Nemesis, the same head and chest pieces returned with a dappled plastic jaw {{and the removal of}} the ammunition trays. A plainer type of flight suit without built-in pipes was used for the bodies, and cable junction boxes with plastic tubes were added to the limbs for more detail.

The unit was located at RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney from May to August 1946, and then moved to RAAF Station Williamtown outside of Newcastle. On 4 August 1946 it received four P-51D Mustang fighters and a single CAC Wirraway trainer. No. 78 Squadron undertook training during 1947, including exercises with Australian and British warships in March and July.

30|$|Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is {{aromatic}} herbs {{that are}} used extensively to add a distinctive aroma and flavor to food. The leaves can be used fresh or dried as a spice. Essential oils extracted from fresh leaves and flowers {{can be used as}} aroma additives in food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics [1]-[3]. Traditionally, basil {{has been used as a}} medicinal plant in the treatment of headaches, coughs, diarrhea, constipation, warts, worms, and kidney malfunction [1]. Phytohormones and environmental stresses are the effective factors in controlling abscission process [4]. It is demonstrated that the ethylene has an important role in initiation of the abscission layer in different plants [5]. Ethylene activates the biosynthesis genes of hydrolytic enzymes, e.g., cellulose and polygalacturonase, which induces separation of plant organs from the main plant [6],[7]. In addition, the abscission process could be regulated by the other phytohormones such as auxin (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The later induces the abscission process through stimulation of the ethylene biosynthesis while auxin is effective in delaying the abscission by reducing the sensitivity of cell to ethylene [4],[6],[8]. Abscission may be delayed by using some chemical components such as amino isobutyric acid and cobalt ions, (aminooxy) acetic acid, silver thiosulfate (STS), and silver nitrate (AgNO 3) [8],[9]. Several studies demonstrated that <b>spraying</b> of <b>silver</b> ions decreases the flowers and flower bud abscission in orchid plant [10]. Additionally, it has been reported that silver ions decreased 100 % flower abscission of Alstroemeria plant as compared to untreated flower within two first days [11]. Moreover, ethylene is involved on senescence of flowers in Bougainvillea plant while this process may be postponed by <b>spraying</b> <b>silver</b> thiosulfate [12].|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{emergence}} of bacterial pathogens resistant to {{most or all}} available antibiotics is among the major global public health problems. As indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces is a main route of dissemination for most of such pathogens, the implementation of effective antimicrobial surfaces has been advocated as a promising approach for their containment, especially in the hospital settings. However, traditional wet synthesis methods of nanoparticle-based antimicrobial materials leave {{a number of key}} points open for metal surfaces: such as adhesion to the surface and nanoparticle coalescence. Here we demonstrate an alternative route, i. e. supersonic cluster beam deposition, to obtain antimicrobial Ag nanoparticle films deposited directly on surfaces. The synthesized films are simple to produce with controlled density and thickness, are stable over time, and are shown to be highly bactericidal against major Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial pathogens, including extensively drug-resistant strains. From the Clinical EditorThe use of silver nanoparticle in health care is getting more widespread. The authors here describe the technique of cluster beam deposition for <b>spraying</b> <b>silver</b> on surfaces used in health care sectors. This may open a new avenue for future anti-bacterial coatings...|$|R

50|$|He studied art at {{foundation}} level at the High Wycombe College of Art. In 1975 he travelled to London {{to see the}} exhibition Fashion from 1900-1939 at the V&A, which inspired him {{to pursue a career}} in the fashion industry. This inspired him to apply to study fashion design under Bobby Hillson, at the Saint Martin's School of Art, London, where he was the sole male student in his year. Although he enjoyed being taught by Peter Lewis Crown, the designer-owner of the London couture house Lachasse, he had little prior sewing experience, and so in order to develop his skills Crown secured Jones a summer placement in Lachasse's tailoring workroom. Jones soon requested a transfer to the next-door millinery department presided over by Shirley Hex, but was told he had to make a hat from scratch first. The hat he eventually submitted, his first original millinery creation, was a cardboard pillbox covered in blue crÃªpe de Chine and trimmed with a plastic iris, <b>sprayed</b> <b>silver</b> that his mother had received as a free gift from a petrol station in the 1960s. In his innocence, Jones had not realised that millinery flowers were traditionally made of silk, but Hex approved the hat, commenting on the flower's modernity. Between 1976 and 1979 Jones spent his summer breaks working for Hex and learning about millinery methods and techniques. Through hats he developed a keen interest in fashion history, particularly the drama and exaggerated glamour of the 1950s.|$|R
30|$|Seed abscission {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors in {{reducing}} seed yield in basil plant. It is proven that one of the reasons for plant organ abscission is imbalance between phytohormones. Ethylene is playing an important role in this process. Furthermore, it is proven that silver ions inhibit the ethylene action by preventing its connection to its receptors in plant cells [8, 6, 4]. Thus, the increase in the seed yield was a result of reducing the seed abscission due to the inhibitory effect of silver on ethylene action. These results are confirmed by the results obtained from other studies [10],[11],[15],[20]. There are many reports about the use of silver nitrate in decreasing the abscission, but this study is the first research which is about nano silver effect on decreasing the abscission of reproductive organs of plants. Increasing silver concentration in aerial organs of sprayed plants with nano silver caused decreasing polyphenol and tannin content. While there was an increased in polyphenol and tannin content by <b>spraying</b> <b>silver</b> nitrate due to rising of the silver concentration in aerial organs of plant. There are many reports available about ethylene effect on increasing the phenol content [27],[28]. On the other hand, high concentration of heavy metals (that is silver) in plant tissue causes polymerization of phenol by peroxidase enzyme which chelates the heavy metals [28],[29]. Therefore, by increasing the level of silver nitrate more than 100 ppm, phenol and tannin content enhances due to toxicity effect of silver on plant cells.|$|R
