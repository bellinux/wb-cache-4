25|$|In January 1975, Otonabee Airways {{launched}} the first scheduled passenger {{service at the}} airport. Otonabee operated a three-times a day service between the island airport and Montreal's international airport. 1975 was also the year that the island airport {{was used as the}} base for Olga, a Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> helicopter used to dismantle the crane of the new CN Tower under construction and hoist sections of its new antenna into place on top of its concrete tower.|$|E

50|$|Once {{through the}} thick mat of debris, they entered dense virgin forest swathed in a thick blanket of fog—the clouds {{surrounding}} the peak. Bracing their feet on tree roots and the stems of huge ferns, they groped from stalk to frond to keep their balance, slowly maneuvering through the fog and undergrowth that limited their visibility to the men immediately in front of and behind them. After an hour of this slow, painstaking, and uneventful climb, a lone NVA soldier stood and called to Parkinson’s front scout—an indigenous Montagnard named Dish—thinking he was a fellow soldier. Instantly realizing his mistake, the soldier stood shocked, arms at his sides, mouth and eyes open, as Dish and Parkinson raised their rifles and shot him.Parkinson’s team made another patrol around the peak while, with the LZ now operational, hundreds of scout helicopters, slicks, gunships, and powerful CH-47 Chinooks laden with troops flocked in from the east. Reaching the Lurps’ mountaintop stronghold, they plunged deep inside the valley to search out and destroy the enemy with airpower and overwhelming infantry assaults. As large and small battles raged farther and farther south, streams of tracers could be seen flying skyward. The effectiveness of the enemy antiaircraft was obvious as massive CH-54 <b>Skycranes</b> could be seen from Signal Hill, returning to Camp Evans {{with one or two}} destroyed helicopters slung beneath them.|$|R
25|$|In January 1975, Otonabee Airways of Peterborough, Ontario {{started a}} three-times a day service between the island airport and Montreal's {{international}} airport. Flights cost $38 one-way and included {{a stop in}} Peterborough. The trip between Toronto and Montreal took two-and-a-half hours. Otonabee operated a Saunders ST-27 twin-engine propeller plane on the route. The plane could carry 19 passengers in a two-seat-per-row configuration with a single aisle between the seats. From downtown-to-downtown, the trip took 15 minutes longer than one using commercial jets between Malton and Montreal, which also required the trip to Malton from downtown by bus, while Otonabee's service used a free mini-bus from downtown to the island airport. 1975 was also the year that the island airport {{was used as the}} base for Olga, a Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> helicopter used to dismantle the crane of the new CN Tower under construction and hoist sections of its new antenna into place on top of its concrete tower.|$|E
2500|$|The antenna was {{originally}} {{to be raised}} by crane as well, but during construction the Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> helicopter became available when the United States Army sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named [...] "Olga", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.|$|E
2500|$|The Sikorsky S-60 helicopter, a {{prototype}} [...] "flying crane", {{was derived from}} the S-56 in 1958. Proving to be underpowered, the development of the S-60 led to the larger, turbine-engined Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe military transport helicopter, and its civil S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> variant, which were already on the drawing board by the time the sole example of the S-60 crashed on 3 April 1961.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013, The Dream Chaser Engineering Test Article (ETA) {{was shipped}} to the Dryden Flight Research Center in California {{for a series of}} ground tests and {{aerodynamic}} flight tests. This move to Dryden came about a year after a captive carry test that was conducted near the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on May 29, 2012. During that test, an Erickson <b>Skycrane</b> was used to lift the Dream Chaser to better determine its aerodynamic properties. [...] "The testing at Dryden will include tow, captive-carry and free-flight tests of the Dream Chaser. A truck will tow the vehicle down a runway to validate performance of the nose strut, brakes and tires. The captive-carry flights will further examine the loads the vehicle will encounter during flight and test the performance and flutter of the vehicle up to release from an Erickson <b>Skycrane</b> helicopter. The free-flight tests are designed to validate the Dream Chaser's aerodynamics as well as test the flight control surfaces to verify flight characteristics for approach, flare and landing." [...] A second captive carry flight test was completed on August 22, 2013.|$|E

50|$|Skycranes {{were used}} in 1972 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge {{connecting}} Maryland and the Eastern Shore was being built to bring concrete and other supplies to the construction site. In 1993, an Erickson aerial <b>Skycrane,</b> normally used for hauling lumber in Oregon, {{was used to remove}} the “Statue of Freedom” {{from the top of the}} Capitol dome in Washington, D.C. The statue was placed on the ground while it was being cleaned and restored before being gently returned to the top of the dome, once again with a <b>Skycrane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Initial {{work on the}} Sikorsky [...] "sky-crane" [...] {{helicopters}} {{began in}} 1958 with the piston-engined Sikorsky S-60. The first flight of the turboshaft-powered S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> was on 9 May 1962.|$|E

50|$|The Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> is an American {{twin-engine}} heavy-lift helicopter. It is {{the civil}} {{version of the}} United States Army's CH-54 Tarhe. The S-64 Aircrane is the current production version, manufactured by the Erickson Air-Crane company.|$|E
50|$|Erickson was {{established}} in 1971 in Central Point by Jack Erickson. Originally the Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane,</b> the type certification and manufacturing rights for the S-64 were purchased from Sikorsky Aircraft by Erickson Air-Crane in 1992. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 changes to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. The Aircrane can be fitted with a 2,650-gallon (~10,000 liter) fixed retardant tank {{to assist in the}} control of bushfires. The <b>Skycrane</b> has a support group of a tanker truck, service trailer and lift, and a crew of 8 people.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{helicopters}} became {{commercially available}} after the Vietnam War as helicopter manufacturers focused on selling commercial versions of their military aircraft. For instance, Boeing Vertol Model 107 and Model 234 aircraft {{have been used}} to carry even heavier payloads than their lighter predecessors. But the heaviest loads required a pure aerial crane. The answer came from Sikorsky's S-64 <b>Skycrane.</b> Originally produced for the military as the CH-54 Tarhe for heavy lifting of downed aircraft and artillery pieces, the S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> was nothing more than just enough airframe to attach two powerful engines, the main and tail rotors and transmissions, a cockpit, and a cargo hook and winch system.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to power out of vortex ring state, but this requires having about twice the power it takes to hover. Only one full-scale helicopter, the Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane,</b> {{is able to do}} this, when unladen.|$|E
50|$|The Pratt & Whitney T73 (company {{designation}} JFTD12) is a turboshaft engine. Based on the JT12A, the T73 powered the Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe and its civil counterpart Sikorsky S-64 <b>Skycrane</b> {{flying crane}} heavy-lift helicopters. Turboshaft versions {{for naval use}} are known as the FT12.|$|E
5000|$|The Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe is a {{twin-engine}} heavy-lift helicopter {{designed by}} Sikorsky Aircraft for the United States Army. It {{is named after}} Tarhe (whose nickname was [...] "The Crane"), an 18th-century chief of the Wyandot Indian tribe. The civil version is the S-64 <b>Skycrane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Commonwealth was sculpted by Roland Hinton Perry and was {{installed}} on the dome on May 25, 1905. The statue was removed for restoration by helicopter {{in the summer of}} 1998. The statue was placed back onto the dome by <b>Skycrane</b> in September of the same year, after restoration.|$|E
50|$|Milberry's {{research}} has {{taken him to}} all parts of Canada and to many overseas destinations. Although never a pilot, he has flown in more than 100 types from the Ford Trimotor to the Noorduyn Norseman, C-130 Hercules, CF-18 Hornet, Pitts Special, Sikorsky <b>Skycrane</b> and the giant Antonov 124.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) began {{deploying}} to Camp Radcliff, An Khe, Vietnam, in the Central Highlands and {{was equipped}} with the new M16 rifle, the UH-1 troop carrier helicopter, UH-1-C gunships, the CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopter, and the massive CH-54 <b>Skycrane</b> cargo helicopter. All aircraft carried insignia to indicate their battalion and company.|$|E
50|$|Miguel San Martín (January 6, 1959) is an Argentine {{engineer}} of NASA and {{a science}} educator. He {{is best known}} for his work as Chief Engineer for the Guidance, Navigation, and Control system in the latests missions to Mars. His best known contribution is the <b>SkyCrane</b> system, of which he is coinventor, used in the Curiosity mission for the descent of the rover.|$|E
50|$|On 14 December 2007, the Country Fire Service officially {{announced}} that all fires were contained. The event was South Australia's largest bush fire operation to date with over 800 personnel, 7 fixed wing water bombers and an Elvis <b>Skycrane</b> Helitanker all assisting in firefighting efforts, together with units from Victoria's Country Fire Authority and the Rural Fire Service of New South Wales.|$|E

5000|$|Larger water {{dropping}} helicopters {{such as the}} S-64 <b>Skycrane,</b> {{which can}} hold as much as 3,000 gallons, rivaling fixed-wing airtankers, are increasingly being used.
