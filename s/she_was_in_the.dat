5|$|By 1980, Shabazz was {{overseeing}} the health sciences department, {{and the college}} president decided she could {{be more effective in}} a purely administrative position than <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom. She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement. In her new position, she became a booster and fund-raiser for the college. A year later, she was given tenure. In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.|$|E

While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call-in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men. She was also an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|During early Summer 1902, Charles Martel was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron, along with three other battleships and three armored cruisers. The ship did not participate in the annual fleet maneuvers in JulyAugust of the following year. She remained in the Reserve Squadron, which was renamed the Second Squadron in 1906; by that time, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Division of the Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Germinet. The ship was maintained in a state of en disponibilité armée, a state of reduced readiness with a minimal crew. Charles Martel was in full commission for three months of the year, and in reserve with a reduced crew for the remainder. She remained in this status for the duration of 1907.|$|E

5|$|Guerrero {{was raised}} in the Jamaica Plain and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston after being taken in by other Colombian families. She has had an {{interest}} in acting since a young age and took advantage of free opportunities in the neighborhood or at school. Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that she draws upon in her acting.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, New York {{joined the}} Neutrality Patrol, {{safeguarding}} sea lanes in the North Atlantic, {{and served as}} flagship with the Atlantic Squadron, later redesignated the United States Atlantic Fleet, for the next 27 months. In July 1941, she protected a convoy of U.S. troops moving to garrison Iceland. She saw another modernization in 1940–41 where her main battery elevation was increased from 15 to 30 degrees. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of this refit on 7 December 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, sinking many of the battleships in the U.S. Pacific Fleet and bringing the United States into World War II.|$|E

Later that October, she ventured to the Middle East. Bush said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region in an attempt to improve America's image by highlighting concern for women's health, specifically promoting her breast cancer awareness work with the US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research. She defined the trip as successful, saying that stereotypes were broken on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of writing a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E
5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of developing the album.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{was laid}} up in {{ordinary}} or under repair {{for most of}} the subsequent years of peace, but returned to active service on the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean supporting Lord Hood's occupation of Toulon in 1793, and remained there for several years. During this time she captured the 44-gun French Sibylle. Romney briefly returned to North America and then served in the Red Sea. Assigned to blockade the Dutch coast, Romney ran aground in November 1804 while sailing to join the fleet off Den Helder. She broke up after attempts to float her off failed.|$|E
5|$|San Martino saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa, fought during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. There <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the action, {{at the head of}} the Italian main body. Of the three ships in her division, San Martino was the only vessel to survive the battle. After the war, the ship's career was uneventful, the result of the {{emergence}} of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{had just}} reached his 26th {{birthday}} when the Second World War began {{and the war}} claimed the peak years of his playing career. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and managed to play in numerous wartime league, cup and exhibition matches for Norwich City, Arsenal, Luton Town and Partick Thistle, depending on where he was stationed. On 30 May 1942, he played a single game for Liverpool in a 4–1 win over Everton at Anfield. Shankly was keen on boxing and fought as a middleweight in the RAF, winning a trophy when he was stationed in Manchester. He confirmed in his autobiography that his weight as an RAF boxer was 159 pounds (72kg) and he was only six pounds (2.7kg) heavier than that in 1976. Shankly met his wife, Nessie, in the RAF (<b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WAAF and stationed at the same camp) and they married in 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{dockyard}} and the Admiralty decided to modify her {{for use as}} the Home Fleet's trials and training carrier. In this role she conducted the deck-landing trials {{for most of the}} British postwar naval aircraft in the early 1950s. She was occasionally used to ferry troops and aircraft to and from foreign deployments as well as participating in exercises. In 1951, she helped to transport troops to quell rioting in Cyprus {{after the collapse of the}} Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She was paid off in early 1955 and sold for scrap in late 1956.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh was in {{the shower}} the entire time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Leigh stated <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion's body in a shower curtain and places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation in the scene.|$|E
