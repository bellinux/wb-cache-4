hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer

Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is I s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want LI or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over

out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar I Id a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will

5000|$|The keeping {{of fish in}} an {{aquarium}} became a popular hobby and spread quickly. In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1853, the aquarium craze was launched in England by Philip Henry Gosse who created and stocked the first public aquarium in the London Zoo which {{came to be known}} as the Fish House. Gosse coined the word [...] "aquarium", opting for this term (instead of [...] "aquatic vivarium" [...] or [...] "aqua-vivarium") in 1854 in his book The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea. In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria. In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fad in the United Kingdom.Tank designs and techniques for maintaining water quality were developed by Warington, later cooperating with Gosse until his critical review of the tank water composition. Edward Edwards developed these glass-fronted aquaria in his 1858 patent for a [...] "dark-water-chamber slope-back tank", with water slowly circulating to a reservoir beneath. Germans soon rivaled the British in their interest. In 1854, an anonymous author had two articles published about the saltwater aquaria of the United Kingdom: Die Gartenlaube (The Garden House) entitled Der Ocean auf dem Tische (The Ocean on the Table). However, in 1856, Der <b>See</b> <b>im</b> Glase (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas.

40|$|The {{stability}} of a two-dimensional viscous flow between two rotating porous cylinders is studied. The basic steady flow {{is the most}} general rotationally-invariant solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in which the velocity has both radial and azimuthal components, and the azimuthal velocity profile depends on the Reynolds number. It is shown that {{for a wide range}} of the parameters of the problem, the basic flow is unstable to small two-dimensional perturbations. Neutral curves in the space of parameters of the problem are computed. Calculations show that the stability properties of this flow are determined by the azimuthal velocity at the inner cylinder when the direction of the radial flow is from the inner cylinder to the outer one and by the azimuthal velocity at the outer cylinder when the direction of the radial flow is reversed. This work is a continuation of our previous study of an inviscid instability in flows between rotating porous cylinders (<b>see</b> <b>IM</b> 2013) ...|$|E

In all such examples, one may say that the developments they led to have far reaching consequences, even if the results themselves are not much more than curiosities.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the German service sector statistic 2001 for company oriented services in the New Länder (without Berlin), which have been derived from data of the regional statistical offices. The article can be regarded as an update of an earlier version (<b>see</b> “Wirtschaft <b>im</b> Wandel”, 12 / 2003, p. 342 - 349). Fundamental results are: 1. Compared to 2000, the New Länder’s proportion of Germany’s total revenue and employment in company oriented services has, compared to 2000, slightly increased, but remains rather small. 2. The profitability of East German companies has deteriorated, measured by total expenses per sales unit. Partially this might be due to the increased number of businesses. 3. Last evaluation’s assumption, that East German company’s labor productivity (gross value added per employees) is half of the West German’s, has been proofed in this actual evaluation. An illustration of reasons is not being provided since it has been discussed extensively in the first evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the aid organization IM´s (the Swedish Organization for Individual Relief) two year project in Landskrona, with a focal point on their two activities “Move it” and Café for women and girls. Focus lie on how IM has strived to achieve their objectives and perceived effects. The evaluation is conducted from an individual perspective, seeking participating individual’s and cooperation partner’s perception. Secondly the paper discusses on what ground and what possibility the project has for integrating newly arrived immigrant youths and women in relation to theories of integration, social capital and sport-based social mobility. Semi-structured interviews were held with key persons, participants and volunteers and were complemented with participant observations at activities, in the area and by following the work of the project leader. 	Effects are detected at mainly an individual level. Participants have gained language skills, tested sports and know slightly more about the town. Especially the women have received weak ties with Swedes and other participants and to some degree extended their knowledge about the society. Some youths have “dropped off” to other organizations but the amount is not established here. The project mainly works on a “structural integration” level. It appears to lower prejudices among the participants and volunteers, however most likely they did not hold strong prejudices from the start. Contact with associations was experienced mainly positive however a few negative contacts have occurred and could have enlarged prejudices about immigrant, Swedes, youths, the association etc. The findings show a very limited enlarged social capital for the participants, but the women’s weak ties represent some. To enlarge the positive effects <b>seen</b> <b>IM</b> ought to focus more on language skills, knowledge about the town and develop relationships rather then centre on visiting associations. The volunteers have also gained from their engagement, for example interest in cultures or personal development. To sustain IM´s activity in Landskrona it requires additional volunteers, as well as team building and communication regarding the future. Furthermore the “Move it” activity need to focus more on socializing, continuity and gaining a wider context...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade or so, {{distributional}} methods have become the mainstay of semantic modelling in Computational Linguistics. As such, they have also been applied the automatic modelling of verb meaning. However, more than with other lexical categories, the research into verb semantics has taken its inspiration from the idea that a verb’s meaning is strongly linked to its syntactic behaviour and more specifically, to its selectional preferences. Depending on how they use these selectional preferences, distributional models of verb meaning come in two flavours. The first approach has its historical origins in the linguistic research tradition into verb valency and frame semnatics and is in principle purely syntactical in nature. A verb’s semantic category is said to be inferrable from its distribution over subcategorization (subcat) frames, i. e. the possible combinations of syntactic verb arguments like subject, direct object, indirect object etc. Additionally, this purely syntactic information can be extended with some high-level semantic information like the animacy of the verb arguments (<b>see</b> Schulte <b>im</b> Walde (2006...|$|R
