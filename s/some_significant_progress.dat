30|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} on waveforms for 5 G wireless networks [30 – 35]. In particular, faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling has recently received renewed interest since it can potentially increase the system capacity by packing more data in the time and/or frequency domains [30 – 33]. In the time domain, this {{can be achieved by}} allowing data bearing pulses to be sent faster. While this design destroys the orthogonality, satisfactory detection performance can still be achieved by employing a sophisticated detection technique at the receiver to mitigate the intentional ISI introduced at the transmitter. In addition, employment of FTN signaling in both time and frequency domains results in multi-carrier FTN, which attains larger spectrum efficiency compared to FTN in time or frequency alone [31]. Although <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> <b>progresses</b> have been achieved in recent years on understanding FTN signaling, {{more research is needed to}} study and develop efficient designs to meet the performance and QoS requirements of 5 G wireless systems.

Achieving doublet-triplet splitting without fine [...] tuning is chief among them.
