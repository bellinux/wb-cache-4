Because of her very strong morals about intimacy and marriage, Maria became upset afterwards and demanded that he marry her. Cataldo showed her a <b>savings</b> <b>book</b> with a $400 deposit and promised to marry her. She continued to meet with him at the boarding house in the hopes that he would consent to marrying her. However, he continued to put the marriage off for several months. In fact he was already married to a woman in Italy, with whom he had children. Barbella was devastated when Cataldo told her that he was returning to Italy and was ending the relationship. Barbella then told her mother about the situation. Her mother confronted Cataldo and insisted he marry Barbella but he said the only way he would do that was if they paid him $200. In New York City on April 26, 1895 at approximately 9:30 AM, Domenico Cataldo was playing cards in a saloon on East 13th Street, and had planned to board a ship leaving for Italy that afternoon. Barbella entered the bar and there was a brief exchange. [...] "Only a pig can marry you!" [...] were his last words. Barbella produced a straight razor and slashed his neck so swiftly Cataldo had no chance to scream. He staggered out the door, clutching his throat with both hands, knocking Barbella over, spraying blood everywhere. Finally, as he reached Avenue A, he lurched off the curb and fell twitching into the gutter, where he died.|$|E

We analyse real decisions on retirement savings by using qualitative data. This allows us to examine how different, perceived decision-making criteria have led to actual investment decisions by {{taking into account the}} context in which such decisions are made. Our main results are as follows. We find evidence that taxes do not matter much. Financial planning for retirement consists of saving discretionary income instead of the required savings premium and choosing a secure type of investment which yields more than a <b>savings</b> <b>book.</b> Savers do not base their decisions on calculating and comparing rates of return or tax benefits. Instead, we find strong influences of relatively unqualified relatives, bank clerks and the desire for security. Thus, the financial outcome is strongly linked with the decision-making context and decision-making processes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. The first two essays study the association between tax aggressiveness and financial reporting aggressiveness. There is an emerging debate about whether firms tradeoff between tax savings and reported earnings. Essay 1 examines this relationship in the Canadian context and finds that tax aggressiveness is negatively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness, suggesting {{the existence of a}} tradeoff. However, closely-held firms seem to be making no tradeoffs between tax <b>savings</b> and <b>book</b> income. This essay also finds that closely-held firms are more aggressive in pursuing tax savings compared to other firms. Essay 2 examines the tradeoff question in the North American context. I find that tax reporting aggressiveness is positively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness for U. S. firms (i. e., U. S. firms in general do not seem to tradeoff between the tax <b>savings</b> and <b>book</b> income), while negatively associated for Canadian firms (i. e., Canadian firms do seem to tradeoff between pursuit of tax <b>savings</b> and <b>book</b> income). Within the U. S. sub-sample, there is no difference in tradeoff behavior between closely-held and widely-held firms. Closely-held firms in Canada do not seem to tradeoff between book income and tax savings, thereby pursuing both tax aggressiveness and financial reporting aggressiveness simultaneously. Essay 3 focuses on financial reporting and examines the association between IFRS adoption and executive compensation. More specifically, I examine whether IFRS better reflects firms' and managers' performance. I find that accounting-based pay for performance sensitivity is stronger in the year of IFRS adoption. My results show that CFOs earned approximately $ 108, 000 more in the year of IFRS adoption. In contrast, the chief executive officer's (CEO) compensation did not change significantly in the year of IFRS adoption. I also find CF Os' bonus relative to CEO bonus increased by more than 20 % in the year of IFRS adoption...|$|R

50|$|Mediobanca {{was set up}} {{to provide}} {{medium-term}} financing for manufacturers and establish a direct relationship between the banking sector and the investment needs of the reorganization of industry after the devastation caused by World War II. The Banking Act of 1936 established a clear separation between short term and medium-to-long term financing and the major banks had opted for specializing in short-term loans and there was the institution that would deal with financing for the flotation of companies that wished to obtain a stock market listing. In addition to granting consolidated loans against certificates of deposit and <b>savings</b> <b>books,</b> Mediobanca developed its activity of placement of bonds and shares issued by Italian companies. The professionalism developed by the bank under the, some would say brilliant, guidance of Enrico Cuccia enabled it to quickly acquire a position of leadership in the field of investment banking in Italy. In the mid-1950s, Mediobanca entered into agreements with important foreign partners (Lazard Group, Berliner Händel-Gesellschaft, Lehman Brothers, Sofina) that enabled the bank to play a role on the international market and obtained a Stock Exchange listing in 1956.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, {{transitional}} socialist economies (TSEs) in Central and Eastern Europe were only somewhat {{more sophisticated than}} shell money systems: <b>savings</b> <b>books</b> or currency had {{to be used for}} most transactions and there was no risk assessment, information monitoring and acquisition, or portfolio management. The TSEs have moved toward a two-tiered banking system but they lag in the development of competitive, market-based financial systems. In several TSEs the financial system seems {{to be part of a}} shell game to hide the losses of the real economy. The authors argue that rapid, successful economic reform requires putting the shell game to an end. They review several contentious issues of financial reform in the TSEs, especially issues involving macrofinance, corporate finance, the internal debt problems, and the need to build efficient banks. The authors contend that the banks should be"cleaned up"when they are privatized, to prevent the quick reemergence of debt problems. They believe that either of the proposed alternatives for shaping financial systems in the TSEs - very highly capitalized banking or narrow banking - would minimize the need for future support. Either alternative would reduce leverage in the TSEs and provide more financial stability. But taking concerns about moral hazard to an extreme - prohibiting debt finance - could starve new firms for credit and limit economic growth.
