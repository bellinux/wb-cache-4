40|$|This study {{identifies}} systemic {{problems in}} the New Zealand Agricultural Innovation System (AIS) that affect the ability {{of participants in the}} agricultural sectors to co-develop technologies. We integrate structural and functional streams of innovation system enquiry, gathering data through 30 semi-structured interviews with individuals in Government, industry and research. Interviews explored perceptions of the influence of actors, interactions, institutions, infrastructure, and market structure on the effectiveness of AIS functions. Examples of systemic problems were: (i) a lack of facilitative and transformational leadership and systemic intermediaries to support the formation of <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>agendas</b> in vertically and horizontally fragmented industries; (ii) a culture of hunting for funding within research organisations; hindering sustained involvement of researchers in innovation, (iii) a large number of actors in the R&D component of the AIS competing for public resources to pursue uncoordinated innovation agendas; and (iv) a lack of institutional support for interactions between actors and roles that support interactions, such as innovation platforms and innovation brokers. The existing New Zealand AIS limits innovation to a linear process; restricting opportunities for innovation to occur and fostering competition amongst organisations that collectively have much to contribute to innovation in the agricultural sectors through constructive collaboration and roles in all facets of the innovation process. These findings indicate an urgent need to create a policy and legislative framework, built on a systemic understanding of innovation that more pro-actively stimulates and fosters co-innovation. Such a framework would facilitate the formation and effectiveness of innovation-brokering organisations and multi-actor platforms, enabling coordinated <b>innovation</b> <b>agenda</b> setting and prioritisation of issues in which all actors in the value chain and innovation support system jointly articulate a shared agenda for change...|$|R

40|$|CSA Oceans {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} policy needs CSA Oceans has completed its preliminary analysis of policy needs. The public deliverable {{reports on the}} current status of marine and maritime policies relevant to JPI Oceans and identifies examples of science to policy mechanisms. The report uses stakeholder input to identify the needs of different policies to fulfil their objectives. One of the underlying issues is thought to be a lack of integration between marine and maritime activities. It was suggested that new technologies, integrated systems and greater data sharing could be the key to developing more holistic management strategies. Stakeholders also identified several examples of effective science to policy mechanisms which include ICES, the IPCC assessment, and science-policy activities of the European Marine Board. Evidence for the public deliverable was gathered from three stakeholder consultation exercises conducted in 2013. This involved a series of stakeholder workshops, a national funding agencies questionnaire, and an online consultation. Next steps The next step for CSA Oceans - Work Package 5 is to build on the findings of the first deliverable. The next deliverable will develop case studies, based on the examples identified, and suggest how JPI Oceans could improve science to policy mechanisms in Europe. Both deliverables of Work Package 5 will be used to inform the content of the JPI Oceans <b>Strategic</b> Research and <b>Innovation</b> <b>Agenda</b> and Implementation Plan. Stakeholder inputs are at the core of this deliverable to ensure that the <b>Strategic</b> Research and <b>Innovation</b> <b>Agenda</b> and the Implementation Plan are developed in parallel with the opinions of the European marine and maritime community. ...|$|R

Currently, foreign cosmetic products and brands have occupied 80 % of the market share in China, and domestic companies are under pressure to compete with them.

40|$|<b>Strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> is {{an issue}} that is {{frequently}} debated by the recent studies. The contemporary organizations almost in all industries seek to increase their <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> capabilities in order to possess a sustainable competitive advantage. Similarly, in the hospitality industry <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> is an essential instrument of gaining competitive advantage in the marketplaces. In modern days of hospitality and tourism, satisfying consurmers with providing only accommodation and catering services is not sustainable since demand is becoming diversified and rivals are offering new services. Thus, <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> may assist hotel firms in meeting new demand and expanding the range of services they offer. Therefore, the purposes of this paper are to measure the level of <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> of hotel firms, and to reveal the obstacles to <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> activities. The paper will also examine the importance of <b>strategic</b> <b>innovation</b> for hotel firms.

The practical implications concern the production of instructive material and the application of strategic management initiatives in industry. The proposed themes and sub themes can serve as a logical framework to develop and update publications, which have been instrumental in their own right to shape the field.

The added value of the implementation of this agenda will be a move towards sustainable development resulting from scientifically grounded and informed decision-based – both integrated across disciplines and {{the full extent of the}} DBS system. The development of the SRIA was achieved using a cross-disciplinary team of scientists who through a series of workshops worked directly with stakeholders from research and education, government and industry to identify their needs and the current opportunities. This was used to inform the scientific research direction to derive current state of the art and this knowledge in conjunction with a review of historical and current research projects and programmes was utilised to effectively shape the SRIA. The document introduces the issues and challenges involved (Section 1), outlines the approaches used to develop the SRIA (Section 2) and the corresponding results (Section 3) were used to identify twenty one research topics.

To evaluate the performance of the airport operations reliable, quantifiable and resilient Key Performance Indicators are required. In the context of air traffic, performance is primarily characterized by the amount of flight movements, handled aircrafts on ground, delays in operations and passengers operated. The objective of our research is to derive a consolidated set of Key Performance Indicators, primary focuses the airport airside operations, which will allow both a comprehensive view of the airport system and an efficient, holistic and performance based management of the day of operations enabled by realtime measurements and modelbased predictions for the future system states. To meet this challenge, factors with relevant impact on the airport airside performance are identified, clustered and evaluated to derive reasonable Key Performance Indicators. Three Key Performance Indicators are chosen which are determined with the help of 22 Performance Indicators split in two levels. Applying those Key Performance Indicators in the concept of Performance-Based Airport Management an improved airport performance is expected as the knowledge about upcoming disturbing events during the operations enables the various stakeholders to intervene ahead of time and such to reduce negative impacts.
