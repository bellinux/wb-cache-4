5|$|In the Paris of the 1860s, {{despite being}} a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet {{struggled}} to get his stage works performed. The capital's two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet's professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him {{to bring to the}} <b>stage</b> <b>two</b> full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of Zeppelin {{commenced}} on 8 February, with threats to Greece and Crete. A provisional date for the supposed invasion was set at 29 March (to {{take advantage of the}} full moon). On 10 March the operation moved to a second stage, where the fictional operation was delayed until April and May to join up with a supposed Soviet invasion of Bulgaria. <b>Stage</b> <b>two</b> was communicated through a sub-plan called Dungloe, involving double agents back in England. The story passed to the Germans was that radio messages would inform friendly leaders in Yugoslavia of the intended invasion dates and any delays.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposed}} ski flying hills, most of which never reached the construction <b>stage.</b> <b>Two</b> were planned in Finland, in Kemijärvi and Ylitornio, but neither projects were realized after their inception in 2007. In Norway, prior to the renovation of Vikersund, there were serious talks about constructing a new ski flying hill at Rødkleiva in Oslo. The most recent proposal has come from China, together with German architects Graft, who are in the development stages of a ski jumping and flying hill complex at the Wangtiane ski resort in the Changbai Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., <b>stage</b> <b>two)</b> than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of August16, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents in St. Joseph Peninsula State Park and Stone State Park on Cape San Blas in Gulf County, Florida. Two shelters were opened in Bay County, one at the Dean Bozeman High School and the other at Bozeman Learning Center. Voluntary evacuation orders were also given to residents living in low-lying areas along the coastline. Although no plans {{were put in place}} to open shelters, the Emergency Operations Center in Washington County raised their activation level to <b>stage</b> <b>two.</b> In Franklin County, the Emergency Operations Center was placed at stage three and voluntary evacuation orders were issued for Alligator Point. After an afternoon briefing, officials in Walton County declared a State of Emergency based on available information on the storm. In Wakulla County, the American Red Cross opened a shelter in Crawfordville at a local church.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their fears about the event's safety and delayed their decision on whether to allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the licence application. The local fire service were also concerned about access {{in the event of a}} fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to <b>stage</b> <b>two</b> separate performances, on the 8 and 9 October.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the <b>stage.</b> <b>Two</b> he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (based on both the movie and the book). Sir Elton John will be composing the score for the project with playwright Paul Rudnick, who had written some early scenes for the screenplay, mostly with Miranda, writing the book and lyrics. McCollum did not say when he expected it to premiere but hoped it would eventually play on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|McCabe's {{most highly}} rated innings {{came in the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. England {{compiled}} 8/658 before declaring late on the second day, and McCabe had toiled for 21 overs without success. McCabe arrived at the crease with the dismissal of Bradman at 2/111 to join Brown, and after two unsuccessful appeals against the light, he was 19 {{at the close of}} play after 35 minutes of batting with the total at 3/138, having seen Brown dismissed for 48. McCabe had struck three boundaries by this <b>stage,</b> <b>two</b> cut shots and an on drive, and had survived a final spell from fast bowler Ken Farnes without a sightscreen, accompanied by nightwatchman Frank Ward.|$|E

5|$|One hundred cyclists {{had entered}} for the 1906 Tour de France; only 82 of them {{showed up at}} the start. Only 49 cyclists {{finished}} the first stage, and the number of active cyclists quickly fell to 37 in <b>stage</b> <b>two,</b> 29 in stage three, until 16 after stage eight. At that point, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages. At the end of the Tour de France, only 14 cyclists finished. The cyclists were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, but they were not allowed to work together.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. <b>Stage</b> <b>two</b> involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage involves Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|E
5|$|The {{road race}} {{stages in the}} Netherlands were both marred by {{repeated}} crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13minutes against {{the remainder of the}} field. Porte took the pink jersey after this <b>stage.</b> <b>Two</b> days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22teams, as 17 of them came away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.|$|E
50|$|Caird has devised and <b>staged</b> <b>two</b> {{celebrations}} for WWF, the Worldwide Fund for Nature: the Religion and Inter-faith Ceremony at Assisi in 1986 and Gifts for Living Planet at Bakhtapur, Nepal in 2000.|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} {{of the project was}} {{approved}} in late 1953 and construction began in early 1954. Initially a two-stage construction was conceived. But the total generation capacity of the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> was too large for load forecasts of that time. So a time lag of more than 10 years was proposed between the <b>two</b> <b>stages.</b> Within <b>two</b> years thereafter, it came to be noticed that the 10 years time tag between these <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> will not be affordable and to cope up with the power requirements, the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> should be merged and both the stages should be constructed simultaneously. Hence, it was accepted that the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> have to be executed as one.|$|R
