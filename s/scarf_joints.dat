The {{construction}} {{is very different from}} the English barn [...] typically being built using the square rule method of joinery, raised in bents, [...] increasingly of sawn rather than hewn timbers, common rafter roof framing with purlin plates, designed to be used with a , straight posts rather than flared (gunstock) posts, and dropped tie beam framing rather than the English tying joint. The doors are mounted on the gable end rather than the sidewall and after the 1840s mounted on rollers so they slide sideways rather than being mounted on hinges and swinging outward. Sometimes they have interior sliding doors. Doors on rollers are believed to have been a development from rail cars which had sliding doors. A full basement became standard and was used primarily for manure management with trap doors in the floor of the tie-up so manure was easily shoveled into the basement for later use on the fields. This is a significant difference between the Pennsylvania Barn where the cows were housed on the basement level. The basements also had sliding doors, sometimes arranged as a drive through passage. The foundation is dry laid stone, some of which may have been split rather than just being field-stone; and some barns have a top course of large, rectangular, quarried stones. The drive floor was not needed for hand threshing since threshing machines were available by this time. <b>Scarf</b> <b>joints</b> were needed to join timbers longitudinally because these barns are larger in size and the timber supply was more limited so full length timbers were not available. Roof overhangs of a foot are typically built in on the gables and eaves protecting the walls from water. Later in the 19th century these barns may also have ventilators or a cupola on the roof to help reduce moisture build-up inside. Stairways are sometimes found in New England barns but built-in ladders are common but less prevalent than ladders found in the New World Dutch barn. The number and size of cows were larger and were given more headroom so the New England barns were not just longer and wider but taller. Also the New England barn was popular during the period in northern New England when the connected farm building arrangement was popular and so were more likely to be connected to the house through a series of smaller rooms. Some New England barns have an indoor silo. These barns are easier to add on to by adding more bays. The New England barn almost always has a gable roof, but a gambrel roof form may be found on some New England barns. Sometimes the New England barn is framed with studs in the walls and horizontal sheathing boards instead of the more common rails with vertical sheathing.|$|E

50|$|The {{device was}} invented by William Bridges Adams in May 1842, because of his dissatisfaction with the <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> and other systems of joining rails then in use. He noted that to form the scarf joint the rail was halved in {{thickness}} at its ends, where the stress was greatest. It was first deployed on the Eastern Counties Railway in 1844, but only as a wedge between the adjoining rails. Adams and Robert Richardson patented the invention in 1847, but in 1849 James Samuel, the engineer of the ECR developed fishplates that could be bolted to the rails.|$|E
50|$|During the dynastic period, {{which began}} in around 3200 BC, Egyptian art {{developed}} significantly, and this included furniture design. Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as leather, and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration. Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so had to be imported into the country from other places, particularly Phoenicia. The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this, as well as construction of veneers in which low quality cheap wood {{was used as the}} main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Bridges Adams {{patented}} {{an improved}} carriage spring, {{which he called}} [...] "bow springs". These {{could also be used}} on railway carriages, and the manufacture proved profitable. The manufacture was based in the Currier Factory in Drury Lane and Parker Street, Soho. The business was carried out in the name of Samuel Adams, Bridges Adams's uncle. In 1842 the factory moved from its small premises to three acres of land adjoining the Eastern Counties Railway at Fair Field, Bow. The company now traded as Adams & Co. He founded the Fairfield Locomotive Works (...) in Bow, East London, in 1843, where he specialized in light engines, steam railcars (or railmotors) and inspection trolleys. These were sold in small numbers to railways all over Britain and Ireland, including the Fairfield steam carriage for the broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway and the Enfield for his most important customer, the Eastern Counties Railway, with its headquarters at nearby Stratford. Dissatisfied with the <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> then in use for joining iron track, he invented the first railway fishplate, {{in the form of an}} unbolted wedge between adjoining chairs, in collaboration with Robert Richardson, a junior engineer under Peter Bruff on the Eastern Counties Railway. The two men patented the invention in 1847. Although the design was successful, with sales to the Eastern Counties Railway among others, financial difficulties forced Adams to relinquish the patent. This [...] "wedge" [...] version was soon overtaken by an improved, bolted design by James Samuel of the Eastern Counties Railway. He also supplied an 2-2-0 well tank to the Roman Railway.|$|E

5000|$|The Viking shipbuilders had no written {{diagrams}} or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder {{pictured the}} longship before its construction, {{based on previous}} builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel {{was made up of}} several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes [...] - [...] the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about 25 mm thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about 20 mm. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles {{to the surface of the}} plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the meginhufr, was about 37 mm thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about 25 mm-30 mm and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. At midlength, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about 170 mm apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> fixed with nails were also used.|$|E

40|$|A {{request of}} {{material}} change when performing repairs on composite parts of SAABs JAS 39 Gripen has {{lead to the}} initiation of this project. The aim {{is to create a}} quicker and more robust repair method. The requested method of repair is to use a direct-cured repair patch made of CFRP fabric instead of CFRP tape and to mount the patch with a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> see Figure 1. 1. The fabric patch should then provide a robust quasi-isotropic repair, where the operator not is dependent of complete design data such as ply-directions etc. Today tape repairs are made on tape laminate and fabric repairs made on fabric laminate. The new method is to repair tape laminate with a fabric patch. This project will evaluate the possibility of implementing this method. The work started with a literature study to find out how repairs in composite parts of the airframe are being performed today. SAABs in-house analytical tools were then used to try to predict the results and examine some of the details in the questions at issue. Finite element models were then constructed to simulate a previous physical test program conducted to validate a repair method using a step joint and a direct-cured repair patch. If the FE models could show similar results as the physical tests the results from the FE models then can be assumed to be credible. The results of this project indicate that the change from fabric to tape in the repair patch can be done without disturbing the load path of a quasi isotropic composite laminate. Fabric repairs in orthotropic composite plates results in a knock-down of about 40 %. The use of a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> instead of a step joint should also work well as the repair patches show similar strains in the centre of the patches. The difference between step <b>joint</b> and <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> is the strain {{near the edge of the}} patch. It increases with <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> and it may lead to an earlier fibre failure in the repair patch. Results from the analysis of the bonded joint indicate that a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> yields in a lower and more evenly distributed shear stress than the step joint. This indicates that the bonded joint in the step joint will reach failure earlier then the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R

30|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} and numerical (CZM) comparison was made between {{several types of}} adhesive joints, and considering three adhesives. From the experimentally obtained results, {{it is possible to}} conclude that the performance of the joints is very influenced by the choice of the adhesive. For the Araldite® AV 138 and large values of LO, the joint with the best performance was the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> because the this joint takes advantage of the adhesives’ strength, even for brittle adhesives, due to the typically flat stress distributions. However, for shorter LO, due the area effect in the DLJ, these joints behave better. Higher LO lead to large peak stresses and the area effect is cancelled because of the adhesive’s brittleness. On the other hand, for the Araldite® 2015, since this adhesive is more ductile, the DLJ performs best. Under these conditions, the joints take advantage of the higher bonded area, despite the peak stresses. The <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> approaches the DLJ for higher LO because of taking advantage of the more uniform stress distributions and due the DLJ attaining the adherends’ limit strength. The Sikaforce® 7752 also performs best in the DLJ joint type. Moreover, for LO[*]=[*] 50  mm, Pm is identical to the Araldite® 2015 due to the adherends’ plastic deformation effect. The other joint types are much below the DLJ, with slight advantage for the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint.</b> However, the fabrication complications may not justify the advantage over the SLJ. The CZM simulations with triangular cohesive laws showed a good match to respective experiments, except for consistent Pm under predictions when using the Sikaforce® 7752, because of the ductility of this adhesive, which is not correctly modelled with a triangular CZM. Nonetheless, rough predictions were achieved. The <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> showed slightly better strength predictions by CZM modelling. Actually, due to the improved stress distributions of this joint type, the cohesive strengths rule the failure process, instead of the failure displacements. The maximum errors obtained by joint type were as follows, always for the Sikaforce® 7752 : 16.0 % (SLJ), 15.6 % (DLJ), 13.9 % (stepped-lap joint) and 12.7 % (<b>scarf</b> <b>joint).</b> For the other adhesives, the correspondence was significantly better. Thus, it can be concluded that CZM is an accurate tool for the strength prediction of bonded joints, which enabled to define the best geometry for each adhesive type (and vice versa).|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{strength}} of epoxy adhesively bonded <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> of dissimilar adherends, namely SUS {{304 stainless steel}} and YH 75 aluminum alloy is examined on several scarf angles and various bond thicknesses under uniaxial tensile loading. Scarf angle, θ= 45 °, 60 ° and 75 ° are employed. The bond thickness, t between the dissimilar adherends is controlled to be ranged between 0. 1 and 1. 2 mm. Finite element (FE) analysis is also executed to investigate the stress distributions in the adhesive layer of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> by ANSYS 11 code.

40|$|As {{advanced}} composites see {{increased use}} in military and commercial aircraft, {{there is a}} growing need to understand the structural behavior of these composite structures after repair. In this work, a numerical and experimental investigation was conducted to characterize the sensitivity of the behavior of the composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> particularly with regard to failure, to changes in the height of the blunt tip, the adherend thickness, and the ratio of the two parameters, defined as the "blunt height ratio". All specimens manufactured for the experimental testing and modeled via finite element analysis were constructed from the same adherend material and adhesive material: Toray Industries T 800 / 3900 pre-impregnated carbon fiber/epoxy composite material, and 3 MTM Scotch-WeldTM Structural Adhesive Film AF 555 M, respectively. In the numerical work, linear elastic plane strain analyses were performed via finite element modeling to determine the stress and strain fields for a homogeneously orthotropic configuration with moduli equivalent to a [± 15]nS configuration and for cases of n equal to 1, 3, and 5; blunt tip heights of 0. 0. 6 tply, and tply; and blunt height ratios of 0 %, 5 %, 8. 3 %, and 25 %. In the experimental work, all configurations considered were tested in uniaxial tension to failure, and have adherends of a [15] 3 s laminate, which are bonded via a single layer of film adhesive with different scarf angles of 3 °, 5 °, and 10 °, and have blunt tip heights of 1, 2, 3, and 4 plies. The results from the numerical investigation indicate that the strain fields of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> depend on the blunt height ratio, and not any individual lengthscale as the finite thickness of the joint affects the load traveling through the joint. At the corner of the blunt tip, there are large gradients of longitudinal and shear strain that dissipate {{along the length of the}} bondline and away from the blunt tip and this magnified strain at the corner is not due to any specific lengthscale, but is simply due to the existence of the corner. As the blunt height ratio increases, the size and magnitude of this gradient increases and approaches the center of the joint due to the effects of the finite thickness. The general response of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> with a blunt tip can be modeled as a hybrid of an "ideal" <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> dominated by shear, and a butt joint, dominated by longitudinal strain, acting in parallel. In the experimental work, the load-displacement responses of all specimens exhibit the same general characteristics, with an initial linear region that transitions to increasingly nonlinear behavior to the point of maximum load. The maximum load-carrying capability of all test cases indicate that decreasing the blunt height ratio or the scarf angle increases the load-carrying capability of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint.</b> In addition, variations of the maximum load amongst specimens of the same test case and differences in the type of failure throughout the joint region are shown to relate to the cured film adhesive thickness. Recommendations for future work are presented, particularly the need to perform additional numerical and experimental work using thicker laminates with a constant blunt height ratio on the order of 1 %, and with varying heights of the blunt tip in order to determine any sensitivity of the response of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> to the height of the blunt tip. by Gary M.
