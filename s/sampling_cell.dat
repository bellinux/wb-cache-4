40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{progress}} on gas sensing using real-time correlation spectroscopy, where a gas {{is used to}} "recognise" its own spectral absorption lines. Our recent results on methane detection using pressure modulation spectrometry are shown, and a new method of modulating the absorption of the gas in the reference cell section of an ammonia detection system is reported for the first time. The basic concept of correlation spectrometry involves the passage of light sequentially through two gas cells, a reference cell containing a known quantity of the gas to be detected, and a <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> where {{the presence of the}} gas is to be determined. An optical signal passing sequentially through the cells will suffer absorption in each of the cells. If the absorption in the reference cell is periodically modulated, then the total absorption depends on whether the gas absorption lines in the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> correlate with those in the reference cell gas. If the absorption lines of the gases do not correlate strongly, then the modulation index of the optical signal is essentially unaffected by the presence of the different gas in the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell.</b> Therefore, the concentration of a specific gas in the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> can be quantified by this means. Pressure modulation of the gas within the reference cell is achieved by the use of a novel acoustic resonator. This device provides a reasonable pressure ratio whilst being compact and easily driven. Unlike previous piston-compressors, the high modulation frequency of the resonator improves the tolerance to transients in the optical signal produced by the passage of dust through the optical beam. The system can be tailored to detect a desired gas by changing the reference gas and a broadband section filter. Results for methane are presented in this paper. A novel method for detection of ammonia gas is reported for the first time. This involves Stark modulation of the gas in the reference cell, by the application of an electric field. This method is applicable to gases with strong electric dipole moments, such as NH 3, CO 2, NOx and HCl...|$|E

40|$|A new {{apparatus}} {{for performing}} laser-excited photothermal lens spectroscopy is described. The apparatus uses a sub-microliter cylindrical <b>sample</b> <b>cell,</b> chopped laser excitation, and a continuous probe laser to perform photothermal lens spectrometry. The sample is irradiated with a constant irradiance beam, and the photothermal lens forms due to thermal diffusion through the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> walls.

Experimental results are obtained for organic and inorganic complexes in ethanol solution and {{compared to those}} obtained using a standard <b>sample</b> <b>cell.</b> Results for dicyclopentadienyl iron solutions excited with 10 mW 514. 5 nm Ar+ laser radiation show that the cylindrical <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> signal is 32 % of that obtained using the standard <b>sample</b> <b>cell.</b> This ratio is in reasonable agreement with that expected based on thermal diffusion models.

Two methods of modulating the reference cell absorption are reported, pressure and Stark modulation. Results are presented for methane detection employing pressure modulation.

However, due to high heterogeneity of particle size and different morphologies in mountain river channel {{sediment transport}} in mountain river cannot be treated similar to its lowland counterpart. As such, the present research was carried out at Sungai Sedim by applying high resolution bed profiling and total load measurement. A total of 36 numbers of <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> was prepared within the six meter by six meter study reach. Sediment data was collected fromeach <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> while the bed profile was measured at every 0. 2 meter increment at each axis for the entire study reach. The measured bed elevation was transformed into Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and further expanded to Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) model using ArcGIS 9. 3. Based on geostatistical and cell resolution analysis conducted, Radial Basis Function (RBF) was identified {{to be the most}} suitable interpolation method {{to be used in the}} study. Similar method also applied to derive the measured total load grid for the study area. TBML equation by Sinnakaudan (2010) was employed to formulate a spatial distribution prediction model to show the spatial discrete variability of the total load using the map algebra functions. Discrepancy Ratio (DR) analysis indicates that the prediction model fails to show the variability in the total load for the study reach. Thus, a Correction Factor Grid (CFG) was introduced. The application of CFG shows a promising DR result of 80. 5 % and 54. 9 % for two set of sample tested respectively. Thus, it is recommended that TBML equation should include spatial variability and localized properties in its derivation since the inclusion of spatial variability provides more precise overview towards sediment transport pattern at mountain rivers...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{instruments}} {{became available}} on the market that provide the possibility to perform eddy covariance flux measurements of CH 4 and many other trace gases, including the traditional CO 2 and H 2 O. Most of these instruments employ laser spectroscopy, where a cross-sensitivity to H 2 O is frequently observed leading to an increased dilution effect. Additionally, sorption processes at the intake tube walls modify and delay the observed H 2 O signal in closed-path systems more strongly than the signal of the sampled trace gas. Thereby, a phase shift between the trace gas and H 2 O fluctuations is introduced that dampens the H 2 O flux observed in the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell.</b> For instruments that do not provide direct H 2 O measurement in the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell,</b> transfer functions from externally measured H 2 O fluxes are needed to estimate the effect of H 2 O on trace gas flux measurements. The effects of cross-sensitivity and the damping are shown for an eddy covariance setup with the Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (FGGA, Los Gatos Research Inc.) that measures CO 2, CH 4, and H 2 O fluxes. This instrument is technically identical with the Fast Methane Analyzer (FMA, Los Gatos Research Inc.) that does not measure H 2 O concentrations. Hence, we used measurements from a FGGA to derive a modified correction for the FMA accounting for dilution as well as phase shift effects in our instrumental setup. With our specific setup for eddy covariance flux measurements, the cross-sensitivity counteracts the damping effects, which compensate each other. Hence, the new correction only deviates very slightly from the traditional Webb, Pearman, and Leuning density correction, which is calculated from separate measurements of the atmospheric water vapor flux...|$|E

30|$|As the {{analysis}} mentioned in Section 3.1, {{to capture the}} discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall, it requires that the system can sense the time-varying HME of each sub-region. In our sensing model design, each <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> corresponds to a sub-region of the monitored region, and the PIR sensors are employed to capture the time-varying HME of these sampling cells. Therefore, our sensing model satisfies the design requirements. Our sensing model is an intrinsic non-isomorphic model, which means the number of PIR sensors M {{is less than the}} number of sampling cells L, and the measurement of each PIR sensor is a linear combination of the sampling cells [30]. However, its sensing efficiency is high, that is, it can robustly detect the fall by processing low-dimensional sensor data directly. The reason lies in that the our sensing model captures the most discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall by efficient spatial segmentation. In Section 5, we will elaborate the system implementation, and list the specification of the reference structure.|$|E
