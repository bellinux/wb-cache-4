However, the virological and immunological mechanisms associated with mucosal inflammation are not well understood. The goal of the studies {{is to determine the}} impact of mucosal inflammation on virus acquisition and early events following infection using SIV infection of rhesus macaques. We introduced two forms of mucosal inflammation: induced gingival inflammation (chapter 3 and 4) and Haemophilus ducreyi-induced penile inflammation (chapter 5). After successful induction of mucosal inflammation, macaques were non-traumatically exposed to SIV through either the oral or penile route (corresponding to the site of inflammation). The goal of the study is to understand the ability of mucosal inflammation to influence SIV acquisition, virological and immunological changes associated with SIV infection in rhesus <b>macaques.</b> Following <b>SIV</b> challenges, the <b>macaques</b> were monitored for the frequency of SIV infection, number of founder viruses, plasma viral loads, immune changes at mucosal sites and systemic tissues. Although our results showed that overall SIV acquisition rates (through oral or penile challenge) were not significantly affected in the presence of mucosal inflammation (in the form of induced gingivitis or Haemophilus ducreyi related genital inflammation), we observed that mucosal inflammation was associated with an increased number of transmitted founder viruses, indicating that mucosal inflammation can alter host susceptibility to SIV, and by analogy HIV. The influence of mucosal inflammation on SIV pathogenesis in rhesus macaques was assessed. Following oral SIV infection, examination of the level of immune modulators in the oral cavity (gingival crevicular fluid and gingival biopsy) showed an increased production of IFN-alpha;, OAS and CXCL 10 in <b>SIV</b> infected <b>macaques</b> with gingival inflammation, compared to <b>SIV</b> infected control <b>macaques</b> during acute infection. In addition, higher levels of plasma IFN-alpha; and IFN-gamma; in the peripheral blood were observed in <b>SIV</b> infected <b>macaques</b> with gingival inflammation during acute infection. Furthermore, these macaques {{were more likely to have}} OAS upregulation and myeloperoxidase production in the peripheral lymph nodes. These results indicate that mucosal inflammation can modulate early immunological events following SIV infection. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that mucosal inflammation has influences on not only host susceptibility to SIV but also early immunological changes following SIV infection. The effects between mucosal inflammation and SIV infection have the potential to impact the early stages of the SIV infection with potential implications for treatments or vaccines development...|$|R

40|$|Infection {{with human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) commonly results in neurologic disease called the AIDS dementia complex. Neuronal loss and injury {{have been found in}} the HIV brain, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected macaque is an excellent animal model for HIV infection, but neuronal loss has not been demonstrated. To determine whether neuronal damage occurs in the SIV brain, we quantified the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) in brain extracts of control and SIV-infected macaques and correlated these findings with histologic analyses. We found reduced NAA in the SIV-infected animals compared with controls (2. 94 +/- 1. 37 versus 6. 21 +/- 1. 73 micromol/g of wet weight; p = 0. 004). A significant decrease in NAA was also found in SIV-infected animals sacrificed in the acute stages of infection 9 or 10 days after inoculation with SIVmacYnef. We conclude that SIV infection of rhesus macaques results in neuronal damage that is demonstrable shortly after infection and that 1 H-MRS may be used to measure such injury.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of the molecular mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV- 1, transcriptional regulation is required to develop novel inhibitors of viral replication. NF-κB transacting factors strongly enhance the HIV/SIV expression in both epithelial and lymphoid cells. Controversial results have been reported on the requirement of NF-κB factors in distinct cell reservoirs, such as CD 4 -positive T lymphocytes and monocytes. We have previously shown that IκB-αS 32 / 36 A, a proteolysis-resistant inhibitor of NF-κB, potently inhibits the growth of HIV- 1 and SIVmac 239 in cell cultures and in the <b>SIV</b> <b>macaque</b> model of AIDS. To further extend these observations, we have generated NL(AD 8) IκB-αS 32 / 36 A, a macrophage-tropic HIV- 1 recombinant strain endowed to express IκB-αS 32 / 36 A. Results In this work, we show that infection with NL(AD 8) IκB-αS 32 / 36 A down-regulated the NF-κB DNA binding activity in cells. NL(AD 8) IκB-αS 32 / 36 A was also highly attenuated for replication in cultures of human primary monocytes. Conclusions These results point to a major requirement of NF-κB activation for the optimal replication of HIV- 1 in monocytes and suggest that agents which interfere with NF-κB activity could counteract HIV- 1 infection of monocytes-macrophages in vivo. </p...|$|E

Recent studies suggest that stimulation of HIV- 1 -specific CTL responses is important for effective vaccination against HIV- 1. While quantitative measurements of SIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have been facilitated by the use of tetrameric peptide complexes, this technique is currently limited to the study of Mamu-A* 01 -positive rhesus macaques. Furthermore, very few SIV-specific CTL epitopes have been identified, and there is limited identification of other MHC alleles in macaques.

Although all macaques immunized with beta 2 M and HLA class I developed high antibody titers to beta 2 M, these animals were not protected from a subsequent challenge with infectious SIV grown in human cells. In contrast, the macaques immunized with class II protein (HLA-DR) and mock virus developed antibodies to class II protein and were protected from the intravenous infectious virus challenge. The class II protein- and mock virus-immunized animals which were protected from challenge were given boosters of the appropriate antigen and challenged with the same <b>SIV</b> propagated in <b>macaque</b> cells.

A simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>macaque</b> model has been developed that mimics the mucosal exposure that can occur during intrapartum HIV- 1 transmission. To develop immunoprophylaxis against intrapartum HIV- 1 transmission, we used SHIV-vpu+ (refs. 5, 6), a chimeric simian-human virus that encodes the env gene of HIV-IIIB. Several combinations of human monoclonal antibodies against HIV- 1 have been identified that neutralize SHIV-vpu+ completely in vitro through synergistic interaction.

All four macaques were protected against intravenous SHIV-vpu+ challenge after delivery. The infants received monoclonal antibodies after birth and were challenged orally with SHIV-vpu+ shortly thereafter. We found no evidence of infection in any infant during 6 months of follow-up.

MDA 5 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed at higher levels in the brain than RIG-I, with protein expression correlating with the severity of disease from 42 until 84 days post-inoculation.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{understanding}} of host cell {{factors that affect}} viral replication contributes to elucidation of the mechanism for determination of viral tropism. Cyclophilin A (CypA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), is a host factor essential for efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) in human cells. However, the role of cyclophilins in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication has not been determined. In the present study, we examined the effect of cyclosporine A (CsA), a PPIase inhibitor, on SIV replication. Results SIV replication in human CEM-SS T cells was not inhibited but rather enhanced by treatment with CsA, which inhibited HIV- 1 replication. CsA treatment of target human cells enhanced an early step of SIV replication. CypA overexpression enhanced the early phase of HIV- 1 but not SIV replication, while CypA knock-down resulted in suppression of HIV- 1 but not SIV replication in CEM-SS cells, partially explaining different sensitivities of HIV- 1 and SIV replication to CsA treatment. In contrast, CsA treatment inhibited <b>SIV</b> replication in <b>macaque</b> T cells; CsA treatment of either virus producer or target cells resulted in suppression of SIV replication.

In this study, the simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>macaque</b> model was used to determine whether SIV infects CNS endothelial cells. SIV RNA was detected in capillary endothelial cells in brain sections from animals parenterally inoculated with a neurovirulent strain of SIV by double immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization and by reverse transcriptase-in situ PCR. These in vivo observations were extended by examining whether SIV replicated productively in cultured macaque brain endothelial cells (MBEC). A neurovirulent strain, SIVmac 239 / 17 E-Br, replicated productively in MBEC as determined by the presence of viral cytopathic effect (syncytia), viral DNA by PCR, viral RNA by in situ hybridization, and viral antigen by immunohistochemistry and by the production of high titers of cell-free virus. Virus replication was confirmed by electron microscopy. In contrast, a nonneurovirulent strain, SIVmac 239, did not infect MBEC. Infection of the endothelial cells was not blocked by soluble CD 4. Thus, endothelial cells may provide a CD 4 -independent pathway of virus entry to the CNS. In addition, damage to the BBB as a result of endothelial cell infection may provide a mechanism for amplification of viral load in the CNS and may contribute to the CNS dysfunction that characterizes AIDS dementia and SIV encephalitis.

Cynomolgus <b>macaques</b> had significantly higher frequencies of circulating invariant NKT lymphocytes compared to both rhesus macaques and AIDS-resistant sooty mangabeys.

While NKT number and function remained intact in SIV-infected mangabeys, there was a profound reduction in NKT activation-induced, but not mitogen-induced, secretion of IFN-c, IL- 2, IL- 10, and TGF-b in SIV-infected macaques. SIV-infected macaques also showed a selective decline in CD 4 + NKT lymphocytes which correlated significantly with an increase in circulating activated memory CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Macaques with lower pre-infection NKT frequencies showed a significantly greater CD 4 + T lymphocyte decline post SIV infection. The disparate effect of SIV infection on NKT function in mangabeys and macaques could be a manifestation of their differential susceptibility to AIDS. Alternately, these data also raise the possibility that loss of anti-inflammatory NKT function promote...|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{influence}} of {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I (MHC-I) alleles on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diversity in humans has been well characterized at the population level. MHC-I alleles likely affect viral diversity in the simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> -infected pig-tailed <b>macaque</b> (Macaca nemestrina) model, but this is poorly characterized. We studied the evolution of <b>SIV</b> in pig-tailed <b>macaques</b> {{with a range of}} MHC-I haplotypes. SIV(mac 251) genomes were amplified from the plasma of 44 pig-tailed macaques infected with SIV(mac 251) at 4 to 10 months after infection and characterized by Illumina deep sequencing. MHC-I typing was performed on cellular RNA using Roche/ 454 pyrosequencing. MHC-I haplotypes and viral sequence polymorphisms at both individual mutations and groups of mutations spanning 10 -amino-acid segments were linked using in-house bioinformatics pipelines, since cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape can occur at different amino acids within the same epitope in different animals. The approach successfully identified 6 known CTL escape mutations within 3 Mane-A 1 * 084 -restricted epitopes. The approach also identified over 70 new SIV polymorphisms linked to a variety of MHC-I haplotypes. Using functional CD 8 T cell assays, we confirmed that one of these associations, a Mane-B 028 haplotype-linked mutation in Nef, corresponded to a CTL epitope. We also identified mutations associated with the Mane-B 017 haplotype that were previously described to be CTL epitopes restricted by Mamu-B* 017 : 01 in rhesus macaques. This detailed study of pig-tailed macaque MHC-I genetics and SIV polymorphisms will enable a refined level of analysis for future vaccine design and strategies for treatment of HIV infection. IMPORTANCE: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes select for virus escape mutants of HIV and SIV, and this limits the effectiveness of vaccines and immunotherapies against these viruses. Patterns of immune escape variants are similar in HIV type 1 -infected human subjects that share the same MHC-I genes, but this has not been studied for <b>SIV</b> infection of <b>macaques.</b> By studying <b>SIV</b> sequence diversity in 44 MHC-typed SIV-infected pigtail macaques, we defined over 70 sites within SIV where mutations were common in macaques sharing particular MHC-I genes. Further, pigtail macaques sharing nearly identical MHC-I genes with rhesus macaques responded to the same CTL epitope and forced immune escape. This allows many reagents developed to study rhesus macaques to also be used to study pigtail macaques. Overall, our study defines sites of immune escape in <b>SIV</b> in pigtailed <b>macaques,</b> and this enables a more refined level of analysis of future vaccine design and strategies for treatment of HIV infection.

40|$|The reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) inhibitor tenofovir (TFV) is highly {{effective in the}} simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>macaque</b> model of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The current report describes extended safety and efficacy data on 32 animals that received prolonged (≥ 1 - to 13 -year) daily subcutaneous TFV regimens. The likelihood of renal toxicity (proximal renal tubular dysfunction [PRTD]) correlated with plasma drug concentrations, which depended on the dosage regimen and age-related changes in drug clearance. Below a threshold area under the concentration-time curve for TFV in plasma of ∼ 10 μg·h/ml, an exposure severalfold higher than that observed in humans treated orally with 300 mg TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF), prolonged TFV administration {{was not associated with}} PRTD based on urinalysis, serum chemistry analyses, bone mineral density, and clinical observations. At low-dose maintenance regimens, plasma TFV concentrations and intracellular TFV diphosphate concentrations were similar to or slightly higher than those observed in TDF-treated humans. No new toxicities were identified. The available evidence does not suggest teratogenic effects of prolonged low-dose TFV treatment; by the age of 10 years, one macaque, on TFV treatment since birth, had produced three offspring that were healthy by all criteria up to the age of 5 years. Despite the presence of viral variants with a lysine-to-arginine substitution at codon 65 (K 65 R) of RT in all 28 SIV-infected animals, 6 animals suppressed viremia to undetectable levels for as long as 12 years of TFV monotherapy. In conclusion, these findings illustrate the safety and sustained benefits of prolonged TFV-containing regimens throughout development from infancy to adulthood, including pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|The simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>macaque</b> model of AIDS {{has provided a}} valuable system with which to investigate vaccine approaches for protection against human {{immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. In particular, the ability of macaques persistently infected with attenuated infectious molecular clones of SIV to resist challenge with the pathogenic parental swarm has conclusively demonstrated that protective immunity {{can be achieved by}} immunization prior to exposure. The breadth of these protective responses and the immunological correlates of protection, however, have not been identified. In addition, vaccine studies have mainly employed lymphocyte-tropic strains of HIV- 1 and SIV. Recent studies have implicated macrophage-tropic strains in the transmission of HIV- 1 and have suggested that these virus strains should be examined in vaccine strategies. Macrophage-tropic viruses may confer additional advantages in the induction of protective immunity by replication in antigen-presenting cells. In this study, the immune response of rhesus macaques inoculated with an attenuated macrophage-tropic recombinant of SIVmac 239 (SIV/ 17 E-Cl) was evaluated with respect to protective immunity by heterologous challenge at various times after infection. Vigorous type-specific neutralizing-antibody responses restricted to SIV/ 17 E-Cl were evident by 2 weeks postinfection. By 7 months, however, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies emerged which neutralized not only SIV/ 17 E-Cl but also the heterologous primary isolate SIV/DeltaB 670. Challenge of SIV/ 17 E-Cl-infected monkeys with SIV/DeltaB 670 at various times postinfection demonstrated that protective responses were associated with the appearance of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, passive transfer of sera from SIV/ 17 E-Cl-infected animals passively protected two of four naive recipients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Immunotherapy aims {{to assist}} the natural immune system in {{achieving}} control over viral infection. Various immunotherapy formats have been evaluated in either therapy-naive or therapy-experienced HIV-infected patients over the last 20 [*]years. These formats included non-antigen specific strategies such as cytokines that stimulate immunity or suppress the viral replication, as well as antibodies that block negative regulatory pathways. A number of HIV-specific therapeutic vaccinations have also been proposed, using in vivo injection of inactivated virus, plasmid DNA encoding HIV antigens, or recombinant viral vectors containing HIV genes. A specific format of therapeutic vaccines consists of ex vivo loading of autologous dendritic cells {{with one of the}} above mentioned antigenic formats or mRNA encoding HIV antigens. This review provides an extensive overview of the background and rationale of these different therapeutic attempts and discusses the results of trials in the <b>SIV</b> <b>macaque</b> model and in patients. To date success has been limited, which could be explained by insufficient quality or strength of the induced immune responses, incomplete coverage of HIV variability and/or inappropriate immune activation, with ensuing increased susceptibility of target cells. Future attempts at therapeutic vaccination should ideally be performed under the protection of highly active antiretroviral drugs in patients with a recovered immune system. Risks for immune escape should be limited by a better coverage of the HIV variability, using either conserved or mosaic sequences. Appropriate molecular adjuvants should be included to enhance the quality and strength of the responses, without inducing inappropriate immune activation. Finally, to achieve a long-lasting effect on viral control (i. e. a “functional cure”) it is likely that these immune interventions should be combined with anti-latency drugs and/or gene therapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Single-genome {{amplification}} (SGA) and {{sequencing of}} HIV- 1 RNA in plasma of acutely infected humans allows {{the identification and}} enumeration of transmitted/founder viruses responsible for productive systemic infection. Use of this strategy {{as a means for}} identifying transmitted viruses suggested that intrarectal simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> inoculation of <b>macaques</b> recapitulates key features of human rectal infection. However, no studies have used the SGA strategy to identify vaginally transmitted virus(es) in macaques or to determine how early SIV diversification in vaginally infected animals compares with HIV- 1 in humans. We used SGA to amplify 227 partial env sequences from a SIVmac 251 challenge stock and from seven rhesus macaques at the earliest plasma viral RNA-positive time point after low- and high-dose intravaginal inoculation. Sequences were analyzed phylogenetically to determine the relationship of transmitted/founder viruses within and between each animal and the challenge stock. In each animal, discrete low-diversity env sequence lineages were evident, and these coalesced phylogenetically to identical or near-identical env sequences in the challenge stock, thus confirming the validity of the SGA sequencing and modeling strategy for identifying vaginally transmitted SIV. Between 1 and 10 viruses were responsible for systemic infection, similar to humans infected by sexual contact, and the set of viruses transmitted to the seven animals studied represented the full genetic constellation of the challenge stock. These findings recapitulate many of the features of sexual HIV- 1 transmission in women. Furthermore, the <b>SIV</b> rhesus <b>macaque</b> model can be used to understand the factors that influence the transmission of single versus multiple SIV variants...|$|R

40|$|An {{antibody}} phage display {{library was}} constructed from RNA extracted from lymph node cells of a simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> -infected long-term-nonprogressor <b>macaque.</b> Seven gp 120 -reactive Fabs {{were obtained by}} selection of the library against SIV monomeric gp 120. Although each of the Fabs was unique in sequence, there were two distinct groups based on epitope recognition, neutralizing activity in vitro, and molecular analysis. Group 1 Fabs did not neutralize SIV and bound to a linear epitope in the V 3 loop of the SIV envelope. In contrast, two of the group 2 Fabs neutralized homologous, neutralization-sensitive SIVsm isolates with high efficiency but failed to neutralize heterologous SIVmac isolates. Based on competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with mouse monoclonal antibodies of known specificity, these Fabs reacted with a conformational epitope that includes domains V 3 and V 4 of the SIV envelope. These neutralizing and nonneutralizing Fabs provide valuable standardized and renewable reagents for studying the role of antibody in preventing or modifying SIV infection in vivo.
