40|$|Regional tissue {{distress}} {{caused by}} microcirculatory dysfunction and mitochondrial depression underlies the condition in sepsis and shock where, despite correction of systemic oxygen delivery variables, regional hypoxia and oxygen extraction deficit persist. We have termed this condition microcirculatory and mitochondrial distress syndrome (MIMIDS). Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging allowed the first clinical {{observation of the}} microcirculation in human internal organs, and has identified the pivotal role of microcirculatory abnormalities in defining the severity of sepsis, a condition not revealed by systemic hemodynamic or oxygen-derived variables. Recently, sublingual sidestream dark-field (SDF) imaging has been introduced, allowing observation of the microcirculation in even greater detail. Microcirculatory recruitment is needed to ensure adequate microcirculatory perfusion and the oxygenation of tissue cells that follows. In sepsis, where inflammation-induced autoregulatory dysfunction persists and oxygen need is not matched by supply, the microcirculation can be recruited by reducing pathological shunting, promoting microcirculatory perfusion, <b>supporting</b> <b>pump</b> function, and controlling hemorheology and coagulation. Resuscitation following MMDS must include focused recruitment of hypoxic-shunted microcirculatory units and/or resuscitation of the mitochondria. A combination of agents is required for successful rescue of the microcirculation.

30|$|Among cardiac markers, α-CA is {{the major}} protein of the thin {{filaments}} in cardiac sarcomeres, {{which is responsible for}} muscle contraction and generation of force to <b>support</b> <b>pumping</b> function of the heart (Orban et al. 2008). GATA 4 is a vital cardiac marker which is shown to regulate genes involved in embryogenesis and myocardial differentiation and function (Orban et al. 2008; Latinkic et al. 2002). This marker is a transcriptional mediator which responds to mechanical force, such that the direct stretching of the ventricles activates GATA 4 (Hautala et al. 2002). An elevation of GATA 4 activity is thought to induce angiogenesis in infarcted heart tissues (Heineke et al. 2007). This marker functions in combination with other essential cardiac transcription factors such as Nkx 2 - 5 which is crucial in cardiac differentiation and normal growth of the embryonic myocardium. Finally βMHC is a gene encoding a myosin heavy chain beta (MHC-β) isoform that is primarily expressed in the heart (Uhlen et al. 2010, 2015).|$|R

BACKGROUND: The small rotary blood pump Impella provides unloading of the left ventricle and is introducible via the femoral artery.

MethodsDuring a 3 -year period, 20 patients underwent subclavian artery–intra-aortic balloon pump in the setting of end-stage heart failure. The balloon was inserted through a polytetrafluoroethylene graft sutured to the right subclavian artery in 19 patients (95 %) and to the left subclavian artery in 1 patient (5 %). The goal of support was to bridge to transplantation in 17 patients (85 %) and bridge to recovery in 3 patients (15 %).

50|$|The {{conditions}} in the atmospheres of late-type stars <b>support</b> the <b>pumping</b> of different maser species at different distances from the star. Due to instabilities within the nuclear burning sections of the star, the star experiences periods of increased energy release. These pulses produce a shockwave that forces the atmosphere outward. Hydroxyl masers occur {{at a distance of}} about 1000 to 10000 astronomical units (AU), water masers at a distance of about 100 to 400 AU, and silicon monoxide masers at a distance of about 5 to 10 AU. Both radiative and collisional pumping resulting from the shockwave have been suggested as the pumping mechanism for the silicon monoxide masers. These masers diminish for larger radii as the gaseous silicon monoxide condenses into dust, depleting the available maser molecules. For the water masers, the inner and outer radii limits roughly correspond to the density limits for maser operation. At the inner boundary, the collisions between molecules are enough to remove a population inversion. At the outer boundary, the density and optical depth is low enough that the gain of the maser is diminished. Additionally, the hydroxyl masers are <b>supported</b> chemical <b>pumping.</b> At the distances where these masers are found water molecules are disassociated by UV radiation.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveMechanical {{support of}} a failing heart is {{typically}} performed with rotary blood pumps running at constant speed, which results in a limited control on cardiac workload and nonpulsatile hemodynamics. A potential solution to overcome these limitations is to modulate the pump speed to create pulses. This study aims at developing a pulsatile control algorithm for rotary pumps, while investigating its effect on left ventricle unloading and the hemodynamics. MethodsThe CentriMag (Levitronix GmbH, Zürich, Switzerland) rotary blood pump was implanted in 5 sheep and cannulated from the ventricular apex to the descending aorta. A modified controller {{was connected to the}} pump yielding direct speed control via analog voltage. Pump speed modulation patterns, including sine, saw tooth, triangle, and square waveforms with 2 different phase shifts, were synchronized with heartbeat. Various hemodynamic parameters, such as left ventricular pressure and volume, coronary flow, and arterial pressure, were analyzed to examine the influence of <b>pump</b> <b>support.</b> ResultsThe <b>pump</b> speed modulation significantly affected left ventricular pressure and volume and arterial pressure, whereas coronary flow was not influenced by <b>pump</b> <b>support</b> mode. Stroke work in the pulsatile modes varied from 69 % to 91 % of baseline value and from 74 % to 96 % of constant speed value. Consequently, cardiac workload can be adjusted to provide relaxation, which may lead to myocardial recovery. ConclusionsA synchronized pulsing rotary blood pump offers a simple and powerful control modality for heart unloading. This technique provides pulsatile hemodynamics, which is more physiologic than continuous blood flow and may be useful for perfusion of the other organs...|$|R
