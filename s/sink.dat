She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to <b>sink</b> any Pakistani naval warships, to <b>sink</b> merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E

5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single <b>sink,</b> {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the <b>sink</b> back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of corporate bonds contain a <b>sinking</b> fund provision. The wide use of <b>sinking</b> funds has prompted both theoretical and empirical investigations.

The signalling implications of <b>sinking</b> funds is examined, and it is shown that, under information asymmetry, the <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rate provides a credible signal for the quality of the firm. In a separating equilibrium, better quality firms choose higher <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rates in their bond issues.

5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen <b>sink</b> by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the <b>sink,</b> cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the <b>sink</b> are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the <b>sink</b> from time to time.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions {{on a global}} scale may be achieved by {{reduction of}} energy intensity, by reduction of carbon intensity or by capture and storage of CO 2. A portfolio of these methods is required to achieve the large reductions required; of which utilization of carbon <b>sinks</b> (i. e. material, geosphere and biosphere) will be an important player. Material <b>sinks</b> will probably only play a minor role as compared to biosphere and geosphere <b>sinks</b> in storage of CO 2. Biosphere <b>sinks</b> are attractive because they can sequester CO 2 from a diffuse source whereas geosphere <b>sinks</b> require a pure waste stream of CO 2 (obtained by using expensive separation methods). On the other hand, environmental factors and storage time favor geosphere <b>sinks.</b> It is expected that {{a combination of the two}} will be used in order to meet emission reduction targets over the next 100 yr. A critical look is taken at capacities, retention/residence times, rates of uptake and relative cost of utilization of biosphere and geosphere <b>sinks</b> at three scales - global, national (Canada) and provincial (Alberta). Biosphere <b>sinks</b> considered are oceans, forests and soils. Geosphere <b>sinks</b> considered are enhanced oil recovery, coal beds, depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep aquifers. The largest <b>sinks</b> are oceans and deep aquifers. The other biosphere and geosphere <b>sinks</b> have total capacities approximately of an order of lower magnitude. The <b>sinks</b> that will probably be used first are those that are economically viable such as enhanced oil-recovery, agriculture, forestry and possibly enhanced coalbed methane-recovery. The other <b>sinks</b> will be used when these options have been exhausted or are not available or a penalty (e. g. carbon tax) exists. Although the data tabulated for these <b>sinks</b> is only regarded as preliminary, it provides a starting point for assessment of the role of large <b>sinks</b> in meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. ...|$|R

5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat <b>sink</b> of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat <b>sink</b> coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an energy}} {{requirement}} {{for the maintenance of}} low <b>sinking</b> rates (~ 0. 1 m d-l) in the marine diatom Ditylum brightwellii. The lowest <b>sinking</b> rates occurred when cells were grown under ii-radiances saturating for growth. The highest <b>sinking</b> rates occurred when cells grown at growth-limiting irradiances were placed in the dark, or in cells treated with a respiratory inhibitor. Small cells <b>sank</b> more rapidly than large cells under saturating light, but under severe energy limitation <b>sinking</b> rates were directly proportional to cell volume. When cells were grown under saturating irradiance and then placed in the dark, their <b>sinking</b> rate increased as their respiration rate decreased over time. We suggest that when light is unavailable, a diatom’s ability to use energy gained from respiration may be the principal determinant of its <b>sinking</b> rate. We provide the first estimate of the dependence of cell <b>sinking</b> rate on cell respiration and suggest that the sinking-respiration relationship may be useful in predicting the <b>sinking</b> dynamics of diatoms during a bloom. We speculate that energetic <b>sinking</b> control may have evolved to allow diatoms to colonize the photic zone and that larger diatoms with lower <b>sinking</b> rates may have an ecological advantage over smaller diatoms with higher <b>sinking</b> rates early in a bloom. Although diatom blooms are the periods of highest yearly “new ” production and car-bon sedimentation (Burrell 1988), the spe-cific physiological mechanisms governing the process of diatom sedimentation are not well understood. Early observations sug-gested that <b>sinking</b> rates were related to a cell’s growth rate and physiological statu...|$|R
