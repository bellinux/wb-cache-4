40|$|Background: In chronic petrol <b>sniffers,</b> recent {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of leaded petrol may give rise to a lead encephalopathy characterised by tremor, chorea, ataxia, hyperreflexia, convulsive seizures, and death. Neurological abnormalities associated wild lead encephalopathy involve the cortex, basal ganglio, cerebellum, and brain stem. Objective: To use saccadic eye movement tasks as an experimental tool to determine which CNS changes are associated with chronic petrol sniffing and which with a history of lead encephalopathy, and to what extent these changes are reversible. Methods: Saccade function was assessed in chronic petrol <b>sniffers</b> with a history of lead encephalopathy (encephalopathic <b>sniffers),</b> chronic petrol <b>sniffers</b> who had never suffered lead encephalopathy (chronic <b>sniffers),</b> individuals who had sniffed petrol in the past but had not done so for more than six months (ex-sniffers), and individuals who had never sniffed petrol (non-sniffers). Results: Chronic <b>sniffers</b> showed increased latency of visually guided saccades and antisaccades and increased antisaccade errors which suggested cortical and basal ganglia dysfunction. These abnormalities returned to normal in ex-sniffers. Encephalopathic <b>sniffers</b> showed the same abnormalities as chronic <b>sniffers</b> but with greater severity and additional saccadic signs including dysmetria, gaze evoked nystagmus, and saccade slowing which usually indicate cerebellar and brain stem dysfunction. Conclusions: Chronic petrol abuse is associated with cortical and basal ganglia abnormalities that are at least partially recoverable with abstinence. Additional long term cerebellar and brain stem abnormalities are associated with lead encephalopathy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper studies {{an optimal}} channel {{assignment}} problem for passive monitoring in multi-channel wireless net-works, where {{a set of}} <b>sniffers</b> capture and analyze the network traffic to monitor the network.

5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with <b>sniffer</b> dogs, and the buildings around the stadium were lined with Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between contact with treatment and transition to injection for heroin <b>sniffers.</b> Our primary research question is, does contact with treatment delay onset of injection for heroin <b>sniffers?</b> A stratified network-based sample was recruited from multiple communities in South Florida which were known for high drug use. Three categories of respondents were recruited based on injection outcome: long-term injectors, short-term injectors, and <b>sniffers</b> (n= 900). We answer our research question in two steps. First, we investigate the prevalence of drug treatment for heroin <b>sniffers</b> and injectors using case-control methods. The preliminary findings indicate {{a positive relationship between}} contact with treatment and injection status outcome. Second, we further examine the relationship by attempting to identify the causal factors that delay initial injection for a subgroup of current injectors using survival regression procedures. Delaying or preventing transition to injection could significantly decrease risk of HIV transmission by reducing or eliminating risky injecting behaviors. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and suggestions for future research. Drug treatment HIV/AIDS Transition to injection Heroin Heroin <b>sniffers</b> USA...|$|R
30|$|There {{are various}} {{solutions}} that enable wireless environment monitoring. Software-defined radios (SDRs) are advanced devices {{that are highly}} utilized within the cognitive radio networks for monitoring the intended bands [18]. Packet <b>sniffers</b> are an alternative solution used for monitoring the activity of a certain wireless technology on a certain band. Combining several packet <b>sniffers</b> on the different intended channels will bring the same functionality of a single software-defined radio device. The low cost and simplicity of implementation in case of the Wi-Fi technology is our motivation to only consider Wi-Fi packet <b>sniffers</b> as sources providing information of the spectrum.|$|R

30|$|Firstly, {{the model}} is {{developed}} in a pseudo-shielded all line-of-sight single-hop environment where the measurements were performed. The hidden node problem is not taken into consideration since {{it is not an}} issue in this environment. More precisely, the model does not consider interference of nodes that are not in the radio range of the <b>sniffers.</b> The <b>sniffers</b> are assumed to capture all present traffic without dropping any packets. If for any reason (other ISM band interference such as Bluetooth, microwave ovens, and ZigBee) the interference is not perceived by the <b>sniffers,</b> the event detector of the CDE (see Figure 3) assists by detecting the unpredicted throughput degradation in the network.|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{observations}} {{suggest that}} neurological impairments associated with petrol (gasoline) sniffing resolve with abstinence, although these effects {{have not been}} proven empirically. Severe exposure to leaded petrol may induce a lead encephalopathy that extends beyond any acute intoxication and requires emergency hospital treatment. Previously, in chronic petrol <b>sniffers,</b> we showed neurological, saccadic, and cognitive abnormalities that were more severe in petrol <b>sniffers</b> {{with a history of}} hospitalization for lead encephalopathy, and that correlated with blood lead levels and the length of time of sniffing petrol. Ex-petrol <b>sniffers</b> showed a qualitatively similar but quantitatively less severe pattern of impairment. Petrol sniffing was stopped completely in one of the study communities by modifying social, occupational, and recreational opportunities. After 2 years, we obtained biochemical and neurobehavioral (neurological, saccade, and cognitive) data from all available participants of the earlier study including 10 nonsniffers and 29 chronic petrol <b>sniffers,</b> with six of these individuals previously receiving hospital treatment for lead encephalopathy. Here, we report that blood lead was reduced and that neurobehavioral impairments improved, and in many cases normalized completely. The most severe petrol-related neurobehavioral impairment was observed among individuals who had longer histories of abuse and higher blood lead levels, and among petrol <b>sniffers</b> with a history of lead encephalopathy. Those with the greatest extent of neurobehavioral impairment showed the greatest degree of improvement with abstinence, but were less likely to recover completely, This is the first direct evidence that neurological and cognitive impairment from chronic petrol sniffing ameliorates with abstinence and may recover completely...|$|R

25|$|Phosgene {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style refrigerant gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small gas torch (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a <b>sniffer</b> tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any refrigerant gas was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the <b>sniffer</b> tube and would cause a colour change of the gas flame to a bright greenish blue. In the process, phosgene gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of phosgene poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of phosgene, produced during such leak testing. Electronic sensing of refrigerant gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, phosgene poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of refrigerant leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon refrigerant leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E
