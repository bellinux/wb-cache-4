The goal is to compute the maximum achievable secrecy degrees of freedom (<b>S.</b> D. <b>o.</b> <b>F)</b> region of a MIMO two-user wiretap network. First, a cooperative secrecy transmission scheme is proposed, whose feasible set is shown to achieve all <b>S.</b> D. <b>o.</b> <b>F.</b> pairs on the <b>S.</b> D. <b>o.</b> <b>F.</b> region boundary.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) {{broadcast}} channel with confidential messages {{under the assumption}} of alternating channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We consider two alternating states: PD and DP which occur for an equal fraction of time. In state PD, the CSIT of the channel to the first receiver is available perfectly without delay (P) while that of the second receiver is available with a delay of one channel use (D); in state DP, {{the roles of the}} receivers are reversed. We characterize the exact secure degrees of freedom (<b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.)</b> region of this system, and show as a corollary that the sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> is 3 2. We observe that this sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> is the same as what can be achieved by the states PP and DD occurring for equal fraction of time.

In this paper, we determine the entire <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> region of this channel model. The converse includes constraints both due to secrecy as well as due to interference. Although {{the portion of the}} region close to the optimum sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> point is governed by the upper bounds due to secrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper bounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature, in order to fully understand the characterization of the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> region of the IC, one has to study the 4 -user case, i. e., the 2 or 3 -user cases do not illustrate the generality of the problem.

In particular, we show that in the absence of eavesdropper's CSIT, the K-user multiple access wiretap channel reduces to a wiretap channel with (K- 1) helpers from a sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> perspective, and the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> reduces from K(K- 1) /K(K- 1) + 1 to K- 1 /K.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{physical layer}} security in wireless networks using an information theoretic framework. The {{central theme of}} this work is exploring the effect of delayed or no channel state information (CSI) on physical layer security in various wireless channel models. We begin with the fast Rayleigh fading wiretap channel, over which a legitimate transmitter wishes to have secure communication with a legitimate receiver {{in the presence of}} an eavesdropper. Subject to an average power constraint on the input, and with no CSI at any user, we show that the input distribution that achieves the secrecy capacity for this wiretap channel is discrete with a finite number of mass points. This enables us to evaluate the exact secrecy capacity of this channel numerically. Next, we consider multi-user models, specifically, the wiretap channel with M helpers, the K-user multiple access wiretap channel, and the K-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper, when no eavesdropper's CSI is available at the transmitters. In each case, we establish the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (<b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.)</b> by providing achievable schemes and matching converses. We show that the unavailability of the eavesdropper's CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) does not reduce the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> of the wiretap channel with helpers. However, there is loss in <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> for both the multiple access wiretap channel and the interference channel with an external eavesdropper. In particular, we show that in the absence of eavesdropper's CSIT, the K-user multiple access wiretap channel reduces to a wiretap channel with (K- 1) helpers from a sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> perspective, and the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> reduces from K(K- 1) /(K(K- 1) + 1) to (K- 1) /K. For the interference channel with an external eavesdropper, the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> decreases from K(K- 1) /(2 K- 1) to (K- 1) / 2 {{in the absence of the}} eavesdropper's CSIT. Our results show that the lack of eavesdropper's CSIT does not have a significant impact on the optimal <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> for any of the three channel models, especially when the number of users is large. We, then, study multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multi-user channels. We begin with the case when full CSIT is available. We consider a two-user MIMO multiple access wiretap channel with N antennas at each transmitter, N antennas at the legitimate receiver, and K antennas at the eavesdropper. We determine the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> for this model for all values of N and K. We subdivide our problem into several regimes based on the values of N and K, and provide achievable schemes based on real and vector space alignment techniques for fixed and fading channel gains, respectively. To prove the optimality of the achievable schemes, we provide matching converses for each regime. Our results show how the number of eavesdropper antennas affects the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> of the multiple access wiretap channel. In line with the theme of this dissertation, we next consider the MIMO wiretap channel with one helper and the two-user MIMO multiple access channel when no eavesdropper CSIT is available. In each case, the eavesdropper has K antennas while the remaining terminals have N antennas. We determine the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> for each channel model for the regime K = N. Finally, we explore the effect of delayed CSIT on physical layer security. In particular, we consider the two user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel with confidential messages, in which the nature of CSIT from each user can be of the form I_i, i= 1, 2 where I_i belongs to P, D,N, and the forms P, D and N correspond to perfect and instantaneous, completely delayed, and no CSIT, respectively. Thus, the overall CSIT can be any of nine possible states corresponding to all possible values of (I_ 1,I_ 2). While the optimal sum <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> in the homogeneous settings corresponding to I_ 1 =I_ 2 are already known in the literature, we focus on the heterogeneous settings where I_ 1 is not equal to I_ 2 and establish the optimal <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> region in each case. We further consider the case where the CSIT state varies with time. Each state (I_ 1,I_ 2) can then occur for λ_I_ 1 I_ 2 fraction of the total duration. We determine the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> region of the MISO broadcast channel with confidential messages under such an alternating CSIT setting, with a mild symmetry assumption, where λ_I_ 1 I_ 2 =λ_I_ 2 I_ 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the multi-antenna wiretap channel {{in which the}} transmitter wishes to send a confidential message to its receiver while keeping it secret to the eavesdropper. It has been known that the secrecy capacity of such a channel does not increase with signal-to-noise ratio when the transmitter has no channel state information (CSI) under mild conditions. Motivated by Jafar's robust interference alignment technique, we study the so-called staggered multi-antenna block-fading wiretap channel where the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper have different temporal correlation structures. Assuming no CSI at transmitter, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the secrecy degrees of freedom (<b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.)</b> of the channel at hand. Our results show that a positive <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> can be ensured whenever two receivers experience different fading variation. Remarkably, very simple linear precoding schemes provide the optimal <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> in some cases of interest...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{multiple}} antenna wire-tap channel {{in the presence}} of a multi-antenna cooperative jammer is studied. In particular, the secure degrees of freedom (<b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.)</b> of this channel is established, with $N_t$ antennas at the transmitter, $N_r$ antennas at the legitimate receiver, and $N_e$ antennas at the eavesdropper, for all possible values of the number of antennas, $N_c$, at the cooperative jammer. In establishing the result, several different ranges of $N_c$ need to be considered separately. The lower and upper bounds for these ranges of $N_c$ are derived, and are shown to be tight. The achievability techniques developed rely on a variety of signaling, beamforming, and alignment techniques which vary according to the (relative) number of antennas at each terminal and whether the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> is integer valued. Specifically, it is shown that, whenever the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> is integer valued, Gaussian signaling for both transmission and cooperative jamming, linear precoding at the transmitter and the cooperative jammer, and linear processing at the legitimate receiver, are sufficient for achieving the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> of the channel. By contrast, when the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> is not an integer, the achievable schemes need to rely on structured signaling at the transmitter and the cooperative jammer, and joint signal space and signal scale alignment. The converse is established by combining an upper bound which allows for full cooperation between the transmitter and the cooperative jammer, with another upper bound which exploits the secrecy and reliability constraints.

We prove that the <b>s.</b> d. <b>o.</b> <b>f.</b> region is identical to that when the eavesdropper channel is fixed and globally known. A multi-stage coding scheme that combines secret key generation and confidential message transmission is developed to prove achievability.
