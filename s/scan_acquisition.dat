40|$|The Single Fiber Scanning Endoscope (SFSE) is a {{miniature}} endoscope with unique features {{that promises to}} open new minimally invasive procedures for previously inaccessible diseases. There {{is a need for}} enhancement of depth cues and 3 D measurement in procedures using monoscopic endoscopes. The SFSE uses <b>scanning</b> <b>acquisition</b> that gives it unique imaging properties which are advantageous for 3 D vision algorithms [...] simultaneous images can be created from multiple sensors all having common viewpoints but different lighting directions. A radiometric dual exists between array and <b>scanning</b> <b>acquisition</b> systems, so <b>scanning</b> <b>acquisition</b> images appear to have the light source originating from the sensors and the viewpoint at the scanner location. Disparity and photometric stereo techniques are investigated. A novel method for interactive virtual lighting allows the surface to be illuminated from any virtual lighting direction, even those not physically possible with endoscope, for use with either monocular or binocular images. This enhances or provides depth cues from shading and parallax. Using the photometric stereo method a 3 D mesh representing the surface shape is obtained. A combination of disparity stereo and photometric stereo techniques creates dense range maps and measurements. The ability to make dense 3 D measurements allow accurate volume measurements for dosage, risk estimation, and healing progress evaluations...|$|R

40|$|Rationale and Objectives—We {{sought to}} examine {{heart rate and}} heart rate {{variability}} during cardiac computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods—Ninety patients (59. 0 ± 13. 5 years) underwent coronary CT angiography (CTA), with 52 patients also undergoing coronary artery calcium scanning (CAC). Forty-two patients with heart rate greater than 70 bpm were pretreated with oral β-blockers (in five patients, use of β-blocker was not known). Sixty-four patients were given sublingual nitroglycerin. Mean heart rate and percentage of beats outside a ± 5 bpm region about the mean were compared between baseline (free breathing), prescan hyperventilation, and <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition</b> (breath-hold). Results—Mean <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition</b> time was 13. 1 ± 1. 5 seconds for CAC scanning and 14. 2 ± 2. 9 seconds for coronary CTA.

50|$|A MUGA <b>scan</b> (multigated <b>acquisition</b> <b>scan)</b> is {{a nuclear}} {{medicine}} test designed {{to evaluate the}} function of the right and left ventricles of the heart, thus allowing informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. MUGA scanning is also called radionuclide angiography, equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, or gated blood pool imaging, as well as SYMA <b>scanning</b> (synchronized multigated <b>acquisition</b> <b>scanning).</b> This mode of imaging uniquely provides a cine type of image of the beating heart, and allows the interpreter to determine the efficiency of the individual heart valves and chambers. MUGA/Cine scanning represents a robust adjunct to the now more common echocardiogram. Mathematics regarding acquisition of Q is well served by both of these methods as well as other inexpensive models supporting ejection fraction as a product of the heart/myocardium in systole. The advantage of a MUGA scan over an echocardiogram or an angiogram is due to its accuracy. An echocardiogram measures the shortening fraction of the ventricle and is limited by the user's ability. Furthermore, an angiogram is invasive and, often, more expensive. A MUGA scan provides a more accurate representation of cardiac ejection fraction.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{benefits}} of simultaneous multichannel detection over single-channel scanning detection are well established in analytical chemistry. Multichannel detection increases duty cycle, {{which leads to}} enhanced sensitivity, detection limits, and reduced analysis time. Also, multichannel detection used with either isotope-ratio or internal-standard techniques provides a mechanism to reduce the effect of multiplicative or flicker noise prevalent in plasma sources. An additional benefit of simultaneous detection is superior analysis of short-lived transient signals. Presented here is a theoretical comparison between simultaneous/continuous multichannel <b>acquisition</b> and single-channel <b>scanning</b> <b>acquisition.</b> To conduct this comparison, reported sensitivity, single-channel precision, and background values for commercial inductively coupled plasma sector-field mass spectrometers (ICP-SFMS) are used to generate theoretical figures of merit for both acquisition methods. Among the figures of merit that will be considered are detection limits, precision, and analysis time, particularly for multi-element or multi-isotope analysis...|$|R

The algorithm operates locally, within an expanded bounding box of each hole, and therefore scales well with the number of holes in a single, complex model.

40|$|The {{result of}} an {{outdoors}} 3 D <b>scanning</b> <b>acquisition</b> campaign is usually an accurate 3 D model of the site, but {{in most of the}} cases the quality of the color acquired by the scanner is not satisfying. Alternative solutions, like the projection of a photographic dataset acquired in a different stage, are still dependent {{on the quality of the}} initial images. The short time for the acquisition campaigns and the weather conditions often force the shooting of images taken under a strong direct sun illumination. This generates colored models of poor quality. In this paper we present a method to estimate the sun position starting from a geo-referenced 3 D model and a set of images. The sun position can enhance both the image alignment and color projection phases. Moreover, the detection and removal of the shadows from the images produces a better and more coherent color in the final 3 D model.
