6000|$|... "Mr. Powis and Sir George Templemore {{will not}} quarrel about the honour," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> as they {{proceeded}} towards the table.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "don't, it won't pay. It's the sickest {{game that}} ever was played by man or woman. Come here!" ...|$|E
