40|$|The mutant strain am 126 was isolated, {{using the}} direct {{selection}} procedure, after nitrous acid mutagenesis. It produced neither measurable NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) nor immunologically cross-reacting material. That the am 126 strain produced {{some form of}} GDH product was shown {{by the fact that}} it complemented several other am mutant strains. The GDH formed by complementation between am 126 and each of two other am mutants was relatively thermolabile, but could not be distinguished from wild-type GDH by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. This, together with the relatively high yield of the complementation enzymes, suggests that the am 126 product is a polypeptide chain not grossly abnormal in structure. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertant</b> frequency was between 0. 3 and 3 prototrophic revertants per 105 live cells. This frequency was at least 40 times greater than that for am 19, which had the second highest <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertant</b> frequency among the mutants tested. Neither meiosis nor mutagenesis increased the revertant frequency, nor did incubation at elevated temperatures lower it. Sixty-eight revertant strains were examined for thermostability of their GHD. All appeared to be identical to wild type. Seven of the revertant strains were also tested for instability with regard to forward mutation to am auxtrophy. None was found to be unstable.

Outer membrane protein (OMP) analysis indicated decreased expression of a 33 - 36 kDa protein by isolates A-l and A- 24 when compared with A-l (rev) and the other A. baumannii isolates.

40|$|Salmonella tester strain TA 102 {{carries the}} hisG 428 ochre {{mutation}} on the multicopy plasmid pAQ 1. DNA sequence analysis of 45 <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertants</b> of hisG 428 on the chromosome {{in the presence}} of pKM 101 (strain TA 103) indicates that hisG 428 revertants fall into three major categories: (i) small, in-frame deletions (3 or 6 base pairs) that remove part or all of the ochre triplet; (ii) base substitution mutations at the ochre site; (iii) extragenic ochre suppressors. Deletion revertants are identified in a simple phenotypic screen by their resistance to the inhibitory histidine analog thiazolealanine, which feedback inhibits the wild-type hisG enzyme but not the enzyme resulting from the deletions. The effect of various genetic backgrounds on the generation of <b>spontaneous</b> deletion <b>revertants</b> was examined. The error-prone repair system encoded in the pKM 101 plasmid markedly increased the frequency of total spontaneous reversion events in all genetic backgrounds except recA but did not affect the frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> deletion <b>revertants</b> in any background except polA. The presence of a polA mutation increased the frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> deletion <b>revertants</b> by 2 -fold in the absence of pKM 101 and by 20 -fold with pKM 101. The presence of a uvrB mutation or a recA mutation suppressed the generation of <b>spontaneous</b> deletion <b>revertants</b> to approximately 1 / 2. 5. When hisG 428 was in multiple copies on pAQ 1, the frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> deletion <b>revertants</b> increased by 40 -fold, which is the approximate copy number of pAQ 1. Mutagenic agents that induce single-strand breaks in DNA (e. g., x-rays, bleomycin, and nalidixic acid) induced deletion revertants in TA 102. These agents induced deletion revertants only in hisG 428 on pAQ 1 and only {{in the presence of}} pKM 101.

Histidinol dehydrogenase from newly isolated spontaneous and N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NG) -induced intragenic revertants has been examined for amino acid replacements. The results provide additional evidence that NG can delete guanine plus cytosine base pairs from deoxyribonucleic acid.

The DNA sequence {{analysis showed that}} as many as three amino acid changes could be responsible for the transport defect. By recombining the cDNA clones in vitro and expressing the recombinants in COS cells, we were able to trace the critical lesion in tsO 45 to a single substitution of a polar amino acid (serine) for a hydrophobic amino acid (phenylalanine) in a hydrophobic domain. We suggest that this nonconservative substitution may block protein transport by causing protein denaturation at the nonpermissive temperature.

We investigated whether alterations in Treg function might explain these paradoxial observations. While WASp-deficient (WASp-/-) mice exibited normal thymic Treg generation, the competitive fitness of peripheral Tregs was severely compromised. The total percentage of forkhead box P 3 -positive (Foxp 3 +) Tregs among CD 4 +T cells was reduced, and WASp-/- Tregs were rapidly outcompeted by WASp+ Tregs in vivo. These findings correlated with reduced expression of markers associated with self-antigen-driven peripheral Treg activation and homing to inflamed tissue. Consistent with these findings, WASp-/- Tregs showed a reduced ability to control aberrant T cell activation and autoimmune pathology in Foxp 3 -/- Scurfy (sf) mice. Finally, WASp+ Treg exhibited a marked selective advantage in vivo in a WAS patient with a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertant</b> mutation, indicating that altered Treg fitness likely explains the autoimmune features in human WAS.

By comparison with wild-type cells, sterol and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic activities in the mutant cells grown in fetal calf serum medium appear to be nearly intact.

In vitro enzyme assays with crude cell extracts demonstrated that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is not induced in the mutant.

It is shown that the aminoglycoside kanamycin, which is effective on these streptomycin-resistant strains, was capable of inducing the uptake of streptomycin, thus giving rise to streptomycin accumulation up to wild-type levels. Plasmid-determined resistance, which has been speculated {{to be the result}} of a blockage of the uptake system by modified antibiotic molecules, cannot be overcome by the induction of streptomycin transport.

To determine the role of conserved aromatic residues adjacent to the histidyl molecule in the helix of B-j, we generated six site-directed mutants of the psaB gene in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Three mutant strains with W 645 C, W 643 C/A 644 I and S 641 C/V 642 I substitutions could grow photoautotrophically and showed no obvious reduction in the photosystem I activity. Kinetics of P 700 re-reduction by plastocyanin remained unaltered in these mutants. In contrast, the strains with H 651 C/L 652 M, F 649 C/G 650 I and F 647 C substitutions could not grow under photoautotrophic conditions because those mutants had low photosystem I activity, possibly due to low levels of proteins. A procedure to select <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertants</b> from the mutants that are incapable to photoautotrophic growth resulted in three revertants {{that were used in}} this study. The molecular analysis of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertants</b> suggested that an aromatic residue at F 647 and a small residue at G 650 may be necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of photosystem I. The (P 700 + - P 700) steady-state absorption difference spectrum of the revertant F 647 Y has a ~ 5 nm narrower peak than the recovered wild-type, suggesting that additional hydroxyl group of this revertant may participate in the interaction with the special pair while the photosystem I complexes of the F 649 C/G 650 T and H 651 Q mutants closely resemble the wild-type spectrum. The results presented here demonstrate that the highly conserved residues W 645, W 643 and F 649 are not critical for maintaining the integrity and in mediating electron transport from plastocyanin to photosystem I.

On the other hand, in matings with OU 11, a Hayes-type Hfr (HfrH), {{and these two}} F- strains, recombinant colonies derived from KY 9474 showed only 22 % polygenotypic recombinant colonies; whereas, those derived from OU 9474 showed a high production rate (57 %) of polygenotypic recombinant colonies. Among the polygenotypic recombinant colonies derived from KY 9474 maf- 1, 50 % contained three or more recombinant types. These were probably derived from {{a small fraction of}} Maf+ revertants in the KY 9474 population, as suggested by the results of mating this strain with M 80, an F' strain that contains an amber mutation in traH. These results support the hypothesis that the donor DNA fragments derived from an HfrH can undergo a limited replication in the recipient to produce polygenotypic recombinant colonies, whereas those derived from HfrC cannot...|$|E
40|$|The {{unicellular}} diazotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain BO 8402, {{isolated from}} Lake Constance, contains a novel insertion sequence, IS 8402, in the apcA gene encoding a pigmented protein of phycobilisomes. IS 8402 comprises 1, 322 bp, {{flanked by two}} inverted repeats of 15 bp. Upon insertion in the target DNA, direct duplications of 8 nucleotides were generated. One open reading frame, potentially coding for a protein of 399 amino acids, was found. The deduced amino acid sequence shows homology to putative transposases of the IS 4 family. Precise excision of the insertion element resulted in a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertant,</b> Synechocystis sp. strain BO 9201, that had regained the ability to form hemidiscoidal phycobilisomes. Apart from the unique insertion of IS 8402 into apcA in strain BO 8402 both strains contain at least 12 further homologous insertion elements at corresponding sites in the genomes. The unique insertion in strain BO 8402 prevents the expression of apcABC operon and hence abolishes the formation of intact phycobilisomes. This decreases the quantum efficiency of photosystem II and promotes anaerobic N 2 fixation in a unicellular cyanobacterium with a highly oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase...|$|E
40|$|Origin {{recognition}} complex (ORC) is a six {{subunit complex}} that functions as the replication initiator and {{is required for}} silencing the HML and HMR loci in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The roles of ORC 5 in replication initiation and silencing were investigated {{to determine whether the}} two roles were mechanistically coincident or separable. Some <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertants</b> of orc 5 - 1 were functional for replication initiation, but not silencing. Other alleles of ORC 5 were obtained that were nonfunctional for replication initiation, but fully competent for silencing. The two types of alleles, when put in the same cell, complemented, establishing two separable functions for ORC 5. These data implied that replication initiation at HMR-E was not required for silencing. The data were consistent with a model in which different ORC species functioned at different origins within the genome and that only one Orc 5 p subunit functioned at any given origin...|$|R
40|$|Duplication {{is thought}} {{to be one of the}} main {{processes}} providing a substrate on which the effects of evolution are visible. The mechanisms underlying this chromosomal rearrangement were investigated here in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>revertants</b> containing a duplication event were selected and analyzed. In addition to the single gene duplication described in a previous study, we demonstrated here that direct tandem duplicated regions ranging from 5 to 90 kb in size can also occur spontaneously. To further investigate the mechanisms in the duplication events, we examined whether homologous recombination contributes to these processes. The results obtained show that the mechanisms involved in segmental duplication are RAD 52 -independent, contrary to those involved in single gene duplication. Moreover, this study shows that the duplication of a given gene can occur in S. cerevisiae haploid strains via at least two ways: single gene or segmental duplication...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous mutants of Bacillus subtilis {{resistant}} to thiostrepton (TSP) exhibit relaxed synthesis of RNA when starved for required amino acids. Intact cells of tsp mutants cannot synthesize the regulatory nucleotides, ppGpp and pppGpp, after amino acid deprivation. Because ribosomes isolated from <b>spontaneous</b> <b>revertants</b> to thiostrepton sensitivity and from wild-type stringent strains can synthesize (p) ppGpp whereas ribosomes isolated from tsp strains cannot synthesize these regulatory nucleotides {{in the presence}} of stringent factor, it appears that the lesion is expressed {{at the level of the}} ribosome. Genetic mapping, via three-factor transformational crosses, has shown that tsp is closely linked to rif, in the order cysA 14, tsp, rif-I, strA. The phenotype of the tsp mutants indicates that they are of the relC type. Their map position indicates that they are different from a previously described B subtilis rel mutation. Ribosomes from the latter strain can synthesize (p) ppGpp in cell-free extracts...|$|R
