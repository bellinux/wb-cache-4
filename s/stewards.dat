5|$|Around 00:15, the <b>stewards</b> began {{ordering}} the passengers {{to put on}} their lifebelts, though again, many passengers took the order as a joke. Some set about playing an impromptu game of association football with the ice chunks that were now strewn across the foredeck.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{served as}} the driver {{representative}} on the <b>stewards</b> panel at the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix where he {{and the rest of}} the panel decided to relegate former rival Michael Schumacher for overtaking under yellow flag conditions. The decision led to Hill receiving hate mail.|$|E
5000|$|His {{father was}} John <b>Steward</b> (1786-1826), {{and his mother}} was Eunice Wilcox (1787-1875). He married Johanna Glidden (1808-1896).

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the <b>stewards</b> could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the <b>stewards,</b> occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups of women and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the <b>stewards</b> as he was deemed to gain an {{advantage}} by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the <b>stewards</b> deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The <b>stewards</b> elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable.|$|E

5|$|Hart House resembles some {{traditional}} aspects of student representation through its financial support of student clubs, and its standing committees and board of <b>stewards</b> that are composed mostly of undergraduate students. However, the main students' unions on administrative and policy issues are the University of Toronto Students' Union, Association of Part-time Undergraduate Students and the Graduate Students' Union. Student representative bodies also exist {{at the various}} colleges, academic faculties and departments.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, a new fastest lap of the track ever at 1:36.006. However, he also came under investigation of the <b>stewards</b> as he failed to obliged the rules set for turn 2, rejoining the track earlier than allowed after running wide. After being summoned to the <b>stewards</b> at the end of qualifying, he walked away with a reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At {{the tail end of the}} field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|Race <b>stewards</b> {{initially}} {{imposed a}} 10-place penalty on Coulthard and Barrichello, for changing their engines prior to qualification. Since 2006, the engines of Formula One cars {{are required to}} last for two races. However, after further investigation they rescinded Coulthard's penalty, as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made {{before the start of}} the race weekend. Barrichello's penalty stood.|$|E

5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli provided {{teams with}} the hard, medium and soft compounds of tyre—the three hardest compounds available—for the race. Just {{as the year}} before, the race <b>stewards</b> warned drivers about exceeding the track limits around the circuit, stressing that lap times during qualifying would be disallowed should drivers not stay within the lines indicating the track borders.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} <b>stewards</b> {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for {{crossing}} the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply.

Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are <b>stewards</b> at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E

5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the <b>stewards</b> of their {{inability}} to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great {{attention}} to his estate around Busseto, purchasing additional land, dealing with unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) <b>stewards,</b> installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic slumps. In 1867, both Verdi's father Carlo, {{with whom he had}} restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo's great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, as their own child. She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi's friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually the heirs of Verdi's estate.|$|E
