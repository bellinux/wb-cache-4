On 1 February: [...] "Sergeant Pepper sounds good. Paul tells me that I will get {{royalties}} on the song—great news, now perhaps a new home."

2500|$|Members of {{this small}} commune (occasionally joined by Galina Kuznetsova and Margarita Stepun) were bent on survival: they grew {{vegetables}} and greens, helping one another out at a time when, according to Zurov, [...] "Grasse's population had eaten all of their cats and dogs". A journalist who visited the Villa in 1942 described Bunin as a [...] "skinny and emaciated man, looking like an ancient patrician". For Bunin, though, this isolation was a blessing and he refused to re-locate to Paris where conditions might have been better. [...] "It takes 30 minutes of climbing to reach our villa, but there's not another view {{in the whole world}} like the one that's facing us," [...] he wrote. [...] "Freezing cold, though, is damning and making it impossible for me to write," [...] he complained in one of his letters. Vera Muromtseva-Bunina remembered: [...] "There were five or <b>six</b> <b>of</b> <b>us...</b> and we were all writing continuously. This was the only way for us to bear the unbearable, to overcome hunger, cold and fear." ...|$|E

I {{chose to go}} round the wicket and {{obviously}} we put men round the bat, 'Brears' (Mike Brearley the captain) at first slip, Graham Roope, Bob Willis, 'Both' all round the bat. I just bowled it right and it was magic really; it just turned a fraction and bounced, and 'Iqqie' nicked it. Brears just dived to his left and caught the ball about a foot off the ground, landed in front of Roopey and Willis, Iqqie just looked up the wicket at me, nodded, said, 'Well bowled'; the umpire went bananas, shaking hands and saying, 'I've never seen a hat-trick before, well bowled.' And ironically this was on my debut. 12 months previously, on the same ground, Peter Petherick of New Zealand had just done the first hat-trick ever on debut, so {{it would have been}} 12 months to the day {{and it would have been}} a unique place in history." [...] "But Mike in landing got a lot of gravel on the back of his hand. Iqqie left the field and all the lads were up there when suddenly Brears started saying, ‘I’m going to bring him back because I don't think I caught it cleanly.' All the lads around him were adamant he had caught it a foot off the ground, but he said, 'No, for the best interests of this series I'm going to bring him back.' So he brought him back – and for the best interests of the series, <b>six</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were lbw in our first innings. It happened, but it was a moment of disappointment because something like that on a Test debut is very special. As somebody once said, 'If bad luck hadn't been invented, we'd have had none at all!'" ...|$|E
