50|$|By the 1920s, a {{combination}} of the reducing calorific value of the waste and an end to Sunday collection of waste, led to an additional Babcock & Wilcox boiler being installed and used when there was insufficient waste for the destructor furnaces. This boiler was fuelled by coke, a by-product of the Coal gas production process, often being sourced from the Cambridge gas works next to the pumping station.By 1942 this boiler provided the main steam supply, the destructor cells being used only for trade refuse and <b>standby</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E

50|$|Due to {{problems}} experienced with No. 26 whilst at Hebburn {{that required the}} hiring of a South Maitland Railways locomotive and since that SMR was short of locos due {{to the state of}} their loco fleet at the time, JABAS purchased 4-6-4T 3013 from the New South Wales Department of Railways. This locomotive was built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1903 (builder's No. 4456). This loco was delivered to Hebburn Colliery at Weston on 15 May 1967, where it remained until the closure of Hebburn No. 2 Colliery in June 1972 when it was transferred to Hexham on 12 July 1972. It was regularly used on duties at Hexham until the arrival of the second SMR Ten class loco in May 1973, when it was used mainly on <b>standby</b> <b>duties</b> until being stored in 1976. In 1981 the loco was sold to the Lachlan Valley Railway, where it was dismantled for overhaul. In October 2009 the dismantled loco was transferred to the Canberra Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|The first {{transmitter}} (and {{likely the}} first antenna, package deals were {{very common in}} the early days of television) was/were built by Standard Electronics. This was installed at the Comanche Peak site east of Roswell. It was later moved to the Caprock tower. In the early sixties an RCA TT-25-DH (25,000 watt visual output, fourth (D) series, high band VHF output channel) was installed at the new site. After the 1960 collapse of the first 1610 ft tower, the 875 ft tower (formerly used by KFVS-TV in Cape Girardeau, Missouri) was installed a fraction of a mile from the former and future tall tower site. In the mid-1980s a Harris Transmitter was installed and the TT-25DH was retired to <b>standby</b> <b>duty,</b> where it currently serves.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{carried the}} lighter green livery since arrival in 1983, the {{locomotive}} was withdrawn in 1989 and the wheels removed for reprofiling and major engine work.

When the line had visiting locomotives in 1998 as part of the Steam 125 event, [...] "Walrus" [...] needed to be stored in the open to accommodate the visitors so the wheels were replaced at this time, and a coat of battleship grey paint applied to smarten her up. War Department transfers were also applied to the false tanks at this time. By 2003 interest had resurfaced (the 50th anniversary of the two the previous year having sparked interest), and over the winter the locomotive was overhauled and repainted into a maroon colour scheme with yellow features. It now operates on gala days and performs works train duties, shared with No.1 [...] "Dolphin".

The next day the Dominican Republic crisis arose, and upon delivery of her cargo at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico she headed for San Juan where she went on four-hour <b>standby</b> <b>duty.</b> In May she made one trip to Little Creek, returning to the Caribbean within two weeks with Army units aboard. On 8 June, she debarked these units at Puerta de Andres, Dominican Republic and loaded other Army units for a voyage back to the east coast. She returned to Little Creek on 15 June, but {{before the end of}} the year completed three more Caribbean deployments; 13 August to 15 September 25 October to 10 November, and 18 November to 8 December. On 11 December the LST was assigned active status and then underwent overhaul in preparation for extended sea duty.|$|E
50|$|On 24 April, she was {{returned}} to the operational control of the Commander, 7th Amphibious Force. She moved to Cebu harbor where she served <b>standby</b> <b>duty</b> as fire—support ship for the Americal Division. That assignment proved relatively uneventful until {{the first week in}} May. On 3 May, she took under fire a group of houses on Nailon Point near Tobagan village, Cebu, rumored to harbor a concentration of Japanese troops. From there. Abbot moved along the coast toward Cebu harbor, firing at targets of opportunity as she went. She repeated the mission three days later and then departed Cebu on 8 May. Staged through Mindoro, the destroyer participated in the landings at Macajalar Bay on the island of Mindanao. She participated in the preparatory shore bombardment early on the 10th though it later proved to have been unnecessary when the assault troops encountered absolutely no Japanese. The ship remained in the neighborhood until the 14th to be on hand should her guns be needed. On that day, she shaped a course back to San Pedro Bay and spent the next three weeks engaged in patrols and escort missions in the southern Philippines. She concluded her Philippine service with a 10-day tender availability at Leyte.|$|E

5000|$|The Portsmouth Queen {{was built}} in 1966. This vessel {{replaced}} the other two original, smaller, Gosport ferries. However three of the original, smaller diesel powered ferries were kept and used for harbour cruises {{in the summer and}} <b>standby</b> ferry <b>duties</b> in the winter months, when Gosport Queen or Portsmouth Queen was away for refit. The three original ferries the company kept were Vita, Vesta and Ferry Queen, they were fondly known by retired Captain Albert 'Tiddler' Jessey and his Grandchild as 'The Marjorie Daw boats', (after the nursery rhyme), as they rolled in rough weather like the motion of a seesaw. In 1974 Vita, Vesta and Ferry Queen were sold {{with the arrival of the}} 'Southsea Queen'. The Portsmouth Queen has since been sold to Absolute Charters.

However, at 119 GRT she proved too small for her job and was sold to White Horse Ferries for use on its Hythe Ferry service just four years later. She was repainted from her green with red band livery to a red and white livery, and was renamed Hythe Hotspur. She was withdrawn from this service in 1995 and chartered to Brownsea Island Ferries Ltd for service in Poole Harbour. She initially kept the name Hythe Hotspur but was later sold to Blue Funnel Cruises in 1997 and renamed Poole Scene. She sailed from Poole Quay until early 1998, when she returned to Southampton. In 1999, she was sold to Clyde Marine Services and renamed Cruiser. As such, she operates as a charter cruise vessel operating out of Greenock and cruising the Clyde.|$|R
5000|$|Solent Enterprise (formerly Gay Enterprise) was {{previously}} {{the pride of}} the fleet.

She looked similar to the other ferries built in 1966, but had a bar, dance floor, restaurant, deck shelter and was painted with an apple green hull and funnels, but instead of the red logo, with white PHF lettering, she had a dark green band, all the way round the white superstructure.
