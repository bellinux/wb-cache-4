40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} the specific aspects that influence or limit {{the application of}} remotely-sensed data for information retrieval from coastal marine, estuarine and riverine environments. The thesis is drawn principally from ten separate studies and is divided into discrete sections, or experiments, that provide {{an understanding of the}} fundamental aspects {{of the effects of the}} atmosphere, water surface, water column and bottom on sensor-received reflected signal. The results show the importance of precise calculation of acquisition parameters and the absolute importance of relevant reference data. Most instrumentation for remote sensing at visible wavelengths has been developed for terrestrial applications where signal is rarely limiting and target features are relatively static. For in-water applications, where signal is small and noise can be large, the features to be sensed may be temporally dynamic and obscured. However, the work presented also shows the great benefit and spatial cost-effectiveness that can be obtained if the spectral and temporal specification is adequately considered. The prime motivation for such applications usually comes from the requirement to detect and quantify water column characteristics, such as phytoplankton forming as algal blooms, and bottom <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>condition,</b> such as benthic habitat mapping for fishery or conservation purposes...|$|R
40|$|A fully coupled {{mathematical}} model of land subsidence caused by groundwater pumping was established {{based on the}} mechanics of porous seepage and the theory of fluid-solid interaction. The {{mathematical model}} employing the Galerkin finite element method was proposed to simulate the deformation dependencies of hydraulic properties due to the water pressure decrease in aquifers. This model has been verified by comparing with the known analytical solutions in the confined aquifer. Results show that the simulated drawdown and displacements match well with those of analytical solutions. To evaluate the nonlinear effects of hydraulic properties in the seepage and consolidation coupling phenomena, the numerical model is applied to an ideal three layers numerical experiment. The {{results show that the}} subsidence rate is faster than conventional groundwater theory when the nonlinear hydraulic properties (NHP) are considered in the coupled model. The reason is that the water level decline due to groundwater withdrawal induces the soil compression and the porosity and permeability decrease. Decrease of permeability in regions adjacent to the pumping well produces hydraulic gradient and seepage forces that may result in accelerated subsidence. Therefore, the effect of the NHP is an interaction process of pore water pressure and soil consolidation deformation and should not be ignored. Further studies of various hydrogeology problems are recommended to consider the heterogeneity concerning different <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>condition</b> in the field...|$|R

Effects of the non-synchronous seismic action on the seismic response of a long bridge founded on a soft soil deposit overlying an inclined bedrock are investigated.

40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have been {{conducted}} on organic carbon (OC) variation in mangrove ecosystems. However, few have examined its relationship with soil quality and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>condition.</b> Mangrove OC characteristics would be explicitly understood if those two parameters were taken into account. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine mangrove OC characteristics qualitatively and quantitatively after distinguishing mangrove OC from other OC. Geological survey revealed that the underground of a mangrove ecosystem was composed of three layers: a top layer of mangrove origin and two underlying sublayers of geologic origin. The underlying sublayers were formed from different materials, as shown by X-ray fluorescence analysis. Despite a large thickness exceeding 700 cm in contrast to the 100 cm thickness of the mangrove mud layer, the sublayers had much lower OC stock. Mangrove mud layer formation started from the time of mangrove colonization, which dated back to between 1330 and 1820 14 C years BP, and OC stock in the mangrove mud layer was more than half of the total OC stock in the underground layers, which had been accumulating since 7200 14 C years BP. pH and redox potential (Eh) of the surface soils varied depending on vegetation type. In the surface soils, pH correlated to C% (r = − 0. 66, p < 0. 01). C/N ratios varied widely from 3. 9 to 34. 3, indicating that mangrove OC had various sources. The pH and Eh gradients were important factors affecting the OC stock and the mobility/uptake of chemical elements in the mangrove mud layer. Humic acids extracted from the mangrove mud layer had relatively high aliphatic contents, in contrast with the carboxylic acid rich sublayers, indicating that humification has not yet progressed in mangrove soil...|$|R

In the form analyses, the symmetric products (P) of Tibetan pinnacles present large differences between individual pinnacles. The plan forms, represented by long/short axes ratios (R L/S), are mostly irregular and scattered and the diameter/height ratios (R d/h) reveal that the Tibetan features could belong to any three cone or tower karst types, according to Balaze's classification of karst towers. The direction of pinnacle development seems to be primarily related to slope aspect and to geological structure. The morphological structure and orientation analyses show that pinnacle development is largely controlled by lithological and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The closed water catchment structure, which is a basic feature in karst areas, has not been found in the limestone pinnacle areas of Tibet. The results of the form and structure analyses for the Tibetan pinnacles differ from those for tropical and subtropical karst areas.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the effects of soil-structure {{interaction}} and the spatial variability of seismic motion due to site effects on the seismic response of a multi-span viaduct on pile foundations. In particular, site effects induced in a soft clay deposit by an inclined bedrock layout are evaluated through different models, characterised by an increasing level of accuracy, which allows determining the free-field motion that is adopted to perform soilstructure interaction analyses in the frame of the substructure approach. The seismic input is represented at the outcropping bedrock by a set of suitably selected and scaled real accelerograms. After a brief presentation of the adopted numerical procedure, analyses results are presented focusing on both site and structural response. Amplifications effects obtained from simplified linear equivalent 1 D and nonlinear 2 D site response models are compared, discussing the applicability of the simplified approach. Structural responses, obtained by considering the non-synchronous motion resulting from the local <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions,</b> in conjunction with soil-structure interaction effects, are shown in terms of piers displacement and ductility demands. Furthermore, the role of soil structure interaction is clarified comparing results with those obtained from fixed base bridge models, proving that its contribution is more significant if the simplified model for site response is adopted...|$|E
40|$|Throught {{continental}} Southeast Asia, the Hoabinhian techno-complex {{stands out}} in clear contrast with the universal chrono-cultural model essentially established {{on the basis of}} western prehistory. Following this model, early authors considered perforated stones and associated lithic artefacts as markers of what was then believed to pertain to a Southeast Asian Mesolithic. However, Southeast Asian Mesolitithic has progressively been abandoned in favour of a ubiquitous Hoabinhian spanning from 30, 000 to 3000 BP. Here, we present and discuss the discovery of perforated stones at the Doi Pha Kan site in northern Thailand. Perforated stones have almost never been found in undisturbed <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions</b> nor dated with any sufficient degree of certainty. At Doi Pha Kan site, such a kind of artefacts was found in burials intersecting sedimentary layers that could be ascertained as Hoabinhian. In contrast with similar perforated stones described in the literature, that found at Doi Pha Kan are well-dated (13, 000 BP), thus providing a time-reference for a putative Southeast Asian Mesolithic. We therefore advocate that such non-Hoabinhian artefacts support the early authors' hypothesis of the existence of a Southeast Asian Mesolithic. Finally, the funerary practices, the unusually high stature of individuals found at Doi Pha Kan in conjunction with the particular lithic assemblages further contributes to raise the question of the co-occurrence of several cultures or populations at the Pleistocene-Holocene interface in continental Southeast Asia...|$|E

The rocks of the area include carbonates, sandstones, mudstones, cherts, phosphorite, metamorphic rocks, intrusive igneous rocks, and unconsolidated sediments and have been divided into 16 mapped units. An undetermined thickness of Precambrian metamorphic basement rocks, approximately 7, 000 feet of sedimentary rocks, and an undetermined thickness of Tertiary intrusive igneous rocks are exposed in the area. In addition, surficial deposits of unconsolidated alluvium and landslide debris are present in the area. Sedimentary rocks in the area are correlated with the Devonian Jefferson and Three Forks Formations, the Mississippian Lodgepole and Mission Canyon Formations, the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian Amsden Formation, the Pennsylvanian Quadrant Formation, the Permian Park City, Shedhorn, and Phosphoria Formations, the Triassic Dinwoody Formation, the Jurassic Sawtooth, Rierdon, and Morrison Formations, and the Cretaceous Kootenai Formation and Colorado Group. The area has undergone two major episodes of deformation. The first occurred in latest Cretaceous to Early Tertiary time when compressive forces produced thrust-faulting and folding in the area.

40|$|The most {{different}} faunal and floral assemblages {{have experienced}} several events of extinction, diversity reduction and diversification during Cretaceous. Such events are basically coeval to rapid reorganizations of the regional-to-global hydrosphere/atmosphere systems following relevant geodynamic pulses. Biotic assemblages shifted repeatedly among phases of carbonate production modes dominated by oligotrophic specialized and meso-eutrophic opportunistic taxa, namely k- and r-mode forms, {{as well as}} microbes, {{as a consequence of}} major turning points in the evolving paleoceanographic <b>conditions.</b> <b>Stratigraphic</b> data on several Cretaceous successions of southern Apennines and Apulia (southern Italy) have demonstrated that brachiopods were a main component of r-mode assemblages which developed in latest Valanginian, late Early Aptian, earliest Cenomanian, and latest Campanian. With the exception of the latest Campanian event, all of these time intervals correspond to severe global environmental disruptions of the oceans and climate coupled to biocalcification crises. However, all of them correlate to the Cretaceous Tethyan oceanic anoxic events (WEISSERT and SELLI OAEs) and/or platform drownings (Late Valanginian, late Early Aptian, Early Cenomanian and latest Campanian). Noteworthy, all of the investigated events reflect regional shifts among chlorozoan, foramol and microbial production modes of the Mediterranean shallow- water carbonate factories. The remarkable association of brachiopoda with cyanobacteria, though in complex stratigraphic relationships, especially in Late Valanginian, late Early Aptian, and Early Cenomanian times accounts for drastic environmental deterioration of the surface oceanic waters which were highly unfavourable for oligotrophic, k-mode organisms. We assume that such a relevant correlation between Cretaceous brachiopod beds and disruptions of the paleoceanographic conditions may provide an additional tool to improve the comprehension of the internal structure of major paleoecologic changes due to the environmental collapse of oceanic ecosystems during drowning events of carbonate platforms and/or OAEs...|$|R
40|$|We {{have applied}} an {{attribute-based}} autopicking algorithm to reflection seismics {{with the aim}} of reducing the influence of the user’s subjectivity on the picking results and making the interpretation faster with respect to manual and semiautomated techniques. Our picking procedure uses the cosine of the instantaneous phase to automatically detect and mark as a horizon any recorded event characterized by lateral phase continuity. A patching procedure, which exploits horizon parallelism, can be used to connect consecutive horizons marking the same event but separated by noise-related gaps. The picking process marks all coherent events regardless of their reflection strength; therefore, a large number of independent horizons can be constructed. To facilitate interpretation, horizons marking different phases of the same reflection can be automatically grouped together and specific horizons from each reflection can be selected using different possible methods. In the phase method, the algorithm reconstructs the reflected wavelets by averaging the cosine of the instantaneous phase along each horizon. The resulting wavelets are then locally analyzed and confronted through crosscorrelation, allowing the recognition and selection of specific reflection phases. In case the reflected wavelets cannot be recovered due to shape-altering processing or a low signal-to-noise ratio, the energy method uses the reflection strength to group together subparallel horizons within the same energy package and to select those satisfying either energy or arrival time criteria. These methods can be applied automatically to all the picked horizons or to horizons individually selected by the interpreter for specific analysis. We show examples of application to 2 D reflection seismic data sets in complex geologic and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions,</b> critically reviewing the performance of the whole process...|$|E
40|$|The {{route of}} the old road of Valencia matches with the old sea line of the XI century, as {{evidenced}} by the archaeological remains of Roman’s beach and boats. The main argument of the project is the nature of “ancient line of the Sea” of this road, cause it had determined its whole history. From the fifties the main industries of aggregate extraction around the Delta concentrate their activities along the Valencia road, thanks to optimal <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions</b> for closeness and presence of gravels. It was during the eighties, and especially in the period 1971 - 1974, between the closure of the Montjuic Landfill and the opening of the Garraf one, that there was a strong pollution both of water and soil caused by uncontrolled activities related with waste landfill of the big holes left by mining activities. This invisible contamination affects the landscape leaving heavy footprints as the largest abandonment of agricultural plots. A territorial vision about the future of this landscape is suggested through four main themes: 1) The agricultural production: the base structure of this landscape, its matrix, reconstructed with plots of soil phytodepuration; 2) Energy and landscape: as a way to interpret the locus and as a possible paradigm for waste productive landscapes, defining strategies for produce, recycle and save energy; 3) Cultural heritage as a potential activator of the landscape memory and identity, the traces of the ancient sea line as a heritage to be revealed; 4) Visual structure as the tool to understand, to design and to explore a way to “draw atmospheres” and inform the design decisions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of coastal plains {{affected}} by soil and water salination, a knowledge of several geological aspects, such as structural features, depth to basement, stratigraphy of sedimentary cover, relationships between the phreatic aquifer and underlying aquifers, and the latter's structure, is basic to gaining an adequate understanding of both the causes and possible evolution of salination. In this framework, geophysical techniques can play a very important role. To improve the available geophysical information about the Muravera coastal plain, Sardinia, Italy, which is affected by severe soil and water salination, previously acquired electrical resistivity, reflection seismic and gravity data have been reprocessed, and a new seismic reflection survey has been conducted. Moreover, {{in order to give}} better support to the geological and hydrogeological interpretation of geophysical data, three boreholes were drilled. Reprocessed electrical data indicate the presence of a wide, electrically homogeneous low-resistivity zone associated with salination phenomena. Reprocessed reflection data provide useful information on the near-surface stratigraphy. The combined interpretation of resistivity and seismic results, supported by one calibration borehole, elucidates the relationships between the phreatic aquifer and the underlying confined aquifer. A new seismic reflection survey gives information on the depth to, and structure of, the Paleozoic basement, as well as on <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions</b> of Pleistocene-Holocene sediments. Finally, the combined interpretation of seismic, gravity, and well data results in a geological section containing most of the information considered essential, such as the interface between Holocene alluvium and Pleistocene alluvium, the thickness of the latter, and the structure and composition of the Paleozoic basement. The work as a whole shows how the combined application of geophysical techniques can in this specific situation provide wide-ranging and high-quality information that is essential for the realistic mathematical modeling of aquifer contamination, and can enable the rational planning of exploratory drilling...|$|E
40|$|Site {{amplification}} of earthquake ground motion {{can arise}} from local <b>stratigraphic</b> and morphological <b>conditions.</b> In this respect, a detailed geo-mechanical 2 D model is needed, in particular for peculiar situations {{such as the}} ones in Alpine valleys. This paper reports a site characterization case history for seismic response analysis, where a combination of both body and surface wave seismic techniques has been used. In particular, it is shown that synergies and mutual cross-checking of information lead to a reliable 2 D model for site amplification studies. The evaluation of the deep structure and the location of the seismic bedrock have been obtained through seismic reflection and combined active-passive surface wave analysis, while the shear-wave velocity profile of the sediments has been obtained by downhole measurements and surface wave tests. Furthermore, a detailed compressional wave velocity model has been retrieved by tomographic inversion of the first arrivals picked on seismic reflection records. This model is useful for geological interpretation as well as for quality control of the other methods. Surface wave analysis has also been performed on the ground roll of the seismic reflection records. The large amount of profile oriented data has made it possible to reconstruct lateral variations of the shear-wave velocity in the soil deposit. The final pseudo- 2 D shear-wave velocity model is the product of an innovative inversion approach, based on the integration of the Monte Carlo and laterally constrained least-squares techniques. In the laterally constrained inversion the shear-wave velocity profiles obtained from downhole tests and data from passive surface wave measurements have been used to constrain the inversion. This has greatly improved the final solution. This case history underlines the necessity of combining different seismic techniques to derive an accurate and reliable 2 D model for site amplification studies. Through several different and independent analyses of the same seismic records, the cost effectiveness of the whole survey is optimized and a full exploitation of the information contained in the reflection seismic data set is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Three consecutive, time-equivalent valley fills of Lateglacial-Holocene age (13 to 8 cal kyr BP) were {{identified}} in the Tuscan coastal plain, across a 30 km long transect approximately parallel to the present Tyrrhenian Sea shoreline. From South to North, the Arno valley fill is 35 - 40 m thick and 5 - 7 km wide, the Serchio valley fill is 15 - 20 m thick and 7 - 8 km wide, while the Camaiore valley fill is 20 - 30 m thick and 8 - 10 km wide. The three valley fills display remarkably similar facies architecture, with thin basal fluvial deposits overlain {{by a variety of}} transgressive, mud-dominated coastal plain and estuarine deposits. The valley bodies deeply incise and crosscut sand and gravel-prone fluvial-channel deposits assigned to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and are capped by a sheet-like, late transgressive succession of shoreline sands grading vertically into offshore clays. Beneath present Arno River, the valley body consists internally of three superposed millennial-scale cycles bounded by flooding surfaces (parasequences). These cycles display a similar facies architecture, with sharp-based central/outer estuarine clays grading upward into inner-estuary, bay-head delta and coastal-plain deposits. Overall, the three parasequences display an aggradational, rather than retrogradational stacking pattern, which is interpreted to reflect the complex relation between eustatic sea-level rise and sediment supply during the post-LGM transgression. Diagnostic changes in vegetation patterns, driven by opposite climate conditions, enable documentation of parasequence development as a function of climate change. Pollen spectra invariably show expansions of broad-leaved forests at parasequence boundaries, suggesting that rapid shifts to warmer climate conditions accompanied episodes of sea-level rise. In contrast, stillstand phases saw the development of cold-temperate communities, suggesting transition to temporary colder climate <b>conditions.</b> <b>Stratigraphic</b> architecture beneath the Lateglacial-Holocene valley bodies shows that the coastal system of Tuscany experienced multiple cycles of fluvial incision and subsequent valley filling in response to late Quaternary sea-level fluctuations. Below the LGM fluvial deposits, an older set of estuarine clays is observed at depths ranging from 40 to 90 m. Based upon physical correlations with nearshore deposits, these valley fills are likely to record an older phase of generalized fluvial incision, which is tentatively assigned to the MIS 6 - 5 transition...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2010. Major: Geological Sciences. Advisor: Dr. Howard Mooers. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 80 pages. Ill. (maps col.) Beginning {{in the early}} 1990 ‘s, a portion of Deer Creek, {{a tributary of the}} Nemadji River in the Lake Superior basin, experienced the formation of sediment volcanoes in its creek bed, along with related slumping, enhanced erosion rates, and turbidity in excess of state total maximum daily load (TMDL) limits. Slumping near the stream has increased erosion rates and may eventually threaten the stability of nearby structures. The resulting excess turbidity negatively impacts aquatic wildlife, and increases sedimentation rates and dredging costs in downstream navigable waters. Slumping and formation of sediment volcanoes at Deer Creek were likely caused when dynamite was used to destroy a nearby beaver dam on the creek. Some combination of rapid pond drainage and/or disturbance from the explosives may have led to fracturing of a glacio-lacustrine clay confining layer over a locally extensive aquifer. A sediment volcano and associated slumping are also present along nearby Mud Creek. The sediment volcano areas at Deer and Mud Creeks both occur at the toe of 10 -meter high slumps. The failure planes of these slumps may facilitate formation of sediment volcanoes by providing pathways for groundwater to reach the surface. Predicting slump locations should then also help predict the location of potential sediment volcanoes. The <b>stratigraphic</b> and hydrologic <b>conditions</b> in Deer and Mud Creeks are similar to those throughout nearby areas in the Nemadji River basin. This project examines the relationship between the slumps and sediment volcanoes, and develops a predictive model of the potential for slope failure in the lacustrine clay portions of the basin. A 3 -D model of stratigraphy and hydraulic potential from more than 300 wells is used, along with slope stability analysis with the stress-slope and Mohr-Coulomb equations in a GIS. Results of the modeling found higher susceptibility for slumping in areas of high slope and high potentiometric surface. The model correlated well at a 92 % rate with a data set of 322 inventoried slumps, and included both volcano areas, without overpredicting high-risk slump areas. Another model, SINMAP 2. 0, was run to test the veracity of the original model‘s results. Both models were in good agreement with each other. This project provides a reasonable approximation of slope stability and can be used to assist in land use planning to help reduce erosion and its consequences...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Over 10, 000 feet {{of marine}} and nonmarine Late Cretaceous {{sedimentary}} rocks are exposed within a 110 square mile area in northeastern Teton County, Wyoming. An additional 1400 feet of nonmarine Paleocene and Miocene rocks overlie these. Landslide deposits and Pleistocene glacial moraine cover over {{one-half of the}} area. The Late Cretaceous Cody Shale and Bacon Ridge Sandstone, which are the oldest rocks exposed, represent the last marine invasion of the region. The overlying Late Cretaceous nonmarine rocks consist of the Coaly Sequence, Lenticular Sandstone and Shale Sequence, Mesaverde Formation, and Harebell Formation. These formations are composed largely of poorly sorted quartz arenites with intercalated mudstones, claystones, shales, and coals. A few quartzite conglomerate lenses are present {{near the top of}} the sequence. These rocks, which contain numerous quartz, chert, and metaquartzite grains, were derived from Precambrian metamorphic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks exposed to the west and northwest. The sediments were carried into the area by streams and were deposited on a broad coastal plain similar to the modern Texas Gulf Coast. Many of the fine-grained sediments were deposited in swamps and small freshwater lakes. Near the end of Cretaceous time, a large area of Precambrian Beltian quartzite was exposed in central Montana. Powerful streams carried large volumes of coarse sediments into the area mapped forming the Paleocene Pinyon Conglomerate. Basalt and andesite were extruded locally during the Miocene. Morainal deposits from two Pleistocene glacial stages are recognized. Two periods of Laramide deformation are represented by broad asymmetric folds.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a case study conducted on the Holocene alluvial deposits of the Tiber River valley, in the city of Rome. The main test site selected for the study, Valco S. Paolo, is located about 2 km South of Rome's historical centre. The alluvial deposits were dynamically characterized in a comprehensive way via site investigations and geotechnical laboratory tests. Normalized shear modulus decay and damping curves (G/G(0) and D/D(0) vs gamma) were obtained for the dominantly fine-grained levels. The curves demonstrate that these levels have a more marked shear stiffness decay if compared with the underlying Pliocene bedrock. Decay curves from laboratory tests for the Tiber alluvia correlated well with the trend of the function proposed by Hardin and Drnevich, making it possible to derive their specific interpolation function coefficients. Use was made of the extrapolation of the findings from the Valco S. Paolo test site to a large part of Rome's historical centre by means of two other test sites, supported by an engineering-geology model of the complex spatial distribution of the Tiber alluvia. The experimental Valco S. Paolo Vs profile was extrapolated to the other test sites {{on the basis of a}} stratigraphic criterion; the analysis of seismic noise measurements, obtained for the three test sites, validated the engineering-geology based extrapolation and showed that the main rigidity contrast occurs inside the alluvial body (at the contact with the underlying basal gravel-level G) and not between the alluvia and the Plio-Pleistocene bedrock, composed of highly consistent clay (Marne Vaticane). The 1 D modeling of local seismic response to the maximum expected earthquakes in the city of Rome confirms that the deposits have one principal mode of vibration at about 1 Hz. However, the simulation also evidenced that the silty-clay deposits (level C), making up the most part of the Tiber alluvial body, play a key role in characterizing the soil column deformation profile since it can be affected by non linear effects induced by the maximum expected earthquake when some <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions</b> are satisfied...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Presentation date: 1965 - 05 - 14 Over 3, 000 feet of nonmarine Late Cretaceous {{sedimentary}} rocks are exposed within the northern Fish Lake Plateau. The Cretaceous strata are overlain by over 2, 000 feet of Early Tertiary nonmarine {{sedimentary rocks}} and volcanics. Landslide deposits cover over {{one-half of the}} area. The Late Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation, the oldest formation exposed, was deposited in fluvial, swamp, coastal lagoon, and possibly shallow marine environments during the eastward retreat of the Mancos sea. This formation is overlain disconformably by the Late Cretaceous Price River Formation which is composed largely of quartz arenites derived from Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks exposed to the west. The sediments were carried into the area by streams and were deposited under piedmont and flood plain conditions. The Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary North Horn formation conformably overlies the Price River Formation. The lower part is composed largely of fluvial sandstones but, in the upper part, lacustrine mudstones and siltstones predominate. The latter were deposited in the Uinta Lake which persisted until late middle Eocene. In this lake the Early Tertiary Flagstaff, Colton and Green River Formations were deposited in succession. After an interval of erosion, the Eocene Gray Gulch Formation was deposited and, later, lavas of Oligocene age. Two periods of folding are reflected by structures within the area. The Early Laramide orogeny caused the disconformity between the Blackhawk and Price River Formations, and a later period of folding, between the late Eocene and Miocene, formed the Wasatch and Gates Creek monoclines. Late Tertiary normal faulting has been superimposed on the earlier structures. There {{do not appear to}} be favorable structures for the accumulation of oil and gas. However, <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions</b> exist for both the formation and accumulation of oil and gas. The Mancos Shale, a known source rock for oil and gas farther to the east, is present in the sub-surface. Sand pinchouts in Late Cretaceous strata are believed to exist in the subsurface. Potential production in this area will depend on the presence of these updip sand pinchouts...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the genesis of loess-derived soils in southern Iowa. Field sites were selected on flat and sloping primary divides along two linear traverses oriented to represent loess distributional patterns. Field measurements for each site included loess thickness and the vertical extent of a zone of groundwater saturation perched above the slowly permeable paleosolic surface immediately subjacent to the loess. Physical and chemical properties of the genetically related soils were evaluated with relation to horizon differentiation, natural drainage, and their potential as indices of soil development in loess-derived soils;Loess thickness on the flat and sloping primary divides decreased systematically with distance from the major source area (the Missouri River Valley). Internal drainage of the soils became poorer as loess thickness decreased and distance from the source area increased. Maximum clay content in the solum and B/A clay ratio were found to increase with distance from the source area as loess thickness decreased and as the internal drainage became poorer on the flat and sloping divides. As the loess decreased in thickness from west to east, the depth to the Yarmouth-Sangamon surface decreased {{as well as the}} depth to the water table perched above this slowly permeable paleosolic surface. Negative correlations were found between the depth to the perched water table and distance from the loess source, capillary porosity of the B and C horizons, total porosity of the B horizon, and rainfall on the flat and sloping divides. Positive correlations were found between the depth to the perched water table and total porosity of the C horizon and temperature on the flat and sloping divides;Mathematical prediction equations were formulated that adequately predict the monthly depth to the perched water table on the flat and sloping divides. The higher water tables on the eastern end of the traverses were attributed to the <b>stratigraphic</b> and geomorphic <b>conditions</b> of the divides. This high water table provided an environment conducive to accelerated weathering. This weathering was reflected in the increase in 3 ̆c 2 micron clay with distance from the source area, higher B/A clay ratios, the depth distribution of total, inorganic, and available phosphorus and organic carbon in the loess-derived profiles;Total, inorganic, and available phosphorus values showed distinct eluvial and illuvial zones in their depth distribution. The zones were found to be more pronounced from west to east along the traverses. Organic phosphorus and organic carbon decreased vertically with increasing depth in all profiles studied. The weighted average total and organic phosphorus and organic carbon in the 10 - 40 inch section and the solum decreased as horizon differentiation increased and as the internal drainage of the soils became poorer...|$|R
40|$|The present PhD thesis {{deals with}} the hydrogeological and hydrochemical {{conditions}} in the coastal part of the hydrologic basin of Almyros in Magnesia Prefecture. The study area covering an area 134 km 2, is constituted from two subbasins, Eyxenoypolis and Soyrpis. To the North it is bounded by the Nea Agchialos fault, to the South it is bounded by the village Soyrpi, and to the West it is bounded by the semi mountainous area. From a geological point of view, the Alpine bedrock of Almyros bain comprises formations belonging to the Ypopelagoniki (schist, calcitic schists and ultrabasic rocks) and Pelagoniki (Paleozoic rocks of Permio, crystalline limestones of Triassic- Jurassic age, shales cherts group, limestones and flysch) zone, respectively. The post-alpine sequence comprises Neogene deposits with lignite (marls) of Lower Pliocene, sub-yellow argillic marls of Upper Pliocene and clastic formations, mainly from fluvial origin of Pleistocene. The hydrogeological regime {{is controlled by the}} tectonic conditions of the study area. A fault pattern with NNW-SSE (Upper Miocene) and ENE-WSW to E-W (Plio- Pleistocene). The main aquifer systems are developed in Pleistocene deposits and carbonate rocks (karst aquifer). Generally, the recharge of the alluvial aquifer is occurred by the periodical flow of existing streams of region, from karstic formations and from the fissured crystalline rocks, with which they come in contact, {{as well as from the}} direct infiltration of rainfall. The geometric and hydraulic characteristics of aquifer systems in the study area are controlled by lithology and the tectonic conditions of region. Thus, the bigger thickness of the alluvial aquifers is recorded in the coastal part of the basin. Transmissivity values range between 8. 0 · 10 - 4 – 1. 2 · 10 - 2 m 2 /s with mean value 2. 3 · 10 - 3 m 2 /s, while the hydraulic conductivity ranges between 7. 9 · 10 - 6 – 2. 5 · 10 - 4 m/s with mean value 6. 7 · 10 - 5 m/s. The transmissivity of karst aquifers varies between 2 · 10 - 4 – 2. 6 · 10 - 1 m/s, with mean value 2. 9 · 10 - 2 m/s. Based on results of geostatistical analysis, concerning the distribution of hydraulic parameters of alluvial aquifers it is concluded that CoKriging method is the most reliable in the spatial distribution of transmissivity. The Kefalosi karstic spring is located at a distance of 3250 m form the cost, discharging the Othrys mountain. It is discharged at an elevation of about 26. 5 m above sea level. The spring is brackish and plays an important role in hydrochemical conditions of the study area, due to the mixing phenomena. The salinity of the spring is associated with the geological and tectonic regime of the wider area. The piezometric conditions that prevail in the region favours the occurrence of submarine springs and artesian phenomena in the coastal part. Based on historical data of water level measurements, a decline of water level is recorded, due to over exploitation during the last decades and to decrease of natural recharge. From a hydrochemical point of view it is concluded that seawater intrusion phenomenon is related to natural geological structure of the area and to human activities. Seawater intrusion phenomena are presented on the edges of sub-basin Eyxenoypolis and in the coastal and central area of sub-basin Soyrpis, regions what are in hydraulic connection with the brackish water of the karstic aquifers. The absence of seawater intrusion phenomena in the central area of sub-basin Eyxenoypolis can be associated with the high hydraulic head in this area. This conclusion is also confirmed by the application of a mathematic model for simulation of groundwater flow, and from the geological – <b>stratigraphic</b> and tectonic <b>conditions</b> that prevail in the region. Based on the results of chemical analysis of Kefalosi springwater and the appearance of brackish wells in the southern part of the sub-basin Eyxenoypolis it is revealed, that the presence of salinity in the southern part of the study area is related to the presence of sharp of saline water and overpumping of alluvial aquifers. High nitrate concentrations, exceeding the upper acceptable limit (50 mg/l) are observed in groundwater of alluvial aquifers and can be associated with intensive use of fertilisers. For the coastal alluvial aquifer of sub-basin Eyxenoypolis, higher nitrate concentrations are recorded in the central part, south of the military airport, while in the sub-basin of Soyrpis the higher values are presented in its southern part. Finally, a three-dimensional model was developed for the alluvial aquifer of Eyxenoypolis sub-basin, using the MODFLOW code, in order to estimate the groundwater budget. From the estimated groundwater budget it is concluded that a significant amount of water discharges to the sea, mitigating the seawater intrusion towards inland. Furthermore, the model was used to predict the aquifer system response, under different climatic scenarios. ...|$|R

[...] 74 pages, 39 figures, 8 tables, 1 appendixThree-dimensional (3 D) seismic {{reflection}} profiling {{is one of}} {{the most}} advanced technologies used in offshore and onshore geophysics. It is needed for a wide range of investigations, most often carried out by the hydrocarbon industry, in inshore, coastal, and deep ocean environments. Three-dimensional seismic reflection profiling, provides high-resolution images of the subsurface that allow solving detailed structural and <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The implementation of seismic attributes, such as amplitude or coherence, has improved our capacity to visualize and interpret features such as sedimentary patterns (e. g., channel systems) or faults and fractures in any orientation. In this project, we used 2700 km 2 of 3 D seismic reflection data with the aim of mapping the Miocene sedimentary bodies deposited in front of the Ebro Delta. From these data we try to 1) offer new constrains on the geomorphological evolution of the Ebro Margin, 2) provide evidences of a possible pre-Messinian connexion between the Ebro Basin and the Mediterranean Sea, which is still the subject of intense debate, and, 3) determine whether all prograding clinoforms below the Messinian Erosion Surface (MES) are actually pre-Messinian or some were formed during the Messinian. Five seismic surfaces were mapped between the Top Oligocene and the MES along the 3 D seismic volume, including the two boundaries and three intra-Miocene horizons to establish accurate stratigraphic markers for the mapped area as a whole. The 3 D seismic data display a major NE-SW oriented horst-and-graben structure developed in an extensional context during the upper Oligocene-early Miocene (Sàbat et al., 1997; Roca et al., 1999). The study of the depocentres shows that the initial sedimentary transport started filling the deepest troughs from north-northwest during the syn-rift stage. The increasing sedimentation, together with the attenuation of the tectonic activity, led to a progressive filling of the grabens, subsequent spreading and final onlapping of the structural highs. This caused the development of sigmoidal clinoforms that evolved in a progradational system. This increase of the sediment rate, together with the change in the transport direction from longitudinal (N-NW) to transversal (E-NE) observed from the study of the depocentres, are presumably indicative of the existence of a pre-Messinian Ebro River. Moreover, the subsequent Messinian Salinity Crisis truncated the evolution of the Ebro Margin, which became dominated by a major fluvial system identified as the Messinian Ebro River. The high-equilibrium conditions reached by this drainage network also support the idea of a capture of the Ebro Basin by a relative small river prior to the Messinian drawdownPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Port Arthur Historic Site, {{located in}} southeastern Tasmania, is a {{significant}} heritage-listed site which operated as a major convict settlement between 1830 and 1877. It was largely destroyed {{in the intervening years}} due to bushfires and demolition activities. Multi-disciplinary research over the past 30 years has generated a rich contextual framework of knowledge about the 19 th century convict and post-penal periods, however information about buried physical evidence of the associated buildings, landscape features and cultural deposits that remain in the subsurface is very limited. A range of geophysical techniques for mapping subsurface cultural features of archaeological value were assessed at three areas within the Port Arthur Historic Site: the Isle of the Dead, Settlement Hill and the Penitentiary Complex. Each of these areas is located within a distinct geological domain, and hosts different archaeological targets and near-surface <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Geophysical results were compared with historical documents, including maps and photographs, and oral sources. Archaeological ground-truthing was also employed to explore some features identified at Settlement Hill and the Penitentiary Complex. Research on the Isle of the Dead cemetery aimed to map individual burials, former pathways and other cultural elements, and major stratigraphic interfaces. Prior knowledge of the cemetery layout on the 0. 8 hectare island is limited to historic photographs, surface evidence (grave markers and depressions) and incomplete documentation — estimates {{of the total number of}} graves range from 1100 to over 1700. Magrtetometry and frequency-domain electro-magnetics were effective in delineating near-surface ferrous cultural features such as former fence lines and paths but were ineffective for detecting burials. Resistivity imaging and seismic refraction tomography helped to resolve the stratigraphic context but were also ineffective for direct detection of burial sites. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was the most effective technique for locating both individual burials and zones of stratigraphic disturbance. Radar data were very complex and the final interpretation product was a series of maps that depict the density of subsurface ground disturbance rather than more conventional products that illustrate the distribution of hyperbolic responses or amplitude time-slice maps. At Settlement Hill the main aim was to delineate subsurface structural remains in an area with multiple generations of convict era construction. Much of the site is characterised by a thin layer of demolition rubble. Magnetic data in this area is typified by high-amplitude, high-frequency anomalies attributable to natural variations in magnetic dolerite bedrock depth, as well as variations due to penal era cultural features such as terrace excavations, trenches and an aqueduct. Clear rectilinear anomalies in the 500 MHz GPR timeslices and apparent resistivity variation map are attributed to very shallow well-preserved structural features, which correlate closely to the building layout available in several historic maps. Surveys were conducted at two sites in the Penitentiary complex: the Sawpits - Tannery Complex and the Parade Ground area. Both sites are characterised by heterogeneous penal and post-penal fill material. At the Sawpits - Tannery Complex, 500 MHz GPR profiling and electrical resistivity tomography successfully map foundation walls, sawpit fill deposits, yard features and reclamation structures. The rubble fill stratigraphy apparent in the GPR data also provides indirect evidence of the Sawpits boundary. Resistivity tomography also clearly defines the interface between reclamation fill and underlying remnant Quaternary beach sands. Integrated interpretation of multiple geophysical datasets from the Penitentiary Parade Ground area enabled the detection and characterisation of a diverse range of penal era archaeological targets, including sections of the parade ground wall, the parade ground gravel surface and remnants of the tramway. The most effective techniques in this complex environment are apparent resistivity and GPR, while the magnetic response is complicated by the presence of magnetic dolerite fill material. A range of geophysical techniques have been successfully applied at the Port Arthur Historic Site for detection and characterisation of a diverse range of subsurface cultural heritage features. However, there is no single technique or recipe for future archaeo-geophysical activities that can be readily applied across the entire site. The choice of the optimal technique or combination of techniques for a particular site should be based on a prior assessment of the local geological conditions and likely target characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} two main thrusts. The {{first part of}} the study {{addresses}} static seepage and stability of California levees as related to the presence of woody vegetation. The second part of this study addresses seismic deformations related to California levees through calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis of a constitutive model implemented to capture seismic embankment deformations. Two field tests were conducted to investigate the effects of seepage in the vicinity of live and decaying tree root systems {{to examine the effects of}} live and decaying root systems on levee seepage and slope stability. The first field test involved the construction of parallel trenches in the vicinity of a eucalyptus stump located along the landside of the northern levee bordering the American River adjacent to the California Exposition and State Fair. A live hackberry tree with healthy roots was present at the toe of the levee. A control set of parallel trenches was constructed away from the eucalyptus stump. During the test, the upslope trench was flooded and maintained at constant head to induce slope-parallel seepage and the downslope trench was used to make observations and collect any intercepted seepage. Piezometers and tensiometers were installed to measure positive and negative pore water pressures within the zone of flow to describe the wetting and flow patterns as they evolved within the levee. Instrumentation was installed to assess the influence of the stump and its decomposing root system. Live roots, mammal burrows, and other features added complexity to the system. In addition to instrumentation data, visual observations were recorded during the 6 day flow test. During the flow test, wetting front and water flow patterns appeared to be dominated by flow through a network of shallow mammal burrows. Physical observation of the saturation front, as seen from the lower wall, confirmed that the area below the stump was the last location to saturate during the wetting test. Ground-based tripod light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) was used to complement traditional logging and for constructing a 3 D model of the root system, burrows and stratigraphy. Preliminary computer simulations of the advance of the wetting front support the basic patterns observed in the field test. The second field experiment was conducted along the crown of a bypassed levee along an oxbow segment of the seven mile slough on Twitchell Island in Rio Vista, California. An 8 -foot deep crown trench was excavated to extend through the root system of a land side live oak tree, a water side valley oak tree, and a control section. The test was designed to evaluate the effects of seepage in the vicinity of live tree root systems. During the test, the crown trench was flooded and maintained at constant head to simulate a flood condition with water delivered from the center of the levee. Piezometers and tensiometers were installed to measure positive and negative pore water pressures, respectively, within the zone of flow to describe the wetting and flow patterns as they evolved within the levee. Burrow networks, fracturing, and gapping within levee soils, as well as variability of <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>conditions</b> across the site added complexity. Visual observations were made during the flow test to view surficial seepage and flow patterns from the surface in addition to continuous monitoring of subsurface instruments. The site contained an extensive network of muskrat burrows in addition to burrows by other species and the initial advance of the wetting front appeared to be related to burrowing activity. With increased time and saturation of levee soils, flow through macropores appeared to diminish. The levee appears to have been founded on overbank deposits comprised of lower permeability soils than the overlying levee fill. Water appeared to accumulate on this stratigraphic layer, driving seepage patterns on the landside of the levee. A break in this low permeability layer affected flow patterns while the slope of this layer toward this break appears to have added a three dimensional effect to flow patterns. Cracking was observed in the crown road along the levee crest within the first 24 hours of the flow test. After approximately 40 hours of flow, the waterside oak tree, which was initially leaning at an angle of approximately 43 degrees from horizontal, rotated an additional approximately 20 degrees into the slough, creating cracks and deformation along the waterside slope. A dye test was performed as a part of the experiment to better understand the extent of these burrows, their effect on flow patterns, and to better evaluate the role of these burrow networks in the deformations observed on the waterside slope during the flow test. Ground-based tripod light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) was used to complement our efforts related to tracking deformations during the test. Based on calibrated numerical simulations, trees were found not to play a significant role in seepage-induced rotational or block failure of the levee slopes. However, where trees exhibit significant lean (center of mass extends beyond the fulcrum of the root plate), horizontal roots extending into the levee may place additional loads on the levee embankment. Loading of this type can be incorporated into two dimensional slope stability analyses, using mass-averaging to capture the three-dimensional impact of the tree. Tree overturning was evaluated at the waterside oak tree. Root forces were represented as a single horizontal force and a single vertical force. Horizontally oriented tree root loading increased faster than vertical loading in response to increasing slope angle, while the reverse was true for tree lean where vertical root forces increased more rapidly with increasing tree lean. The method was implemented and successfully captured the observed landside and waterside tree responses during the Crown Trench Seepage Test. The second part of this research focused on seismically induced permanent displacement of earth levees, embankments, and earth-fill slopes resulting from liquefaction below these earth structures. Deformations of this nature are not well captured in current seismic design practice. Ground remediation can be employed to reduce the hazards resulting from soil liquefaction for cases where the analytical tools predict poor seismic performance. There are not sufficient funds to repair all vulnerable levees in the system. Thus, robust analytical procedures are required to evaluate sections of levees where liquefiable foundation materials may lead to significant damage. Inertially driven ground movements of intermediate levels are the primary focus of this study. In these cases, the post-liquefaction static stability of the earth slope is greater than one, and seismically induced permanent displacements result primarily from earthquake shaking after liquefaction is triggered. Limited lateral spreads involving liquefaction of medium dense sand can produce seismic displacements on the order of several centimeters to a meter or more. These levels of seismic displacements are sufficient to damage severely levees. The most commonly employed simplified method for evaluation of seismic deformation at these intermediate levels relies on the concept post-liquefaction residual shear strength. For many practical cases, residual shear strength is ill-defined due to the ever changing resistance provided by soils that undergo repetitive dilative responses during cyclic loading. Where liquefied soils are sufficiently strong to resist flow failures, engineers lack satisfactory tools to evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures that overlie liquefiable soils. A nonlinear soil constitutive model (UBCSAND), which was developed by Professor Byrne and implemented in the finite difference program FLAC, is employed to evaluate seismic deformations of earth structures resulting from liquefaction-induced lateral movements. Analyses of one-element laboratory tests are performed first to develop trends within the UBCSAND soil model calibration parameters. The basic model parameters are correlated to (N 1) 60 values. The UBCSAND model also has four "fitting" parameters. Two of the four model parameters are varied in this study to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these variations. Triggering is captured with values of the m_hfac 1 parameter with a typical range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 depending on relative density, CSR, and initial static shear stress. The trends identified are implemented in the back-analysis of several case histories, and the ability of the UBCSAND model within the program FLAC to capture observed deformations is evaluated. The numerical simulations of seismic performance at Moss Landing Marine Laboratory and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake and at the Juvenile Hall Facility during the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake are shown to capture well the key features of these case histories. The study was generalized through a broader sensitivity study to investigate the seismic performance of earthen embankments built atop potentially liquefiable soils. Several representative levee sections on differing foundations are analyzed, wherein key characteristics, such as the thickness of the liquefiable layer and its relative density, are systematically varied to develop useful insights. The thickness of the liquefiable foundation layer impacted displacements in a non-linear pattern where displacement increased more rapidly as the liquefiable material layer thickness increases. As would be expected, combinations of thicker deposits of liquefiable foundation soils combined with higher embankments yielded the maximum displacement of the cases analyzed in this study. A suite of nine near-fault, forward-directivity, fault-normal soil earthquake ground motions and seven intermediate-field soil earthquake ground motions are used to reflect the seismic hazards most likely to control the design of levees within the San Joaquin-Sacramento delta region of California. The intense forward-directive 1994 Northridge Sylmar Converter Station motion yielded approximately twice as much displacement as the lower intensity backward-directive 1992 Landers Joshua Tree motion. The rate of increase of the calculated liquefaction-induced displacement with increasing Arias intensity was roughly linear for these embankment configurations for the entire suite of earthquake ground motions...|$|E
