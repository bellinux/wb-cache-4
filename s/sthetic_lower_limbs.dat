40|$|BackgroundTo {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of ultrasonic venous duplex examination (UVDE) for <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> varicose vein. Materials and methodsSixty-five patients with varicose vein of the <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> during a 2 -year period were enrolled in this study. There were 21 men and 44 women with an age range from 20 to 80 years and a mean age of 60 years. All patients received UVDE to determine the causes of varicose vein, including valvular incompetence, incompetent perforating vein, deep vein thrombosis, and congenital abnormality. ResultsIn these 65 patients with 80 abnormal <b>lower</b> <b>limbs,</b> valvular incompetence was observed in 40 <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> (50 %), valvular incompetence combined with incompetent perforating vein was observed in 22 <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> (27. 5 %), incompetent perforating vein only was observed in 13 <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> (16. 3 %), deep vein thrombosis in four <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> (5 %), and congenital abnormality in one <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> (1. 2 %).

Purpose: When {{investigating}} <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> landing biomechanics, researchers often assume movement symmetry {{between a}} participant 2 ̆ 7 s {{right and left}} <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> for the simplicity of data collection and analysis, although landing tasks often involve dual-limb motion. However, whether <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> symmetry can be assumed when investigating dynamic, sport-specific movements such as the stop-jump has not been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed {{to determine whether there}} were any significant differences in selected kinetic, kinematic, and muscle activation patterns characterizing <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> biomechanics displayed by the dominant limb compared with the nondominant limb of participants during a stop-jump task. Methods: Sixteen male athletes with normal patellar tendons on diagnostic imaging performed five successful stop-jump trials. Patellar tendon forces (FPT), ground reaction forces, three-dimensional kinematics, and EMG activity of seven <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscles were recorded for the dominant and nondominant <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> during each trial. Results: During the horizontal landing phase, the dominant <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> sustained a significantly higher FPT and peak net knee joint extension moment compared with the nondominant <b>lower</b> <b>limb.</b> Furthermore, during the vertical landing phase, the dominant <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> sustained significantly <b>lower</b> vertical but higher posterior ground reaction forces compared with the nondominant <b>lower</b> <b>limb.</b> Other variables did not significantly vary as a function of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> dominance. Conclusions: It is recommended that researchers clearly identify their primary outcome variables and ensure that their experimental design, particularly in terms of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> dominance, provides an appropriate framework to investigate possible mechanics underlying unilateral and bilateral knee joint injuries during dual-limb movements such as the stop-jump task...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> coordination during <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> asymmetry in a split-belt walking paradigm. Eleven healthy individuals walked on a split-belt treadmill with 4 different speed ratios (2 : 2, 2 : 4, 2 : 6 and 2 : 8 km/h) {{and the left}} belt fixed at 2 km/h. Spatial (upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> movement amplitudes) and temporal (correlations between trajectories) aspects of limb movement were analyzed. Results showed that while amplitudes of the right <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> increased and left <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> decreased with increasing asymmetry, both upper limb amplitudes increased. Correlations between diagonal upper/lower limb trajectories increased as right belt speed became faster, suggesting increasing cross-body matching regardless of side. As the treadmill asymmetry increased, ipsilateral lower/upper limbs became more out of phase suggesting a more precise gait pattern to regulate timing between limbs. The upper limbs reached maximum horizontal displacement before the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> except between the right upper limb/left <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> for asymmetrical belt speeds. From these results, it appears the faster moving <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> drives the motion of both upper limbs.

This innate coupling between upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> has a neural basis {{that may be}} advantageous for gait rehabilitation. Adding upper <b>limb</b> effort to <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> stepping could improve <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle recruitment during therapy. I developed a computer controlled recumbent stepping device with mechanically coupled handles and pedals to test principles of neural coupling of the arms and legs. Subjects drove the stepping motion using different combinations of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> effort (active or passive). The first study demonstrated that upper limb effort increased passive <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle activation proportionally in neurologically intact individuals. These results indicated an excitatory neural coupling between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> during rhythmic stepping movements. I then studied neurologically intact subjects performing maximal effort, velocity-controlled recumbent stepping. The results revealed that neural coupling between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> is bidirectional and ipsilaterally biased. For the next study, I examined neural coupling in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury to determine if adding upper limb effort enhanced muscle recruitment of volitionally maximally active <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> The data indicated that maximal upper limb effort did not increase active <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle recruitment in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Similar to neurologically intact individuals, spinal cord injured individuals also demonstrated increased passive <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle activation with greater upper limb effort. Lastly, I used computer simulations to examine potential neural mechanisms behind the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> neural coupling. These models showed that excitatory sensory feedback, excitatory ipsilateral pathways, and supraspinal drive were all possible specific neural mechanisms explaining my empirical results. Future studies using more sophisticated neural techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation can test the specific neural mechanisms shown in the simulations. Overall, my findings provide {{a better understanding of}} interlimb neural coupling and have specific implications for the design of exercise therapies for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To explore job adjustments, job satisfaction, {{and health}} {{experience}} among employees with an upper limb amputation and {{to compare the}} results with those of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees and control subjects. Methods: Amputees were recruited from data files of a large European University Medical Centre and orthopaedic workshops. Controls were matched colleagues of the <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees. All participants filled out the VAG questionnaire (Vragenlijst Arbeid en Gezondheid), assessing job satisfaction and job adjustments, and the RAND- 36. Results: 28 upper limb amputees were compared to 144 <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees and 144 controls. Job adjustments were necessary in 38 % and 28 % of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees, respectively. All three groups were equally satisfied with their jobs (p= 0. 90).

METHODS: Healthy full-term neonates were systematically sampled during the months of February and March 2004. Crown-heel length was measured, using a 1 -mm precision neonatometer, at approximately 8 h and 32 h after birth, with one and both <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> extended. The Neonatal Facial Coding System was used to assess discomfort during measurements. Data were analysed by parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Whatever the measurement technique, discomfort scores are significantly higher during the length measurement than at baseline. Whenever length measurements are performed, discomfort scores are significantly higher when extending both <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> rather than one <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> (p < 0. 006). The measured length is greater with one <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> extended; however, the difference decreases over time, being 0. 19 cm (95 % CI 0. 1 - 0. 3; p < 0. 001) at approximately 32 h of age. No significant differences in length were found between measurements at approximately 8 or 32 h, regardless of the technique used. The best correlation between length measurements with one or both <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> extended was observed at approximately 32 h after birth (r = 0. 98). CONCLUSION: Measuring crown-heel length is a distressful procedure for the neonate.

The primary aim of this research was to advance understanding on foot function and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> biomechanical movement characteristics in children; analysing differences between obese, overweight and normal weight children. Having determined the reliability of the measurement protocols, 100 children were recruited for assessment of body mass status and plantar foot loading. Following this, a sub-group of 45 children were recruited and three-dimensional gait analysis was undertaken. Plantar foot loading and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> temporal-spatial, kinematic and kinetic gait characteristics were analysed during barefoot level walking. Multiple regression was undertaken to determine relationships between body mass status, foot loading and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> gait biomechanics. Findings demonstrated that overweight and obese children displayed marked differences in foot loading and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> gait biomechanics when compared to normal weight children.
