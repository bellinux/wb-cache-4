5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main {{difference between the}} two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain much of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system,</b> free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a market economy. In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where private enterprise played an important role.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> {{have come}} under attack with claims that they {{negatively}} impact savings, capital formation and the labour supply. This, together with the near-bankruptcies of some <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> {{have led to a}} series of reforms, including the privatisation of the system with the assignment of individual accounts to contributors. There have, however, been little efforts in isolating the cause of the failure of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> and in the identification of the factors which may enhance performance. It is this gap, which this study attempts to fill by investigating the relationship between governance, performance and administration of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> by addressing the key question "How do governance factors impact on the performance and administration of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in the Member States of the Organisation Of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) ?"

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a stages-of-development model according to which, as living standards rise, {{the responsibility for}} insuring against risks associated with retirement is laid upon Government {{in the form of}} emerging <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems.</b> Later, political support for the continued expansion of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> weakens, and containment becomes the order of the day. Clear signs of such containment were evident in the OECD economies during the 1980 s. However, this model appears not to describe the development of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> in reforming (essentially, Latin American) and transition (essentially, Eastern and Central European) economies, where <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> have become sources of distortion and imbalance at levels of development much lower than those that prevailed in OECD economies when policy makers first expressed concern and began to implement measures to correct those imbalances. A <b>social</b> <b>security</b> reform agenda is discussed which would shift more risk to the individual, taking reforming and transition economies into relatively unexplored territory. The social costs of economic reform and of transition from command to market economy have been greater than many analysts anticipated, and how reforms will be implemented in the currently difficult atmosphere remains to be seen, as does the long-term viability of reformed <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The current <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe {{have not}} been able to deal with {{increased}} traditional and new risks such as unemployment or work-life balance. One suggested solution to this problem has gained more popular and academic support in recent years: the idea of a universal, unconditional basic income (UBI). This study, therefore, examines whether and how UBI could support <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in the UK, Germany and Sweden in order to achieve their aims and fulfil their functions, and thus to improve insufficient <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Since effectiveness and efficiency describe the functionality of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems,</b> the study focuses on these two aspects. These aspects will be used to theoretically discuss expected effects of UBI along with the main aims and functions of key policies in each country in regard to their effectiveness and efficiency. In comparison with current <b>social</b> <b>security</b> schemes in each country, the study demonstrates that UBI is able to deal better with several traditional and new risks, despite problems with higher expectations and living standards. UBI provides basic needs and will especially pull risk away from people in need. Additionally, it alleviates poverty and fosters social cohesion. These achievements help to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in the UK, Germany and Sweden...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies on}} the future of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in a unified Europe treat the issue as merely a {{particular}} aspect of the broader question of redistribution within a federation with mobile agents. As a result, such studies typically recommend their gradual centralisation. This paper which is based on the model of Rothschild, Stiglitz and Wilson adopts a much less categorical approach, emphasising the need to clarify whether <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> principally seek insurance or redistribution. In this analytical framework competition between public insurance systems can generate efficiency. It can also remain compatible with cross-subsidisation if the proportion of low risks is sufficiently large. The result depends on the relative proportion of high risks, on the goals of the national <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems,</b> and on their behaviour when competing with each over. ...|$|R

In Disqualification from Unemployment Benefits (Avstängning från arbetslöshetsförsäkring), from 1980, Christensen studied the Swedish rules on disqualification from unemployment benefits on the ground of refusal of work and other self-imposed unemployment. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to disclose the control and steering of the citizens that is built into the Swedish <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system.</b> According to Christensen, there was a strong interest on the part of the state to conceal the role that the Job Service played in the system. Furthermore, Christensen meant that the state had an interest in concealing how the behavior-steering and repressive functions of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>system</b> were inseparably associated with the supportive functions of the system – a fact that contradicted the ideology surrounding the Welfare State. The study represented an important shift in Christensen’s research towards a more theoretical, social-science-oriented and critical approach.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} the international standards in the area of financing and administration of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> and their influence on the reforms of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in transitions economies of Eastern Europe. Particular attention is given to the concept of the rights-based approach to development as a leading principle behind the development agenda of international organizations. In particular, ILO Convention No. 102 and other international legal standards regulating the financing and administration of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> schemes are examined regarding their suitability for the ratification by transition economies. The research of possible reasons is undertaken to answer the question as to why the standards have received an unusually low level of ratifications. Examples of several Latin American countries are provided to illustrate the lack of sustainability as a result of pension reforms which were carried out in contradiction to the basic principles of the financing and administration of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> as provided by ILO legal instruments. Further, the mechanisms of financing and administration of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> in Russia and Ukraine are analyzed in order to assess the countries’ readiness to ratify ILO instruments in these areas, as well as to assess the suitability of the instruments for these countries. The research has showed that despite being largely outdated, ILO Convention No. 102 still has significant influence on the development of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> and provides for fundamental principles in the areas of financing and administration of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> schemes. Russia and Ukraine are currently at different stages of readiness to ratify the Convention, as they adopted contrasting strategies in the development of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, due to the introduction of privately funded <b>social</b> <b>security</b> schemes Russia is likely to be reluctant to proceed with the ratification. However, the research has revealed no legal obstacles for Ukraine to be able to ratify the Convention...|$|R
