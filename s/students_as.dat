40|$|<b>Student</b> <b>as</b> Producer is a {{curriculum}} development project {{that has been}} ongoing at the University of Lincoln since 2007. The aim of the project has been to promote research-engaged teaching as the organising principle for teaching and learning across all subjects and all levels of taught provision at Lincoln. While there are many examples of research-engaged teaching in higher education what makes the curriculum distinctive at Lincoln is that research-engaged teaching is the default position for all teaching and learning at the University. While <b>Student</b> <b>as</b> Producer has been under development at Lincoln since 2007 this report focuses on the period 2010 - 2013, when the University of Lincoln received funding, £ 200, 000, from the Higher Education Academy to develop the programme. The main focus of this report is the embedding and implementation of <b>Student</b> <b>as</b> Producer at Lincoln, but <b>as</b> <b>Student</b> <b>as</b> Producer extends beyond Lincoln to involve other higher education providers the report will also {{pay attention to the}} external national and international impact of <b>Student</b> <b>as</b> Producer across the higher education sector. <b>Student</b> <b>as</b> Producer was conceived during momentous times in the history of higher education in this country, including a massive increase in student fees and the withdrawal of public funding for teaching the Arts, Humanities and Social Science. For a brief moment in time English students were at the forefront of protests across Europe against the financialisation of higher education and the politics of austerity (Bailey and Freedman 2011).

40|$|This paper {{posits that}} the ‘student as customer’ model has a {{negative}} impact upon the academic leadership {{which in turn is}} responsible for the erosion of objectivity in the assessment process in the higher education sector. The paper draws on the existing literature to explore the relationship between the <b>student</b> <b>as</b> customer model, academic leadership, and student assessment. The existing research emanating from the literature provides the basis from which the short comings of the <b>student</b> <b>as</b> customer model are exposed. From a practical perspective the arguments made in this paper provide the groundwork for possible future research into the adverse affects of the <b>student</b> <b>as</b> customer model on academic leadership and job satisfaction in the academic work force. The concern for quality may benefit from empirical investigation {{of the relationship between the}} <b>student</b> <b>as</b> customer model and quality learning and assessment outcomes in the higher education sector. The paper raises awareness of the faults with the present reliance on the <b>student</b> <b>as</b> customer model and the negative impact on both students and academic staff. The issues explored have the potential to influence the future directions of the higher education sector with regard to the social implications of their quest for quality educational outcomes. The paper addresses a gap in the literature in regard to use of the <b>student</b> <b>as</b> customer model and the subsequent adverse affect on academic leadership and assessment in higher education...|$|R
