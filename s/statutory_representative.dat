Its enforcement powers were removed in 1992 and transferred to then newly created Department of Fair Trading & Consumer Affairs (absorbed into the Fiji Commerce Commission as of October 2010) The council's role is now limited to consumer rights advocacy, mediation, advisory and information. One of its main daily functions is to receive consumer complaints and institute mediation between traders and aggrieved consumers. The council regularly advocates for consumer rights using the media, community/school visits, mobile information units, public forums, lobbying of government ministries and other means.

In seven {{distinct}} papers (referred to herein as: chapters) diverse {{aspects of this}} topic are discussed from different perspectives. The first chapter seeks in an experimental way to identify factors that may justify restrictions to the minors legal capacity and the parental administration of the minor’s property. The second chapter deals with the question how much freedom a minor has as an independent individual to shape his/her legal relationships with his/her <b>statutory</b> <b>representative</b> and third parties. The crucial question of the third chapter is how the provision of parental usufruct can be justified. The fourth chapter deals with testamentary fiduciary administration. Examined is what the relation is between the provisions in Book 1 {{on the one hand}} and the provisions in Book 4 on the other and how two different kinds of administration should be applied in practice. The fifth chapter concerns the lump sum in terms of art. 4 : 35 BW. This provision entitles the bequeather’s child aged 20 or younger to a lump sum if, and to the extent that, the funds are required for the bringing-up maintenance and education of the child.

40|$|The 1928 law of {{criminal}} procedure previously regulating proceedings {{in cases of}} juveniles did not clearly define the judicial status of parents and guardians in that proceedings. The scope of rights of those persons {{was considered to be}} narrow. They were supposed to be summoned before a court, provided that the service of the documents was not creating particular difficulties. Yet, the court was entitled to demand the obligatory appearance at the hearing, in case of evading that obligation coercive measures provided for witnesses were applied. At the trial, those persons wese vested with the right to make statements and motions. The new act of Oct, 26, 1982 bestowed those persons with the status of litigant parties and extended their rights in a considerable way. The rights of parents and guardians as parties in litigation are autonomous, resulting from the fact of a defined consanguinity or from excercising a guardianship upon a juvenile, established judicially or existing factually. They are not resulting from the statutory representation of a juvenile. Parents and guardians as the litigant parties act in their own name and not {{in the name of a}} juvenile, they do not also have to act on his behalf although they usually do so, the results of their acts do not have to concern a juvenile, as parents and guardians can act in the proceedings in their own favor. It is a different question that usually there is a commutation observed m the roles of a litigant party and a <b>statutory</b> <b>representative</b> of a juvenile whose case is under trial. Applying new judicial provisions is not simple though, as the judicial status of parents and guardiand as the litigant parties is presently determined by the three normative acts. Apart of the mentioned act of 1982 on proceedings in cases of juveniles the regulations provided in Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure has also to be applied. Provisions of civil law procedure of nonlitigious mode are employed in case of examination and clarification proceedings, in guardian's and educational proceedings, in cases of applying medical and educational measures and partly in appeal proceedings. But if the evidence taking acts are performed by the Citizens' Militia provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure must be applied then, irrespectively of the stage and mode of the proceedings. Provisions of that Code also apply in reformatory proceedings and partly in appeal proceedings if the decision of reformatory measure is being appealed against or if the appeal demands applying that measure, as well as in criminal proceedings when it is conducted against a juvenile on exceptional bases in cases defined in the act. The detailed discussion of the scope of rights and obligations of parents and guardians in the proceedings in cases of juveniles as well as various complexities observed in the new regulation can be found in the published article. The author discusses, among the other things, the acceptable direction of parents' and guardians' acts in the proceedings in cases of juveniles, concurrence with the status of injured party, measures to be applied directly to the parents as eg. imposition of a duty to redress the damage, caused by a juvenile, burdening with costs of the proceedings, etcDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|The thesis aims at {{acquiring}} {{relevant information}} concerning the motivation of clients, their guardians or <b>statutory</b> <b>representatives</b> for the choice of residential service. Research question: Why do families leave clients {{in the care of}} residential facility of social services even though they have knowledge, skills, and material potential to provide the care of their members in the family? The theoretical part of the thesis defines basic terms and briefly describes the Home for Persons with Disabilities in Zběšičky. The sample consists of families of clients that are interested in their family members and continually cooperate with the Home for Persons with Disabilities in Zběšičky. It is a quota sampling where quotas are conditioned by the interest and cooperation of family members. When elaborating the practical part I chose the qualitative research strategy because of the sensitivity of acquired data and with the view of the ethically very problematic area of study. In-depth interviews with clients? families were selected as the questioning method. Interview transcripts, notes from the dates etc. were given to the thesis supervisor Ing. Lucie Kozlová, Ph. D. at her disposal upon the agreement of communication partners while a promise was given {{that they would not be}} handed over to a third person. Only the data coming from the communication partners who had agreed with their processing into the final version and had answered all questions by the end of the data acquisition were used as the results of the diploma thesis. The results of this thesis displayed that families have not come through the whole process of the coping ? admission of the child and have chosen passive and escapist strategies in which they remain. They rationalize their decision by pointing out the necessity of the provision of indispensable complex care which they cannot provide to the clients at home, the demanding character of the care, the presently worsening health state of the carers, the inevitability of care of client?s siblings etc. By the placement in the residential service with regular visits of the client at home, the persisting ambivalent relations to the client manifest themselves together with the necessity to maintain the contact and saturate emotional needs at least in this way. A combination of several factors influences the decision to place there their family member. The placement of a client in the residential service is understood by the families as the final and definitive solution. Therefore passive attitudes to possible changes prevail and families conform to changing demands from the social services providers only unwillingly. With difficulties they get accustomed to the change of the attitude of the society oriented from the paternalist concept of social work towards the assumption of responsibility and active solution of proper situation. It is obvious from the interviews that families have potential, knowledge and skills to take care of their handicapped family members in the home environment, but they refuse the permanent care. In the course of in-depth interviews, I have managed to get into a more intensive relationship and cooperation with clients? families. Knowledge acquired is a valuable feedback for the assessment of the quality of provided care and for the adaptation to the real needs of the clients and their families. Moreover, the results have influenced the ongoing process of quality standards revision and amended methodical materials in the facility. In the spirit of humanizing and transformation changes in the facility, common education of facility employees and our clients? families has been intensively prepared and common meetings of families have been supported in a more substantial way.
