5|$|The NBS, a {{radio network}} started in 1933 by the colonial government, {{assigned}} Achebe to the Talks Department, preparing scripts for oral delivery.

5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of <b>spoken</b> <b>language.</b> The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in <b>spoken</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although writing first {{appeared}} during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear until about 2600 BC, {{at the beginning of}} the Old Kingdom. This development marked the beginning of the first known phase of the Egyptian language: Old Egyptian. Old Egyptian remained a <b>spoken</b> <b>language</b> until about 2100 BC, when, during the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, it evolved into Middle Egyptian. While Middle Egyptian was closely related to Old Egyptian, Late Egyptian was significantly different in grammatical structure. Late Egyptian possibly appeared as a vernacular language as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a written language until c. 1300 BC during the Amarna Period of the New Kingdom. Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a <b>spoken</b> <b>language</b> until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.|$|E

50|$|Sign <b>languages,</b> like <b>spoken</b> <b>languages,</b> {{organize}} elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful semantic units.

More generally, both sign and <b>spoken</b> <b>languages</b> share the characteristics that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, semanticity, arbitrariness, productivity, and cultural transmission.|$|R

5|$|Biblical Hebrew as {{preserved}} in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient, while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language. These additions were added after 600 CE; Hebrew had already ceased {{being used as a}} <b>spoken</b> <b>language</b> around 200 CE. Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the consonantal text of the Bible and in extra-biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In <b>spoken</b> <b>language,</b> meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|During the Iron Age, Celtic culture, {{deriving}} from the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, arrived from Central Europe. Brythonic was the <b>spoken</b> <b>language</b> during this time. Society was tribal; according to Ptolemy's Geographia there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions {{on the edge}} of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the Roman Republic attempted to invade twice in 55BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a client king from the Trinovantes.|$|E
2500|$|Sign <b>languages,</b> like <b>spoken</b> <b>languages,</b> {{organize}} elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful semantic units.

Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). German is written using the Latin alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became a classical language that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs. For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the <b>spoken</b> <b>language</b> for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the <b>spoken</b> <b>language.</b> The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E
