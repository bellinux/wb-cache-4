2500|$|In Canada, juries {{are used}} for some {{criminal}} trials but not others. For <b>summary</b> <b>conviction</b> offences or offences found under [...] section 553 of the Criminal Code (theft and fraud up {{to the value of}} $5,000 and certain nuisance offences), the trial is before a judge alone. For most indictable offences, the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury. In the most serious offences, found in [...] of the Criminal Code (such as murder or treason), a judge and a jury are always used, unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury. The jury's verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous, but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition.|$|E

2500|$|The {{judicial}} system in New Brunswick, {{which is now}} governed by the Judicature Act and its regulations, {{is similar to that}} in most other provinces with the exception of Quebec. [...] The system consists of eight Judicial Districts, loosely based on the counties. Courts exist in three streams: the court of Queen's Bench, the Probate court, and the Provincial court. The Probate Court deals with matters involving wills and estates of deceased persons, while the Provincial court is the entry point for all persons charged with offences under the Criminal Code or other federal or provincial legislation. The Court of Queen’s Bench hears all matters within the domain of family law, and also has original jurisdiction in major civil and criminal cases. In addition, it has appellate jurisdiction over <b>summary</b> <b>conviction</b> offences from the Provincial Court. Criminal cases, at the defendant's option, can be tried by a jury or by a judge alone. Civil cases are similarly disposed. [...] The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, which sits in Fredericton, hears appeals from the inferior courts, as well as various administrative tribunals. The Chief Justice of New Brunswick, currently the Honourable J. Ernest Drapeau, serves at the apex of this court structure. [...] In addition, the Chief Justice chairs the committee tasked with recommending Order of New Brunswick recipients.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, summary {{offences}} {{are referred}} to as <b>summary</b> <b>conviction</b> offences. [...] As in other jurisdictions, <b>summary</b> <b>conviction</b> offences are considered less serious than indictable offences because they are punishable by shorter prison sentences and smaller fines. These offences appear both in the federal laws of Canada and in the legislation of Canada's provinces and territories. For <b>summary</b> <b>conviction</b> offences that fall {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government (which includes all criminal law), section 787 of the Criminal Code specifies that, unless another punishment is provided for by law, the maximum penalty for a <b>summary</b> <b>conviction</b> offence is a sentence of 6 months of imprisonment, a fine of $5,000 or both.|$|E

Primrose and John Rose, was called to the Lower Canada bar in 1845 and set up practice in Montreal. Carter was crown clerk and associate clerk of the peace for Montreal district from 1862 to 1866. In 1862, he was named Queen's Counsel. Carter was {{an associate professor of}} criminal law and later professor emeritus at McGill University.

40|$|Judicial review now {{accounts}} for over {{one third of the}} applications submitted to the Queen’s Bench Division. Judicial review has ascended to this point of high prominence {{over the course of a}} four hundred year history. That history is the story of the progress since the sixteenth century of the prerogative writs – particularly certiorari and mandamus. Of these prerogative writs, it is certiorari which has the closest connection with the modern process of judicial review. In the early part of its history, from the seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth century, the writ issued against a wide range of orders made by justices of the peace and specialist agencies like commissioners of sewers. The particular focus of this study is upon its use as a means of invalidating <b>summary</b> <b>convictions...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} a pardon {{underwent}} {{significant changes in}} the application in June 2010 as a result of amendments to the Criminal Records Act, through Bill C-23B. Specifically, new waiting periods of 10 years were made for personal injury offences and indictable sexual offences. All other offences fell under a waiting period of 5 years for indicatable offences and 3 years for <b>summary</b> <b>convictions.</b> Additional information was now required for indictable applications, which would detail why they are applying for a pardon, what benefit it would provide and how it would assist their rehabilitation. Applicants would also need to explain changes in their lives since their conviction(s) and give details about what, how and why the offence occurred. The fee was raised at this time from $50 to $150.|$|R

5000|$|In 2012 Bill C-10 [...] {{was passed}} which brought further {{changes to the}} Criminal Records Act. The term “pardon” was {{replaced}} by “record suspension.” The reasoning behind this {{is said to be}} that “pardon” connotes forgiveness, which the government does not want to appear to have given. The waiting period for convictions increased further to five years for <b>summary</b> <b>convictions,</b> and 10 years for indictable convictions, or those whose method of trial cannot be confirmed. The final big change was the creation of Schedule 1 offences, which is essentially a list of primarily sexual offences against minors. Any person convicted of one of these offences is no longer eligible to apply for a pardon or record suspension, unless they meet some very stringent exceptions. The fee at this time increased substantially in an effort to create a cost recovery model, raising to the current amount of $631.|$|R
40|$|The 2015 results include data on tax collected, timely {{compliance}} rates, {{numbers of}} customer contacts, outcomes from {{compliance and enforcement}} interventions and resources deployed. Addressing the issue of non-compliance and Revenue’s response, Niall Cody said that "Risk based identification and confrontation of non-compliance reinforces Revenue’s tangible support for voluntary compliance. Our results highlight an extensive range of compliance interventions, enforcement and prosecution activity, demonstrating Revenue’s determination to tackle evasion, fraud, criminality and tax avoidance. In 2015, Revenue conducted over 461, 000 audit and compliance interventions with a yield of € 642. 5 m and seized 1, 377 kgs of drugs {{to the value of}} € 23. 1 m, 68 million cigarettes and 2, 364 kg of tobacco to the value of € 35. 5 m.

5000|$|Many provincial {{and state}} laws are being changed to help clarify status of non-constabulary bylaw officers. In British Columbia, {{when the new}} {{enabling}} charter was amended, (called 'Community Charter'), sections specifically referring to bylaw officers were included, including the power of bylaw officers to enter upon private property and investigate without warrant, something police are unable to do. The rationale behind such provisions (approved by the courts) is that bylaw matters are of significant importance to the public welfare (such as verifying that a building was properly constructed or that garbage is not illegally disposed of), yet violations carry only <b>summary</b> <b>convictions</b> (fines, or in most extreme cases, very very small jail terms if the issue is extremely serious and the person does not pay the fine) and are not as serious and deprecatory to a person's reputation and well-being as criminal offences. As such, the courts have determined that such powers are not unreasonable limitations on a person's Charter right of not being subject to [...] "summary searches." ...|$|R
