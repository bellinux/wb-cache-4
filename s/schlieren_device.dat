40|$|The rainbow schlieren {{apparatus}} is simpler, cheaper, {{and more}} easily built to large scale than the interferometer. The accuracies {{of the two}} instruments are similar but only if refraction is properly accounted for in interferometry. The measurement thresholds of both instruments are similar. The rainbow <b>schlieren</b> <b>device</b> provides more detailed information because the detection threshold of the rainbow schlieren is {{an order of magnitude}} better than that of the interferometer...|$|E
40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau de Física, Facultat de Física, Universitat de Barcelona, Any: 2014, Tutor: Pere Serra CorominaFor {{many people}} seeing means {{understanding}} {{because it is}} the most direct way of verifying. Thus, seeing phenomena into transparent media represents a challenge which needs to be solved. The schlieren technique is a method that allows to see changes in the refractive index of transparent materials when a density gradient is established. In this paper a <b>schlieren</b> visualization <b>device</b> will be put together and characterized. Di erent arrangements were assembled in order to discuss which is the optimum setup. Several aspects as type of light source, focal length or knife- edge cuto are taken into account. Ultimately, the device was tested in extreme conditions when it was used to visualize a sound wave produced by an electric spark. This allowed us to determine its speed and, therefore, corroborate that the visualized perturbation indeed corresponds to a sound wave...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{progress}} of {{light emitting diode}} (LED) technology has recently resulted in the availability of high power devices with light emission intensities {{comparable to that of}} visible laser light sources. On this basis two versatile devices have been developed, constructed and tested. The first one is a high-power single LED iiluminator that provides continuous light (CW) as weil as light pulses of programmable width and intensity. The apparatus can be used for both light field as weil as dark field imaging in high-speed videography and in image based measurement techniques such as PIV (particle image velocimetry), LPT (Lagrangian particle tracking), BOS (background oriented schlieren), IPCT (image pattern correlation technique), shadowgraphy and <b>schlieren.</b> The <b>device</b> generates extremely bright, non-coherent, but essentially monochromatic, light. The CW-intensity is up to 2100 Im and reaches 14, 000 Im (528 nm) in overdriven (250 A) pulsed operation. Available colors are red (623 nm), green (528 nm) or blue (462 nm), UV (390 nm or 400 nm) and white light. The mode of operation and all parameters can be programmed over a USB interface and stored in an internal non-volatile memory. The pulse width can be set in the range from 50 ns up to 300 ms or switched into CW. The programmable delay allows the flashes to be precisely synchronized with camera triggers or other trigger sources by means of an external TTL-trigger signal input. The double pulse mode for PIV is also provided. The device is equipped with interchangeable projecting objective lenses providing a homogenous light spot of various diameters. Moreover the light can be coupled with the experimental set-up using light guides and accompanying optics, e. g. light sheet lenses...|$|R
