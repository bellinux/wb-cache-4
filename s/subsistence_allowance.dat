Employment protection was reduced for parts of the labor market. Public employment services and social welfare centers adopted results-based accountability and outsourced services through competition {{between public and private}} providers. Employment offices were (partly) merged with social welfare units and converted into centers that provided job search assistance, social services, and benefit payments. Unemployment and social benefit levels and duration were reduced. Eligibility for <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances</b> were changed according to a person’s ability to work rather than previous history of contributions. Benefits were cut if recipients did not meet their responsibilities. Wage subsidies and start-up grants were provided to entrepreneurs. Jobs with reduced social security contributions were introduced (“midi-jobs”), and the regulations for jobs exempt from such contributions were reformed (“mini-jobs”). The objective was to lower the cost of hiring low skilled workers.|$|R

Fraud that Kane found in the GCHQ outpost of Little Sai Wan in Hong Kong concerned employees renting apartments at lower rates than their £600 rent allowance, then submitting false invoices for the higher amount, and sharing the difference with their Chinese landlords. Kane had worked in Hong Kong until 1976. Senior GCHQ officers were also involved in the fraud, and Kane found that senior management at GCHQ were not interested in his complaints. Kane believed that these activities could expose staff to blackmail by hostile intelligence agencies. A spy ring had already been uncovered in Little Sai Wan, with 150 people arrested for spying in Hong Kong from 1970-1976. His allegations also concerned the loss of secret documents and the collection of material from wastepaper baskets by Chinese cleaners, which he had established by intercepting communications between Chinese intelligence agents.|$|R

40|$|Background: Immigration {{detention}} {{has been}} shown to negatively affect {{the health and well-being of}} detainees. The aim of the study was to describe and compare policies and practices that could affect the health and well-being of immigrant detainees in the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) to those in Sweden. Design: This was a case study. Data were collected in two phases using a questionnaire developed particularly for this study. In the first phase, authorities in the Benelux countries responded to the questionnaire via email. During the second phase, a research team visited detention centres in the Benelux countries to observe and further explore, strengthening findings through triangulation. Data on Swedish detention centres were collected in previous studies. Results: Compared to the Benelux countries, Sweden has limited health care provision available in the detention centres. Swedish detention centres did not have mental health care professionals working at the centres and had fewer restrictions within the centres with regard to access to mobile phone, internet, and various recreational activities. Compared to Sweden, the detention centres in the Benelux countries have more staff categories providing services to the detainees that are provided with relevant and timely on-the-job training. All the countries, except Belgium, provide <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances</b> to detainees. Conclusion: Despite the Common European Asylum System framework, differences exist among the four European Union member states in providing services to immigrant detainees. This study highlights these differences, thereby providing a window on how these diverse approaches may serve as a learning tool for improving services offered to immigrant detainees. In Sweden, the health care available to detainees and training and recruitment of staff should be improved, while the Benelux countries should strive to reduce restrictions within detention centres...|$|R
40|$|China is {{entering}} {{a period of}} rapid urban development. With {{the rapid expansion of}} cities, a large number of peasants have lost their land as a result. Given the development of urbanization, safeguarding the rights and interests of land-lost peasants in the process of urbanization has become a new topic of interest in China. In this study, based on game theory, we analyze the interests of the local government and land-lost peasants in several rounds of the citizenization process. The result demonstrated the following: (1) this paper proposed that overall interest declines in the entire game, in which the peasant can obtain a greater share of benefits from bargaining with the local government; (2) However, a long bargaining process would lead to the diminishment of peasants’ rights and benefits. In contrast, the local government would obtain greater share of benefits than the peasant and would obtain fewer benefits than {{at the beginning of the}} process. Therefore, both sides expect to end the game process early; (3) Under the “rational economic man” process, this process will always tend to be one in which one party struggles while the other compromises. Therefore, in the game, the game process will not reach a game equilibrium state and both sides will be at a stalemate; (4) The local government, as the power owner, is expected to surrender its interests as the “rational economic man” for the Pareto optimality; (5) Finally, we proposed policy recommendations for the sustainability of citizenization. Increasing the public service benefits, establishing the system of <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances</b> and raising the minimum living allowance of citizenization, improving the training and employment service system for the peasant can improve land-lost peasants’ acceptance in the game...|$|R
40|$|The western {{extension}} {{area of the}} Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) covers five countries: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali (western part), Senegal and Sierra Leone. From 1986 to 1990, national teams employed by the respective governments have been regularly collecting entomological data on the vectors of onchocerciasis in these countries. As in the initial programme area of the OCP, the entomological surveillance network was composed of entomological sectors and subsectors (the latter are called "operational bases" in the western extension). In 1990, 308 staff in 47 capture teams were employed for the entomological surveillance activities in seven sectors and twenty-five operational bases. They included a national coordinator {{as head of the}} teams for each country, a wide range of technicians, and administrative support staff to assist the national coordinator in the overall management of available resources. The national teams worked under the technical responsibility and supervision of WHO/OCP but with no employee/employer relationship between them and WHO, since they were employed and their salaries were paid by their governments. The OCP, however, paid additional lump sum allowances to each worker, as well as daily <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances</b> when away from their duty station. Vehicles, entomological equipment, office supplies and furniture, fuel and lubricants were provided by WHO/OCP. Despite the difficulties encountered in the field, which were often great, and their lower salaries (compared with colleagues paid by WHO/OCP), the technical workers in the national teams performed well by OCP standards, with results as satisfactory as those obtained by the WHO/OCP teams {{in the rest of the}} programme area.

40|$|Active {{labour market}} policy {{under the terms}} of Volume III of the German Social Code is being subsidized by the European Social Fund within the scope of the 'ESF-BA programme' from 2000 until 2008. First of all, {{participation}} in vocational training schemes is facilitated by ESF <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances</b> paid to unemployed persons who are not entitled to subsistence benefits by law. Furthermore, occupation-oriented training schemes were offered as supplementary ESF modules within the programme, which were not eligible according to the German Social Code Volume III. One main focus of research conducted by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in parallel with the ESF-BA programme is the evaluation of measures to promote vocational training funded by the ESF in comparison to existing statutory promotion schemes (evidence of 'added value') and the 'counterfactual' non-participation in measures. The main benchmark for evaluating ESF-funded training schemes is employability, the impact of which is analyzed by comparing participants in measures with groups of non-participants with similar characteristics. The evaluation is empirically based on the administrative process-generated data of the Federal Employment Agency and a national representative survey of participants in measures funded by the ESF from 2000 to 2002 and comparison groups (participants without ESF-funding and unemployed non-participants). Both the heterogeneity of participant groups funded by the ESF and of schemes conducted in East and West Germany is demonstrated with a descriptive analysis of the survey data. Multivariate analyses of the transition from ESF-funded vocational training to subsequent employment verify that the structural mismatch on the labour market, which particularly affects priority groups targeted by the ESF, cannot be balanced by occupational training schemes. Impact analyses of comparison groups are based on process-generated and survey data selected by the method of sequential matching. The share of participants who continue to work in 'non-funded employment liable to social security' as well as 'funded and non-funded employment including funded self-employment' after completing the programme is analyzed to indicate the performance of ESF-funded training schemes. Finally, it is investigated whether registered unemployment is likely to be terminated faster by participants in measures.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} report is to identify and quantify the cost drivers of three district hospitals in the Western Cape, namely Knysna Hospital, Oudtshoorn Hospital and Mossel Bay Hospital, and to simultaneously measure value-driven performance indicators. An environmental scan identified various driving forces that would significantly affect change in the healthcare industry such as the brain drain of health professionals, consumerism and cost containment and efficiency initiatives. The Department of Health’s understanding of the eighth Batho Pele principle of value for money is generally understood as providing quality health care within prescribed cost limits. An attempt is made to establish {{the effect of the}} quadruple burden of disease (the HIV/AIDS pandemic, persistent infectious diseases, injury arising from violence and road traffic collisions and emerging chronic conditions) on hospital expenditure in the Eden District. Research identified Mossel Bay as a high TB burden area known as a TB “hotspot” and it is a recognized immigration transit point en route to Cape Town. The population analyses revealed that Mossel Bay is the growth point of the Eden District, showing extraordinary growth of 25 % between 2007 and 2009. Personnel costs: This study revealed that personnel costs are responsible for {{the overwhelming majority of the}} total expenditure of the district hospitals. Staff numbers, occupation specific dispensation (OSD) implementation and annual wage negotiations are the cost drivers of personnel costs. This study also found a clear correlation between an over-expenditure in personnel expenses and over-expenditure in the total expenditure of all three hospitals. Health care costs: Expenditure on blood products is considered a major cost driver of clinical expenses. Laboratory expenditure is clearly the largest cost driver for clinical expenses at all three hospitals. Together with laboratory expenses, medicine and medical supplies are the cost drivers for clinical expenses. Costs not related to health care: The three most significant administrative expenses are communication, stationery and printing as well as travel and <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances.</b> The cost driver for subsistence and travel expenses is the number of vehicles followed by the preference of vehicle, which in turn determines the daily tariff and the kilometre tariff. This study revealed that Knysna Municipality has the cheapest electricity cost of the three towns. It is clear that cost and consumption of electricity and water are the two variables that affect municipal service expenditure the most. Equity: When the district hospital expenditure is combined with the primary health care expenditure in the three sub-districts, the figures show that Oudtshoorn is spending 3 % more than its equitable share of the total budget at a higher cost of R 978 per capita, in excess of R 100 above the district average. Efficiency: The cost per patient day equivalent (PDE) per economic classification for all three hospitals is less than the average cost per PDE of the district hospitals in the Western Cape. The cost/PDE of Oudtshoorn Hospital is considerably higher than that of Knysna and Mossel Bay in all economic classifications, with the single exception of the agency cost of Mossel Bay Hospital. The cost of health care always reflects a combination of price, quantity and value, and it is impossible to consider individual cost drivers in isolation. Several cost-saving initiatives and managerial control measures are recommended...|$|R
25|$|Substantial {{increases}} {{were made}} in social security benefits such as injury and sickness benefits, pensions, unemployment benefits, housing <b>allowances,</b> basic <b>subsistence</b> aid <b>allowances,</b> and family allowances and living allowances. In the government's first budget, sickness benefits were increased by 9.3%, pensions for war widows by 25%, pensions for the war wounded by 16%, and retirement pensions by 5%. Numerically, pensions went up by 6.4% (1970), 5.5% (1971), 9.5% (1972), 11.4% (1973), and 11.2% (1974). Adjusted {{for changes in the}} annual price index, pensions went up in real terms by 3.1% (1970), 0.3% (1971), 3.9% (1972), 4.4% (1973), and 4.2% (1974). Between 1972 and 1974, the purchasing power of pensioners went up by 19%. In 1970, war pensions were increased by 16%. War victim’s pensions went up by 5.5% in January 1971, and by 6.3% in January 1972. By 1972, war pensions for orphans and parents had gone up by around 40%, and for widows by around 50%. Between 1970 and 1972, the “Landabgaberente” (land transfer pension) went up by 55%. Between 1969 and 1974, the average real standard rate of income support rose (in 1991 prices) from around 300 DM to around 400 DM. Between 1970 and 1974, unemployment benefits rose from around 300 euros to around 400 euros per month, and unemployment assistance from just under 200 euros per month to just under 400 euros per month. In 2001 prices, the average standard social assistance benefit level rose from around 200 euros per month in 1969 to over 250 euros per month in 1974. During most of Brandt’s years as chancellor, the majority of benefits increased as a percentage of average net earnings.|$|R
