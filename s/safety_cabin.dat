In 1968, the Unified Series II was presented; it included many innovative features of those times - e.g. the first <b>safety</b> <b>cabin</b> with rollover protection system in the world, mounted on vibration isolators. The new cabin also helped to reduce noise in the cabin below 85 dB. Thanks to these innovative procedures, the ZETOR brand was globally acclaimed and topped the charts of global tractor manufacturers. Soon, in the 1970s, the first six-cylinder ZETOR CRYSTAL 12011 tractor was designed. In 1976, ZETOR became the name of both the brand and the Company. The company continued to evolve and in 1991 the Unified Series III was launched; it underwent an innovation process {{at the turn of the}} millennium and received the ZETOR FORTERRA trade name.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSafety is {{compulsory}} in today’s production lines. Those lines {{often use}} laser material processing applications. The highest {{risk for the}} operator or a bystander of a laser application is the exposure to the direct beam. With the present laser beam intensities, an accident at least causes sudden blindness or severe burns. Even if the process works correctly, which means the beam is always oriented towards the workpiece, the scattered and reflected parts of the laser beam still can be powerful enough to cause serious harm. The state-of-the-art safety measures are passive laser safety cabins around the application. Because of the high intensities and the low beam divergence of the highly brilliant laser beam sources, they cannot guarantee a safe use of these laser applications. An option is to use active laser safety barriers that react to an impinging laser beam on its surface. A new approach to guarantee laser safety is to monitor the system and watch for incidents, {{to ensure that the}} laser spot never reaches the safety barrier. Assuming that accidents with the direct laser beam cannot occur, the passive safety measures still have to withstand the reflected laser radiation. In this paper a theoretical model is presented with which the energy distribution in a hemisphere above a deep-welding-process can be calculated. The model was calibrated and validated with intensity measurements during a welding process. The results of the measurement can be used to develop a process-tailored <b>safety</b> <b>cabin.</b> Because of the increased mobility such a system increases the flexibility of the production cell. Furthermore, the costs for laser-safety may be decreased significantly...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} {{factors that contribute to}} a <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> culture, a comprehensive survey questionnaire was created based mainly on a survey form used in offshore environments (Cox and Cheyne, 2000). The survey was randomly distributed to 391 cabin crewmembers among four major Taiwan national airlines, and achieved a valid response rate of 84. 65 per cent. A Likert five-point scale questionnaire was integrated in the survey. SPSS software was utilized, and various tests including descriptive statistical analysis, factor analysis, reliability analysis, mean analysis, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were employed for data analysis. Nine factors were extracted using Factor Analysis to represent the safety culture and safety performance. Data revealed that cabin crew background is an influential element, where different backgrounds resulted in a different perception on safety culture factors. Findings also suggested management/supervisor commitment and leadership, <b>cabin</b> work environment, <b>safety</b> knowledge and training, safety rules and procedures compliance, crewmember involvement in <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> issues, and <b>cabin</b> accident/incident/near misses investigation were regarded as the priority areas for focusing improvement effort, where they all had descriptive mean values lower than the midpoint of 3. 0. The outcome of these development and assessment endeavors has provided the airline management with a new perspective for an improved <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> culture...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between safety culture (e. g. management commitment, various work environment factors) and flight attendant safety performance (e. g. rule compliance, crewmember involvement and participation, accident investigation, injury incidence). A comprehensive questionnaire was derived from the Loughborough University "Safety Climate Assessment Toolkit" and several similar surveys. Additional items were designed for an airline cabin work environment. The questionnaire was distributed to four major Taiwanese national airlines and achieved a valid response rate of 84. 65 %. Structural equation modeling was used to test a hypothesized model concerning <b>safety</b> culture and <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> performance. A variety of fit indices confirmed the overall model fit but not all of the paths in the model were statistically significant. The findings show that safety culture was a predictor of <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> outcomes. The results indicated that high management commitment was significantly related to high crewmember participation, and that safe cabin work environment was significantly related to crewmember's individual behavior. However, the findings showed no relationship between management commitment and injury incidence which means injury incidence might not be predicted by management commitment.

40|$|Helicopter {{occupant}} {{crash safety}} investigations are {{being carried out}} in the frame of a European consortium project 'HeliSafe', which aims to improve the survivability of occupants in helicopter crashes and to minimise the risk of injuries. This is achieved by an advanced <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> system concept based on interacting safety features such as enhanced safety seats, improved belt systems and deployment of airbags. A key feature of HeliSafe described in this paper is the application of numerical simulation tools to predict cabin and occupant response to crash loads, in order to design and optimise the layout of the safety system. A safety analysis and simulation software concept covering the interaction of relevant cockpit or <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> equipment with structural crash response is described. Full scale sled tests on a generic cockpit mock-up with safety seat and airbag are simulated under both horizontal and vertical crash conditions to validate he simulation methodology.

40|$|The {{quest for}} comfort and {{mobility}} inside an aircraft {{is a daily}} concern. Today's designs are highly passenger-oriented, many times accepting performance losses as consequence of more spacious interiors. For wide-body twin-aisle aircraft {{there are a lot}} of solutions bringing an improved flying experience. On the other hand, the single-aisle paradigm for mid-size jets is far from being broken. The addition of one aisle in such aircraft would lead to a huge comfort and mobility improvement. Not only that, twin-aisle aircraft would have faster boarding and deplaning rates, diminishing the time on ground. Besides, the second aisle brings also <b>cabin</b> <b>safety</b> improvements. Considering that today everybody is seeking for performance gains, increasing the fuselage width to fit an extra aisle would seem to be running on the wrong way.
