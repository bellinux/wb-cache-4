5|$|The {{revolt of}} the Batavi {{appears to have}} led to a {{significant}} change in the Roman government's policy on deployment of Auxilia. The revolt proved that in times of civil strife, when legions were far from their bases campaigning for rival claimants to the imperial throne, it was dangerous to leave provinces exclusively in the hands of auxiliary regiments recruited from the indigenous nation. During the Julio-Claudian period, auxiliary regiments had often been deployed away from their original home province. But in the Flavian period (69–96), this appears to have become <b>standard</b> <b>policy.</b> Thus in AD 70, 5 reconstituted Batavi regiments (one ala and four cohortes) were transferred to Britain under Petillius Cerialis, who had suppressed the Civilis revolt and then embarked on the governorship of the island. The great majority of regiments probably founded in the 1st century were stationed away from their province of origin in the second e.g. of 13 British regiments recorded in the mid-2nd century, none were stationed in Britain. Furthermore, it appears that in the Flavian era native noblemen were no longer permitted to command auxiliary units from their own tribe.|$|E

Cleveland's advisers sent Stevenson to the south to curb the growing appeal of the Populist Party. With his Kentucky roots, Stevenson proved popular at his southern engagements. Stevenson also publicly opposed the Lodge Bill, a proposed bill which would have enfranchised southern blacks. The winning Cleveland-Stevenson ticket carried Illinois, although not Stevenson's home district.|$|E

As a result, the IRB made a one-off exception to its <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> of requiring neutral touch judges and referees for international matches, assigning New Zealander Keith Brown to take Wessels' place.|$|E

500|$|Considerations beside cost {{made the}} line between A and B movies ambiguous. Films shot on B-level budgets were {{occasionally}} marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits: one of 1943's biggest films was Hitler's Children, an RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than [...] in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross box office receipts. Particularly {{in the realm of}} film noir, A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> at 25 percent of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36 percent. The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope; in 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, Allied Artists, to develop and distribute relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the [...] "Premiere" [...] rubric.

His term was plagued by violent feuds {{in the eastern part}} of the state, including the Hatfield–McCoy feud and the Rowan County War. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer James [...] "Honest Dick" [...] Tate absconded with $250,000 from the state's treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for vetoing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The following year, he joined the National Democratic Party, or [...] "Gold Democrats", who favored a gold <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> over the Free Silver position of the mainline Democrats. He was the Gold Democrats' candidate for Vice President of the United States in the 1896 election, but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with John M. Palmer. He never again sought public office and died January 8, 1914.|$|E

2500|$|At {{that time}} (1980) Zionist historians had {{generally}} attributed the Arab leaders' alleged {{calls for a}} mass evacuation to the period before the proclamation of Israeli statehood. They generally believed that, after that period, expulsion became <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> and was carried out systematically. As described below, the narratives presented {{have been influenced by}} the release of previously unseen documents in the 1980s. In a later review in 2000 Mendes pointed to the prevailing Jewish view being that [...] "... it was an absolute fact that the Palestinian Arabs departed in 1948 at the behest of their own leaders, and that Israel desperately attempted to persuade them to stay." [...] Mendes then examines the work of 'new historian' Benny Morris, based on these newly released documents, and his influence on the debate, concluding that, whilst such Zionist writers add to the traditional understanding of the Palestinian exodus, their arguments do not disprove Morris' multi-causal explanation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper proposes random age, {{periodic}} {{and block}} replacement policies {{which are made}} at random variable times, and optimal policies that minimize their expected cost rates are discussed analytically and computed numerically. We compare such random replacements with their <b>standard</b> <b>policies</b> that are made at constant times. Comparison results show that when costs for random and constant replacements are the same, the <b>standard</b> <b>policies</b> are better than the random ones. Furthermore, it is computed numerically that if how much the random replacement cost is lower than that for the constant one, then the standard and random replacements have the same optimal cost rates. That is, the modied random replacement costs and their optimal times are discussed and computed when the random replacements {{would be better than}} the <b>standard</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

2500|$|While {{there are}} hazards {{specifically}} associated with solo diving, {{most of these}} can be planned for and their consequences mitigated {{by the use of}} appropriate equipment. In technical diving, where redundancy of critical equipment is <b>standard</b> <b>policy,</b> self-sufficiency is emphasised and taught more extensively than in recreational diving. This philosophy should also be followed by solo divers. A solo diver operating beyond the range for acceptable risk for a controlled emergency swimming ascent needs to carry a second, independent source of suitable breathing gas, which includes a regulator and preferably a submersible pressure gauge. This emergency gas supply typically {{takes the form of a}} pony bottle, or for more demanding diving, a twin tank set with the capability of independent operation of each tank. Additional equipment carried may include a backup dive computer, a backup dive light and a backup dive mask. The diver must be [...] familiar with the equipment configuration used and be able to access the equipment easily if it is needed. A solo diver needs to be particularly aware of overall personal fitness and health and the limitations it may impose on their ability to manage an emergency. Finally, the solo diver may dive a more conservative dive plan than he/she might dive with an equally competent buddy diver.|$|E
2500|$|After Roberts {{had won the}} {{conventional}} war, Kitchener was left in charge of fighting the Boers, who had taken to guerrilla warfare. [...] The Cavalry Division was disbanded (November 1900) and French, with Haig still his chief of staff, {{was put in charge}} of an all-arms force policing the Johannesburg area, later trying to capture the Boer leader de Wet around Bloemfontein. In January 1901 Haig was given a column of 2,500 men with the local rank of brigadier-general, patrolling Cape Colony, and chasing Commandant Kritzinger. [...] As was <b>standard</b> <b>policy</b> at that time, Haig's actions included burning farms (homesteads, crops and livestock included) as part of the well known British scorched earth policy as well as rounding up Boer women and children into concentration camps. Throughout the war Haig's sister Henrietta had been lobbying Evelyn Wood for her brother to have command of a cavalry regiment of his own when the war was over. French, probably not wanting to part with a valuable assistant, recommended Herbert Lawrence for the vacant command of the 17th Lancers, but Roberts, now Commander-in-Chief back in Britain, overruled him and gave it to Haig (May 1901). [...] Lawrence left the army in disgust at being passed over, although he later returned and was chief of staff to the BEF in 1918. [...] As the 17th Lancers were in South Africa at the time Haig was able to combine that command with that of his own column.|$|E
