The 2005 event was one of the warmest ever, turning many stages into mud and destroying the special studded <b>snow</b> <b>tires</b> <b>used</b> by the teams.|$|R
50|$|Crossing the Sierra Nevada, I-80 {{regularly}} gets snow {{at higher}} elevations from fall to spring. Caltrans sometimes requires vehicles to <b>use</b> <b>snow</b> <b>tires,</b> snow chains or other traction devices {{in the mountains}} during and after snowstorms. Checkpoints are often set up to enforce chain restrictions on vehicles bound for icy or snowy areas. When chain restrictions are in effect vehicles must have chains on the driving wheels, except 4WD vehicles with snow tires. Additionally, during the winter season, trucks are required to carry chains whether or not controls are in force.|$|R
50|$|Snow tires - Snow tires perform three functions: compaction, shear bonding and bearing. On roadways they compact {{the snow}} {{in front of them}} and provide a shear bond between the treads and the {{compacted}} snow. Off-road, they also provide bearing on the compacted snow. The bearing contact must be low enough for the tires not to sink too deeply for forward progress to become impeded by compacting {{the snow in}} front of them. Tread design is critical to <b>snow</b> <b>tires</b> <b>used</b> on roads and represent a tradeoff between on-snow traction and dry and wet-road comfort and handling.|$|R

40|$|Rock shed {{is widely}} used in traffic lines against {{rockfall}}. In order to cushion rockfall impact and dissipate impact energy, cushion layer is usually adopted in rock shed. <b>Used</b> <b>tire</b> cushion layer is proposed in this paper and it can cushion rockfall impact utilizing large radial deformation of tire. Reinforced concrete structure model is built with <b>used</b> <b>tire</b> cushion layer and artificial rockfall test is carried out. Twelve tests are divided into 4 sets with different rockfall mass, rockfall height, and tire filling material. Simplified calculation model with spring-damper is derived from radial repeated compression test of <b>used</b> <b>tire,</b> which improves the calculation efficiency. Test and numerical simulation show that application of <b>used</b> <b>tire</b> cushion layer in rock shed can cushion rockfall impact and effectively reduce peak acceleration and the maximum impact force. Filling sand and gravel in tire can improve tire stiffness and energy absorption capacity but will decrease cushion effect due to its large density. With the same impact energy, light rockfall is more destructive than weight rockfall for <b>used</b> <b>tire</b> cushion layer...|$|R

Reverse logistics networks serve the same. The handling of products, components and materials during the recovery process can be called reverse logistics. Due to the increasing number of heavy vehicles in the country like India, large quantities of <b>used</b> <b>tires</b> are generated every year, and proper disposal of these <b>used</b> <b>tires</b> creates problem in the day-to-day life. Hence recover the value from these <b>used</b> <b>tires</b> in the form of material recovery is gaining importance. The implementation of such recycling system usually requires an appropriate reverse logistics network for choosing the physical locations, facilities, and transportation links to convey the used products from the end customers to the recycling facility. A case study was conducted and traditional reverse logistics networks involved in the <b>used</b> <b>tires</b> focusing quality characteristics has been analyzed in the paper and a new network has been suggested focusing the quality characteristics of material recovered out of <b>used</b> <b>tires</b> through laboratory work and at the same time without compromising the cost factor involved in it.

5000|$|For {{model year}} 1995, a high {{performance}} model, developed {{in part with}} Porsche, was released and designated the 850 T-5R. Originally {{it was to be}} called 850 plus 5. The vehicle was based on the 850 Turbo, utilizing the B5234T3 engine with a special ECU (Bosch #628) that added an additional [...] of turbocharger boost pressure, giving the engine an extra [...] for a total of [...] and 250 lbft Nm of torque. The engine was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission, the latter of which was not available in the US. The T-5R was renowned as a sleeper car; despite its boxy, understated appearance, it boasted a drag coefficient of 0.29 and was capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 5.8 - 6.0 seconds (depending on transmission and body type). The top speed was electronically limited to 152.2 mi/h km/h. The vehicle came standard with Pirelli P-Zero tires, providing lateral grip of 0.88 g. The engine tuning was co-developed with Porsche, as was the transmission and other powertrain components. Porsche also aided in designing some of the interior, such as the Alcantara seat inserts. These cars came as standard with nearly every feature available, only a handful of options - such as heated rear seats - were available. On the North American market only two options could be chosen, a trunk-mounted Alpine 6-CD changer and no-cost 16" [...] wheels for a smoother, more comfortable ride and driveability in <b>snow</b> when <b>using</b> all-season <b>tires.</b>|$|R
