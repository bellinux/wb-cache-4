In principle any fuel that can be vapourised and pre-mixed with air can be used. [...] "Ultra vaporized steam" [...] replaces the exploding air/fuel mixture as the work medium. The flameless combustion keeps emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxides extremely low. Exhaust gas can be recirculated, which further reduces emissions.|$|E

5000|$|Suppression of MRE11 {{expression}} in genetically engineered human breast (MCF7) and bone (U2OS) cancer cell lines {{has resulted in}} decreased migratory capacity of these cells, indicating MRN may facilitate metastatic spread of cancer. Decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 matrix metalloproteinases, which are known to facilitate invasion and metastasis, occurred concomitantly in these MRE11 knockdown cells. Similarly, overexpression of Nbs1 in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples {{has been shown to}} induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which itself plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. [...] In this same study, Nbs1 levels were significanctly higher in secondary tumor samples than in samples from the primary tumor, providing evidence of a positive correlation between metastatic spread of tumor cells and levels of MRN expression. Taken together, these data suggest {{at least two of the}} three subunits of MRN play a role in mediating tumor metastasis, likely via an association between overexpressed MRN and both endogenous (EMT transition) and exogenous (ECM <b>structure)</b> <b>cell</b> migratory mechanisms.|$|E

A change in strain path {{may have a}} significant effect on the mechanical response of metals. This paper concentrates on the role of the plastic slip anisotropy in the strain path dependency of materials containing a dislocation <b>cell</b> <b>structure.</b> The <b>cell</b> <b>structure</b> model, developed in Viatkina et al.

This, more physically based description of the plastic behaviour, allows accounting for plastic anisotropy resulting from the crystal lattice of a metal. The extended <b>cell</b> <b>structure</b> model accounts for four sources of anisotropy: (1) geometrical anisotropy due to the configuration of the <b>cell</b> <b>structure,</b> (2) anisotropy due to the internal stresses associated with the <b>cell</b> <b>structure,</b> (3) slip anisotropy and (4) textural anisotropy.

30|$|According to (Martínez and Guiamet 2014), leaf apoplast has a {{major role}} in both cell <b>structure</b> (<b>cell</b> wall) and {{nutrient}} remobilization due to several apoplastic enzyme activities. Indeed, N depletion acting on the synthesis of proteins (both in translation and transcription) could be at the origin of lower enzyme activity of apoplastic proteins. Moreover, various studies have reported that, despite the absence of differences in terms of cellulose and hemicellulose, nitrogen depletion clearly decreased the amount of lignin (Murozuka et al. 2014; Wilson and Lt 1978), and different cell wall expansin genes are upregulated in response to such stress (Scheible et al. 2004).|$|E
