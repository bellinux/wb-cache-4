40|$|Abstract—The {{opportunistic}} large array (OLA) is {{the basis}} for a simple cooperative transmission protocol that is suitable for broadcasting in wireless sensor networks and in which every node transmits once per broadcast. OLA with transmission threshold (OLA-T) is an energy-efficient extension of the OLA protocol that limits node participation during broadcasting. Performance of OLA-T has been studied for disc-shaped networks. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically set the trans-mission threshold and design the OLAs for two-dimensional <b>strip-shaped</b> networks. Theoretical bounds and conditions for achieving sustained OLA propagation and reducing the total energy consumption in the network using OLA-T have been derived in this paper. These results would also apply to arbitrarily shaped networks that have node participation limited to <b>strip-shaped</b> collections.

It is essential to determine the forming limits for thin sheets and foils. Implementation of the Marciniak procedure with <b>strip-shaped</b> specimens defining the left-hand side of the forming limit diagram (FLD) results in tearing outside the observed area of the specimen. Therefore, new shapes of test pieces were designed with a <b>strip-shaped</b> central area and enlarged outer areas, which were {{in contact with the}} die during the forming process. The radius of the specimen enlargement enabled a co-axial contact of its edge and direction of the material flow over the die radius during the forming process.

Finally, strain paths variations due to shape change were analysed. The new specimen concept was verified on TS- 275 tinplate steel with a thickness of 0. 24 ?mm.
