40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the Single point cutting tool deflection due to cutting forces which were developed because of different parameters like feed, depth of cut, cutting speed and also because of geometrical parameters of cutting tool like side cutting edge angle and <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle and further comparing between <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle and <b>side</b> cutting edge angle. Firstly the cutting forces were measured using dynamometer which is taken from reference, then finite element method (FEM) was used to obtain the cutting tool deflection which is finite element analysis (FEA). The FEA results were then validated using cantilever beam model results. The predicted results from FEA were very close to the theoretical study. Though the prediction from FEA and the theoretical results are reasonably accurate...|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{mechanically}} {{more complicated}} rake was developed, {{known as the}} <b>side</b> delivery <b>rake.</b> This usually had a gear-driven or chain-driven reel mounted roughly at a 45-degree angle to the windrow, so the hay was gathered and pushed to one <b>side</b> of the <b>rake</b> as it moved across the field. A <b>side</b> delivery <b>rake</b> could be pulled longitudinally along the windrow by horses or a tractor, eliminating the laborious and inefficient process of raising, lowering, and back-and-forth raking required by a dump rake. This allowed for the continuous spiraling windrows of a classic mid-20th-century farm hayfield. Later versions of the <b>side</b> delivery <b>rake</b> used a more severe transverse angle and a higher frame system, but {{the basic principles of}} operation were the same.|$|R
5000|$|Rake {{angle is}} a {{parameter}} used in various cutting and machining processes, describing {{the angle of}} the cutting face relative to the work. There are two rake angles, namely the back <b>rake</b> angle and <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle, both of which help to guide chip flow. There are three types of rake angles: positive, negative, and zero.|$|R
50|$|Minimum angles {{which do}} the job {{required}} are advisable because the tool gets weaker as the edge gets keener due to the lessening support behind the edge and the reduced ability to absorb heat generated by cutting. The Rake angles {{on the top of}} the tool need not be precise in order to cut but to cut efficiently there will be an optimum angle for back and <b>side</b> <b>rake.</b>|$|R
50|$|The various angles, shapes, {{and sizes}} of a {{single-point cutting tool}} have direct {{relation}} to the resulting surface of a workpiece in machining operations. Different types of angle such as <b>rake</b> angle, <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle, cutting-edge angle, relief angle, nose radius exist and may be different {{with respect to the}} workpiece. Also, there are many shapes of single-point cutting tools, such as V-shaped and Square. Usually, a special toolholder is used to hold the cutting tool firmly during operation.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of animal drawn implements should {{be within the}} range of the pulling capacity of draught animals. The effects of design and operational parameters such as tail angle, <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle and radius of curvature of a curved soil tillage implement on horizontal and vertical forces have been investigated under laboratory conditions. Seven different wings of different radii of curvature (150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 mm) were designed. The range of tail angle used was between 32 ° and 54 ° and the range of side angle was between 40 ° and 65 °. The effect of curvature on the horizontal force showed anomalous behaviour for different tail angles. For smaller tail angles (about 30 ° to 40 °) the horizontal force decreased significantly with an increase of radius. For a tail angle of about 45 °, the horizontal force decreased first with the increase of radius of curvature and then increased with further increase of radius. For tail angles greater than 50 ° the horizontal force increased with an increase of radius. The variation of the behaviour of radius and force relation is presumably due to the edge rake angle, since it varies with the radius. For larger radii, the effect of edge rake angle on the horizontal force is much more pronounced than the effect of radius on the horizontal force. For the vertical force (directed downward), it was observed that, for all tail angles used, the force increased significantly with a decrease of radius and this relation was described well by a third order polynomial equation. Variation of tail angle showed a significant effect on both horizontal and vertical forces. This is mainly due to an increase of normal compression forces and gravitational force when the tail angle is increased. For the range of tail angle used the horizontal force could be described by a trigonometric model. The effect of variation of <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle on the resulting forces for different speeds and radii was also investigated. Experimental investigation showed that variation of speed and radius affects the of <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle and force relation. The study recommends a combination of larger radius and smaller <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angles for high speed operations to achieve a good penetration performance and reduced horizontal force. From the analysis made, a radius of about 275 mm was found to be an optimum for a curved implement. On the basis of the results obtained from the soil bin experiments and from the basic design of a conventional mouldboard plough and an ard type plough, a reversible animal drawn plough was designed...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new application of electropolishing using a low-cost disc-form electrode offering fast {{improvement of the}} surface roughness of SKD 61. It requires no expensive special-purpose equipment or heavy material removal as conventional electrochemical machining does, and it also avoids the complex pre-polishing of the workpiece before the electropolishing. Round bars or round tubes produced by traditional turning, drawing, form rolling, or extrusion, can be successively electropolished using the designed disc-form electrodes. Five electrode designs are discussed. The experimental parameters include rotational speed of workpiece, electrical current rating and pulse period, electrode geometry, and electrode feed rate. Thinner disc and larger disc taper angle are associated with larger discharge space for the electrode, thus the polishing is more effective. A smaller end radius of the disc electrode produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better polishing effect. A disc with discharge flute performs better, and larger flute back <b>rake</b> angle, <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angle, wider flute, and deeper flute depth are also advantageous. Although the use of pulsed current slightly outperforms the fluted electrode using continuous current, it sacrifices both machining time and cost. The best electrode design is identified.

Six types of feeding electrode are connected with continuous direct current in an electropolishing experiment. It requires no expensive special-purpose equipment nor high material removal as does conventional electrochemical machining, it offers fast improvement of the surface roughness and reduces the residual stress on the workpiece in a new area in electropolishing. The control factors include die material, chemical composition and concentration of the electrolyte, electrolyte temperature, flowrate of the electrolyte, initial gap width, electrical current rating, workpiece and electrode rotational speed, and electrode feed rate. The experimental parameters are the frequency and power level of ultrasonics, the pulse period, and the electrode design. The design change from inner taper to inside pins for full-ring electrodes performs well.

However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European experts were very reserved in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the coarse pitched cutter had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When, however, the Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the coarse pitched milling cutter which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides".|$|R

40|$|International audiencePDC {{drill bit}} {{performances}} in hard rock {{has been greatly}} improved during the last decades by innovations in PDC wear, impact resistance and better vibrations understanding. The bit design is generally done by balancing the bit, distributing uniform wear along the profile and achieving high drillability and steerability. To obtain required drilling performances, drill bit designer adjust features such as profile shape, gage and mainly cutter characteristics (shape, type and orientation). Cutter rock interaction model became a critical feature in the design process. But previously used models considered only three forces on a cutter based on the cutter-rock contact area : drag force, normal force and side force. Such models are no longer valid {{with the introduction of}} PDC cutters with chamfer and special shape. This paper presents a new cutter rock interaction model including some several improvements. It is based on the presence of a build-up edge of crushed materials on the cutting face often described in the literature. In addition, the chamfer, which significantly affects bit Rate Of Penetration (ROP), is taken into account (shape and size). Forces applied {{on the back of the}} cutter and due to the rock deformation and back flow of crushed materials are considered in the model. Finally, results of numerous single cutter tests (under atmospheric and confining pressure) are presented and compared to the new cutter rock interaction model predictions. An analysis of the influence of the PDC characteristics (shape, size, chamfer, back and <b>side</b> <b>rake</b> angles, [...] ) is presented. The model has been applied to optimize the cutting efficiency and bit steerability and some design rules are given to minimize the specific energy and maximize the rate of penetration. Finally, full scale laboratory drilling tests and field results indicate that the use of accurate cutter rock interaction model can help the drill bit designer to find the best drill bit for a specific application. Standard laboratory full scale drilling procedures have been developed. The tests have shown that drillability, stability, steerability and wear can be improved and controlled by acting on the cutter characteristics, cutter setup, trimmer characteristics and gage type...|$|R
