40|$|We show, in full generality, {{that the}} <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> {{provides}} integrals for mappings, and correspondences, obtained as traveling wave reductions of (systems of) integrable partial difference equations. We apply the <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> {{to a variety}} of equations, including the Korteweg-De Vries equation, the five-point Bruschi-Calogero-Droghei equation, the QD-algorithm, and the Boussinesq system. We show that, in all these cases, if the <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> provides r integrals for an n-dimensional mapping, with 2 r<n, then one can introduce q<= 2 r variables, which reduce the dimension of the mapping from n to q. These dimension-reducing variables are obtained as joint invariants of k-symmetries of the mappings. Our results support the idea that often the <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> provides sufficiently many integrals for the periodic reductions of integrable lattice equations to be completely integrable. We also study reductions on other quad-graphs than the regular 2 D lattice, and we prove linear growth of the multi-valuedness of iterates of high-dimensional correspondences obtained as reductions of the QD-algorithm.

40|$|The {{nociceptive}} flexion reflex (NFR) is {{of great}} interest for medical research, since its characteristics {{make it possible to}} draw conclusions from measured electromyographic parameters onto parameters of subjective pain sensation. It has been shown, that NFR threshold and subjective pain threshold correlate well, thus the NFR threshold {{can be used as a}} surrogate criterion for the subjective pain threshold. At present the NFR threshold is measured using a <b>staircase</b> <b>method,</b> which is not suitable for continual measurement. Such measurements would be particularly interesting while administrating fast acting drugs, for example during general anaesthesia. Here a continual NFR threshold tracking algorithm is proposed, which represents an advancement of the <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> and allows continual measurement of the NFR threshold. Both measuring methods should be interchangeably applicable, if the deviation between both methods is not significantly greater than the deviation within the NFR threshold caused by uncontrollable factors in measurements gained with the same method. Measurements of the NFR threshold were taken in 52 healthy subjects at different points of time using the <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> and the continual algorithm. Measurements differed in time intervals between measurements and the included factors that influenced NFR threshold. The deviation of the NFR threshold between <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> and continual algorithm (95 %-CI 1. 48 - 3. 05 mA) is not significantly greater than the deviation of the NFR threshold caused by a measurement-interval of several weeks and change of electrode positions (95 %-CI 4. 21 - 4. 55 mA), the deviation of NFR threshold caused by a measurement-interval of 15 min without change of electrode positions (95 %-CI 0. 78 - 3. 59 mA) or the deviation of the NFR threshold during continual NFR threshold measurements (1. 72 mA). Additional analysis of ratings individually given by 5 experts on 1314 EMG signals each indicated that sensitivity and specificity of the identification of a NFR in an EMG reach equilibrium at an interval-peak-z-score of 7. 34. The above results indicate that continual NFR threshold tracking algorithm and <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> can be used interchangeably. The determined interval-peak-z-score allows the identification of a NFR in an EMG based on a standardised scoring criterion while corresponding to the gold standard, the rating of an expert. In this work a continual NFR threshold tracking algorithm is introduced, which allows a continual measurement of the NFR threshold. The measured NFR threshold can be used as surrogate criterion for the subjective pain threshold, e. g. in the process of a general anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Evoked or {{experimental}} pain {{is often}} used {{as a model for}} the study of clinical pain, yet there are little data regarding the relationship between the two. In addition, there are few data regarding the types of stimuli and stimulus intensities that are most closely related to clinical pain. In this study, 36 subjects with fibromyalgia (FM), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), or both syndromes were administered measures of clinical pain and underwent a dolorimetry evaluation. Subjects also underwent experimental pain testing utilizing heat and pressure stimulation. Stimulation levels evoking low, moderate and high sensory intensity, and comparable levels of unpleasantness, were determined for both types of stimuli using random <b>staircase</b> <b>methods.</b> Clinical pain was assessed using visual analogue ratings and the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Ratings of heat pain sensation were not significantly associated with clinical pain ratings, with the exception of unpleasantness ratings at high stimulus intensities. Pain threshold and tolerance as assessed by dolorimetry were significantly associated with average measures of clinical pain. Both intensity and unpleasantness ratings of pressure delivered using random <b>staircase</b> <b>methods</b> were significantly associated with clinical pain at low, moderate and high levels, and the strength of the association was greater at increasingly noxious stimulus intensities. These findings suggest that random pressure stimulation as an experimental pain model in these populations more closely reflects the clinical pain for these conditions.

50|$|The classic {{methods of}} {{experimentation}} are often argued to be inefficient. This is because, {{in advance of}} testing, the psychometric threshold is usually unknown and much data is collected at points on the psychometric function that provide little information about the parameter of interest, usually the threshold. Adaptive staircase procedures (or the classical method of adjustment) can be used such that the points sampled are clustered around the psychometric threshold. However, {{the cost of this}} efficiency is that there is less information regarding the psychometric function's shape. Adaptive methods can be optimized for estimating the threshold only, or threshold and slope. Adaptive methods are classified into staircase procedures (see below) and Bayesian or maximum-likelihood <b>methods.</b> <b>Staircase</b> <b>methods</b> rely on the previous response only and are easier to implement. Bayesian methods take the whole set of previous stimulus-response pairs into account and are believed to be more robust against lapses in attention.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new class}} of multivariate Padé approximants is introduced. When dealing with two {{variables}} x and y, the approach consists in applying the Padé approximation with respect to y to the coefficients of the Padé approximation with respect to x. This technique has a natural extension to n variables, and is well adapted to programming in any usual language. The advantage of the method is that the algorithm uses only univariate Padé approximation. As a consequence, only small systems need to be solved, and the computation of the approximant is much faster: if M {{is the number of}} derivatives with respect to x and y, the algorithm requires O(M 4) operations instead of O(M 6) when matrix methods are used for solving the coefficients problem, or O(M 3) operations instead of O(M 4) if <b>staircase</b> <b>methods</b> are used.

40|$|Clinicians and {{researchers}} often need to measure proprioception (position sense), for example {{to monitor the}} progress of disease, to identify the cause of movement or balance problems, or to ascertain the effects of an intervention. While researchers can use sophisticated equipment to estimate proprioceptive acuity with good precision, clinicians lack this option and must rely on the subjective and imprecise methods currently available in the clinic. Here we describe a novel technique that applies psychometric adaptive staircase procedures to hand proprioception with a simple tablet-style apparatus that could easily be adapted for the clinic. We report test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and {{construct validity of the}} adaptive <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> vs. two other methods that are commonly used in clinical settings: passive motion direction discrimination (PMDD) and matching. As a first step, we focus on healthy adults. Subjects ages 18 - 82 had their proprioception measured with each of the three techniques, at the metacarpophalangeal joint in the second finger of the right hand. A subset completed a second session in which the measures were repeated, to assess test-retest reliability. Another subset had the measurements done by two different testers to assess inter-rater reliability. Construct validity was assessed using stepwise regression on age and activity level, and correlations calculated across the three methods. Results suggest that of the three methods, the adaptive <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> yields the best test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and construct validity.

40|$|The Battery for the Assessment of Auditory Sensorimotor and Timing Abilities (BAASTA) is a {{new tool}} for the {{systematic}} assessment of perceptual and sensorimotor timing skills. It spans {{a broad range of}} timing skills aimed at differentiating individual timing profiles. BAASTA consists of sensitive time perception and production tasks. Perceptual tasks include duration discrimination, anisochrony detection (with tones and music), and a version of the Beat Alignment Task. Perceptual thresholds for duration discrimination and anisochrony detection are estimated with a maximum likelihood procedure (MLP) algorithm. Production tasks use finger tapping and include unpaced and paced tapping (with tones and music), synchronization-continuation, and adaptive tapping to a sequence with a tempo change. BAASTA was tested in a proof-of-concept study with 20 non-musicians (Experiment 1). To validate the results of the MLP procedure, less widespread than standard <b>staircase</b> <b>methods,</b> three perceptual tasks of the battery (duration discrimination, anisochrony detection with tones, and with music) were further tested in a second group of non-musicians using 2 down / 1 up and 3 down / 1 up staircase paradigms (n = 24) (Experiment 2). The results show that the timing profiles provided by BAASTA allow to detect cases of timing/rhythm disorders. In addition, perceptual thresholds yielded by the MLP algorithm, although generally comparable to the results provided by standard staircase, tend to be slightly lower. In sum, BAASTA provides a comprehensive battery to test perceptual and sensorimotor timing skills, and to detect timing/rhythm deficits...|$|R

To measure the speech recognition threshold (SRT), the ascending procedure that is applied in FT-SI may be very time consuming. The aim of our study was to compare several adaptive procedures with the FT-SI ascending procedure. Based on the analysis of comprehensibility and commonness of stimuli used in FT-SI, the most appropriate words were selected and used in three adaptive procedures: two variants of a descending procedure, both recommended by the ISO 8523 - 3 standards for measuring an SRT, and the <b>staircase</b> <b>method.</b> On a normal-hearing sample (N = 36 in test measurement and N = 24 in retest measurement), comparable SRTs were obtained with the adaptive procedures, whereas the FT-SI ascending procedure yielded slightly higher SRTs.

The final position of a target moving in the frontal plane is not remembered correctly, but is instead shifted {{in the direction of}} the motion. Previous studies of displacement have mostly used the constant-stimuli method and the adjustment method. Although both methods usually yielded forward displacements, the task of responding activates different processes in the two methods, which could result in different outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the magnitude of displacement is affected by the measurement method. Three psychophysical methods were used: the constant-stimuli method, the <b>staircase</b> <b>method,</b> and the adjustment method. Direction and acceleration of the motion were also varied. The results showed that displacement is affected by motion acceleration (being the smallest for decelerated motion) and by motion direction (displacement was larger for motion to the right than for motion to the left). The constant-stimuli method and the <b>staircase</b> <b>method</b> gave comparable results, whereas the displacement obtained with the adjustment method was larger. Also, the variability of data differed between the methods, being the largest for the adjustment method.
