40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made {{to determine the effects}} of screen-induced total-pressure distortions on two J 85 -GE- 13 turbojet engines. Results were compared to those from a previous program run with a third engine. All compressors were found to be sensitive to a critical angle of circumferential distortion equal to 60 deg., and they all adhered closely to the parallel compressor model. The sensitivity of compressor exit pressure to virtually any type of distortion pattern can be determined by defining <b>stall</b> <b>lines</b> for undistorted, hub radial distorted, and tip radial distorted inflows.

Simply by determining compressor <b>stall</b> <b>lines</b> with a single hub radial distortion pattern, a single tip radial pattern, and with undistorted inflow, the overall compressor pressure ratio at stall for even the most complex distortion pattern was found to be predictable...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{estimating}} the undistorted <b>stall</b> <b>line</b> for an axial-flow compressor by using the digital computer is presented. The method involves linearization of nonlinear dynamic equations about an operating point on a speed line, and then application of the first method of Lyapunov to determine {{the stability of the}} nonlinear system from the stability of the linear system. The method is applied to a simulation of the J 85 compressor, which utilizes stage stacking and lumped volume techniques for the interstage regions to simulate steady-state and dynamic compressor performance. The stability boundary predicted by the digital simulation compares quite well with the <b>stall</b> <b>line</b> predicted by a dynamic simulation of the J 85 compressor programmed on the analog computer.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{technique is}} presented for {{the prediction of}} compressor stall for axial-flow compressors for clean and distorted inlet flow. The simulation is implemented on the digital computer and uses stage stacking and lumped-volume gas dynamics.

Parallel compressor theory is utilized to extend the technique to the distorted inlet flow problem. The method {{is applied to the}} eight-stage J 85 - 13 compressor. Analytical stall prediction for the undistorted <b>stall</b> <b>line</b> shows good agreement with experimental results. The predicted <b>stall</b> <b>line</b> for distorted inlet flow is in agreement with experimental results only for large distortion extents and/or low distortion levels. Results for low distortion extents and high distortion level do not agree with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Every {{compressor}} has a <b>stall</b> <b>line.</b> In {{the vicinity}} of the <b>stall</b> <b>line,</b> the flow field is inherently unsteady due to the interactions between adjacent rows of blades, formation of small stall cells, flow separation and the viscous effects including shock-boundary layer interactions. These factors may aggravate to a state of local breakdown of flow or a total breakdown of flow or with a disastrous flow reversal. This paper starts with an overview on the previous researches about compressor stall and surge. Subsequently, it describes the effects of these instabilities in overall engine performance and design with / without any control. The main objectives of this paper are to review the phenomenon of instability and methodology to suppress the rotating stall and surge by enlarging the stable operating range of compressor with the application of various control systems. This paper surveys research developments in this field and also tries to find an improved solution to increase the engine performance by applying various surge control strategies. Finally, the paper focuses on some recommendations towards a better design of compressor especially for aircraft power plant...|$|E

The two wings, perfectly symmetrical, are sub-divided into three parts: near the stables box-rooms for harness; then accommodations for the staff and, finally, the kitchens, near the sea.

40|$|The {{performance}} of {{the first stage of}} a transonic, multistage compressor was mapped over a range of inlet-guide-vane and stator-blade settings. Both stall-free and deep-stall performance data were obtained. For the settings tested, as stall was encountered and flow was further reduced, a relatively sharp drop in pressure ratio occurred and was followed by a continuing but more gradual reduction in pressure ratio with reduced flow. The position of the <b>stall</b> <b>line</b> on the map of pressure ratio against equivalent weight flow was essentially unaffected over the range of inlet-guide-vane and stator-blade settings...|$|E

There is a large parade in the central streets of the city, which features festival floats and dancers from schools, local companies and community organisations. Huge 'shishi gashira' (lion heads) are symbols of the festival. It is said that children chewed by the shishi gashira will become smart and healthy.
