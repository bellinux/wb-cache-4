In the third minute-long clip, Ron tries unsuccessfully to eat his lunch and throw away the garbage without moving.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes, Mary and George {{appear to}} have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their {{youngest}} son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his epilepsy from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: [...] "Her <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance to her. With the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: [...] "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stalin had a <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> {{and when}} {{speaking}} Russian {{he did so}} slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing. Although he avoided doing so in public, in private Stalin used coarse language. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was [...] "simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics". He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his most famous works, he {{attracted}} many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions. At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak. Some, like Michael Ayrton, called him [...] "Gloomy George," [...] but others developed the idea that he was a [...] "secular saint." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1997 was {{the last}} time Marv Albert would call the NBA Finals for NBC during the decade, as an {{embarrassing}} sex scandal forced NBC to fire Albert {{before the start of the}} 1997–1998 season. To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend Isiah Thomas; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of lead analyst. Thomas, in particular, was singled out for his <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> and often stammered analysis.|$|E
2500|$|In the Poltergeist trilogy, O'Rourke played Carol Anne Freeling, a young {{suburban}} {{girl who}} becomes the conduit and target for supernatural entities. The New York Times noted {{that she had}} played the {{key role in the}} films and commented, [...] "With her wide eyes, long blonde hair and <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> she was so striking that the sequel played off her presence." [...] During the production of the original Poltergeist, Spielberg twice accommodated the child actress when frightened. [...] When scared by performing a particular stunt, Spielberg replaced O'Rourke with a stunt double wearing a blonde wig; and when disturbed by the portrayal of child abuse, Spielberg did not require her to perform the take again. [...] For her work in Poltergeist, O'Rourke earned between $35,000 and $100,000. [...] O'Rourke played the role in all three films. O'Rourke and Zelda Rubinstein were the only original cast members to appear in the third film, Poltergeist III.|$|E

2500|$|The {{well-known}} later playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar, {{started to}} sing when Begum {{was at the}} peak of her career, and Begum's break after her husband's death boosted Mangeshkar's career, helping her to be offered high-quality songs. In the early careers of Mangeshkar, as well as her younger sister, Asha Bhosle, between 1944 and 1956, they had often been asked by producers and music directors to imitate Begum's style of singing, because producers could not afford Begum's fees. In their first song together, Mangeshkar {{was a part of the}} chorus while Begum was the main singer. Many of the songs sung by Lata like Ayega Ayega have been sung in Shamshad Begum style. Even Asha Bhosle's songs like her first duet with Kishore – Aati Hai Yaad Humko from 1948 film Muqaddar bear direct resemblance to Shamshad Begum style. From 1949 to 1960, beginning with the song [...] "Dar Na Mohabbat Karle" [...] from Andaz (1949), Mangeshkar and Begum have sung many duets together, with the most famous being [...] "Pyar Ke Jahan Ki" [...] from the 1949 film Patanga, [...] "Bachpan Ke Din" [...] from 1951's Deedar; their last song together was Mughal-e-Azams song [...] "Teri Mehfil Mein Qismat" [...] in 1960. Begum has sung songs together with Mangeshkar and Bhosle, including [...] "Mubarak Ho Woh Dil Jisko" [...] from Benazir 1964 [...] It was the period between 1958 and 1963, that career of Lata got major boost as music directors started gradually preferring her <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> until then Geeta Dutt and Begum were the most preferred singers but Shamshad Begum continued to be at the top from 1940 till 1963 non-stop.|$|E
2500|$|The celebrant and assistants {{follow the}} acolytes {{into the church}} wearing the biretta. Upon {{arriving}} in the sanctuary the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar step, after which they are extinguished. [...] The celebrant and assistants kneel on the lowest step and recite the Aperi Domine silently, after which they go to their places and recite the Pater noster and Ave Maria silently. A curious practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the antiphons and psalms to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him first in a <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms all sit. After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to {{each side of the}} lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones the Magnificat to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then incensed as at Mass while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope. [...] Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the collects. After all commemorations, the celebrant sings Dominus vobiscum, the cantor sings Benedicamus Domino, and the celebrant sings Fidelium animae.... The Marian antiphon is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament often follows Solemn Vespers.|$|E
