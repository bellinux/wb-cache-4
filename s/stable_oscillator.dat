50|$|A {{loop gain}} greater than {{one has a}} down side. In theory, the {{oscillator}} amplitude will increase without limit. In practice, the amplitude will increase until the output runs into some limiting factor such as the power supply voltage (the amplifier output runs into the supply rails) or the amplifier output current limits. The limiting reduces the effective gain of the amplifier (the effect is called gain compression). In a <b>stable</b> <b>oscillator,</b> the average loop gain will be one.|$|E

50|$|By {{varying the}} BFO {{frequency}} around 44000 Hz, the listener can vary the output audio frequency; {{this is useful}} to correct for small differences between the tuning of the transmitter and the receiver, particularly useful when tuning in single sideband (SSB) voice. The waveform produced by the BFO beats against the IF signal in the mixer stage of the receiver. Any drift of the local oscillator or the beat-frequency oscillator will affect the pitch of the received audio, so <b>stable</b> <b>oscillators</b> are used.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, many {{manufacturers}} {{were beginning to}} produce polyphonic synthesizers. The VCO designs of the time still left something to be desired in terms of tuning stability. Whilst this was an issue for monophonic synthesizers, {{the limited number of}} oscillators (typically 3 or fewer) meant that keeping instruments tuned was a manageable task, often performed using dedicated front panel controls. With the advent of polyphony, tuning problems became worse and costs went up, due to the much larger number of oscillators involved (often 16 in an 8-voice instrument like the Yamaha CS-80 from 1977 or Roland Jupiter-8 from 1981). This created a need for a cheap, reliable, and <b>stable</b> <b>oscillator</b> design. Engineers working on the problem looked to the frequency division technology used in electronic organs of the time and the microprocessors and associated chips that were starting to appear, and developed the DCO.|$|E

By combining, in a closed-loop topology, the nonlinear line and a special amplifier that provides not only gain but also mechanisms to tame inherently unruly soliton dynamics, we recently constructed the first electrical soliton oscillator that self-generates a stable, periodic train of electrical soliton pulses (Ricketts et al., IEEE Trans.

This paper starts with a review of this recently introduced circuit concept, and then reports on new contributions, i. e., further experimental studies {{of the dynamics of}} the <b>stable</b> soliton <b>oscillator</b> and a CMOS proto-type demonstrating the chip-scale operation of the <b>stable</b> soliton <b>oscillator.</b> Finally, we go to {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum and present a numerical study showing the possibilities that deliberate promotions of the unruly soliton dynamics in the closed-loop topology can produce chaotic signals.
