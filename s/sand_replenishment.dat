To reduce erosional losses from wind, beach grasses are often planted on the <b>replenishment</b> <b>sands.</b> However, there is little information on the microbial populations in this material that may affect plant establishment and growth. The objectives of this research were to document changes in the populations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and other soil microorganisms in replenishment materials and to determine whether roots of transplanted beach grasses become colonized by beneficial microbes. The study was conducted over a 2 -year period on a replenishment project in northeastern Florida. Three sampling locations were established at 1 -km intervals along the beach. Each location consisted of three plots: an established dune, <b>replenishment</b> <b>sand</b> planted with Uniola paniculata and Panicum sp., and <b>replenishment</b> <b>sand</b> left unplanted.

40|$|Beach nourishments or <b>sand</b> <b>replenishments</b> {{are applied}} {{by the use}} of {{pipelines}} or the rainbow method. Replenished sand is then moved and levelled by bulldozers. This is a passive approach to process the outflow of material. The land based equipment is dependent from tides and water levels, and significant effort is required to install and maintain the onshore discharge pipeline. In remote (off-shore) areas mobilization of site equipment to move the sand may be quite a challenge. The ideal method considers an active approach regarding processing the outflow of material. Instead of distributing the settled material by site equipment, the pipeline out flow point has to be relocated such that the design could be constructed. To increase workability the pipeline must have the ability to be relocated in water as on land. Enabling this approach the pipeline system has to be displaced by some sort of means. The main problem is the rigid behavior of the pipeline. Displacement of the pipeline will result that the entire pipeline length has to be displaced. Assuming that in water relocation of a floating pipeline is not that difficult as floating equipment is able to reach the floating pipeline. When the pipeline is situated on land huge pull or push requirements follows when the pipeline needs displacing. Concepts both for depositing material as for delivering the material have been generated. The most promising method for depositing material is to apply a spray pontoon. By adding amphibious propulsion technique to the spray pontoon the pontoon is able to work on the interface between water and land. The most promising method regarding delivering material to the spray pontoon is by applying a steel pipeline. During depositing the spray pontoon have to be displaced frequently. Also the spray pontoon {{has to be able to}} displace the pipeline system. Properties of the pipeline system dictate the required amount of tractive effort that have to be generated by the spray pontoon. Focus is on maximizing the tractive effort to be generated by the spray pontoon. To decrease the amount of resistance the pipeline will be mounted on platforms. Focus is on minimizing the required amount effort to displace the pipeline system and by generating flexibility along the pipeline system. By generating flexibility along the pipeline system the pipeline could swing independently of each other. Production figures will determine the amount of flexibility needed along the pipeline system. It is technical feasible to apply an amphibious spray pontoon but a uniform concept doesn’t exist because there is a large amount of parameters and aspects involved. It depends on the type of project, and site conditions which type of platform have to be applied. On project locations were small variations of the water level is to be expected and the soil surface has high bearing capacities values platforms can be applied that have an interaction with the soil surface. However, on soft soils with low bearing capacity values the soil interaction platforms will experience significant sinkage; the resistance force to displace such platforms may possible not be generated by the spray pontoon. In addition on soft soil the spray pontoon is able to generate a smaller pull force compared to when on sandy soil surface. On (very) soft soils platforms that don’t have an interaction with the soil surface are advantageous compared to soil interaction platforms. Dredging Engineerin...|$|R

Adverse impacts of coastal beach replenishment projects on the marine environment are well documented. As a result, coastal managers have been seeking ways and techniques with which to implement beach replenishment projects without causing adverse changes to marine ecosystems. In May 2004, the Malta Tourism Authority undertook beach replenishment at St George’s Bay (St Julians, Malta) in which coarse sediment of terrestrial origin, having a mean grain size of 2 mm, was deposited {{at the head of}} the bay to create an artificial beach. An extensive 2 -year (January 2004 to December 2005) environmental monitoring programme was commissioned by the MTA to monitor the potential impacts of the replenishment works on the marine environment. The programme included surveys of physico-chemical attributes (beach and seabed profile surveys, granulometric analysis and microscopic examination of sublittoral sediments, and water quality studies), and use of seagrass as a bioindicator of environmental quality. For most of the attributes surveyed, data was collected from stations located within the putatively ‘impacted’ inlet, and from control stations before initiation of the works and following the beach replenishment works. Data for mean sediment grain size, water quality attributes (salinity, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and nutrients) and seagrass morphometric parameters (shoot density, length and biomass of adult leaves, and shoot epiphyte biomass) were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Overall, the results of the various monitoring components indicated that (i) no major transport of sediment from the beach to the sublittoral had occurred, and (ii) the beach replenishment works did not result in any adverse impacts on the marine environment. Good project planning and management, the relatively sheltered location of the replenished beach, together with appropriate choice of grain size of the <b>sand</b> used for <b>replenishment</b> appear to have contributed to the success of the project. peer-reviewe...|$|R

At the Kailua study site, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) {{analysis was used to}} explain alongshore patterns of alternating sand volume increases and decreases potentially related to seasonal offshore circulation, and at the Waikiki study site, a detailed analysis of historical human intervention was performed to determine its effect on sand transport patterns and develop a basis for planning future <b>sand</b> <b>replenishment</b> efforts.

At the Kihei study site, cycles in longshore sediment transport patterns were compared with periods of increased and decreased Kona storm activity (rain-bearing winds from the southwest), and a significant correlation was found.

In Sri Lanka alone, {{it is estimated that}} over 40, 000 drinking water wells were either destroyed or contaminated. From February through September 2005, a team of United States, Sri Lankan, and Danish water resource scientists and engineers surveyed the coastal groundwater resources of Sri Lanka to develop an understanding of the impacts of the tsunami and to provide recommendations for the future of coastal water resources in south Asia. In the tsunami-affected areas, seawater was found to have infiltrated and mixed with fresh groundwater lenses as indicated by the elevated groundwater salinity levels. Seawater infiltrated through the shallow vadose zone as well as entered aquifers directly through flooded open wells. Our preliminary transport analysis demonstrates that the intruded seawater has vertically mixed in the aquifers because of both forced and free convection. Widespread pumping of wells to remove seawater was effective in some areas, but overpumping has led to upconing of the saltwater interface and rising salinity. We estimate that groundwater recharge from several monsoon seasons will reduce salinity of many sandy Sri Lankan coastal aquifers.

40|$|Macroalgae are {{abundant}} on shallow temperate reef environments, often forming complex communities that comprise several strata. In southern Australia, these assemblages {{are dominated by}} large canopy forming taxa from the Orders Laminariales and Fucales. The presence of subtidal fucoid macroalgae differentiates these communities from that elsewhere, and emphasises the need for local studies {{rather than relying on}} generalisations made elsewhere. Like most natural systems, temperate reefs are often threatened by human activity with degradation reported from many locations in close proximity to urban settlements. The work presented in this thesis involves an examination of the temporal and spatial variability in the structure of macroalgal communities from reefs along the Adelaide (South Australia) metropolitan coast. The work looked specifically at the effects of a dispersed sediment plume, resulting from the 1997 beach sand-replenishment dredging program, on shallow sub-tidal reef systems. An examination of the structure of canopy forming phaeophycean macroalgae in Gulf St Vincent (South Australia), noted large amounts of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Notwithstanding, this variation was not random, but demonstrated considerable structure that could be linked to a number of important underlying processes. In particular, macroalgal assemblages appeared as a mosaic of patches, each of which comprised a high-density state clearly dominated by a single genus (Cystophora, Sargassum, or Ecklonia), or alternatively a lower density mixed assemblage (Variable Low Abundance, VLA). Macroalgal community structure appeared to be driven by biotic interactions at small scales (metres), such that patches comprised of different species of algae in high density states rarely abutted one another. Instead, VLA assemblages frequently formed a buffer being situated between these mono generic patches. In terms of successional processes, the high-density states appeared to be relatively stable whereas the VLA state, at least in some systems, was transitory. This finding was supported by the absence of intermediary high- density states (e. g. a mix of Cystophora and Ecklonia) implying that state changes must occur via the VLA state following some form of disturbance. Larger scale patterns appeared to be driven by environmental variation, with factors such as wave exposure influencing habitat suitability for individual species and thereby affecting community composition. These phenomena were examined in terms of life history strategies that tend to promote stability, and which are common in late successional taxa. The importance of properties enhancing stability and the role of disturbance was investigated experimentally using a dispersed sediment plume, which entirely engulfed two reefs, as a pulse impact. This disturbance was of particular relevance given that degradation of macroalgal communities in close proximity to the City of Adelaide has been, at least in part, attributed to the effects of elevated levels of sediment. Follow up surveys revealed that the sedimentation from the plume had primarily affected newly recruiting individuals, with few juveniles surviving to one year of age. Over the following few years, the effect of this recruitment failure cascaded into the adult stand. In broader terms, unfavourable climatic conditions {{prior to the start of}} the study, including a particularly severe El Nino event, had a widespread effect on local assemblages, causing high levels of both adult and juvenile mortality. As such, at the commencement of the study, macroalgal communities across the study area were in the process of recovery. This was observed at control sites over the duration of the study. In contrast, recruitment failure at the sediment-affected sites retarded the recovery process, exacerbating the problems associated with prior unfavourable climatic events and leaving them in a degraded state. This study demonstrated that macroalgal assemblages are equipped (under natural conditions) to handle 'normal' environmental fluctuations (such as inter-annual variability). However, the additional stress associated with certain anthropogenic impacts has the potential to push them over the limit, causing degradation. The loss of canopy macroalgae reduces the structural complexity of the system, leading to a concomitant reduction in their ability to recover. As such, these findings are of particular relevance to those charged with the responsibility for managing near-shore marine environments.
