50|$|By section 12 of the act, the {{treasury}} may appoint warehousing ports or places, and the commissioners of customs may {{from time to}} time approve and appoint warehouses in such ports or places where goods may be warehoused or kept and fix the amount of rent payable in respect of the goods. The proprietor or occupier of every warehouse so approved (except existing warehouses of special security in respect of which <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>bond</b> has hitherto been dispensed with), or some one on his behalf, must, before any goods be warehoused therein, give <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>bond,</b> or such other security as the commissioners may approve of, for the payment of the full duties chargeable on any goods warehoused therein, or for the due exportation thereof (s. 13).|$|E
50|$|The Act did {{not specify}} a rate of payment, but rather left the {{remuneration}} to be agreed between the railways and the Postmaster-General, or if necessary settled by arbitration. These agreements were subject to alteration at a month's notice, though the Postmaster-General {{had the power to}} terminate the services of the railway companies without notice if compensation was paid. The penalty for refusing or neglecting to convey the mails was £20, and the railways could be required to post <b>security</b> <b>by</b> <b>bond,</b> under a penalty of £100 per day for neglect. Individual lessees of a railway, those not a body corporate or company, were not to be required to give security above £1,000. Finally, two arbitrators were to be appointed to mediate disputes between the Postmaster-General and the railway companies.|$|E
60|$|But what {{security}} {{would there}} be for the faithful fulfillment of these promises? In modern times such <b>security</b> is given <b>by</b> <b>bonds,</b> with pecuniary penalties, or by the deposit of titles to property in responsible hands. In ancient days they managed differently. The promiser bound himself by some solemn and formal mode of adjuration, accompanied, in important cases, with certain ceremonies, which were supposed to seal and confirm the obligation assumed. In this case Hannibal brought a lamb {{in the presence of}} the assembled army. He held it before them with his left hand, while with his right he grasped a heavy stone. He then called aloud upon the gods, imploring them to destroy him as he was about to slay the lamb, if he failed to perform faithfully and fully the pledges that he had made. He then struck the poor lamb a heavy blow with the stone. The animal fell dead at his feet, and Hannibal was thenceforth bound, in the opinion of the army, by a very solemn obligation indeed, to be faithful in fulfilling his word.|$|R
