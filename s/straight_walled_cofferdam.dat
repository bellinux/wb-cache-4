5000|$|On a [...] "rimless" [...] case, the rim {{has almost}} or {{exactly the same}} {{diameter}} as {{the base of the}} case; the recess formed between the rim and the body of the cartridge is known as an extractor groove, since it forms a lip which can be grasped by an extractor to extract the empty case after being fired.

The lack of a projecting rim makes rimless cases feed very smoothly from box magazines, and they are primarily used in firearms that feed from a box magazine, although they also work well in belt, drum and tube-fed weapons. Rimless cases are not well suited to break-open and revolver actions, though they can be used with appropriate modifications, such as a spring-loaded extractor or, in a revolver, a moon clip (for example, the Colt or Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers in [...]45ACP).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Straight</b> <b>walled</b> {{cases were}} the {{standard}} from {{the beginnings of}} cartridge arms. With the low burning speed of black powder, the best efficiency was achieved with large, heavy bullets, so the bullet was the largest practical diameter. The large diameter allowed a short, stable bullet with high weight, and the maximum practical bore volume to extract the most energy possible in a given length barrel. There were a few cartridges that had long, shallow tapers, but these were generally an attempt to use an existing cartridge to fire a smaller bullet with a higher velocity and lower recoil. With the advent of smokeless powders, {{it was possible to}} generate far higher velocities by using a slow smokeless powder in a large volume case, pushing a small, light bullet. The odd, highly tapered 8 mm Lebel, made by necking down an older 11 mm black-powder cartridge, was introduced in 1886, and it was soon followed by the 7.92×57mm Mauser and 7×57mm Mauser military rounds, and the commercial [...]30-30 Winchester, all of which were new designs built to use smokeless powder.

2500|$|Dies for {{bottle neck}} cases usually are {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for crimping. This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition for safe operation, such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] Crimping is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in bottle neck cases, roll crimping is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when crimping. [...] Rimless, straight wall cases, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll crimping causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for <b>straight</b> <b>walled</b> cases, with an optional fourth die for crimping. Crimps for straight wall cases may be taper crimps, suitable for rimless cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll crimps, which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|R

40|$|Fluidized bed dryers (FBDs) {{are used}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry to remove excess moisture from granule prior to tablet formation. As granule moisture content is reduced from its initial to final state, the velocity required to fully fluidize the granule decreases and the bed voidage decreases. The change in these fluidization properties are attributed to the decrease in the interparticle force load created by a reduction in liquid bridging as moisture is removed. During constant velocity drying, these fluidization properties result in a bubbling fluidization state, which evolves into a bubble coalescing regime as drying proceeds. This behaviour was identifiable using pressure fluctuation time-series analysis techniques. Distributor design studies using dry and wet granule in a conical fluidized bed suggest that the punched plate design limits bubble coalescence when compared to the perforated plate and Dutch weave mesh designs. Furthermore, the Dutch weave results in extensive segregation, which is undesirable from a fluidization perspective. Local drying hydrodynamic measurements using x-ray densitometry found that the punched and perforated plates generate a centralized bubbling core region during drying with a defluidized bed periphery. This fluidized core region grows as drying proceeds until the defluidized region disappears. Under the same operating conditions, a porous plate distributor creates extensive channelling and defluidization across the entire bed cross-section during the constant rate period of drying. These poor fluidization characteristics are a result of the porous plate introducing the gas into the bed as a fine dispersion. Lastly, the hydrodynamics associated with the conical vessel geometry improves the circulation and mixing patterns in fluidized bed dryers. This is especially the case in the entry region of the conical bed where the high inlet gas velocity prevents defluidization around the periphery of the bed. The <b>straight</b> <b>walled</b> geometry of the cylindrical bed resulted in defluidization in this area. As a result, the hydrodynamics associated with bubbling differ significantly between the geometries over the course of drying...|$|R

50|$|The {{colonies of}} M. gypseum are {{described}} as cottony or powdery, they grow rapidly with a colour range of white to buff, with a reserve that can range from pink, to red, to yellow (cinnamon); they may occasionally have overtones of violet. The powdery appearance of the colony {{is due to the}} abundant production of macroconidia on the older mycelium, while the edges of the colony {{are described as}} scalloped to ragged and can exhibit pleomorphism. Macroconidia of M. gypseum have a substantial range that can occur as short pedicels, terminal, solitary, spindle shaped, large, thick walled, that are smooth or roughened, borne directly on hyphae or on short branches. They are often very large (e.g., 40-150 x 8-15 μm), ellipsoid to , moderately thick, have verrucose and are 4-6 septate. The macroconidia also possess a rat-like tail {{at the edges of the}} conidia. The ascoma of the fungus is a globose, appendaged gymnothecium that is pale buff in colour and 500-1250 μm in diameter. The peridial hyphae are hyaline, pale buff, septate, and are branched with thinly but have densely verrucose walls. Microconidia are drop shaped, clavate, (1.7-3.5 x 3.3-8.3 μm), unicellular, smooth-walled or can be slightly roughened and are created laterally on the hyphae. The abundance of microconidia is characteristic of the fungus. The hyphae or appendages are of three kinds in the fungi, the first being <b>straight,</b> slender, smooth <b>walled</b> hyphae that can grow up to 250 μm long; they taper at 2.5-4.0 μm in diameter at the base but close to about 1.5-2 μm. The second are slender, smooth-walled, septate, spiral hyphae that are rarely branched, which have a base diameter of 2.5-3.5 μm that taper up to 1.5-2 μm in diameter. They are usually variable in their coiled state, ranging from tightly to loosely coiled with numerous but variable amounts of turns. The third are thick-walled, verruculose, ellipsoid or fusiform macroconidia, that are 35-55 x 10-13.5 μm, with up to five septa. The asci of the fungus are subglobose, thin-walled, evanescent, which are 5-7 μm in diameter and contain a total of eight ascospores. The ascospores are smooth-walled, lenticular, 1.5-2 x 2.5-4 μm in diameter, and when in mass are yellow. Additionally, the spiral hyphal appendages that ornament the ascomata are often produced spontaneously in culture in the absence of gymnothecia. The fungus does not have any specific nutritional requirements for growth. The teleomorphic features of the microsporum on colonial and microscopic features are often done on Takashio's Medium. However, distinguishing is best done by mating (+/-) or by genetics. The species is heterothallic, and a such mating is controlled by a 1-locus, 2-allele compatibility system. Comparatively A. gypseum produces more spreading and a coarser granular colony; the macroconidia also are wider and the surface colour is brighter and redder than A. incurvatum. Colonies of A. incurvatum are pale buff in colour and finely granular, occasionally with a reddish to yellow reverse.|$|R
