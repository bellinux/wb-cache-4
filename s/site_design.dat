Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong {{was familiar with}} the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and vandalism concerns. Instead, a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards.|$|E

500|$|At {{about this}} time, the phase two five acre riverfront {{expansion}} located {{to the north}} of the existing park expanded the park {{to the north of}} the 18th street bridge. [...] It was also designed by <b>Site</b> <b>Design</b> Group, and features a 300 linear foot boardwalk with iconic red Chinese ornamental railings that extends over the water, as well as unique decorative limestone rocks called scholar's stones from Lake Tai in China. [...] Native plantings and oak savanna restoration provide a sustainable planting palette, welcoming native wildlife to the park. [...] The project cost was $4.9 million.|$|E
500|$|Fark tweaked its <b>site</b> <b>design</b> {{a little}} more on June 1, 2011, with the comment, [...] "Fark's {{redesign}} will go live at 5PM EST. Heads-up {{for those of you}} who missed the other warning threads and need a place to completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is to make it easier to use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

2500|$|On July 12, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Hulu had signed a three-year deal purchasing exclusive online streaming rights to the South Park library.

Along with this, the domain name changed from [...] "southparkstudios.com" [...] to [...] "southpark.cc.com". Previously, the show had been available on Netflix. The new site launch caused some technical issues, which were resolved allowing fans to watch uncensored episodes and clips. For viewers outside the US, episodes and clips still stream through the “classic” South Park player and nothing changed aside from the new <b>site</b> <b>design.</b> A handful of countries also have their own localized versions of South Park sites, with the old experience.|$|E
2500|$|The paper's website {{was also}} {{extensively}} overhauled using a new, in-house {{content management system}} known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and section pages), clickable video advertising and a responsive design layout. The site {{was designed to be}} more interactive, provide optimizations for mobile and touchscreen devices, provide [...] "high impact" [...] advertising units, and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform and the USA Today <b>site</b> <b>design</b> throughout 2013 and 2014 (although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre-relaunch design).|$|E
2500|$|The {{site was}} never {{intended}} to be a money-maker or a career option for Brazelton, [...] "It's a coincidence that I get money and keep the site self-supporting." [...] To support the comic, Brazelton initially asked visitors for a US$1 donation, which was very unproductive. [...] He was more successful when he began selling t-shirts and posters featuring his comic, but it was still insufficient to cover Theater Hoppers costs. [...] By 2006, the site was utilizing advertising networks to sell ad space. [...] Though he was dissatisfied with the aesthetic integration of advertising with his <b>site</b> <b>design,</b> the income (initially $500 a month) did begin to cover all of Brazelton's varied associated costs. Revenue from Theater Hopper is insufficient for Brazelton to not work a full-time job, and he does not foresee that changing. As of August 2007, the ratio of advertising to merchandising income from Theater Hopper was 70 to 30%, respectively.|$|E
