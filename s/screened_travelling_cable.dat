40|$|During {{the past}} decade, the global public health {{community}} has been challenged by the emergence and rapid worldwide spread of novel influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome, chikungunya virus, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and other conditions and pathogens. Modern transportation and increased tourism, business travel, and immigration contributed to dissemination of these high-impact pathogens. The effectiveness of interventions such as airport <b>screening,</b> <b>travel</b> restrictions, and other community mitigation measures remains uncertain. However, human migration has occurred for centuries and will continue, despite the threats posed by microbes...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of lift (elevator) systems {{deployed in the}} modern tall built environment can be substantially affected by adverse environmental conditions suchs as seismic (earthquake) activities (as well as strong winds). The building motion (sway) which is induced by those environmental conditions excites the lift system elastic components such as suspension / compensating ropes, belts and cables. A complex dynamic situation arises when the building is excited near its natural frequency which in turn approaches the natural frequency of the ropes. In this scenario resonances interactions phenomena take place. These phenomena severely affect lightly tensioned compensating ropes, as well as <b>travelling</b> <b>cables,</b> that sway at {{the frequency of the}} building displaying non-planar responses. Thus, the lift system designers have to take into consideration the critical characteristics of the building structure before the lift installation is constructed and installed. In this presentation the excitation mechanism is explianed and the dynamic analysis of responses of lift ropes is discussed. Suitable control strategies can then be developed and applied to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses arising in the building – lift system...|$|R
5000|$|These traces were {{produced}} by a commercial TDR using a step waveform with a 25 ps risetime, a sampling head with a 35 ps risetime, and an 18 inch m SMA cable.

2500|$|V-brakes {{function}} {{well with}} the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes {{because they do not}} require a separate cable stop on the frame or fork. Because of the higher mechanical advantage of V-brakes, they require brake levers with longer <b>cable</b> <b>travel</b> than levers intended for older types of brakes. [...] Mechanical (i.e. cable-actuated) disc brakes use the same amount of <b>cable</b> <b>travel</b> as V-brakes, except for those that are described as being [...] "road" [...] specific. As a general rule, mechanical disc brakes for so-called [...] "flat bar" [...] bicycles (chiefly mountain and hybrid bicycles) are compatible with V-brake levers, whereas mechanical disc brakes intended for [...] "drop-bar" [...] bicycles are compatible with the cable pull of older brake designs (cantilever, caliper, and U-brake).|$|R
50|$|In basic {{gameplay}} terms, Salmon Run {{is similar}} to contemporary bird's-eye view racing games like Bump 'n' Jump. The player's character is movable within a fixed area near {{the centre of the}} screen while the scenery scrolls down {{from the top of the}} <b>screen,</b> simulating <b>travel</b> towards the top of a large map. As the map scrolls, the player moves primarily side-to-side to avoid obstacles.|$|R
50|$|Blu-ray {{equipment}} {{is required to}} implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it <b>travels</b> across <b>cables.</b> Through a protocol flag in the media stream called the Image Constraint Token (ICT), a Blu-ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-compliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition formats, the adoption of this protection method was postponed until 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the LNB {{is to use the}} {{superheterodyne}} principle to take a block (or band) of relatively high frequencies and convert them to similar signals carried at a much lower frequency (called the intermediate frequency or IF). These lower frequencies <b>travel</b> through <b>cables</b> with much less attenuation, so there is much more signal left at the satellite receiver end of the cable. It is also much easier and cheaper to design electronic circuits to operate at these lower frequencies, rather than the very high frequencies of satellite transmission.|$|R

50|$|Access Media Network (AMN) is a {{business}} automation and technology organization unifying speech, music, audio, images and movies with two-way communications. The core definition of the AMN, founded by Dale Burleigh Schalow in 1992, was a premise for consumer-based music access, originally called Accessible Music Network. A new music industry model encompassed three main tiers at its inception: 1) method of <b>travel</b> including <b>cable</b> TV, telephony, satellite and cellular; 2) hardware and software to play music after point-of-purchase; 3) business licensing model to levy single license issue, as well as monthly subscription plans of multiple licenses.|$|R

40|$|Large water-use {{facilities}} are often equipped with vertically travelling debris barriers known as Ristroph screens. Although {{made in a}} variety of configurations, all such screens are equipped with some manner of fish-catching troughs or rails, and all operate on the principle of direct contact and active removal of impounded fish and debris. The imposed fish mortalities associated with these machines are commonly attributed to the consequences of impingements (to fish being flattened against the screening by the force of the inflowing water), but the laboratory and field experiments reported here imply that in those circumstances where the <b>screens</b> <b>travel</b> continuously and where water speeds are moderate, the major underwater injuries are attributable instead to buffeting of captured fish within the fish troughs proper. A reconfigured machine, including the redesigned fish-catching apparatus, was installed and tested at a nuclear generating station on the Hudson River estuary. In tests similar to those on the unimproved machine, injuries and deaths were reduced from 53 to 9 % for striped bass Morone saxatilis, from 64 to 14 % for white perch M. american, from 80 to 17 % for Atlantic tomcod Microgadus tomcod, and from 47 to 7 % for pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus...|$|R
25|$|The {{science of}} negative-index {{materials}} is being matched with conventional devices that broadcast, transmit, shape, or receive electromagnetic signals that <b>travel</b> over <b>cables,</b> wires, or air.
