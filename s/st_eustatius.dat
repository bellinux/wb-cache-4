5|$|Fénix was {{commissioned}} under Captain John Carter Allen in February 1780 and renamed HMS Gibraltar on 23April. She joined George Darby's fleet in the English Channel until 29November, {{when she left}} for Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies under Captain Walter Stirling. In 1781, under Captain Charles Knatchbull, Gibraltar became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Francis Samuel Drake and {{was present at the}} Capture of <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> in February. Following the outbreak of war between the Dutch Republic and Britain in December 1780, Rodney received orders from London to seize the island. A British expedition of 3,000 troops from St Lucia, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Vaughan, arrived off <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> on 3February 1781. Rodney, in command of the naval forces, positioned his fleet so as to neutralise any shore batteries, but instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney sent a message to Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. DeGraaff agreed to the proposal and capitulated. The only shots fired were from Gibraltar and , both of which, without orders, briefly engaged Mars, the only Dutch warship in the roadstead.|$|E
5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, a {{tropical}} storm watch was posted for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba and <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> though it was discontinued the next day. Shortly thereafter, {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. Tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were put into effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. By August 24, those tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued, {{and at the same}} time they were issued for parts of the Southeast United States. A hurricane warning was eventually posted for Murrells Inlet, South Carolina to the North Carolina– Virginia border. On August 27, tropical cyclone watches and warnings extended as far north as Plymouth, Massachusetts; all were discontinued early on August 29.|$|E
5|$|On August22, governments {{across the}} Lesser Antilles issued {{tropical}} storm watches. The islands of Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> and St. Kitts were placed under {{a tropical storm}} warning the following day. These advisories were discontinued following Danny's degradation to a tropical depression on August24. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered their courses. Although members of the Haiti Office of Civil Protection issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was {{not a threat to}} the country, they convened to discuss potential preparations and the status of emergency supplies. Officials in the United States Virgin Islands distributed sandbags and opened shelters.|$|E
5|$|As the {{flagship}} of Admiral Juan de Lángara, the ship fought at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 16January 1780, {{where she was}} captured by the British Royal Navy and commissioned as the third rate HMS Gibraltar in March of that year. She spent a short while in the English Channel before joining Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies and {{taking part in the}} Capture of <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> in February 1781 and the Battle of Fort Royal the following month. Gibraltar and five other ships were sent to stop a French invasion fleet bound for Tobago in May 1781, but found the French too powerful and had to withdraw. In November, her 18-pound guns were replaced with 24-pounders, after which, in February 1782, she sailed to the East Indies and in the following year participated in the Battle of Cuddalore.|$|E
5|$|At 1500 UTC on October 19, the {{hurricane}} watch in Dominica, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saint Kitts, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Saba, St. Maarten, and Anguilla, was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Simultaneously, a hurricane watch {{went into effect}} for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, while a tropical storm warning was issued for St. Lucia. It was then that the tropical storm watch in St. Vincent and the Grenadines was discontinued. Later on October 19, {{the hurricane}} watch previously issued for the Virgin Island and Puerto Rico was upgraded to a hurricane warning. In St. Lucia, the hurricane watch was canceled. At 1200 UTC on October 20, a hurricane warning as put into effect for Desirade, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy. Throughout the day, the hurricane warnings in Guadeloupe, Dominica, Antigua, and Desirade were discontinued. By 2100 UTC on October 21, all watches and warnings in effect were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was moving}} little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought {{prolonged}} tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58mph (92km/h) were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4.0 in (102mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 in (43mm) and 1.5 in (41mm) of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported {{in some parts of}} Aruba. In the SSS Islands (Saba, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> and Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76mph (122km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4in (139.4mm). Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center began posting {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings starting at 0900 UTC on October 18, with a hurricane watch for Barbados. Three hours later, {{a tropical storm}} watch was put into effect in Trinidad and Tobago. Late on October 18, a hurricane watch was also issued for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, and Dominica, while a tropical storm watch and a warning was extended to include Barbados and Grenada, respectively. At 2100 UTC on October 18, the tropical storm watch that was issued for Trinidad and Tobago was discontinued. Early on October 19, the hurricane watch was extended to include Martinique, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla, as well as <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> Saba, St. Maarten, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy shortly thereafter. A hurricane watch in effect for St. Vincent and the Grenadines was soon downgraded to a tropical storm watch; simultaneously, the hurricane watch that was issued for Barbados was canceled. By 0900 UTC on October 19, the hurricane watches in effect for Dominica, Martinique, and Guadeloupe were all upgraded to a hurricane warning. Additionally, the tropical storm watch in Grenada was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{consistently}} {{predicted that}} the storm would intensify and pass through the islands. As Hurricane Dean approached, the island nations began to prepare with a flurry of activity. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of all member states in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts {{in advance of the}} hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands. At 11p.m.AST August 15 (0300UTC August 16) the respective governments of St. Lucia, Martinique, Saba, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> and Guadeloupe and its dependencies issued Hurricane watches and the government of the Netherlands Antilles issued a tropical storm watch for the island of St. Maarten, as then-Tropical Storm Dean was expected to intensify to hurricane strength and reach the Windward Islands within 36hours. Authorities in Martinique canceled a memorial to the victims of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 and began to set up shelters.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months the}} 64th had {{returned}} to the West Indies for a campaign of seizing islands held by, variously, France, The Netherlands and Denmark. The first island to fall was the Franco-Dutch island of Saint Martin. This was followed by the Dutch island of <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and the Danish islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix. With the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, which restored to France and its allies all territories conquered by the British, the 64th were withdrawn to Barbados. Peace did not last long and in 1803 war with France broke out again. The 64th was immediately in action being part of an expeditionary force that took St Lucia, earning the battle honour St Lucia 1803— the award of this honour was more timely, it being awarded in 1818. The expedition continued onto the South American mainland with the capture of Dutch held Surinam in 1804. A fourth battle honour, Surinam, was awarded— again in 1818. Garrison duties kept the 64th in Surinam for the next nine years meaning that the regiment played no further part in the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group {{convened a}} meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme Barbados in {{anticipation}} of the hurricane causing significant damage and member states requiring international assistance. At 11 a.m. AST (1500 UTC) the Barbados Meteorological Service issued tropical storm warnings for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Government of the Netherlands Antilles discontinued the hurricane watch on Saba and <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> replacing it with a tropical storm warning. At 5 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) August 16, roughly 15hours before Hurricane Dean arrived, the Government of France issued hurricane warnings for Martinique and Guadeloupe and its dependencies, and the NHC issued a tropical storm watch for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. At 8 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) August 16 the Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm warning for Anguilla. Martinique's main airport and both of St. Lucia's commercial airports closed that night when the last airplanes landed as the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island. At 11 p.m. AST August 16 (0300 UTC August 17) the NHC upgraded the tropical storm watch on U.S. Virgin Islands to a tropical storm warning. The next morning, August 17, the center of Hurricane Dean passed between St. Lucia and Martinique. The Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm warning for the British Virgin Islands that same morning, and the Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a second meeting to finalize the coordination of three Rapid Assessment Teams.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War between Britain and the Dutch Republic Admiral George Rodney, acting under orders from London, captured the Dutch island of <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> on 3 February 1781.|$|E
25|$|The deadliest {{hurricane}} {{ever was}} the 1970 Bhola cyclone; the deadliest Atlantic hurricane was the Great Hurricane of 1780 which devastated Martinique, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and Barbados. Another notable hurricane is Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005.|$|E
25|$|During {{the autumn}} Camilla {{captured}} the brig Chance, John M'Kay Master, off Cape Cod. The brig was sailing from <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> to Connecticut with a cargo of salt.

25|$|That Esmit {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the present contingency {{there could be no}} doubt. The gold, silver, and other property {{that he was able to}} scrape together had been sent to the Dutch island of <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> whence they were to be shipped to Flushing. Although Milan had been instructed only to secure the persons of Esmit and his family and to have them sent to Copenhagen, he took it upon himself to try to secure the latter's property as well, by sending Niels Lassen to Governor Houtcooper of <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> with an alleged copy of his instructions and a demand for the delivery of the goods. But neither this nor subsequent attempts availed the crafty governor. Instead of seeking redress through diplomatic channels, as his masters expected him to do, he authorized Captain Delicaet to take the company's ship Charlotte Amalie (named after Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel), find the skipper who had transported the goods and make his ship lawful prize. It was to avoid just this sort of complication that Esmit had been displaced. But Milan was an exponent of direct action, he sought advice from none, and the council dared not oppose his will.|$|E
25|$|Young {{was back}} in active service during the American War of Independence, with the {{important}} posting {{as commander in chief}} of the Leeward Islands station. He acted to secure British trade from American warships and privateers, but was less successful at intercepting supplies of weapons and gunpowder being provided to the American rebels by the nominally neutral Dutch and French possessions in the Caribbean. His frustration mounted, especially after the Dutch island of <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> fired the first salute to the American flag in 1776. He left the post in 1778, returning to England, where he entered retirement and died in 1789. He left a family, including two sons, William and James, who also became prominent naval officers.|$|E
25|$|Six {{territories of}} the Netherlands — {{all of which}} are Caribbean islands — have OCT status. As such, they benefit from being able to have their own export and import policy to and from the EU, while still having access to receive various EU funds (i.e. from the European Development Fund). The {{inhabitants}} of the islands are EU citizens owing to their Dutch citizenship, with the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Initially they did not have voting rights for such elections, but the European Court of Justice granted them such rights, when they ruled their exclusion from the franchise was contrary to EU law, as all other Dutch citizens resident outside the EU did have the right to vote. None of the islands use the euro as their currency. The US dollar is used on Bonaire, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and Saba, while Curaçao and St. Maarten utilize their own shared currency the Antillean guilder, and finally the currency of Aruba is the Aruban florin.|$|E
500|$|As Hurricane Dean {{approached}} the Lesser Antilles the local meteorological services issued watches and warnings, advising residents {{to prepare for}} the storm.

2500|$|Young's anger {{with the}} Dutch at <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> was further {{provoked}} when the American brig Andrew Doria entered the Dutch port on 16 November 1776 and {{was greeted with}} an 11-gun salute by the guns of Fort Orange, the first foreign salute to {{the flag of the}} United States. Young wrote a furious letter to the governor, Johannes de Graaff, informing him of his surprise and astonishment to hear it daily asserted in the most positive manner that the Port of <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> for some time past has been openly and avowedly declared Protector of all Americans and their vessels, whether in private trade or armed for offensive war. ... the colours and forts of the States General have been so far debased as to return the salute of these pirates and rebels and giving all manner of assistance of arms and ammunition and whatever else may enable them to annoy and disturb the trade of His Britannic Majesty's loyal and faithful subjects and even the Governor of <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> daily suffers privateers to be manned and armed and fitted in their port.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February 1781 Surprize and [...] (Commander Francis Pender), which Admiral Lord Rodney {{had sent}} from <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> {{appeared}} at Demerara.

Lieutenant George Augustus Keppel, a Rodney protege, [...] received his commission as Commander of Americain/Germaine on 14 February; the Admiralty confirmed the appointment in December. Germaine was fitted out at Jamaica on 23 February.|$|E
2500|$|In Puerto Rico, Vera {{was quick}} to change his story: he {{was the victim of}} the pirates, {{captured}} in the boat Antonia, which was petty and forced to serve as Almeida's ship. He also betrayed his comrades, in proceedings brought by the authorities to decide on the prize [...] "Don Jose Vera, a resident of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Practical Sea" [...] requested [...] "to have full credit of the brig called Pichincha arrested in the harbor of <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> by that Portuguese will see and also several free blacks and slaves." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 February 1777, Camilla and , Captain George Keith Elphinstone, {{captured}} the 170-ton snow, Adventure.

Camilla fired eleven shots before Adventure would stop. Perseus and Camilla shared the prize money. Eight days latter, Camilla captured Ranger, William Davies, Master, which was sailing in ballast from St. Lucia. Fanny, Adventure, and Ranger were all condemned and sold at Antigua.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{arrived at}} Nevis, Berry decided on blockading French held Saint Kitts on 17 April.

On 18 May the combined force headed toward Nevis.|$|E
2500|$|In the Caribbean, {{there were}} at one point Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in various other Dutch- and English-controlled islands, such as Jamaica, St. Thomas, Barbados, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and Nevis. [...] With the {{elimination}} of the Inquisition after the Spanish American wars of independence, which many Caribbean Sephardim had supported, many of these communities declined as Jews took advantage of their new-found freedom to move to the mainland, where there were better economic opportunities. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras, among others, received numbers of Sephardim. Within a couple of generations, these immigrants mostly converted to Catholicism in order to better integrate into society. [...] Only in Panama and Suriname did viable communities endure on the Central- and South-American mainland. In the 21st century among the Caribbean islands, only Curaçao and Jamaica still have communities of Spanish and Portuguese Jews.|$|E
2500|$|Young was {{advanced}} to flag rank {{towards the end}} of the Seven Years' War, being promoted to rear-admiral on 21 October 1762. Further promotions followed, he attained the rank of vice-admiral on 28 October 1770, and became commander-in-chief in the Leeward Islands Station in April 1775. He raised his flag aboard the 50-gun [...] and sailed to take up his post on 26 April. The American War of Independence broke out during Young's time in command, and he was tasked with using his small naval force to interdict the supply of arms and gunpowder to rebel forces, and to defend British trade from American privateers and warships. He struggled to combat the delivery of weapons to the Americans. His squadron had too few fast cruisers, and the Americans were being openly supplied from the neutral Caribbean possessions, from the Dutch-held <b>St</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and the French at Martinique. Frustrated, Young himself denounced the [...] "very pernicious traffic carried on between his Britannic majesty's rebellious subjects ... and ... St. Eustatias." [...] He was more successful though in ensuring British commerce remained secure, organizing convoy systems by mid-1776 to escort merchant ships to Britain, and cruising with some success against American privateers and warships. His squadron captured 205 American merchant ships and captured or destroyed seventeen American privateers and warships.|$|E

50|$|<b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> a Dutch-controlled {{island in}} the West Indies, was an {{entrepot}} that operated as a major trading centre despite its relatively small size. During the American War of Independence it assumed increased importance, because a British blockade {{made it difficult to}} transport supplies directly across the Atlantic Ocean to US ports. <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> became a crucial source of supplies, and its harbour was filled with American trading ships. Its importance increased further following France's entry into the war in 1778 as it was used to help supply the French West Indian islands. It is estimated that one half of all the American Revolutionary military supplies were trans-shipped through <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius.</b> Its merchant networks - Dutch, but also British (!) via St. Kitts and especially Bermuda and also Jewish, many of whom were <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> residents - were key to the military supplies and goods being shipped to the revolutionary forces. US-European communications were directed through <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius.</b> In 1776, <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius,</b> hence the Dutch, were the first to recognize the American Revolutionary government when the US brig, Andrew Doria, fired thirteen guns announcing their arrival. The Andrew Doria was saluted with an eleven gun response from Fort Orange. The Andrew Doria arrived to purchase military supplies on <b>St.</b> <b>Eustatius</b> and to present to the Dutch governor a copy of the US Declaration of Independence. An earlier copy of the Declaration had been captured by a British naval ship. The British were confused by the papers wrapped around the declaration, which they thought were a secret cypher. The papers were written in Yiddish for a merchant in Holland.|$|E
