5|$|A major <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> {{the study}} of {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria.

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1991–92 season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and {{replaced}} by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself. While the Rockets {{did not make the}} playoffs, Tomjanovich's arrival was considered a <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> <b>In</b> the next year, the Rockets improved their record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E

5|$|While Kilburn led one {{design team}} working on Meg, he led another with Dick Grimsdale and Douglas Webb, on a {{research}} project examining what he believed {{would be the next}} <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> computer design: the use of transistors. The 48-bit machine they completed in November 1953 was the world's first transistor computer, with 550 diodes and 92 transistors, and was manufactured by STC. An improved version completed in April 1955 had 1,300 diodes and 200 transistors, and was sold by Metropolitan-Vickers as the Metrovick 950.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as a major <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> subway technology, although questions were asked concerning {{the safety of the}} system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E
5|$|Ruggiero di Lauria {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia {{shipyard}} on 3 August 1881 and launched on 9 August 1884. She was not completed for another {{three and a half}} years, her construction finally being finished on 1 February 1888. Because of the rapid pace of naval technological development in the late 19th century, her lengthy construction period meant that she was an obsolete design by the time she entered service. The year after she entered service, the British began building the , the first pre-dreadnought battleships, which marked a significant <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> capital ship design. In addition, technological progress, particularly in armor production techniquesfirst Harvey armor and then Krupp armorrapidly rendered older vessels like Ruggiero di Lauria obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit was a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{generally}} {{performed well}} {{at the end of}} the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to a doubling of prices. Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement of bell and surface mining to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century. Lead mining increased, and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and coal production declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless, some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.|$|E
