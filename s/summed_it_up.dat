The two [...] "weren't disappointed."

500|$|Arsenal were by {{no means}} the only team to have come up with the idea of {{dropping}} the centre half into defence – Newcastle United beat Arsenal 7–0 that season employing such a system with Charlie Spencer at centre-half; Queen's Park and Tottenham Hotspur had also adopted similar systems. Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence.

500|$|After Bryant and Scott {{departed}} the project, director Philip Kaufman {{tried to}} re-write the story, with the resulting treatment heavily inspired by Olaf Stapledon's books Last and First Men and Star Maker. He later described this version as being [...] "less 'cult-ish' {{and more of}} an adult movie, dealing with sexuality and wonders rather than oddness". He intended this version to feature Spock facing off against a Klingon nemesis, A role for whom Kaufman wanted Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Kaufman explained {{that it would have}} featured the two undergoing a psychedelic experience and <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> by saying that [...] "I'm sure the fans would have been upset, but I felt it could really open up a new type of science fiction."

Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave the episode two out of four, said that there was nothing exciting in [...] "Marauders" [...] and that the action sequences towards the end were unrealistic because despite all the apparent violence, not a single person even gets injured during the scene. He called the general premise [...] "classic trek", but that it lacked depth and didn't pose any interesting questions.

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] for Tor.com, and {{admitted}} that he hadn't seen the episode since the original broadcast. He said that it was a [...] "trainwreck" [...] and even worse than he remembered, because other shows such as [...] and Stargate SG-1 had since done much better clip shows. DeCandido <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> by saying that [...] "In all honesty, they’d have been better off doing one fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike anyhow — and upping the budget on one of the other 21. Just an awful, awful episode." [...] He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten. Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V.

500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> saying [...] "We've seen all of this before, and it was barely interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was not sure what the reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E

She <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> by saying that the two episodes were [...] "no means perfect episodes, but they're reaching very earnestly for what Star Trek was in the beginning". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] said that while there were plot holes in the story, and that elements were clumsy such as the showdown towards the end, the overall story was [...] "sound". He said that the episode was a [...] "much more satisfying as a send-off for the Enterprise crew" [...] than [...] "These Are the Voyages...".

In the season six review by Dreamwatch, [...] "Tsunkatse" [...] was given a rating of three out of five. The fight scenes in the episode were reviewed by Robert W. Young for Black Belt magazine. Young described it as being [...] "uncharacteristically cool from a martial arts perspective" [...] and that [...] "it was nice to see a value-judgement-free depiction of no-holds-barred competition on such a respected TV series." [...] He thought that the combat itself was believable and that Seven may have been using moves taken from Jeet Kune Do, a style founded by Bruce Lee.

500|$|The musical {{received}} {{moderate to}} poor reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times termed it [...] "a pleasant, lazy romance... Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein {{in a minor}} key".

[...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing."

Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the Strokes as [...] "a great groove band", and noted that [...] "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity". In a perfect 10 review, NME reviewer John Robinson indicated that Is This It {{was one of the}} best debut LPs by a guitar band during the past 20years. In contrast, Jon Monks of Stylus commented that its shallowness prevents it from ever being called a [...] "classic". In his favorable A– review, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly conceded that he did not know whether the Strokes would have a long-term impact, but noted that, at the time, the record [...] "just feels right, and sometimes that's enough".|$|E

500|$|And {{yet despite}} his {{formidable}} record and undoubted {{importance in the}} history of technology, Evans never became a household name. In this respect Evans was his own worst enemy. He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work, and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme, prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times {{over the course of his}} life. In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force people to pay him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies. A leading Philadelphia merchant <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in 1802, stating [...] "few if any [...] are inclined to give pompous blockhead, Oliver Evans, the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents." ...|$|E

Kevin McDonough of the Illinois Daily Journal criticized some of the writing, but <b>summed</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as [...] "an ambitious cartoon" [...] for both younger and older audiences. Jason Bree of the website Agents of Geek called the miniseries [...] "the greatest thing Cartoon Network has ever produced". Kevin Johnson, writing for The A.V. Club, praised the series, giving it an A, saying that [...] "with such a perfect blend of mood, atmosphere, story, and characterization, Over the Garden Walls 10-episode run will leave you wanting more, but like every great fairy tale, it's a story that knows when it's over." ...|$|E

She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas".
