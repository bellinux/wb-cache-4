5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great {{attention}} to his estate around Busseto, purchasing additional land, dealing with unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) stewards, installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic <b>slumps.</b> In 1867, both Verdi's father Carlo, {{with whom he had}} restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo's great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, as their own child. She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi's friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually the heirs of Verdi's estate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>slumped</b> {{concrete}} takes various {{shapes and}} according to the profile of <b>slumped</b> concrete, the <b>slump</b> is termed as true <b>slump,</b> shear <b>slump</b> or collapse <b>slump.</b> If a shear or collapse <b>slump</b> is achieved, a fresh sample should be taken and the test repeated. A collapse <b>slump</b> is an indication that the mix is too wet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slumping</b> is {{a process}} that can occur to any context in the archaeological record and not just fills. <b>Slumping</b> {{represents}} how a context's deposition morphology may deform from its original position by natural settling action. This is readily apparent with fills which have a tendency to settle radically over time. This settling is termed <b>slumping</b> and has a bearing on the excavation of cut features. As fills <b>slump</b> the overlying layers which seal the feature will <b>slump</b> in sympathy creating false impressions of fills below the lip of the cut and introduce the possibility of contaminated dating evidence into the features excavation. (See archaeological section in fig 1). also the degree of <b>slumping</b> of the primary fills compared to the <b>slumping</b> of overlying sealing layers is a possible measure of time differences between the formation of the fills the overlying sequence. This is because sealing layers laid down over a <b>slumping</b> feature with the intent of leveling the area for a specific purpose such as construction will either conform to the <b>slumped</b> fills as though the <b>slump</b> has occurred {{at the time of the}} sealing layers formation. Or the sealing layers will not take into account the <b>slumping</b> because the <b>slumping</b> is yet to occur. This can lead to sympathetic <b>slumping</b> up the sequence of other features including later structures.|$|R
25|$|Only a true <b>slump</b> is of any {{use in the}} test. A {{collapse}} <b>slump</b> {{will generally}} mean that the mix is too wet or {{that it is a}} high workability mix, for which the <b>slump</b> test is not appropriate. Very dry mixes having <b>slump</b> 0 – 25mm are typically used in road making, low workability mixes having <b>slump</b> 10 – 40mm are typically used for foundations with light reinforcement, medium workability mixes with <b>slump</b> 50 – 90mm, are typically used for normal reinforced concrete placed with vibration, high workability concrete with <b>slump</b> > 100mm is typically used where reinforcing has tight spacing, and/or the concrete has to flow a great distance.|$|R
5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body <b>slumps</b> in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his first}} {{practice}} with Al-Nasr, Owumi became nauseated from food poisoning and was hospitalized. He {{moved into a}} luxurious apartment {{in the center of}} Benghazi owned by Mutassim Gaddafi. Initially unaware, he later saw pictures of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family across the building and learned that Al-Nasr was owned by the Gaddafi family. Owumi began playing with Al-Nasr during a three-game losing streak, and his Libyan teammates had bruises and scratches, as they were beaten by security during such <b>slumps.</b> The team received millions of dollars in funding from the Gaddafi family and its home arena had been the site of Gaddafi's first public execution.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous <b>slumps</b> along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{determining}} <b>slump</b> {{is to use}} an automated <b>slump</b> meter.

5|$|Dragon Ball was loosely {{modeled on}} the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Torishima said he chose it largely {{because it was a}} free {{intellectual}} property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr. <b>Slumps</b> West Coast of the United States feel. While the characters in Journey to the West travel to collect sacred scrolls, Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shōnen magazine audience. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought the story would last about a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience.|$|E
5|$|Karthik was {{the regular}} wicket-keeper in Tests, making rare {{appearances}} in ODIs. During this period, Karthik struggled and averaged less than 20 with the bat, {{and he was}} replaced as Test wicketkeeper by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who had been prolific and destructive with the bat in ODIs, in late 2005. After donning the mantle of an opener for Tamil Nadu and raising himself to the standard of a specialist batsman at domestic level, he was recalled to the national squad as a batsman in late-2006 after injuries and form <b>slumps</b> hit other batsmen, playing occasional matches in both forms of cricket on the tour to South Africa, and scoring a half-century in a Test as an opener. Following India's elimination from {{the first round of}} the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the selectors made multiple changes, and Karthik became a non-wicket-keeping opening batsman in the Test team and regularly played ODIs, batting in the middle order.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either <b>slumps</b> or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, the <b>slump</b> {{test has}} been used to measure {{concrete}} consistency. However, many researchers contend that the <b>slump</b> alone is not a sufficient measure of consistency and that other quantifiable rheological properties such as shear yield stress and plastic viscosity are more representative and should be considered. A <b>SLump</b> Rate Machine (SLRM) was adapted and calibrated, to consistently measure the plastic properties for a number of concrete mixes, namely <b>slump</b> rate and <b>slump</b> flow. Furthermore, a theoretical model was developed to correlate the <b>slump</b> flow and <b>slump</b> rate with the shear yield stress and plastic viscosity of fresh concrete, respectively. Employing the SLRM and the theoretical model has resulted in an efficient new approach to adequately predict the rheological behaviour of fresh concrete as well as to provide reasonably accurate values for shear yield stress and plastic viscosity.

25|$|Olympus Mons is {{asymmetrical}} structurally {{as well as}} topographically. The longer, more shallow northwestern flank displays extensional features, such {{as large}} <b>slumps</b> and normal faults. In contrast, the volcano's steeper southeastern side has features indicating compression. They include step-like terraces in the volcano's mid-flank region (interpreted as thrust faults) {{and a number of}} wrinkle ridges located at the basal escarpment. Why opposite sides of the mountain should show different styles of deformation is puzzling. The answer may lie in understanding how large shield volcanoes grow laterally and on how variations within the substrate of the volcano affect the final shape of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|Economists posit that {{commodity}} prices are the dominant {{driver of the}} Australian dollar, and this means changes in exchange rates of the Australian dollar occur in ways opposite to many other currencies. For decades, Australia's balance of trade has depended primarily upon commodity exports such as minerals and agricultural products. This means the Australian dollar varies significantly during the business cycle, rallying during global booms as Australia exports raw materials, and falling during recessions as mineral prices slump or when domestic spending overshadows the export earnings outlook. This movement is {{in the opposite direction}} to other reserve currencies, which tend to be stronger during market <b>slumps</b> as traders move value from falling stocks into cash.|$|E
25|$|An east-west {{geological}} fault {{just north}} of the summit has brought these two rather different rock groups side by side. To the north, including White Pike, much of Threlkeld Common and the margins of Threlkeld Knotts are rocks of the Buttermere Formation, part of the Skiddaw Group. Mudstones, siltstones and sandstones which had been deposited in deep water on the northern margin of an ancient continent (Avalonia) in the early Ordovician Period were chaotically disrupted by a huge undersea avalanche to form an olistostrome deposit in which blocks of rock are now embedded in a matrix of mudstone, and intensely deformed by minor folds, <b>slumps</b> and shears. This event can be dated to about 460 million years ago.|$|E
30|$|The <b>slump</b> folding {{suggests}} that the sediment experienced soft-sediment deformation. The glide plane is a dislocation in the sedimentary structure or bedding, which suggest internal soft-sediment deformation.
