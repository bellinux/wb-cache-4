5000|$|Many {{problems}} associated with drug abuse {{are the result of}} legitimately-manufactured controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into the illicit drug traffic. Many of the analgesics, depressants and stimulants manufactured for legitimate medical use can often carry potential for dependence or abuse. Therefore, those <b>scheduled</b> <b>substances</b> have been brought under legal control for prevention and population safety. The goal of controls is to ensure that these [...] "controlled substances" [...] are readily available for medical use, while preventing their distribution for illicit distribution and non-medical use. This can be a difficult task, sometimes providing difficulty for legitimate patients and healthcare providers while circumventing illegal trade and consumption of scheduled drugs.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} this {{definition}} conduct, in order to constitute administrative action as defined, {{has to have a}} direct, external legal effect and has to adversely affect rights of the individual or a group. On the face of it, {{it would appear that the}} definition of administrative action in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act limits the scope of administrative action in section 33 of the Constitution. Whether such limitation conforms to the requirements of the limitation clause in section 36 of the Constitution and thus passes muster, does not call for determination in these proceedings. From this definition, the following elements of the term administrative action emerge, namely:* a decision* that is of an administrative nature* made in terms of the empowering provision* that is not specifically excluded by the Act* that adversely affects rights and* that has a direct, external legal effect.For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to be subject to review in terms of section 6 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act it has to embody all the elements enumerated in the preceding paragraph failing which the conduct complained of cannot be subject to review in terms of the Promotion of Just Administrative Act. If the conduct of the Pricing Committee does not fall within the ambit of the definition of administrative action contained in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, the issue which will then call for determination is whether the conduct of the Pricing Committee is beyond judicial review. All these issues will be determined in the course of this judgment. To revert to the Pricing Committee, it will be recalled that it is a committee that was appointed and established in terms of section 22G(1) of the Act. Its mandate was to formulate recommendations which, if accepted, would enable the first respondent to make regulations relating to the introduction of a transparent pricing system for all medicines and <b>Scheduled</b> <b>substances</b> sold in the Republic and, on an appropriate dispensing fee to be charged by a pharmacist or by a person licensed in terms of section 22G(1)(a) of the Act. In line with its mandate the committee did formulate the required recommendations which it submitted to the first respondent for acceptance. It was for the first respondent to either accept or reject the recommendations as formulated. It is these recommendations which are the subject of a challenge by the applicants on the basis that the conduct of the Pricing Committee, in going about fulfilling its functions in the formulation of the recommendations, constitutes an administrative action within the meaning of the term as contemplated in section 1 of the Promotion of Just Administrative Act.For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to constitute an administrative action within the meaning of that term in terms of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, not only should it fall within the ambit of that definition, but, at the very least, it will have to contain those elements I have set out in paragraph 35 of this judgment. The most important of these elements are, in my view, that the recommendations should adversely affect rights and should have a direct external legal effect. I venture to suggest at this stage that such conduct or action should affect the rights of the person concerned directly rather than indirectly. Once the recommendations were formulated and submitted to the first respondent for acceptance, at that stage, that is prior to acceptance thereof by the first respondent, they did not affect any one of the applicants' existing rights or legitimate expectations directly. Such recommendations did not have any force or effect on any one of the applicants. These were mere recommendations. They were not binding on the applicants and thus could not be construed as having had any direct, external legal effect. The applicants did not feel any effect of the recommendations.The recommendations, prior to the acceptance thereof by the first respondent, did not impose any burden on the applicants nor did they, at that stage, remove rights from any one of the applicants. Even if one were to accept that the Pricing Committee is an organ of state, in my view, it can hardly be conceivable that the formulation of the recommendations which can only have a final effect once promulgated into regulation could be said to constitute exercise of public power. The direct, legal effect contemplated in the definition of administrative action cannot be conditional, in the sense of pending acceptance by the first respondent. In my view, and on the grounds set out in this and the preceding paragraph alone, the conduct and the activities of the Pricing Committee can hardly be construed as constituting an administrative action nor do such activities fall within the ambit of the definition of administrative action as defined in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. Furthermore, for the activities of the Pricing Committee to constitute administrative action, such conduct, in terms of the definition of administrative action, should have, in as far as the applicants are concerned, a [...] "direct legal effect." [...] For any action to have a direct effect, it obviously must affect the person concerned directly rather than indirectly. Some writers, in particular, de Ville are of the view that direct effect requires finality in the administration of rights, which would exclude preliminary steps in multi-staged decisions. This would include the making of reports prior to decisions and any conduct preparatory to the taking of a decision. As regards the term legal effect, what this in my view would entail to is that the administrative action or decision must be a legally binding determination of individual rights. In other words, the recommendations, to constitute an administrative action, must either establish, change or withdraw existing rights. The recommendations of the Committee do not have any of these attributes. The principles of administrative justice apply to administrative action only and the Committee's recommendations fall short of this.To the extent that the applicants seek to have the recommendations to be reviewed and set aside in terms of the provisions of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, the applicants' challenge on this ground cannot succeed for the simple reason that the conduct of the Committee, culminating in the recommendations, does not constitute an administrative action within the meaning of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act.|$|E
40|$|Halon 1301 and 1211 {{are listed}} as <b>scheduled</b> <b>substances</b> in the 1987 Montreal Protocol because they are serious ozone destroyers. The Ozone Layer Protection Ordinance Cap. 403 was enacted in July 1989 to fulfil Hong Kong's {{international}} obligations.

Currently available alternatives to halon 1301 and 1211 are reviewed in this paper. A dimensionless cost model is developed to facilitate cost evaluation for the different replacements of halon 1301. Fire suppression effectiveness of halocarbon agents listed in NFPA 2001 are assessed, using a theoretical approach. Comparisons between the common alternatives are also made in terms of the environmental impact, health and safety, extinguishing effectiveness, and cost. Results from two case studies indicate that the life span and the age of buildings and fire protection systems significantly impact total cost. Elaborate strategies based on real situations may lead to considerable savings and benefits and accelerate the process of phasing out the halons. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of ‘legal highs’ or ‘new psychoactive substances’ (NPS) on the Irish market is reflective of their appearance in many countries, with some notable exceptions. The official {{response to the}} situation is examined here by looking at Irish controlled drugs legislation and drug enforcement policies as enacted {{in recent years and}} their effects on academic research on NPS. The philosophy and practice of outright bans of <b>scheduled</b> <b>substances</b> has not been effective in delivering the stated aims of illicit drug control, namely harm reduction. With these legislative changes, we have witnessed the removal of the ‘legitimate’ sale and open marketing of a number of NPS to the general public in commercial retail premises. However, as legislation was enacted, suppliers and vendors rapidly changed the contents of their legal high products from now controlled to non-controlled substances. We have found that it is administratively challenging to perform scientific research on controlled substances at academic institutions. It is desirable to gather analytical, pharmacological, and toxicological data on these substances as they emerge on the market but due to the restrictive nature of licensing requirements, once a substance or generic class of substances is controlled, this becomes more difficult. The facts that any quantity of substance, no matter how small, is controlled, the nomenclature used to describe compounds is not consistent within the enacted legislation and the use of catch-all classes of compounds with the intention of controlling many similar molecular structures, all create problematic issues for academic researchers...|$|E
