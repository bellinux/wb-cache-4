500|$|In Brideshead, the proletarian junior officer Hooper {{illustrates}} {{a theme that}} persists in Waugh's postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the [...] "Age of the Common Man". In the trilogy Sword of Honour [...] (Men at Arms, 1952; Officers and Gentlemen, 1955, Unconditional Surrender, 1961) the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character [...] "Trimmer", a <b>sloven</b> and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella [...] "Scott-King's Modern Europe" [...] (1947), Waugh's pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster's admonition: [...] "I {{think it would be}} very wicked, indeed, to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world". Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel Love Among the Ruins (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought-after of the government's social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that [...] The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957) stands out ″a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a game″. Waugh's final work of fiction, [...] "Basil Seal Rides Again" [...] (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a ″senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth″. Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, ″The Balance" [...] of 1926, with a [...] "fusillade of unattributed dialogue".|$|E
2500|$|The first written {{mention of}} name Slovakia is in 1586 (...) [...] It {{derives from the}} Czech word Slováky; {{previous}} German forms were Windischen landen and Windenland (the 15th century). The native name Slovensko (1791) derives from an older name of Slovaks <b>Sloven</b> what may indicate its origin before the 15th century. The original meaning was geographic (not political), since Slovakia {{was a part of}} the multiethnic Kingdom of Hungary and did not form a separate administrative unit in this period.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by ENGEO Limited and KiwiRail Holdings Limited {{to assess the}} stability of <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct (specifically its western abutment) and a 3 km section of rail corridor between <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct and Avoca on the Midland Line (MDL). Commonly known as the scenic TranzAlpine rail journey (through Arthurs Pass National Park) the MDL connects Greymouth to Christchurch via Rolleston, where the MDL meets the Main South Line into Christchurch. The project area is approximately 40 km southeast of Arthurs Pass Township, in the eastern extension of the Castle Hill Basin {{which is part of}} the Waimakariri Catchment and Canterbury Foothills. The field area is underlain by Rakaia Terrane, {{which is part of the}} Torlesse Composite Terrane forming the basement rock unit for the field area. Cretaceous-Tertiary rocks of the Castle Hill Basin overlie the basement strata and record a transgression-regression sequence, as well as mid-Oligocene submarine volcanism. The stratigraphic sequence in the Castle Hill Basin, and its eastern extension to Avoca, comprises two formations of the Eyre group, the older Broken River Formation and the younger Iron Creek Formation. Deep marine Porter Group limestones, marls, and tuffs of Oligocene age succeed the Iron Creek Formation of the Eyre Group, and probably records the maximum of the transgression. The Enys Formation lies disconformably on the Porter Group and is overlain unconformably by Late Pleistocene glacifluvial and glacial deposits. The Tertiary strata in the Slovens-Avoca rail corridor are weak, and the clay-rich tuff derived from mid-Oligocene volcanism is particularly prone to slaking. Extensive mapping carried out for this project has identified that some 90 percent of the surface along the length of the Slovens-Avoca corridor has been subject to mass movement. The landslides of the Slovens-Avoca rail corridor are clearly younger than the Last Glaciation, and <b>Slovens</b> Creek has been downcutting, with associated faulting and uplift, to form the present day geomorphology of the rail corridor. Deep-seated landslides in the rail corridor extend to <b>Slovens</b> Creek, locally deflecting the stream course, and a generic ground failure model for the rail corridor has been developed. Exploratory geotechnical investigations, including core drilling, installation of an inclinometer and a piezometer, enabled the construction of a simple ground model and cross section for the <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct western abutment. Limit-equilibrium and pseudo-static slope stability analyses using both circular and block critical slip surface search methods were applied to the ground model for the western abutment of <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct. Piezometric and strength data obtained during laboratory testing of core material have been used to constrain the western abutment stability assessment for one representative section line (C-C’). Prior to pseudo-static sensitivity analyses peak ground acceleration (PGA) for various Ultimate Limit State (ULS) design return periods, defined by an equation given in NZS 1170. 5 : 2004, were calculated and have been used as a calibration technique to find and compare specific PGA values for pseudo-static analyses in the <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct area. The main purpose has been to provide an indication of how railway infrastructure could be affected by seismic events of various return periods defined by ULS design standards for the area. Limit equilibrium circular slip surface search methods, both grid search and auto refine search, indicated the slope is stable with a FoS greater than 1. 0 returned from each, although one particular surface returned the lowest FoS in each. This surface is in the lower portion of the slope, adjacent to <b>Slovens</b> Stream and northeast of the MDL. As expected, pseudo-static analyses returned a lower FoS overall when compared to limit equilibrium analyses. The PGA analyses suggest that partial ground failure at the <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct western abutment could occur in a 1 in 25 -year return period event within materials on the slower slope beyond the immediate rail corridor. A ULS (1 in 500 -year) event in the <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct area would likely produce a PGA of ~ 0. 9 g, and the effects on the western abutment and rail infrastructure would most likely be catastrophic. Observed ground conditions for the western abutment of the <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct suggest there is no movement within the landslide at depth within the monitoring timeframe of this project (22 May 2015 – 4 August 2015). Slope stability monitoring is recommended to be continued in two parts: (1) the inclinometer in BH 1 is to be monitored on a six monthly basis for one year following completion of this thesis, and then annually unless ground movements become evident; and (2) surface movement monitoring should be installed using a fixed datum on the stable eastern abutment. Long-term stability management strategies for the <b>Slovens</b> Creek Viaduct western abutment are dependent upon future observed changes and ongoing monitoring. Hazard and risk assessment using the KiwiRail Qualitative Risk Assessment Framework (QRA) is recommended, and if slope stability becomes problematic for operation of the Midland Line consideration should be given to deep slope drainage. In the event of a large magnitude or high PGA earthquake all monitoring should be reviewed...|$|R

The earliest major manuscript {{with information on}} Rus' history, the Primary Chronicle, dates from the late 11th and early 12th centuries. It lists twelve Slavic tribal unions which, by the 10th century, had settled in the later territory of the Kievan Rus between the Western Bug, the Dniepr and the Black Sea: the Polans, Drevlyans, Dregovichs, Radimichs, Vyatichs, Krivichs, <b>Slovens,</b> Dulebes (later known as Volhynians and Buzhans), White Croats, Severians, Ulichs, and Tivertsi.|$|R

When the new officials came it would cease; it would pass away like a dream in the night; and the solid Pax Romana, of the Berlin General Act would succeed. After all, what was there to complain of? The Consuls had shown themselves no <b>slovens</b> and no sentimentalists. They had shown themselves not very particular, but in one sense very thorough. Rebellion was to be put down swiftly and rigorously, if need were with the hand of Cromwell; at least it was to be put down. And in these unruly islands I was prepared almost to welcome the face of Rhadamanthine severity.|$|R
5000|$|The root of many tribal names {{denotes the}} {{territory}} which they inhabited, {{such as the}} Milczanie (who lived in areas with měl - loess), Moravians (along the Morava), Diokletians (near the former Roman city of Doclea) and Severiani (northerners). Other names have more general meanings, such as the Polanes(pola; field) and Drevlyans (drevo; tree). Others {{appear to have a}} non-Slavic (possibly Iranian) root, such as the Antes, Serbs and Croats. Some geographically-distant tribes appear to share names. The Dregoviti appear north of the Pripyat River and in the Vardar valley, the Croats in Galicia and northern Dalmatia and the Obodrites near Lübeck and their further south in Pannonia. Four groups retained the root Slav in their names: the Slovenes, Slovaks, Slavonians and the historical east-Slavic <b>Slovens.</b> There is little evidence of migratory links between tribes sharing the same name. The common names may reflect names given the tribes by historians or a common tongue as a distinction between Slavs (slovo; word, letter) and others; Nemci (mutes) is a Slavic name for [...] "Germans".

50|$|After the war, Kvaternik {{entered into}} {{service of the}} Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and <b>Slovens,</b> but was {{immediately}} retired in 1919 as a major. During his retirement, he dedicated himself to politics and he became active in the Croatian Worker (Hrvatski radiša), an association {{of which he was}} a director in Zagreb. During the April War, the German invasion on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, on 10 April 1941, his brother Slavko told him to go to Crikvenica to proclaim the independence and organize a takeover, as the NDH was established that day. Moreover, Kvaternik got an order from his brother to take over the North Naval Sector, which was, at the time, {{under the control of the}} Yugoslav Navy. Yugoslav commander of the sector, captain Mirko Pleiweiss, formed a detachment of sailors from Selce and arrested Kvaternik in a post in Crikvenica, along with his associates. In the night between 10 and 11 April, Kvaternik was killed during the prisoners' transfer to the municipal building, when he tried to grab lieutenant Perkačević, a commander of sailors who guarded the prisoners, but Kvaternik was shot through an eye. Dr. Hajdin, a local official who informed Pleiweiss about Kvaternik's actions, was also killed.|$|R
60|$|Hence, {{delightful}} {{and inspiring}} {{as it is}} to read this story of diligent and discriminating cultivation, of accurate truth and real erudition and beauty, not vaguely but methodically interpreted, one has some of the sensations of the moral and intellectual hothouse. Mental hygiene is apt to lead to mental valetudinarianism. 'The ignorant journalist,' may be left to the torment which George Eliot wished that she could inflict on one of those literary <b>slovens</b> whose manuscripts bring even the most philosophic editor to the point of exasperation: 'I should like to stick red-hot skewers through the writer, whose style is as sprawling as his handwriting.' By all means. But much that even the most sympathetic reader finds repellent in George Eliot's later work might perhaps never have been, if Mr. Lewes had not practised with more than Russian rigour a censorship of the press and the post-office which kept every disagreeable whisper scrupulously from her ear. To stop every draft with sandbags, screens, and curtains, and to limit one's exercise to a drive in a well-warmed brougham with the windows drawn up, may save a few annoying colds in the head, but {{the end of the process}} will be the manufacture of an invalid.|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{adjutant}} was promoted, and Cottar rejoiced with him, for {{he admired}} the adjutant greatly, and marvelled {{who might be}} big enough to fill his place; so that he nearly collapsed when the mantle fell on his own shoulders, and the colonel said a few sweet things that made him blush. An adjutant's position does not differ materially from that of head of the school, and Cottar stood in the same relation to the colonel as he had to his old Head in England. Only, tempers wear out in hot weather, and things were said and done that tried him sorely, and he made glorious blunders, from which the regimental sergeant-major pulled him with a loyal soul and a shut mouth. <b>Slovens</b> and incompetents raged against him; the weak-minded strove to lure him from the ways of justice; the small-minded--yea, men whom Cottar believed would never do [...] "things no fellow can do"--imputed motives mean and circuitous to actions {{that he had not}} spent a thought upon; and he tasted injustice, and it made him very sick.

Many times he deserted her for manlier joys, but though she was out of sight he could not forget her longing face, and soon he sneaked off to her; he upbraided her, but he stayed with her. They bore with him for a time, but when they discovered that she had persuaded him (after prayer) to put back the spug's eggs which he had brought home in triumph, then they drove him from their company, {{and for a long time}} afterwards his deadly enemy was the hard-hitting Corp Shiach.|$|R

The Committee for Foreign Affairs were such <b>slovens,</b> and stunk so abominably, that no muscadin ambassador of the smallest degree of delicacy of nerves could come within ten yards of them; but now they are so powdered, and perfumed, and ribanded, and sashed, and plumed, that, though they are grown infinitely more insolent in their fine clothes even than they were in their rags, (and that was enough,) as they now appear, there is something in it more grand and noble, something more suitable to an awful Roman Senate receiving the homage of dependent tetrarchs. Like that Senate, (their perpetual model for conduct towards other nations,) they permit their vassals (during their good pleasure) to assume the name of kings, in order to bestow more dignity on the suite and retinue of the sovereign Republic by the nominal rank of their slaves: Ut habeant instrumenta servitutis et reges." [...] All this is very fine, undoubtedly; and ambassadors whose hands are almost out for want of employment may long to have their part in this august ceremony of the Republic one and indivisible.

That is why he considered it necessary to develop the cultural level of Croatian farmers. In december 1904, Antun together wirt his younger brother Stjepan (1871 – 1928) founded the Croatian Peoples Peasant Party (Hrvatska pučka seljačka stranka). The program of the party published in January 1905 called for general suffrage, state assistence for the peasants and cultural and economic development of the rural population in general. The HPSS {{took part in the}} election to the Croat autonomous Diet (Sabor) in 1905 and 1906, but both Antun and Stjepan had not been elected until the elections of 1910. During the Worl War I, Stjepan took active part in the Croatian liberation movement. He advocadet the unification of Serbe, Croats and Slovenes living in Austria-Hungary into one state. This plan was materialized in the end of the WWI, but after one month (on December 1, 1918), it was attached to Serbia. Stjepan Radić (after the death of Antun in 1919) became the respective leader of the Croat autonomist movement in the newly formed The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and <b>Slovens,</b> after 1929 officially named Yugoslavia.
