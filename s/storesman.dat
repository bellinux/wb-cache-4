25|$|The Supply (or Stores) Department is {{composed}} of a Supply (or Stores) Officer, sometimes assisted by a senior cadet, who is entitled to wear the crossed-keys badge of a <b>Storesman.</b> The Supply Department is responsible for all equipment belonging to the corps; however, Supply tends to be primarily concerned with issuing cadets uniforms and related gear - bands often deal with their own gear, as do competitive teams.|$|E
5000|$|Crowdy's {{unit was}} raised at Benedict, Maryland on December 19, 1863 when the United States Government offered {{compensation}} to his enslavers for his freedom to fight. During the Civil War the 19th Regiment USCT fought at the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864. Crowdy {{served as a}} laborer and supply <b>storesman,</b> and participated in the capture of a confederate flour wagon being smuggled into Petersburg, Virginia during the siege of Richmond. Crowdy remained in the Army after the war to become a Buffalo Soldier. He was promoted to quartermaster sergeant in the 5th Cavalry in 1867, receiving his discharge in 1872 [...] He later became a cook on the Santa Fe railroad.|$|E

50|$|Vehicle drivers wore boots without hobnails {{because they}} would damage the pedals and create sparks. This was {{extended}} to armored vehicle crews in the Royal Tank Regiment and Reconnaissance Corps in 1942, {{as well as to}} the crews of waterborne craft of the Royal Army Service Corps in 1943. Specialists and ammo <b>storesmen</b> were issued regular ammo boots with rubber heels and rubber crepe soles that lacked the hobnails and steel heel- and toe-plates. This was to avoid creating sparks near flammable or explosive stores (like gunpowder or gasoline). Commandos were issued them to make it easier for them to move silently.|$|R
40|$|From general {{images to}} {{individual}} features: managing {{lack of understanding}} and stereotypes in four low-status occupations Individuals shape an image {{of themselves and their}} surroundings in relation to how they assume that others regard them. In these situations occupation is essential. Categorizations, valuations and rewards associated with occupations are among the most fundamental instruments used for domination in the social world. Hence it is interesting to study how groups and individuals who experience low occupational status manage their social positions. This article, based upon interviews with workers in food industry, waitresses/waiters, <b>storesmen</b> and dustmen, analyzes how the interviewees handle low respect, here expressed as lack of understanding and stereotyping. Three different positions are distinguished, arguing that one of them implies a stronger identification with the occupation than do the other two, which to a greater extent agree with stereotyped images. In the first position, the workers disagree with stereotypes of low-status jobs as apathetic, heavy or simple, and assert that their occupation has specific values such as self-development, qualifications or advantage to society. In the second position, low recognition is avoided through little identification with the occupation. The interviewees separate themselves and who they are from their jobs, and find it ridiculous to speak about it in terms of self-development or qualifications when so many are able to do the job. In the third position, the interviewees emphasize that their own place of work is less heavy than the job in general. Through the third strategy their particular tasks are seen as exceptional and their identification with the occupation is local rather than embedded in a wider occupational identity.
