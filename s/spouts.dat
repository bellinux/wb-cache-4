40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of gas-particle <b>spout</b> fluidized {{bed in a}} pulsed <b>spouted</b> microwave-vacuum drying system (PSMVD) were investigated. The <b>spout</b> fluidization process in a pseudo- 2 -D <b>spout</b> fluidized bed was simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the inviscid two-fluid theory method (TFM) based on the kinetic theory of granular flow. The {{dynamic characteristics}} of the <b>spout</b> fluidized bed {{and the effect of}} <b>spout</b> elevation on the particle movement were revealed, which could be used to improve the uniformity of particle mixing and microwave heating. The mathematical model demonstrated that the <b>spout</b> fluidization process includes isolated, merged and transitional jets and the fluidization at a specific <b>spout</b> gas velocity has a start-up stage and a quasi-steady fluidization stage. The <b>spout</b> velocity was an important factor controlling particle status in the <b>spout</b> fluidized bed and a critical velocity was identified for effect transition of the flow pattern. There was an approximately linear correlation between the jet penetration depth and the <b>spout</b> velocity. When the <b>spout</b> gas velocity increased up to the critical velocity region, the pressure drop tended to convert from negative pressure to positive pressure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Spouted</b> {{bed with}} porous draft tube is an {{improved}} type of conventional <b>spouted</b> bed {{which is a}} special kind of fluidized bed. Hydrodynamic characteristics are vital to design and normal operating of <b>spouted</b> bed with porous draft tube, but less research has been carried out. Two key hydrodynamics factors including maximum <b>spouted</b> bed height and minimum <b>spouting</b> velocity were studied by a series of experiments. The effects and mechanisms of features of draft tube including diameter, installing position and hole opening ratio on hydrodynamics factors were analyzed. The results are of great value to the design and optimization of <b>spouted</b> bed with porous draft tube and broad the engineering application sphere of <b>spouted</b> bed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe flow {{behaviours}} of gas-solids were {{predicted by}} means of a hydrodynamic model of dense gas-solid flow in <b>spouted</b> beds. Constitutive equations describing the particulate solids pressure and viscosity were implemented into a hydrodynamic simulation computer program. The effect of operating conditions (inclined angle and gas <b>spouting</b> velocity) on particle velocity and concentration in the <b>spout,</b> annulus and fountain regions were numerical studied. Both vertical and horizontal particle velocities increased with increasing <b>spouting</b> gas velocity. The diameter of the <b>spout</b> increases with decreasing the inclination angle.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in a <b>spouted</b> bed with {{auxiliary}} gas introduced horizontally. Auxiliary gas introduced horizontally has an obvious effect on the minimum <b>spouting</b> gas velocity; the minimum <b>spouting</b> gas velocity decreases with increasing auxiliary gas velocity. An empirical equation for the minimum <b>spouting</b> velocity is modified to fit the experimental data. With {{an increase in the}} proportion of the auxiliary gas for a fixed total gas flow, the fountain height decreases, but the relative voidage-in the <b>spout</b> decreases, which means that more particles are circulated. Comparatively, the <b>spouting</b> gas has a distinct effect on the particle velocity in the <b>spouting</b> region, but the auxiliary gas velocity affects the particle velocity in the annular region markedly. The radial profiles of relative voidage and particle velocity at different axial heights are also studied in detail...|$|R

First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and <b>spouts.</b> Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E

It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water <b>spouts</b> that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model developed by Nellist et al. (1987) was adopted in this continuous two dimensional <b>spouted</b> bed dryer (2 DSB) configuration. The {{objective of this}} research was to predict air temperature, grain temperature, absolute humidity and moisture content during the drying process in 2 DSB. In simulation, <b>spouted</b> bed was divided into two regions which were <b>spout</b> and downcomer regions. Air and grains in <b>spout</b> and downcomer were assumed to be moving with co- and counterflow principles. During experiments, drying air temperature at 80 oC and different paddy initial moisture contents (at 41 % db, 36 % db and 30 % db) were used. Based on data, the air temperature profiles in <b>spout</b> region showed that air temperature dropped significantly with the axial positions while downcomer regions resulted fluctuated value. The average deviation of the air temperature in the <b>spout</b> was less than 4. 5 % and within downcomer was less than 4. 2 %. Grain temperature and absolute humidity in <b>spout</b> region increased slowly whilst decreasing in steps in downcomer regions with axial position. The moisture content decreased both in <b>spouted</b> and downcomer regions. Moisture reduction in <b>spout</b> region was higher than downcomer regions because of the high air flow rate in <b>spout</b> region...|$|R

40|$|Interparticle forces, {{developed}} in wet <b>spouted</b> beds {{composed of a}} mixture of spherical particles with different size distributions, intensify particle segregation mechanisms interfering in gas distribution inside the bed and, consequently, in the <b>spouting</b> flow characteristics. Therefore, this paper is aimed at describing the effect of interparticle forces on the air-solid flow distribution in conical <b>spouted</b> beds of unequal-sized particles coated by a thin glycerol film. Experimental results show that both the minimum <b>spouting</b> airflow rate and the minimum <b>spouting</b> pressure drop decrease {{as the amount of}} glycerol added to the bed increases. In addition, simulated results of the annular air velocity along the bed height showed that, {{at the base of the}} column, the radial component of the inertial force is high enough to break liquid bridges between particles and carry these particles out along the <b>spout.</b> Moreover, as the glycerol concentration increases, the <b>spout</b> diameter increases along the bed height. Such changes in the air-solid flow can maintain the <b>spouting</b> regime for higher glycerol concentrations as shown by experimental data...|$|R
5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large <b>spouts</b> of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E

Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who <b>spouts</b> wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E

Pressure transducers at several axial positions were used to obtain pressure fluctuation time series with 1. 2 and 2. 4 mm glass beads at U/U-ms from 0. 3 to 1. 6, and static bed depths from 150 to 600 mm. The conditions covered several flow regimes (fixed bed, incipient <b>spouting,</b> stable <b>spouting,</b> pulsating <b>spouting,</b> slugging, bubble <b>spouting</b> and fluidization). Images of the system dynamics were also acquired through the transparent walls with a digital camera.

40|$|This paper deals {{especially}} with <b>spouting</b> stability in a slot-rectangular (prismatic) <b>spouted</b> bed. The flow stability {{was characterized by}} the pressure drop evaluation (the uniformity and amplitude of the fluctuations) and visual observations (the flow symmetry). The effect of several geometrical conditions, such as the inlet design, prismatic angle and draft plates on the bed behaviour was investigated for different particles and bed inventories exposed to different air flow rates. The prismatic angle {{was found to have}} a strong impact on the <b>spouting</b> characteristics. A method to improve significantly the <b>spouting</b> quality and to make the <b>spouting</b> stability independent on the gas inflow velocity is presented. Compared to the reference geometry the prismatic angle was changed to a higher value and the apparatus was equipped with draft plates. Whereas, to achieve a stable <b>spouting</b> {{in a wide range of}} the air flow rates the design of draft plates should be customized to the bed inventory. Dependent on the static bed height full or open-sided draft plates should be used. In the proposed apparatus implementation, the maximum <b>spouting</b> velocity was almost eliminated for large particles (Geldart D), i. e. a highly coherent dense <b>spouting</b> can pass continuously into the dilute-like stable regime, without stability loss at intermediate gas velocities.
