5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|It all {{happened}} that night. She {{told us the}} title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{left to do}} {{the music}} and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E

You {{have called}} me an adventurer, Sophronia. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> In plain uncomplimentary English, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>So</b> are you, my dear. So are many people. We agree {{to keep our}} own secret, and {{to work together in}} furtherance of our own schemes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{a person}} to be human, he is to be faithful, honorable, kind, and righteous. I had {{previously}} contributed to {{the reign of the}} Prince of Fusha Wang Yanzheng, who carried that title before taking imperial title), but I rebelled against him, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not faithful. He entrusted his nephew to me, but I killed his nephew with others, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not honorable. <b>I</b> lead the soldiers in fighting the soldiers from Jian, and the people we kill are all old acquaintances, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not kind. <b>I</b> abandoned my wife and children so that others could slaughter them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not righteous. <b>I</b> have no usefulness left, and even if I died <b>I</b> would still <b>be</b> shamed.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just like, I'm {{going to}} make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
25|$|Stott {{described}} the wound {{in a letter}} home as being '"not at all severe. I {{was hit by a}} bullet just above the knee (right) {{on the inside of the}} leg and it did not strike a bone <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lucky", and it was not so serious as to prevent him escaping a prisoner of war camp in Greece. Together with another New Zealander, Bob Morton, Stott vaulted the fence of the camp in broad daylight and successfully evaded the German guards with the help of Greek police who led the pursuing Germans astray. After spending several months in and around Athens, Stott and Morton were eventually able to get to Egypt, crossing the Mediterranean by sailboat.|$|E
500|$|Sam Waley-Cohen (Oscar Time, 2nd): [...] "The {{plan was}} always {{to come with}} one smooth run. We {{knew he had a}} huge jump in him <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just {{trying to get him to}} pop a little bit and save and not get too keen. He did {{everything}} I asked of him." ...|$|E

50|$|If <b>I</b> <b>is</b> a right {{ideal of}} R, then <b>I</b> <b>is</b> {{simple as a}} right module {{if and only if}} <b>I</b> <b>is</b> a minimal non-zero right ideal: If M is a non-zero proper {{submodule}} of <b>I,</b> then it <b>is</b> also a right ideal, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> not minimal. Conversely, if <b>I</b> <b>is</b> not minimal, then there is a non-zero right ideal J properly contained in <b>I.</b> J <b>is</b> a right submodule of <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> not simple.|$|R
500|$|Kane also said: [...] "Most of {{my family}} were Spurs fans and I grew up 15 minutes from the ground, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{always going to be}} a Spurs fan". He cited Teddy Sheringham as a {{childhood}} idol and saw him as a [...] "great finisher" [...] and a role model in his ability to score goals.|$|E
500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed! I thought it was so stupid with that 'Ooh-ah' sound in it that I wanted to add something to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|Yiftach Klein {{was cast}} to act {{alongside}} her as Yochay Goldberg. Burshtein remarked that Klein [...] "is {{a big star}} in Israel, and has played a pimp, a homosexual, and a cop (among many other roles), <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not sure you could really believe him as this Orthodox guy. But his audition, and then his chemistry with Hadas were just perfect".|$|E
60|$|But Sara always denied it; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{inclined}} to believe Felix simply made it up himself.|$|R
60|$|Har. Sen. He {{refused to}} pledge the last rummer; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> out of charity with him.|$|R

500|$|Grace Lee Whitney was {{released}} {{during the filming}} of the first season. The official reason given for Whitney's departure from the show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk. This idea was supported by Whitney, saying [...] "They didn't {{want to give the}} fans the idea [...] was in love with Janice Rand. That would limit him. They wanted him to go out and fool around. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> axed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the ceremony, Frank Cottrell Boyce, said: [...] "People around us thought it might need defending, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told to do press the next morning. I was {{completely}} surprised [...] [...] A {{lot of people were}} surprised. [...] But I don't think Danny was surprised. [...] Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling {{that it was going to}} be anything but amazing. [...] And he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|Gene Hoglan, later {{known as}} the drummer for bands like Dark Angel and Death, {{provided}} backing vocals on the song [...] "Evil Has No Boundaries". [...] "Back {{at the time it}} was Jeff [...] and Kerry doing the 'Evil!' You know, it didn't sound too heavy and I mentioned to like Tom or Jeff or somebody like, 'You know you guys should consider...maybe consider doing like big gang vocals on that, make it sound evil like demons and stuff,' and they were like 'Good idea.' But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody jumped up and yelled 'EVIL!!!' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like 'Yeah, I got to sing on it!'" [...] On recording the drums, Slagel wanted drummer Dave Lombardo to play without using cymbals due to the amount of noise they made, as he was unsure if he could siphon the noise out, which he eventually did.|$|E
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. Ah! it is heresy to {{say that}} in this house, Lady Markby. Robert is a great {{champion}} of the Higher Education of Women, and <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid, <b>am</b> <b>I.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Emmet Mullins (Chelsea Harbour, fell at 2nd): [...] "He got {{his back}} up {{too high and}} came down too steeply. But he <b>is</b> grand and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking forward to next time." ...|$|R

500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw because I {{thought it was a}} {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite caught by surprise and {{it was clear to me}} that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|I had to {{deal with}} the loss of my mother and then {{had to deal}} with the guilt of her being gone and then I {{had to deal with}} the loss of my father when he married my stepmother. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just one angry {{abandoned}} girl. I'm still angry. The part of me that goes around saying [...] "Fuck you! Fuck you!" [...] is the part that's covering up the part that's saying [...] "I'm hurt!" [...] I guess all of this came through in the video.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Hood attracted {{him to the}} project, adding: [...] "I happened {{to meet him at}} the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. That night we were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding his remix of the album, O'Brien stated, [...] "The band {{loved the}} {{original}} mix of Ten, but were {{also interested in}} what it would sound like if I were to deconstruct and remix it...The original Ten sound is what millions of people bought, dug and loved, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> initially hesitant to mess around with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
500|$|Elections {{director}} Alexander Payne {{was eager}} to cast Witherspoon as Tracy, based on her performances in Freeway and the 1991 film The Man in the Moon, and Witherspoon was equally eager {{to sign on to}} the project—but not to play Tracy. Witherspoon was drawn to the part of Tammy Metzler, the cynical outcast who becomes the election's dark horse presidential candidate. Referring to the scene in which Tammy delivers a shocking campaign speech denouncing the school's administration and the entire concept of elected student government, Witherspoon said, [...] "That speech alone made me want to play Tammy! <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> terribly conflicted." ...|$|E
