This paper introduces the Pressurized <b>Submerged</b> <b>Combustion</b> and some basic theoretical research. To understand better gas pressure fluctuations and their influence in flame stability, {{a mathematical model}} is developed in this paper, and its particular solution is elucidated. The results show that, the variations of pressure are influenced by bubbling which is a self-excited oscillation phenomenon. Increasing the damping of liquid motion is very helpful for stabilizing pressure fluctuations.

At the same time, it had {{been aware of the}} use of top-jetting lances in the Mitsubishi and Kaldo processes, and of top-entry <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> lance investigations undertaken by ASARCO Limited (which had a long association with MIM, including being a shareholder in MIM Holdings) in the 1960s. This stimulated MIM’s interest in the Sirosmelt lance, which was seen as a way to produce a robust submerged lance.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to convert Illinois coal combustion residues, such as fly ash, bottom ash, and boiler slag, into novel cementitious materials {{for use in the}} construction industry. These residues are composed largely of SiO{sub 2 }, Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, MgO, and CaO, which are also the major components of cement. Since the residues are used as an integral component of the cement and not just as additives to concrete, larger amounts of the residues can be utilized. The process uses <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> to melt blends of coal combustion residues with lime, clay, and/or sand. The <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> melter utilizes natural gas-oxidant firing directly into a molten bath to provide efficient melting of mineral-like materials. Use of this melter for cement production has many advantages over rotary kilns including very little, if any, grinding of the feed material, very low emissions, and compact size. During {{the first year of the}} program, samples of coal combustion residues were blended and mixed, as needed; with lime, clay, and/or sand to adjust the composition. Six mixtures, three with fly ash and three with bottom ash, were melted in a laboratory-scale furnace. The resultant products were used in mortar cubes and bars which were subjected to ASTM standard tests of cementitious properties. In the hydraulic activity test, mortar cubes were found to have a strength comparable to standard mortar cements. In the compressive strength test, mortar cubes were found to have strengths that exceeded ASTM blended cement performance specifications. In the ASR expansion test, mortar bars were subjected to alkali-silica reaction-induced expansion, which is a problem for siliceous aggregate-based concretes that are exposed to moisture. The mortar bars made with the products inhibited 85 to 97 % of this expansion. These results show that residue-based products have an excellent potential as ASR-preventing additions in concretes...|$|R

To describe the {{changes of the}} flow pattern in the two-phase flow, a double-k–ε two-phase turbulence model is developed and adopted. A multi-δ-pdf model is proposed and applied to simulate the turbulent combustion of gaseous SF 6 with liquid metal Li. The gas and liquid velocities, void fraction, shape of the penetrating region (the region containing the gas phase) and the mixture fraction related to gas temperature and species concentration are predicted. Comparison with the results using a single-fluid model shows that current predictions are reasonable in reflecting the influence of velocity slip between the two phases and capable of predicting Li/SF 6 <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion.</b> Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{hot water}} generator that combines direct water heating in a packed column and indirect water heating in a <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber {{is the subject}} of this investigation. Advantages of the heater over the conventional hot water generators include higher efficiency, lower cost of equipment, lower pressure drop, and a simpler control system. The experimental work has been conducted on a prototype dual water heater located at the Natural Gas Technology Center at Boucherville, Quebec. The heater consists of an immersed firetube and two packed columns. It provides hot water at two temperatures. The effects of the controlling parameters, such as the flow rates of the water, air, and fuel gas, on the performance of the heater were analyzed. Equations governing the heat and mass transfer were formulated. Simplified forms of these equations were used to determine heat and mass transfer coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) {{vaporization}} facilities offer {{an excellent opportunity}} of primary energy saving by means of integration with power conversion units that is still weakly exploited in actual installations. This work focuses on the evaluation of primary energy saving achievable by the integration of an LNG vaporization facility with a gas turbine and with a cogenerative combined gas-steam power plant. The fuel energy saving ratio is used as the main performance parameter to evaluate the primary energy saving derived by system integration, with respect to conventional <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> vaporization. Twelve possible configurations are analyzed with steady-state calculations. Results show that a primary energy saving greater than 15 % with peak values up to 27 %, corresponding to 2. 98 TJ/year, is achievable.

50|$|Phase 3 was {{announced}} in May 2007 to increase storage, ship unloading and vapourisation capabilities. A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed {{to the east of}} the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing transfer pipeline. The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch vapour return arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch recirculation line. Additional facilities included further <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> vapourisers; boil-off gas compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a vent stack. The development provided an additional five million tonnes of capacity per annum. All this capacity was contracted out from December 2010. Customers included BP, Iberdrola, Sonatrach, Centrica, E.ON and GDF Suez.|$|R
50|$|In 2005-8 Grain LNG Ltd {{constructed}} {{new facilities}} for the storage and gasification of LNG. The facilities included three LNG storage tanks {{each with a}} capacity of 190,000 m3 (48.7 m high, 87.4 m diameter), each holding {{as much as the}} four original tanks. These are full containment vessels with an inner nickel-steel alloy and an outer pre-stressed concrete wall with a reinforced concrete roof. The tanks were constructed in the north-west part of the site {{to the north of the}} existing tanks. Each tank has a concrete mass of 72,000 tonnes and is supported on 1,560 piles, 600 mm in diameter and a depth of 24 metres. The new facilities included eight <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> water bath vapourisers. These heat and vapourise LNG flowing in stainless steel coils from minus 162°C to 6°C. Two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) gas turbines provide power to the site, and the waste heat is piped to the adjacent vapourisers, to reduce the gas required for firing. The cost of the Phase 2 facilities was £350m. The capacity was sold to three customers: Sonatrach (Algeria), Centrica and Gaz de France. Under phase 2, a further 6.5 million tonnes per year of capacity was contracted on a long term basis from December 2008. The new plant brought the capability of the site to a throughput of 10.5 million tonnes of LNG (about 12% of UK gas demand).|$|R
40|$|The {{staff of}} the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has {{prepared}} an environmental assessment (EA) on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities proposed by Southern LNG, Inc. (Southern LNG) in the above-referenced docket. The EA was prepared {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the proposed project which includes expansion of the existing Elba Island LNG import terminal in Chatham County, Georgia. Southern LNG proposes to: construct an LNG unloading slip cut into Elba Island with two ship unloading docks; construct a 1, 000, 000 -barrel double walled LNG storage tank; construct two boil-off gas compressors; construct two first-stage (booster) LNG pumps; construct a recondenser vessel; construct three second-stage LNG pumps; construct three <b>submerged</b> <b>combustion</b> vaporizers; and construct a motor control center. The proposed facilities would expand the storage and sendout capacity of Southern LNG's existing LNG import terminal in Chatham County, Georgia. The proposal would: 1) expand the storage capacity of the terminal; and 2) increase the sustainable daily sendout capability to 806 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) and its peaking capacity to 1, 2 15 MMscf/d.

40|$|A thin-slice {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model of a conventional tuyere blown slag-fuming furnace has been developed in Eulerian multiphase flow approach by employing a three-dimensional (3 -D) hybrid unstructured orthographic grid system. The model considers a thin slice of the conventional tuyere blown slag-fuming furnace to investigate details of fluid flow, <b>submerged</b> coal <b>combustion</b> dynamics, coal use behavior, jet penetration behavior, bath interaction conditions, and generation of turbulence in the bath. The model was developed by coupling the CFD with the kinetics equations developed by Richards et al. for a zinc-fuming furnace.

A commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009. 2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with several user-defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model predicted the velocity, temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence and vortex, and coal use behavior from the slag bath. The tuyere jet penetration length (l P) was compared with the equation provided by Hoefele and Brimacombe from isothermal experimental work {Mathematical expression} and found 2. 26 times higher, which {{can be attributed to}} coal combustion and gas expansion at a high temperature. The jet expansion angle measured for the slag system studied is 85 deg for the specific inlet conditions during the simulation time studied. The highest coal penetration distance was found to be l/L = 0; 0. 2, where l is the distance from the tuyere tip along the center line and L is the total length (2. 44 m) of the modeled furnace.

2500|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are tar components produced by pyrolysis in smoldering organic matter and emitted into smoke. [...] Several of these PAH's are already toxic in their normal form, however, many of then can become more toxic to the liver. Due to the hydrophobic nature of PAH's {{they do not}} dissolve in water and are hard to expel from the body. [...] In {{order to make the}} PAH more soluble in water, the liver creates an enzyme called Cytochrome P450 which adds an additional oxygen to the PAH, turning it into a mutagenic epoxides, which is more soluble, but also more reactive. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which been shown to toxicate into a diol epoxide and then permanently attach to nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. The DNA contains the information on how the cell function; in practice, it contains the recipes for protein synthesis. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell, a cell that does not function like a normal cell. The carcinogenicity is radiomimetic, i.e. similar to that produced by ionizing nuclear radiation. Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with <b>combustion</b> less <b>vaporizer</b> technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes. Although such products have become increasingly popular, they still represent a very small fraction of the market, and no conclusive evidence has shown to prove or disprove the positive health claims.|$|R
40|$|Slag fuming is a reductive {{treatment}} {{process for}} molten zinciferous slags for extracting zinc {{in the form}} of metal vapour by injecting or adding a reductant source such as pulverized coal or lump coal and natural gas. The process has been operative since 1930 ’s for recovering zinc from lead blast furnace slag. Though slag fuming is a well-established process and has been industrially operative for over eighty years, there is only limited understanding of the process kinetics and fluid flow behaviour inside the slag fuming furnace. The {{purpose of this study is}} detailed fluid dynamic analysis including combustion behaviour, gas-liquid momentum interaction, generation of splashing due to gas injection process in slag fuming furnace, analysis of fuming behaviour at different locations of the furnace by using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling technique. This PhD thesis focuses on the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the zinc slag fuming process. In the first stage of the present research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the Top Submerged Lance (TSL) gas injection process was carried out in a laboratory scale isothermal air-water model. The multiphase flow simulation, based on Euler-Euler approach, elucidated the effect of swirl and non-swirl flow inside the bath. The effects of lance submergence level and air flow rate were also investigated in that phase. The simulation results for velocity fields and generation of turbulence in the bath were validated against existing experimental data from the previous water model experimental study of Morsi et al. [1]. In the next stage of the research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of the pilot plant scale top submerged lance slag fuming furnace was developed to investigate details of fluid flow, combustion behaviour, reaction kinetics and heat transfer in the furnace. The model integrates <b>submerged</b> CH 4 <b>combustion</b> at the lance tip and chemical reactions with the heat, mass and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. Commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009. 2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with a number of user defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model is based on 3 -D Eulerian multiphase flow approach and it predicted the velocity and temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence, vortex and plume shape at the lance tip. The model also predicted the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model was validated by adopting the macro – step validation approach by using the zinc fuming rate against the pilot plant scale experimental study on top submerged lance zinc fuming process carried out by Waladan et al. [2]. Finally, the developed CFD model for TSL furnace was extended for <b>submerged</b> coal <b>combustion</b> instead of CH 4 combustion and applied to a conventional tuyere blown slag fuming furnace. The model considered a thin slice of a conventional tuyere blown slag fuming furnace consisting two opposing set of tuyere.
