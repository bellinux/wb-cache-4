50|$|Trench Town (also Trenchtown) is a {{neighborhood}} {{located in the}} parish of St. Andrew which shares municipality with Kingston, the capital and largest city of Jamaica. In the 1960s Trench Town {{was known as the}} Hollywood of Jamaica. Today Trench Town is the location of the Trench Town Culture Yard Museum, a National Heritage Site presenting the unique history and contribution of Trench Town to Jamaica. Trench Town is the birthplace of rocksteady and reggae music, as well as the home of reggae and Rastafari ambassador Bob Marley. The neighborhood gets its name from its previous designation as Trench Pen, 400 acres of land once used for livestock by Daniel Power Trench, an Irish immigrant of the 18th century (descendants of the Earls of Clancarty). The Trench family abandoned the land in the late 19th century. It is a common misconception that the name comes from the large open <b>storm-water</b> <b>drain</b> that runs through the neighbourhood in the middle of Collie Smith Drive. Trench Town is home to the communities of Wilton Gardens Rema, Federal Gardens, Arnette Gardens Jungle, Havana, Buckers and others. Trench Town today is also the home of two of Jamaica's top Premier League football club teams, Arnette Gardens and Boys' Town.|$|E

40|$|A {{factory in}} New Hampshire had a {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) release detected in a storm-water outfall pipe. Hydrogen Release Compound (HRC) injection {{was determined to be}} the best remedial solution. Tight soils, shallow water table, access limitations, and pending property sale complicated remediation. Groundwater was directly below the floor slab. The plume was centered on the <b>storm-water</b> <b>drain</b> which carries runoff from the upgradient parking lot under the building. The VOCs are believed to have entered the subsurface in the central area of the building through spillage; the storm drain system was a preferential pathway. The groundwater contamination was addressed through bioremediation using HRC. Application required many injection points and applications, due to the low permeability of the soil. Due to interference with operations and property sale, repeated openings of the floor for injections using a drill rig were not feasible. Permanent injection points were installed, but would not be accessible for direct injection. Therefore, a trench was cut into the concrete floor slab between each point and the wall. Piping ran from the injection point to the wall, terminating at a standpipe with a quick-connect fitting. Each trench was then fillled with concrete to restore the floor slab. Since starting HRC treatment, VOC levels at the outfall have dropped to below the state regulatory standard. One well had levels of 1800 ug/L and 1200 ug/L of Cis- 1, 2 Dichloroethene and Vinyl Chloride in April, 2008. By January, 2009, both were below MCLs. Site closure is expected to be completed in a reasonable timeframe. The treatment has not interfered with Site activities or with sale of the Site...|$|E
40|$|It {{was once}} thought oceans were so vast {{they could not}} be {{affected}} by humans, but unfortunately rapid globalisation now threatens marine biodiversity. The negative effects of marine debris were recognised in the 1970 s, and more recently globally acknowledged in scientific literature. We revisited the Greater Sydney region in New South Wales Australia, to research whether plastic waste on coastal beaches has reduced in recent years. This was achieved by designing a community science project in collaboration with local schools and volunteers. We discovered that plastic debris differed between beaches and strata, but was similar to Australian beaches that were sampled over a decade ago. The high correlations we found between plastic debris and both the frequency of <b>storm-water</b> <b>drains</b> and local population sizes suggested that <b>storm-water</b> <b>drains</b> may be responsible for delivering plastic waste to coastal ecosystems, and the amount of plastic debris was proportional {{to the size of the}} surrounding population. Involving local communities has the potential to rapidly raise awareness about key conservation issues to large and broad demographic audiences. Ultimately, this may inspire public and political change. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} oviposition {{preferences of}} Aedes aegpti to water from <b>storm-water</b> <b>drains</b> and seasoned tap water were evaluated in the laboratory. The sample was collected from concrete <b>storm-water</b> <b>drains</b> with stagnant clear {{water in a}} dengue-endemic site, Taman Samudera, Selangor. Ae. aegypti adults were given a blood meal and released into the caged. Gravid females were given a choice between drain water and seasoned tap water for egg deposition. In a no-choice test, {{there was no significant}} difference in the numbers of eggs, larvae, pupae and adults colonized from the drain water and seasoned tap water (p> 0. 05), indicating that Ae. aegypti oviposit their eggs on a substrate which is readily available. In a choice test, the number of eggs laid by Ae. aegypti in drain water (1630. 67 Â± 204. 26) was significantly more than that in seasoned tap water (221. 33 Â± 53. 18) (p 0. 05), indicating that water from the drain did not contain high organic content. Significant water conductivity (p< 0. 05) and the presence of bacteria could have contributed to the site selection for egg laying by Ae. aegypti. The drain water successfully supported the colonization of the immatures, with the emergence of 824. 33 Â± 13. 96 adult mosquitoes. The ratio of male and female mosquitoes was 1 : 1. This study concluded that the concrete drainage system with clear stagnant water provides a suitable medium for the colonization of dengue vector Ae. aegypti...|$|R

40|$|The {{aquarium}} {{trade has}} a long history of transporting and introducing fish, plants and snails into regions where they are not native. However, other than snails, research on species carried “incidentally” rather than deliberately by this industry is lacking. I sampled invertebrates in the plankton, and from water among bottom stones, of 55 aquaria from 43 New Zealand households. I recorded 55 incidental invertebrate taxa, including copepods, ostracods, cladocerans, molluscs, mites, flatworms and nematodes. Six were known established non-indigenous species, and eight others were not previously recorded from New Zealand. Of the latter, two harpacticoid copepod species, Nitokra pietschmanni and Elaphoidella sewelli, are not native to or known from New Zealand, demonstrating the aquarium trade continues to pose an invasion risk for incidental fauna. The remaining six species were littoral/benthic rotifers with subtropical/tropical affinities; these may or may not be native, as research on this group is limited. A variety of behaviours associated with the set-up and keeping of home aquaria were recorded (e. g., fish and plants in any home were sourced from stores, wild caught, or both, and cleaning methods varied), which made prediction of “high risk” behaviours difficult. However, non-indigenous species had a greater probability of being recorded in aquaria containing aquatic plants and in those that were heated. Methods for disposal of aquarium wastes ranged from depositing washings on the lawn or garden (a low risk for invasion) to disposing of water into outdoor ponds or <b>storm-water</b> <b>drains</b> (a higher risk). It is recommended that aquarium owners be encouraged to pour aquarium wastes onto gardens or lawns—already a common method of disposal—as invasion risk will be minimised using this method...|$|R
40|$|In sub‒Saharan Africa, non‒typhoidal Salmonellae (NTS) cause {{invasive}} disease particularly {{in children and}} HIV infected adults, but the disease epidemiology is poorly understood. Between 2012 and 2013, we investigated NTS sources and transmission in Kampala. We detected Salmonella in 60 % of the influent and 60 % of the effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant and 53. 3 % of the influent and 10 % of the effluent samples from waste stabilization ponds that serve the human population; 40. 9 % of flush‒water samples from ruminant slaughterhouses, 6. 6 % of the poultry fecal samples from live bird markets and 4 % of the fecal samples from swine at slaughter; and in 54. 2 % of the water samples from a channel that <b>drains</b> <b>storm-water</b> and effluents from the city. We obtained 775 Salmonella isolates, identified 32 serovars, and determined resistance to 15 antimicrobials. We genotyped common serovars using multiple‒locus variable number tandem repeats analysis or pulsed‒field gel electrophoresis. In addition, we analyzed 49 archived NTS isolates from asymptomatic livestock and human clinical cases. Salmonella from ruminant and swine sources were mostly pan‒susceptible (95 %) while poultry isolates were generally more resistant. Salmonella Kentucky isolated from poultry exhibited extensive drug resistance characterized by resistance to 10 antimicrobials. Interestingly, similar genotypes of S. Kentucky but with less antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were found in poultry, human and environmental sources. The observed AMR patterns {{could be attributed to}} host or management factors associated with production. Alternatively, S. Kentucky may be prone to acquiring AMR. The factors driving AMR remain poorly understood and should be elucidated. Overall, shared genotypes and AMR phenotypes were found in NTS from human, livestock and environmental sources, suggesting zoonotic and environmental transmissions most likely occur. Information from this study could be used to control NTS transmission...|$|R
