25|$|Services-oriented labor {{revolves}} around the provision of consumable, non-durable goods and the fulfillment of tasks by an external source for the consumer. This includes {{wholesale and retail trade}} and restaurants and hotels; transport, storage, and communications; financing, insurance, real estate, and business services; and community, social, and personal services. Most female laborers in Muslim majority countries work in the agriculture sector but many also work in private service jobs. Few, though <b>some,</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> employed in industrial-oriented labor.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{breast-feeding}} difficulties {{arise if}} the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, {{or if the}} milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common if the incisions cut tissue near the nipple. The milk glands {{are most likely to}} be affected by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, it is impossible to predict whether a woman who undergoes breast augmentation will be able to successfully breast feed since <b>some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> able to breast-fed after periareolarincisions and subglandular placement and some are not able to after augmentation using submuscular and other types of surgical incisions.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When <b>some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some symptoms-based {{forms of}} {{fertility}} awareness require observation or touching of cervical mucus, an activity with which <b>some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> not comfortable. Some practitioners {{prefer to use}} the term [...] "cervical fluid" [...] to refer to cervical mucus, in an attempt to make the subject more acceptable to these women.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{major cause}} of {{infertility}} in women may be the inability to ovulate. Malformation of the eggs themselves may complicate conception. [...] For example, polycystic ovarian syndrome is when the eggs only partially developed within the ovary {{and there is an}} excess of male hormones. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs. In this case synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid (Clomiphene citrate) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{a process}} known as [...] "employee clustering", {{employees}} tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is.|$|E
2500|$|Notably, {{the rules}} {{governing}} Cambridge sub-fusc are less detailed and less strict than those prevailing at Oxford. In particular, bands may be worn at Oxford only by high officers of the university and by doctors on certain occasions. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> required to wear bands with a black tie (in practice a black velvet ribbon) while others holding certain offices are permitted the alternative of a white bow tie with their bands. At Cambridge, there are only strict sub-fusc rules in Statutes and Ordinances for graduation ceremonies, at which the rules are enforced strictly by the proctors. [...] Persons who are incorrectly dressed may be prevented from graduating in person, and their Praelector or Presenter may be fined.|$|E
2500|$|Experiencing a {{miscarriage}} [...] "is a major loss for all pregnant women." [...] A miscarriage {{can result in}} anxiety, depression or stress for those involved. The impact on a woman life can be underestimated. It can have an affect on the whole family. Almost all those experiencing {{a miscarriage}} go through a grieving process. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may {{go through the same}} loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, the realization of the loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The father can have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult.|$|E
50|$|During the {{reporting}} period, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> increasingly permitted {{to be photographed}} for official identification while wearing the hijab, particularly to participate on the Hajj. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> also able to attend mosque without being detained or prosecuted.|$|R

2500|$|Japanese {{women will}} {{sometimes}} {{be forced to}} take jobs after marriage to supplement their husband's income, however, <b>some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> unable to work, {{because of the lack}} of domestic support at home. [...] Husbands seldom help with the housework, forcing women to stay home rearing children and taking care of domestic tasks. many believe a good housewife's job is to stay at home and look after the house. [...] Housewives may allow their husband to help in some small tasks, however, they are worried if they see their husband taking too much time to do domestic chores. [...] Housewives believe the house is their charge and do not want their husbands accusing them of neglecting their responsibility. Japanese women overall completed 95% of unpaid housework, while among full-time workers women still completed 60% of the housework, an unparalleled proportion among OECD countries. In 2000, 84.6% of women and 88.5% of men agreed that women should still be responsible for household jobs although it is good to have employment. In 2004, 67.4% of new mothers left their previous job for their first birth.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{is still}} {{something}} of a niche market, a few companies have begun to produce and market small sponges as reusable feminine hygiene products. They are marketed under the brand names Sea Pearls in the United States and Jam Sponge in the United Kingdom. The sponges are inserted into the vagina {{in much the same}} way a tampon is, but when full are removed, cleaned, and reused, rather than discarded. The advantages of a reusable tampon alternative include cost-effectiveness and waste reduction. (Since sponges are biodegradable, even when a menstrual sponge's absorbent life is over it can be composted.) <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> also concerned by the health risks associated with traditional tampons and feel it is healthier to use a natural material. [...] While no known cases of toxic shock syndrome have been associated with the use of menstrual sponges, sponges are known to contain sand, grit and bacteria, and thus the possibility of toxic shock syndrome must be considered. Sponges have a greater capacity for absorbing menstrual flow than most tampons; though they should still be changed at least every eight hours.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, 16.1 million American {{children}} {{were living in}} poverty. Outside of the 49 million Americans living in food insecure homes, 15.9 million of them were children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels in the U.S., with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households. Many of the neighborhoods these children live in lack basic produce and nutritious food. 47 million Americans depend on food banks, more than 30% above 2007 levels. Households headed by single mothers {{are most likely to}} be affected. 30 percent of low-income single mothers cannot afford diapers. Inability to afford this necessity can cause a chain reaction, including mental, health, and behavioral problems. <b>Some</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> forced to make use of one or two diapers, using them more than once. This causes rashes and sanitation problems as well as health problems. Without diapers, children are unable to enter into daycare. The lack of childcare can be detrimental to single mothers, hindering their ability to obtain employment. [...] Worst affected are Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and the District of Columbia, while North Dakota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Massachusetts are the least affected. 31 million low-income children received free or reduced-price meals daily through the National School lunch program during the 2012 federal fiscal year. Nearly 14 million children are estimated to be served by Feeding America with over 3 million being of the ages of 5 and under.|$|E

50|$|Mass {{politics}} was essentially {{the inclusion of}} the masses in the political process. There was a major rise in this from 1880 to 1914. This was when the vote in Europe was expanded to all men and in some countries even <b>some</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> allowed to vote.|$|R
