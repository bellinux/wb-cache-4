5|$|Nevertheless, {{palatial}} {{control over}} resources {{appears to have}} been highly <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed. Thus, sectors like the production of perfumed oil and bronze materials were directly monitored from the palace, but the production of ceramics was only indirectly monitored. Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. The Lancet averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The Lancet, which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|Most Noodles & Company {{restaurants}} are {{owned and operated}} by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores. As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent. Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues. According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{more active}} {{in the early morning}} than at other times of the day; flying more when visiting flowers at the time when nectar is most abundant. Its body mass {{decreases}} during the night, and then increases during the day with the greatest increase occurring during the important first hour of early morning foraging. It seems to make up around half of the overnight water loss during this hour. The energy that the brown honeyeater can potentially get from nectar exceeds its requirements in all seasons except winter, when it needs to be <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> the plants that are used, to balance energy intake and expenditure. It compensates for any lessening in nectar concentration by increasing the frequency of feeding.|$|E

5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} {{knowledge}} of Wilfrid are the medieval Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and {{the works of}} the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's Vita is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The Vita is <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the Vita is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives, {{as was the case with}} Stephen's work. It appears that the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.|$|E

50|$|<b>Selective</b> {{breeding}} <b>in</b> aquaculture holds {{high potential}} for the genetic improvement of fish and shellfish.

This was evident <b>in</b> <b>selective</b> breeding programs for growth rate, which resulted in slow growth and high mortality.|$|R
