(2) The Community of Goessel <b>stakeholders</b> and USD 411 <b>stakeholders</b> aspire to maintain a unique and independent school system with high academic standards. (3) The Community of Goessel <b>stakeholders</b> and USD 411 <b>stakeholders</b> shared their aspirations to maintain their high degree of quality of life and sense of safety that they perceive to exist in the community. (4) The Community of Goessel <b>stakeholders</b> and USD 411 <b>stakeholders</b> aspire to maintain a positive relationship between USD 411 and the churches within the community.
