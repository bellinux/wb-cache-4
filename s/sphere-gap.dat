40|$|A {{review of}} chopping-circuit {{techniques}} {{used in the}} production of square waveforms is presented, and two new methods which have been developed for use up to 1 MV are described. The first of these consists of a 3 -sphere gap circuit for chopping impulses with a scatter in the time of chopping of Â± 3 %. Also a circuit employing an auxiliary impulse generator and trigatron <b>sphere-gap</b> has been used to produce square waves of predetermined duration, or for automatically removing the voltage shortly before collapse of the test-gap. This automatic technique is a valuable aid in the photographic study of discharge processes where the variation in time to breakdown is large...|$|E
