40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{an introductory}} section and three essays analysing Russia’s economic {{transition from the}} early 1990 s up to the present. The papers present {{a combination of both}} theoretical and empirical analysis on some of the key issues Russia has faced during its somewhat troublesome transformation from <b>state-controlled</b> command <b>economy</b> to market-based economy. The first essay analyses fiscal competition for mobile capital between identical regions in a transition country. A standard tax competition framework is extended to account for two features of a transition economy: the presence of two sectors, old and new, which differ in productivity; and a non-benevolent regional decision-maker. It is shown that in very early phase of transition, when the old sector clearly dominates, consumers in a transition economy may be better off in a competitive equilibrium. Decision-makers, on the other hand, will prefer to coordinate their fiscal policies. The second essay uses annual data for 1992 – 2003 to examine income dispersion and convergence across 76 Russian regions. Wide disparities in income levels have indeed emerged during the transition period. Dispersion has increased most among the initially better-off regions, whereas for the initially poorer regions no clear trend of divergence or convergence could be established. Further, some – albeit not highly robust – evidence was found of both unconditional and conditional convergence, especially among the initially richer regions. Finally, it is observed that there is much less evidence of convergence after the economic crisis of 1998. The third essay analyses industrial firms’ engagement in provision of infrastructure services, such as heating, electricity and road maintenance. Using a unique dataset of 404 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in 40 regions of Russia, the essay examines public infrastructure provision by Russian industrial enterprises. It is found that to a large degree engagement in infrastructure provision, as proxied by district heating production, is a Soviet legacy. Secondly, firms providing district heating to users outside their plant area {{are more likely to have}} close and multidimensional relations with the local public sector.

Transformations to Shanghai’s existing vibrant inner-city neighbourhoods is a specific example of how these until-now little-studied [1] and yet crucial ‘centralities’—one of many in the polycentric urban system serving whole regions—spatially manifest the recalibration of drivers, agents, networks, urban forms responding to globalization’s effects in local frameworks. With qualities of openness, socio-economic diversity, and typological adaptability that make these neighbourhoods culturally and economically significant, their resilience in face of structural changes⎯from economic transitions to globalization’s acceleration of mobility and migrations⎯make their understanding and the urban resources they provide crucial in developing specific urban strategies for future sustainable developments.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{labour migration}} as {{an outcome of}} the interaction {{between the state and the}} informal economy, by considering the trends of contemporary labour migration from Ukraine to Southern Europe. It contends that in both the sending and receiving countries, migration policies either disregard or severely limit labour migration, while their informal economies facilitate the development of migration. This basic contradiction sustains migration flows over time. The main argument of the thesis is that migration develops within the system of interacting informal economies. I demonstrate the embeddedness of migration in the informal economy by using the case of Ukrainian migration to Italy. The role of the informal economy in the development of migration is examined across several dimensions. First, I argue that the recent labour migration from Ukraine emerged as a strategy of the informal economy, continuing the previous strategies of cross-border trading and short-term migration to Central Europe. These economic practices were the innovative responses of the population to the decline of the state economy and to the absence of economic reforms. Migration developed in the space between the state and the market economy. Second, the flows of labour migration were 'invisible' to states, and developed outside state control and regulation. This thesis demonstrates that the migration policies of the Ukrainian state disregarded the process of out-migration of Ukrainian citizens. Similarly, Italian immigration policies did not recognise the existing flows of labour migration. The informal economy of the receiving state resolved the contradiction between the economic demand for migrant workers and restrictive migration policies and enabled access to the receiving economy. However, access to the receiving labour market through the informal economy contributed to the disadvantaged incorporation of migrants and prevented their integration into the receiving society. The analysis of economic incorporation demonstrates that the informal economy channelled Ukrainian migrants to the secondary labour market with low earnings, a lack of benefits, and no possibility of professional advancement. The mode of access to the receiving economy and the resulting illegality heavily influenced the position of Ukrainian migrants in the labour market. Finally, the analysis of Ukrainian labour migration to Italy demonstrates that alternative migration-facilitating institutions were developed in the absence of the state recognition of labour migration. These institutions paralleled the institutions of the official labour markets and allowed migrants to implement income-generating projects. In addition, migration was facilitated by the supporting institutions of the receiving society, which counteracted the restrictive immigration laws and political controls on migration. The migration-supporting institutions were predicated on the strategies of circumventing state control which developed from participation in the informal economy of the sending country. Labour migration from the former Soviet Union would not be possible without these informal practices and the culture of avoiding state control in economic activities. The proposed analysis answers the challenge posed by the recent Ukrainian labour migration to conventional theories on migration, whose approaches usually omit references to the meso-level of migration processes, and consider either the structural-economic or the micro- determinants of migration. This thesis presents the informal economy both as a structural factor which enables migration and as a characteristic of the migrant agency that facilitates it. By doing that, the thesis also complements the literature on migration to Southern Europe and argues that migrations are not simply encouraged by the informal economies of the receiving countries, but they emerge from, and are facilitated by, the informal economies of the sending countries. To perpetuate migration migrants creatively use the resources of the informal economy in conjunction with strategies of circumventing the state. This argument holds for a number of ex-Soviet countries, which suffered severe economic crises during the disintegration of the <b>state-controlled</b> socialist <b>economies,</b> and consequently produced significant labour migrations to Western Europe...|$|R

Next to the old ladies gathered in gossip while tipping off the tails of bean sprouts in the lanes connecting the typical lilong housing, young free-lancers “tweet” their way into their new co-working studios in a lanehouse equipped with airbooks and Illy coffees.

Despite the vibes and looks of being neighborhoods that are becoming extremely global, the localized nuances confounding western presumptions of property rights, institutional stability and clarity ask the components of its urban spatial production to be investigated. The transformation in the city center is most visible in the return of commerce to the city center as the strictures of socialism are slowly eroded by the re-entry of market economy. Street-front ground floor spaces of apartment buildings, converted terraces of lanehouses, and insertions into and constructions from garden walls became everything from small restaurants, hardware stores, hair salons, convenience stores. And former neighborhood factories, closed or relocated with onset of economic liberalization, similarly became new cafes, florists and studios. What is today a ground floor commercial space, for example, was mostly likely once a garage or boiler room for the apartment building or the terrace for a lane house pre-revolution before 1949. The depletion of market commerce after 1949 removed and contained all commercial exchange into limited numbers of designated spaces. And with demographic increase and the lack of investment into infrastructure and housing construction, these ground floor spaces became, by the 1960 s allocated as residences. As is in most post-socialist cities, the return of capital and consumer demand generated commercial and spatial opportunity. Unique to Shanghai as a former global city is the extremely rapid usurping of international trends in the grasping of these opportunities. The constellation of returning diaspora compelled by both nostalgia and pragmatism, expats attracted by the city’s historic global connections, and expediently learning and commercial-minded local stakeholders not only facilitate the re-plugging of Shanghai into the global market but are becoming the active residents and users of the city center area that has been shirked by the local residents reminded by the it of the pre-reform memories of decades of forced socialization and privacy deprivation.

40|$|From the introduction]. Integrating {{into the}} European Union {{is a process}} of {{institutional}} choices and subsequent changes in domestic political, economic and legal structures. This has indeed been the case for the new member states that joined the EU in 2004. Firstly, the Copenhague criteria established by the European Council in 1993 set out the obligations on the applicant states. 1 The political obligations were the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, the respect of human rights and protection of minorities, whereas the economic requirements consisted of a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU. Last, but not least, the applicant states had to manifest an ability to incorporate the aquis or “to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union”. 2 The process of translating the acquis communitaire into the domestic legislation and the building up of political and administrative routines for influencing and implementing EU-policies have resulted in an unprecedented and far-reaching re-structuration of political, economic and administrative institutions and norms. For eight of the new EU member states of 2004 that either had been independent or parts of one-party communist states (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Slovenia) or republics in the Soviet Union (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) EU accession ran in tandem with processes of state- and nation building. The rapprochement to the EU and the NATO were parallel to the post communist transformation from authoritarian to democratic rule and rule of law as well as the development from <b>state-controlled</b> to market <b>economies.</b> As a matter of fact, the strong commitment to membership in the EU was motivated by the belief that full integration with the EU would secure progress in the construction of modern liberal democracies and market economies. A high prevalence of organisational change has consequently characterised these states due to both state and nation-building as well as European integration in the 1990 s and 2000 s. Whereas the drawing up of new democratic constitutions in the 1990 s predominantly has been conceived of as domestically driven processes, the integration into the European Union has been portrayed as mainly conditioned from outside. 3 It has more or less been taken as a given that the “EU has, or at least could have, a pervasive influence on the domestic policies of the CEES”, but “only a few analysts have made an effort to ascertain whether the influence of the EU is so ubiquitous as assumed”. 4 Moreover, the domestic insularity of constitution designing has also been questioned since various international organisations exert pressure on how states formulate the basic rules of the political game. 5 This study is situated within this broader academic debate since it aims at analysing how external and internal factors interact in how national parliaments adapt to European integration...|$|R
