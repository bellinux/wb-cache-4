25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Charles de Gaulle {{government}} {{cleaned up}} the French Penal Code, principally getting rid of the anti-Semitic laws. The article against homosexual relations between adults and minors, however, remained in force until 1982. The homophobic atmosphere of the 1940s-1960s meant that for the returning victims, the possibility of telling their story was thwarted by the fear of further <b>stigmatisation.</b> In his book, Seel also notes an increase of homophobic attacks in Mulhouse, after the war. In his family itself, Seel found a negative reaction to his homosexuality. His closest relatives decided to avoid broaching the subject while other members of the extended family made humiliating jokes. His godfather disinherited him.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, a {{significant}} number of Anioma indigenes have grown resentful towards the wider Igbo community and questioned {{whether or not they are}} “truly” Igbo, with many histories of Anioma towns being allegedly re-written to showcase a non-Igbo wave of migration and ethno-linguistic background. Many claim descent from the ancient Benin Kingdom, a movement which has been garnering more and more support following the <b>stigmatisation</b> that followed the Nigerian Civil War. Introspection of the Igbo denial in Delta State, however, may generally reveal that it is strongest in the Ndokwa and Ika territories and weakest among the Enuani, the latter of whom inhabit the Aniocha and Oshimili local government areas. Many theories have been postulated to explain this occurrence. Of particular interest, it has been suggested that the Ika were an aboriginal Igbo clan, with later migrations of settlers from the Benin Kingdom, owing to close proximity. The absorption of Edoid-speaking ethnic groups into Ika territory may have resulted in the attendant strong influence on the aborigines, in cultural and linguistic terms, providing fertile soil for Igbo denial. The same phenomenon may apply to the Ukwuani but, by virtue of less proximity with Edo State, to a lesser extent. Although many Ika and Ukwuani people maintain distinct cultural identities, they yet speak Igbo languages. The term Igbo itself has been conceived by many as a linguistic classification, encompassing all bia-speaking clans and with ethnic identity falling secondary to linguistic designation. As earlier mentioned, they are officially recognised as distinct ethnic groups from the Igbo.|$|E
500|$|Women in India {{have a lower}} {{onset of}} {{schizophrenia}} than men. However, women and men differ in the associated stigmas they must face. [...] While men tend to suffer from occupational functioning, while women suffer in their marital functioning. [...] The time of onset also {{plays a role in}} the <b>stigmatisation</b> of schizophrenia. [...] Women tend to be diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life, oftentimes following the birth of their children. [...] The children are often removed from the care of the ill mother, which may cause further distress.|$|E
500|$|HIV {{crossed the}} species barrier between {{chimpanzees}} and humans in Africa {{in the early}} decades of the 20th century. During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa. Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities, and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations. The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years, so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible. At this time there was much scapegoating and <b>stigmatisation.</b> The [...] "out of Africa" [...] theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans, who felt that the [...] "blame" [...] was misplaced. This led the World Health Assembly to pass a 1987 resolution, which stated that HIV is [...] "a naturally occurring [...] of undetermined geographic origin".|$|E

2500|$|Ptolemaic astrology {{continued}} to be taught at European universities into the 17th century, [...] but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position {{as one of the}} respected Liberal sciences. At this time, the contents of the Tetrabiblos started to draw <b>stigmatisation</b> as part of [...] "a diabolical art of divination". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: [...] "no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy".|$|E
2500|$|The {{societal}} {{consequences of}} war rape can equally {{have a negative}} impact on post-conflict reconciliation and the judicial follow-up on war-time crimes, including rape. Given the <b>stigmatisation</b> of victims and their isolation or fear thereof, they might prefer to remain silent with regard to the violations they have suffered. Indeed, underreporting of cases of rape during armed conflict is a practical challenge post-conflict communities have to face that is pointed to by a number of actors, including the United Nations Secretary-General, [...] the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as international NGOs.|$|E
2500|$|The Rasta message {{resonates with}} {{many people who}} feel marginalised and alienated by the values and {{institutions}} of their society. In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora {{by allowing them to}} psychologically reject their social <b>stigmatisation.</b> It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance. Cashmore expressed the view that [...] "whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance." [...] According to sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke, Rastafari [...] "helped to provide many people of African descent with a deeper sense of their African identity".|$|E
2500|$|To {{investigate}} the epidemic, {{the city government}} and various medical practitioners formed the [...] {{at the end of}} May 1956. Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was suspected to be contagious and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected. Although contagion was later disproved, this initial response contributed to the <b>stigmatisation</b> and discrimination experienced by Minamata victims from the local community. During its investigations, the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients' homes. From around 1950 onward, cats had been seen to have convulsions, go mad, and die. Locals called it the , owing to their erratic movement. Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed, and fish floated dead {{on the surface of the}} sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from Kumamoto University to help in the research effort.|$|E

50|$|Stigma, though {{powerful}} and enduring, is not inevitable, {{and can be}} challenged. There are two important aspects to challenging stigma: challenging the <b>stigmatisation</b> {{on the part of}} stigmatizers, and challenging the internalized stigma of the stigmatized.

5000|$|There is also {{a concern}} that fear appeals give rise to <b>stigmatisation</b> {{of those who are}} seen to be already {{suffering}} the negative consequences of the undesirable behaviour. For example, injury prevention campaigns often rely on emphasising the negative consequences of potentially becoming disabled. Wang hypothesises that when becoming disabled is portrayed as unacceptable, so is being disabled, adding to the <b>stigmatisation</b> of disabled individuals. For example, in responses to a poster campaign stating that [...] "Last year, 1057 teenagers got so drunk they couldn't stand up. Ever." [...] presented alongside a picture of a wheelchair, disabled participants in Wang's study felt that this held them up {{as an example of how}} not to be.
