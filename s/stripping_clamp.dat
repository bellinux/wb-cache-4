40|$|Like {{many other}} materials, thin sheets having no bending {{rigidity}} exhibit a slow non-equilibrium dynamics. We performed experiments on paperboard (100 µm in thickness) {{and on a}} laminate made of paperboard and Low Density Polyethylene (25 µm in thickness), both used in food packaging industries. The investigated samples were rectangular <b>strips</b> <b>clamped</b> at two ends on a tensile test machine. They were loaded at two different strain levels and monitored under constant strain; resonance frequencies were measured for several conditioning cycles of loading. We found that the resonance frequency shifts downward {{in response to a}} conditioning strain and the resonant line shape changes with increasing number of cycles due. The results are equivalent to long-time slow dynamics relaxation experiments on solid materials of many types. The conditioning period in our experiment is about one million longer than in typical earlier acoustic conditioning measurement. But, this does not influence the result to any significant degree, as the recovery response is even slower. In addition, these thin sheets have an even larger effect in terms of percentage of resonance frequency shift than rocks, which are known to have a very high degree of slow dynamic recovery. This type of measurement is important for the fundamental understanding of material dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Intra-ply shear is an {{important}} mechanism in thermoforming processes of UD fibre reinforced thermoplastic laminates. Various methods {{have been developed to}} characterise this shear mechanism, but measured properties differ for several orders of magnitude. The potential of another technique is shown in this paper. This approach considers a strip with a rectangular cross section, subjected to torsion. Several analyses have been carried out to determine the significant material properties for this loading mechanism. For clarity, isotropic and orthotropic elastic material behaviour was considered first. The response torque mainly depends on the in-plane shear modulus G 12. An extension was made to the analysis of anisotropic viscous material behaviour. Closed form solutions and FE simulations were compared, using a fibre reinforced viscous fluid model. The torsional response of a partially <b>clamped</b> <b>strip</b> was highly influenced by the fibre stiffnesses. Nevertheless, it is possible to relate the longitudinal viscosity to a closed form solution directly, if bulging is not suppressed and constant through the length of the <b>strip.</b> A smart <b>clamping</b> design is therefore required...|$|R

The singular integral equations representing the boundary condition of this problem were solved numerically by the newly proposed method based on the boundary collocation. The stress intensity factor was calculated and it has been made clear that precise solutions can be obtained even when the number of the collocation points is small. The crack opening displacement was also calculated and a startling result has been obtained. In the neighborhood of the crack tip, the crack opening displacement exceeds the applied displacement between both sides of the strip...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{tensile test}} set-up was built and {{attached}} to an Instron 5566 to determine gluten extensibility, comparing the performance of strong and weak flour mixed for various mixing time. In this work, the gluten <b>strip</b> was <b>clamped</b> at two ends and extended upward at the centre by a hook at speed of 300 mm min- 1. Parameters such as gluten length at fracture, measured force, actual force acting on the gluten strips, strain, strain rate and stress were obtained. Gluten obtained from strong flour has greater extensibility compared to weak flour. The extensibility of gluten from both strong and weak flour dough increased as dough mixing time increased before decreasing at a peak of 8 min. The results demonstrated the capability of the tensile test set-up to describe the development of gluten during mixing of dough. Rheological characteristic of gluten indicated that gluten exhibited strain hardening effect during extension...|$|R

They buckle under a certain load just as a flat sheet. There is one optimum hole spacing and a corresponding buckling load in shear for each sheet width, sheet thickness, and flange form. Comparison with non-flanged sheets revealed a marked increase of buckling load in shear due to the flanging and a slightly greater displacement. <b>Strips</b> were <b>clamped</b> between two stationary end rails and one sliding center rail at which the shear is applied.

40|$|We present our {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} ‘mechanochemoelectrical’ behavior of tri-layer polypyrrole (PPy) -type conducting polymer sensors. One {{end of the}} polymer <b>strip</b> is <b>clamped</b> and the other—free end—is excited through a mechanical lever system, which provides sinusoidal displacement inputs. The voltage generated and current passing between the two outer PPy layers {{as a result of}} the displacement input is measured to model the output/input behaviour of the sensors through their experimental current/displacement and voltage/displacement frequency responses. We specifically targeted the low frequency behaviour of the sensor as it is a relatively slow system. Experimental transfer function models are generated for three sensors with the dimensions of (7. 5 mm× 1 mm× 0. 17 mm), (10 mm× 1 mm× 0. 17 mm), and (12. 5 mm× 1 mm× 0. 17 mm). These models are for use in understanding the dynamic behaviour and sensing ability of the polymers as mechanical sensors. The effect of the active sensor length on the voltage and current outputs are investigated that the shorter is the sensor length, the higher are the voltage output and the current passed. Also, their current and voltage responses under an impulse stimulus (i. e. displacement) are experimentally measured to show their dynamic sensing response...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effectiveness}} of applying a high-frequency, low-energy, reactive gas plasma {{for the removal}} of hydrocarbon contamination from specimens and components for electron microscopy has been investigated with a variety of analytical techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of specimens that have been plasma cleaned shows an elimination of the carbonaceous contamination from the specimen. With extended cleaning times the removal of existing carbon contamination debris due to previously conducted microanalysis is shown. Following plasma cleaning, specimens may be examined in the electron microscope for several hours without exhibiting evidence of recontamination. The {{effectiveness of}} plasma cleaning is not limited to applications for TEM specimens. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) specimens that have been plasma cleaned likewise show an elimination of carbonaceous contamination.

Fifty-one warm ischemic canine lungs were made by hilar <b>stripping</b> and <b>clamping</b> of the left PA, PV and bronchus for 2 - 3 hours. In the Non-perfusion group, GSH (50 mg/ kg, I. V. : Group II) and solcoseryl (50 mg/kg, I. V. : Group III) were administered. In the perfusion group, Euro-Collins (E-C) solution (20 ml/kg) was perfused (Group IV) and GSH (1 mg/ml in E-C solution: Group V) and SOD (15 mg/l in E-C solution : Group VI) were used for anti-oxidative drugs. The pulmonary arterial pressure and aortic pressure were measured and also blood gas analysis was made during the preischemic period, immediately after, one hour and 3 days after reperfusion. Small parts of pulmonary tissues were taken for pathological examination one hour and 3 days after reperfusion. Chest X-ray films were teken at 3 days after the operation. GSH, SOD, and solcoseryl effectively act as scavengers of active oxygen species (AOS), {{especially in terms of}} oxygenation.

Our choice of boundary conditions is not easily satisfied by the anisotropic structures, forcing a cooperation between bending and twisting deformations. We find that, despite clear physical differences between rods and strips, a naive Kirchhoff model works surprisingly well as an organizing framework for the experimental observations. In {{the context of this}} model, we observe that anisotropy creates new states and alters the connectivity between existing states. Our results are a preliminary look at relatively unstudied boundary conditions for rods and strips that may arise in a variety of engineering applications, and may guide the avoidance of jump phenomena in such settings...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{asymptotic}} behaviour of the high-frequency spectrum of the wave equation with periodic coefficients in a ‘thin’ elastic strip Ση=(0, 1) ×(−η/ 2, η/ 2), η > 0. The main geometric assumption is that the structure period is of the order of magnitude of the strip thickness η and is chosen in such a way that η− 1 is a positive large integer. On the boundary ∂Ση, we set Dirichlet (clamped) or Neumann (traction-free) boundary conditions. Aiming to describe sequences of eigenvalues of order η− 2 in the above problem, which correspond to oscillations of high frequencies of order η− 1, we study an appropriately rescaled limit of the spectrum. Using a suitable notion of two-scale convergence for bounded operators acting on two-scale spaces, we show that the limiting spectrum consists of two parts: the Bloch (or band) spectrum and the ‘boundary’ spectrum. The latter corresponds to sequences of eigenvectors concentrating on the vertical boundaries of Ση, and is characterised by a problem set in a semi-infinite periodic <b>strip</b> with either <b>clamped</b> or stress-free boundary conditions. Based on the observation that some of the related eigenvalues can be found by solving an appropriate periodic-cell problem, we use modal methods to investigate finite-thickness semi-infinite waveguides. We compare our results with those for finite-thickness infinite waveguides given in Adams et al. (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 464, 2008, pp. 2669 – 2692). We also study infinite-thickness semi-infinite waveguides in order to gain insight into the finite-height analogue. We develop an asymptotic algorithm making use of the unimodular property of the modal method to demonstrate that in the weak contrast limit, and when wavenumber across the guide is fixed, there is at most one surface wave per gap in the spectrum.

40|$|The ionic {{nature of}} the pace-maker current (delta Ip, If, Ih) was {{investigated}} in rabbit sino-atrial node using a single sucrose-gap voltage-clamp technique. The pace-maker current was activated by hyperpolarizing clamp steps negative to - 50 mV and the pace-maker potential was activated by an action potential or a depolarizing clamp step. Neither pace-maker current nor pace-maker potential were altered by addition of tetrodotoxin, but a tetrodotoxin-sensitive channel could be activated in sino-atrial nodal <b>strips</b> following hyperpolarizing <b>clamp</b> steps. Ca 2 +-channel blockers {{did not affect the}} voltage dependence of delta Ip or the maximum diastolic potential (m. d. p.) significantly. Removal of Ca 2 + did not affect the pace-maker current at clamp potentials near the pace-maker potential range (- 60 to - 80 mV), but it did reduce the potential dependence of the m. d. p. Removal of Na+ suppressed completely the pace-maker current and hyperpolarized the membrane. Removal of Na+ also increased membrane conductance, most likely through an increase in resting K+ permeability. Low concentration of Cs+ (less than 5 mM), but not Ba 2 + or tetraethylammonium, markedly suppressed activation delta Ip and reduced the rate of pacing slightly. Cs+ also decreased the membrane conductance and hyperpolarized the membrane. In 50 % of experiments designed to determine contribution of IK to pace-maker current, a double-pulse procedure revealed a time-dependent component of delta Ip which reversed near the K+ equilibrium potential, EK. Release of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing test clamps was followed by pace-maker potentials, the magnitudes of which were dependent on the test-clamp potential. The m. d. p. approached values near EK following depolarizing clamps and near - 45 mV following hyperpolarizing clamps. The results suggest that delta Ip is carried primarily by Na+ and is blocked by Cs+. It is likely, however, that Ca 2 + alters the rate of pacing not only through its contribution to the Isi system, but also through activation of a K+ conductance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn elastic <b>strip</b> is {{transversely}} <b>clamped</b> in {{a curved}} frame. The induced curvature decreases as the strip opens and connects to its flat natural shape. Various ribbon profiles are measured and the scaling {{law for the}} opening length validates a description where the in-plane stretching gradually relaxes the bending stress. An analytical model of the strip profile is proposed and a quantitative agreement is found with both experiments and simulations of the plates equations. This result provides a unique illustration of smooth nondevelopable solutions in thin sheets. Geometry-induced rigidity is a fundamental feature of thin structures [1], which has long been used in engineering and architecture to design stiff fuselages, hulls, roofs, and deployable structures [2 – 4]. It is also widely encountered in living structures, such as in plant leaves where curvature can prevent {{the collapse of the}} leaves under their own weight [5]. A simple illustration of this rigidity induced by curvature is given by a strip of paper held at one end. When the strip is flat, it is unable to sustain its own weight and bends downward under gravity. However, if the end of the paper is slightly curved transversely, the strip straightens up and becomes much stiffer. Rigidity in these systems arises because bending in one direction is coupled to the transverse curvature and cannot occur without stretching the sheet—a costly mode of deformation in thin plates in terms of elastic energy [6]. Knowing the distance over which an induced curvature spreads is thus an important issue for predicting the rigidity of thin plates and shells. In this Letter, we address the question of the persistence length of curvature in thin sheets on a minimal system: a flat elastic ribbon of thickness t, width W, and length L W, which is clamped at one end over a cylinder of radius R [Fig. 1 (a) ]. After what distance from the clamp does the ribbon unfold and recover its flat natural shape? This deceptively simple problem is actually not straightforward as, to unfold, the ribbon has to stretch—a forbidden mode of deformation in the inextensible limit. In thin sheets, this constraint is usually resolved by focusing the stretch in elastic defects or singularities, such as the ridges and peaks of a crumpled paper, the rest of the surface being fully developable (i. e. free of stretching) [7 – 14]. However, another way to obtain the stretching of a thin sheet is to consider that the curvature variation on large distances is associated with a regular stretching, i. e., without defects. Surprisingly, the first insights of this approach are found in the studies of defects such as ridges [15] and pinches [16], where both the focused-stress and the diffuse-stress are present [17]. In each of these situations, regular developable solutions exist away from the defect but they are not observed as the bending energy can be progressively released by a small in-plane stretching (see also [18, 19]). The stretching over large distances is also involved in the shape of drapes [20] and curtains [21], the tearing of sheets [22], or the dynamics of curved ribbons [23, 24]. Our prototypal system provides a reduced model to probe these situations and the transition between smooth and singular solutions in strained sheets. A first observation of the opening is displayed in Fig. 1 (b), using an acetate elastic sheet (t ¼ 110 m, W ¼ 4. 5 cm) clamped in a circular frame of radius R ¼ 2. 5 cm. The strip is positioned vertically to limit the out-of-plane deflection caused by its weight. Away from the <b>clamping,</b> the <b>strip</b> opens and its curvature decreases and connects to the flat stress-free region over a finite length L p. The opening also results in a small deflection of the strip corresponding to a tilt angle θ of the centerline. The persistence length of curvature L p can be estimated from a balance between the stretching and bending elastic energies using scaling arguments similar to [15]. On one hand, the bending energy of the ribbon scales as E b ∼ EtWL p ðt=RÞ 2, where E is the Young modulus of the medium. On the other hand, the opening of the ribbon requires the stretching of the edges of the ribbon over a length L p. This is associated with a stretching energy E s ∼ EtWL p 2, where ∼ Z 2 = 2 L 2 p is the typical in-plane strain and Z ∼ W 2 = 8 R is the out-of-plane deflection of the ribbon at the clamp [see Fig. 1 (b) inset]. The trade off between the two energies E s and E b gives L p ∼ W 2 = ffiffiffiffiffi tR p or equivalently [15] L p ∼ W ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Z=t p. The persistence length of the curved region is independent of the Young modulus and increases when the thickness is reduced...|$|R
