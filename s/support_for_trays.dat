40|$|Problems met in countercurrent {{separation}} {{units have}} been solved {{by means of}} a proper combination of two different models, referred to as sure and fast, to describe the whole set of theoretical stages. The "sure" model is employed <b>for</b> <b>trays</b> showing particular features, or disturbances, i. e. feed trays, partial condensers, reboilers, side cuts, intercoolers, etc. as well as <b>for</b> <b>trays</b> adjacent to the previous ones. This model is written in terms of single theoretical tray equations. The "fast" model is applied to multitray sections, provided that no "disturbance" exists, with an assumption that molar flowrates and temperatures vary according to prefixed laws. The adoption of effective K-values allows one to use formally the same operating equations for the multitray sections as <b>for</b> single theroretical <b>trays.</b> A Newton-Raphson procedure, combined with a B. P. method, is employed to converge the set of equations describing the problem. © 1982...|$|R

40|$|Fractionation {{is one of}} {{the pivotal}} unit {{operations}} in refineries and gas processing industries which is single largest energy-degrading processing unit utilized to separate mixtures into individual products. A reliable design method <b>for</b> sizing <b>tray</b> fractionators must take into account of foaming which is a major consideration in many process systems. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop simple predictive tool, which is simpler to use than current available techniques avoiding large number of parameters requiring less complicated and shorter computations, for accurate determination of downcomer velocity and vapor capacity factor as a function of tray spacing and density. The results can be used in follow-up design calculations to size fractionators without foaming formation <b>for</b> <b>tray</b> spacing up to 1. 2 Â m, vapor densities up to 100 Â kg/m 3 and liquid and vapor density differences up to 950 Â kg/m 3. The accuracy of the proposed equations was tested and found to be in excellent agreement with the reported data for the wide range of conditions, wherein the average absolute deviation percent of proposed equations are 0. 77 % and 2. 35 % for downcomer design velocity and vapor capacity factor respectively.

The flow pattern <b>for</b> the 95 <b>tray</b> is nearly in an ideal mode if suitable deflectors are set. The per <b>tray</b> pressure drop <b>for</b> the 95 <b>tray</b> is approximately one-half of that for a conventional sieve tray in the range of medium to high vapor flow rates, and the divergence of the per tray pressure drop between the two kinds of trays is increased with increasing vapor flow rate.

40|$|Using similar {{assumptions}} {{to those}} adopted in a companion paper (1) <b>for</b> <b>tray</b> column analysis, a parametric transfer-function (T. F. M.) is here derived completely analytically for packed, binary distillation columns. For simplicity, {{the method of}} calculation is illustrated for a column that is symmetrical statically and dynamically i. e. having a rectifier vapour/stripping section liquid capacitance ration c= 1. 0. This produces a completely diagonal T. F. M. between the sum and output composition changes and the circulating and product take-off flow rates. The T. F. M. is also presented for c= 1. 0 and although no longer diagonal at all frequencies, analysis and simulation show that the column behaviour is not greatly affected by changes in this parameter. Long packed columns are shown to produce novel nonminimum phase effects when twin product control is attempted, whereas, serious travelling-wave phenomena can limit controller performance in short columns. The possibility of zero separation-gain is also revealed. The computed shapes of inverse Nyquist loci are confirmed by analysis and by numerical time-domain simulation. The chief cause of discrepancy between tray and packed column behaviour is shown to result from the continuous equilibrium assumption <b>for</b> theoretical <b>trays...</b>|$|R
