5|$|On January 13, 1994, NASA {{declared}} the mission a complete success {{and showed the}} first <b>sharper</b> images. The mission {{was one of the}} most complex performed up until that date, involving five long extra-vehicular activity periods. Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope.|$|E

5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a <b>sharper</b> revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the studios}} {{were forced to}} {{streamline}} operations and rely on their own resources, their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much <b>sharper</b> focus. Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the studio system finally coalesce, with the individual studios {{coming to terms with}} their own identities and their respective positions within the industry.|$|E
5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times <b>sharper</b> than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming {{just a few}} months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were <b>sharper</b> than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the {{collision of}} a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce <b>sharper</b> changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having <b>sharper</b> teeth.|$|E

The <b>Sharps</b> and Hankins partnership ended in 1866, and <b>Sharps</b> resumed the manufacturing of firearms under the C. <b>Sharps</b> and Company name. In all, he was awarded a total of fifteen firearms-related patents.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the identity of the Central American species of the genus Phaenonotum <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, the type specimens of the species described by <b>Sharp</b> (1882) deposited in the David <b>Sharp</b> collection in the Natural History Museum in London have been re-examined. The following species are redescribed: Phaenonotum apicale <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, P. collare <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, P. dubium <b>Sharp,</b> 1882 (confirmed as junior synonym of P. exstriatum (Say, 1835)), P. laevicolle <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, P. rotundulum <b>Sharp,</b> 1882 and P. tarsale <b>Sharp,</b> 1882.

5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the <b>sharper</b> angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E
5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. <b>Sharper</b> cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the city}} bought the two private systems. Some {{elevated}} lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but several connections were built between the IND and BMT; these now operate as one division called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, <b>sharper</b> curves, and stations {{are too small}} and therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. However, many passenger transfers between stations of all three former companies have been created, allowing the entire network {{to be treated as}} a single unit.|$|E
50|$|Richard Hey <b>Sharp</b> {{was born}} on 2 June 1793 to Richard <b>Sharp</b> and Mary (née Turton) and baptised in Batley two days later. Richard was the eldest of five {{children}} including the surgeon and promoter of museums William <b>Sharp</b> and Samuel <b>Sharp</b> who followed his brother into a career in architecture. Initially living in Gildersome, the family had moved to Armley {{by the end of}} the 18th century where his father was a drysalter. The <b>Sharps</b> were from an ancient Yorkshire family which included the mathematician Abraham <b>Sharp,</b> the Archbishop of York John <b>Sharp,</b> Archdeacon of Northumbria Thomas <b>Sharp,</b> the surgeon William <b>Sharp</b> and the abolitionist Granville <b>Sharp.</b> Richard's paternal grandmother, Sarah Hey, was the sister of the surgeon and twice mayor of Leeds William Hey, theologian John Hey and academic and essayist Richard Hey.|$|R

5|$|On July 12, 2002, a Halo {{port for}} Windows was {{announced}} {{to be under}} development by Gearbox Software. Its showing at E3 2003 was positively received by some critics, with skepticism by others. It was released on September 30, 2003, and included support for online multiplayer play and featured <b>sharper</b> graphics, but had compatibility issues that caused poor performance. Halo was later released for Mac OS X on December 11, 2003. On December 4, 2007, the game became available for the Xbox 360 via download from the Xbox Live Marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at <b>sharper</b> angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and <b>sharper</b> cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{anagenesis}} {{was confirmed by}} John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. They compared a small Einiosaurus specimen, MOR4568-8-87-1, with Achelousaurus specimen MOR591. Both proved to be quite similar, with the main differences being a longer face in MOR4568-8-87-1, and a <b>sharper</b> supraorbital horncore in MOR591. They concluded that Achelousaurus was likely the direct descendant of Einiosaurus. The more adult Einiosaurus individuals approached the Achelousaurus morphology. The {{differences between the two}} taxa would have been caused by heterochrony – differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{the launch of the}} telescope, the {{returned}} images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be <b>sharper</b> than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E
5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with <b>sharper</b> senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
