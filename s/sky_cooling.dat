The night <b>sky</b> <b>cooling</b> method is based on the long wave radiation of unglazed collectors to the sky at night. An evaluation of the night <b>sky</b> <b>cooling</b> system is present for a residential building in three cities of Australia, namely Alice Springs, Darwin and Melbourne. The system comprises an unglazed flat plate solar collector integrated with borehole storage. It uses night sky radiation to reduce the temperature of the ground near to the boreholes. The system was simulated with TRNSYS, a transient simulation program. The simulation results for adequately sized systems show that night sky radiation is able to reduce the coolth storage borehole temperature and the proposed system is able to meet the cooling load of the residential building simulated in three locations. Borehole lengths of 270, 318 and 106 m are required for coolth storage with 90, 260 and 14 m 2 collector area for heat rejection in Alice Springs, Darwin and Melbourne, respectively. At the 20 th simulation year, the proposed system is able to achieve a system cooling coefficient of performance of 2. 2 in Alice Springs, and 2. 8 in Darwin and Melbourne...|$|E

However, there are very limited studies on indoor thermal environment inside PHs, with their inadequacies. Therefore, an experimental study on the indoor thermal environments in an experimental PH located in the subtropics is reported in this paper. The study results suggested that at closed door and window situation, the air temperature inside the experimental PH was very high at daytime in summer, but very low at nighttime in winter. In addition, the variation of the air temperature inside the PH appeared synchronously with that of outdoor air temperature at daytime in summer, suggesting insignificant thermal mass of envelope to store solar heat gain. Furthermore, in both winter and summer, indoor air temperature stratification was observed. At daytime, indoor air temperature was increased with the height but at nighttime, decreased with the height.

In this paper, a study of developing an alternative general method for evaluating atmospheric down-welling radiation values to the water pond-based empirical formula by Clark and Allen is reported. The validity of the alternative general method has been demonstrated by comparing the atmospheric down-welling radiation values evaluated using the alternative general method and that using the Clark and Allen's formula. Since the alternative general method developed {{is based on a}} building roof system, and no water is involved, the alternative general method developed in this paper appears to have more advantages. On one hand, this could eliminate any potential impacts on prediction accuracy when water is used in different climates. On the other hand, the application of the alternative general method is relatively easier as only a suitable existing roof system is required.

40|$|Silicon wafer {{fabrication}} facilities require {{a significant amount}} of temperate cooling water to meet high internal cooling loads. The tertiary chilled water systems operate year round to fulfil the constant cooling load needed for production. Conventional chillers require a large amount of electricity to cool the water by the vapor compression cycle. As energy costs increase and environmental stewardship becomes the norm in industry, sustainable technologies are needed to chill process cooling water without the significant energy consumption of today’s chillers. Night sky radiation cools a medium by radiating heat from a warm medium to the colder night sky. The Intel silicon wafer manufacturing facility in Rio Rancho, New Mexico was selected to be an ideal location for the implementation of two full-scale designs. Numerous system designs were examined during a thorough literature survey, and an open water system was chosen as the best alternative because of its superior heat transfer ability and lower construction cost. At the suggestion of an external auditor, a closed system was studied further, designed, and economically analyzed. Recommendations for system choice are based on economic analyses, system operability, and environmental considerations. To aid in model construction and full-scale design, an extensive research program was developed to confirm literature correlations and determine the effectiveness of radiation to the night sky as a method used to cool water. Experiments that cooled an aluminum plate through the ambient temperature were used to confirm and verify the accuracy of Berdahl and Martin’s correlation for calculating the effective temperature of the night sky. A prototype for the open water system was built to demonstrate the cooling ability of the design. Operation of the prototype successfully demonstrated radiative night <b>sky</b> <b>cooling,</b> showed the benefit of convective heat transfer when the ambient air temperature is below the water temperature, and validated Berdahl and Martin’s model. With the experimental stage complete, the prototype system was scaled-up to a system for the Intel facility in Rio Rancho. The system diverts cooling water from Intel’s cooling water system into surge tanks. From the surge tanks, water is pumped up to the roof and is distributed among corrugated metal roofing units placed on top of the Intel central utilities building. The corrugated panels are supported by a pressure treated lumber frame. The chilled water isdistributed and collected by a PVC piping network. Model simulations of the full-scale system determined the cooling capability of the system. The full-scale simulation predicted that the system would eliminate over 90 % of the night-time chiller cooling loads during the winter. Throughout the year, the chillers use $ 280, 000 worth of electricity 1. The radiative cooling system will save the company $ 75, 000 in annual electricity costs, a decrease in electricity consumption of 27 %. The electricity generation portfolio of PNM, Intel’s electricity provider, was used to determine that the system will prevent approximately 930 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. The reduction of produced electricity will also conserve 4, 220, 000 gallons of water, a scarce resource in the southwestern Unites States. For the open system, the total capital cost is $ 353, 500 and the operating cost, including electricity to operate the unit, is $ 31, 600 /year. For the closed system, the total capital cost is $ 636, 500 and the operating cost, including electricity to operate the unit, is $ 12, 000 /year. The average net reduction in annual electrical usage is 1, 282 MW-hr and the average yearly electrical cost savings is $ 75, 265 for both systems. The payback period for the open and closed systems are estimated to be 4. 77 years and 6. 8 years, respectively. The radiative cooling system will economically benefit the Intel facility; however, the reduction in carbon emissions and water usage is of immense importance to the public and a company as dedicated to environmental initiatives as is Intel...|$|E

H 577 P BSE 2017 Wangxxv, 195 pages :color illustrationsNatural {{disasters}} have {{an increased}} occurrence rate in recent decades, and hence providing disaster victims with a temporary housing {{has always been one}} of the key problems to be addressed in disaster management. Prefabricated houses (PHs) can be very effective in quickly providing disaster victims with a temporary living place whenever there is a natural disaster. Currently, most existing research and development efforts related to indoor thermal environment and comfort mainly focused on providing occupants with a comfortable indoor thermal environment and improving energy use efficiency in conventional permanent buildings. However, temporary PHs are much different from conventional permanent buildings due to their inherent characteristics. Unlike in conventional buildings, environmental control systems are normally not installed inside PHs so that unbearable indoor thermal environment can be often experienced by their occupants. On the other hand, although temporary PHs for disaster relief are intended for temporary purpose, unfortunately, they are increasingly used for a prolonged time period of up to several years. Therefore, it has become highly necessary to study the thermal environment inside temporary PHs used for disaster relief in order to provide their occupants or disaster victims with a more acceptable thermal environment. Consequently, a programmed research work on studying the thermal environment inside PHs used for disaster relief has been carried out and is reported in this thesis. This thesis begins firstly with reporting a study on measuring the actual yearly indoor thermal environments in an experimental PH located in the subtropical Chengdu City, China. The measured results suggested that at closed door and windows condition, the air temperature inside the experimental PH was very high at daytime in summer, but very low at nighttime in winter. Therefore, the actual thermal environment inside the experimental PH was highly unacceptable if it was used on a long-term basis. The variation of the air temperature inside the PH appeared synchronized with that of outdoor air temperature at daytime in summer, suggesting the insignificant thermal mass of its envelope to store solar heat gain. The measured results also indicated an indoor air temperature stratification inside the PH in both winter and summer. At daytime, indoor air temperature was increased with the height but at nighttime, decreased with the height. Besides, at nighttime in both winter and summer, the external surface temperature of PH's roof was lower than the outdoor air temperature, reflecting the <b>sky</b> <b>cooling</b> effects for the experimental PH. Secondly, the thesis presents a numerical study on both the thermal performances of the experimental PH's envelope, and the effectiveness of applying various passive cooling measures to the PH for improving its indoor thermal environment in summer. A numerical model for the experimental PH was firstly developed using Energyplus and validated using the measured results from the experimental PH. Using the validated model, a detailed breakdown of summer heat gain by the PH was then numerically evaluated. The results showed that PH's windows were responsible for the lion's share of the total heat gain, followed by the roof and east wall. Thereafter, the effectiveness of applying four passive cooling measures, individually or in combination, to the PH was numerically studied using the validated model. The study results suggested that adding a thin movable fabric layer of 0. 9 reflectance to the walls and roof of the PH, and applying external window blinds would lead to a very high percentage reduction in unacceptable hours for occupants, without however the need to implement all the four passive measures, so as to save the implementation cost. Thirdly, using the validated model, a further numerical study on various design issues for a disaster relief PH, including orientation, natural ventilation strategies and window to wall ratio (WWR), to achieve an improved indoor thermal environment, is presented. The numerical study results demonstrated that under the climate condition of Chengdu City, the orientation for the PH would have an obvious effect on its indoor thermal environment, with a south-facing orientation being the most favourable for the PH. In addition, in contrast to that in conventional permanent buildings, the use of daytime ventilation was more effective than the use of nighttime ventilation in the PH for improving its indoor thermal environment. Lastly, the study results suggested that there was an optimum value of ~ 20 % for WWR for the PH, at which its indoor thermal environment was the least unacceptable for PH's occupants. Finally, a study on developing an alternative general method (AGM) which is valid for all climate conditions and easy to be implemented, to evaluate the atmospheric downwelling radiation (ADR) values is reported. The AGM was developed based on the heat exchange of long wave radiation between a horizontal upward facing surface and the sky. Using the AGM developed, the ADR values in Chengdu, China, were evaluated based {{on the roof of the}} experimental PH, and its validity was demonstrated by comparing the ADR values evaluated using the AGM developed and that using the widely used Clark and Allen's formula, which is based on a water pond. Since the AGM developed was based on a roof surface, and no water was involved, the AGM developed appeared more advantageous. On one hand, this could eliminate any potential influence on evaluation accuracy when water was used in different climates. On the other hand, the application of the AGM was relatively easier as only a suitable existing roof system was required. Therefore, the use of AGM can provide a more reliable and low-cost alternative to evaluate ADR values, when compared to using Clark and Allen's empirical formula.

During the dry, temperatures range from 15 to 18 degrees Celsius at night to 28 to 30 degrees Celsius during the day. There is virtually no rainfall, clear blue <b>skies</b> and <b>cool</b> ocean breezes. The wet season brings the monsoon weather with hot and humid days ranging from 31 to 35 degrees Celsius and warm nights. Electrical storms are spectacular and there can be cyclonic activity. Humidity is high and rainfall averages between 100 and 300 milli-metres per month with an annual rainfall around 1100 milli-metres.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh Museum's Olive Trees: Bright Blue <b>Sky</b> (F709) of <b>cool,</b> blue {{daylight}} tones {{is similar}} to Göteborgs Museum of Art's Olive Grove, a study in warm autumn colors. The autumn toned painting met van Gogh's goal of achieving a [...] "harsh and coarse" [...] realism to his work. He presented the painting to his friend and doctor, Dr. Gachet, with whom he would be under care and supervision in Auvers-sur-Oise the following year.|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} {{distribution of the}} clear <b>sky</b> longwave <b>cooling</b> of the atmosphere over tropical oceans is inferred from three different datasets. Two of the datasets refer to the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) NOAA/NASA Pathfinder project, PathA and PathB, {{and the last one}} refers to the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA- 15). Differences are identified originating from the temperature and water vapor fields. They affect the geo-graphical distribution of the longwave fields to various degrees. However, the three datasets lead to similar conclusions concerning the sensitivity of the clear <b>sky</b> total longwave <b>cooling</b> to SST variations. For the highest values of the SST (greater than 278 C), positively correlated to the increased efficiency of the longwave trapping (super-greenhouse effect), the atmosphere shows a lesser efficiency to cool radiatively. The atmosphere does reradiate the longwave radiation toward the surface as efficiently as it traps it. This is verified on regional as well as on seasonal scales. Such longwave cooling behavior is due to an increased mid- and upper-tropospheric humidity resulting from convective transports. The three datasets agree with the {{vertical distribution}} of the radiative cooling variations from normal to favorable to super-greenhouse effect conditions, except in the bound-ary layer, where the coarse resolution of the TOVS-retrieved data makes them not reliable in it. In ‘‘normal’’ conditions the cooling uniformly increases over the vertical with the SST. Over 278 C, the cooling is intensified above 400 hPa and reduced between 900 and 400 hPa. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Wakenaam is {{an island}} of about 17.5 sq mi {{at the mouth of}} the Essequibo River of Guyana. One of the largest islands (the others being Leguan and Hog Island) in the Essequibo Islands group, it was settled at one time by the Dutch in the 18th Century; the name Wakenaam is Dutch meaning [...] "waiting for a name" [...] and still {{contains}} old Dutch graves at various locations on the island. The island, like most other islands in the Essequibo River in Guyana, is characterized by green vegetation, blue <b>skies</b> and <b>cool</b> breeze from the Atlantic. Wakenaam has multiple villages which include Maria's Pleasure, Good Success, Sans Souci, Melville, Belle Plaine, Sarah, Zeelandia, Friendship, Bank Hall, Meer Zorg, Caledonia, Free and Easy, Arthurville, Palmyra, Maria Johanna, Domburg, Fredericksburg, Noitgedacht, Rush Brook and Ridge.|$|R
