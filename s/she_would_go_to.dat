5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored {{the fact that she}} would have to return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E

25|$|Donna Kozlowski {{played by}} Jillian Armenante: He is Amy's clerk. An {{eccentric}} woman, she {{is from a}} wealthy family, but estranged from them. Donna is a genius (she finishes her law degree in {{one and a half}} years) and socially awkward. She is married to a convicted murderer, Oscar Ray Pant, and becomes roommates with Amy's brother Vincent. While living with him, she has a daughter by Oscar, Ariadne Gray Pant, to whom she gives birth in a plastic pool in Amy's living room. Her mother arrives while Donna is in the pool, but is unable to offer her support and leaves. Maxine ends up getting in the pool with Donna. Later, Oscar confesses to Donna that he is really guilty and she divorces him.

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, she {{published}} an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences {{when she was}} allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story. Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her go because he believed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the police and tell them where they were hiding. She claimed that Constanzo {{and the rest of}} the group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was looking for them, but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives. She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial. Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment. She also questioned the police's decision to burn down the shack in Santa Elena, since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.|$|E

Pamela Anderson, in an early 2008 interview, said Wintour was the living person she most despised [...] "because she bullies young designers and models to use and wear fur." ...|$|E

The wheels in Hazel's head begin unaccustomed turnings, and {{sometime}} later when Mac passes Hazel on the street, Mac is surprised to see his friend carrying a baseball bat. When the scene returns to Doc's lab, he is receiving treatment from a real doctor and trying to puzzle out how he broke his arm. Suzy comes in, and makes soup for him as Hazel and Mac take turns watching at the keyhole. Doc admits that he needs and loves Suzy, and they embrace.

500|$|Criminal {{police chief}} Cesar Guardia said Van der Sloot [...] "let slip {{that he knew}} the place" [...] where Holloway's body is buried. Guardia stated that the {{interrogation}} was limited to their case in Peru, which he considered [...] "practically closed", and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided. Guardia said that the confession contains lies because Van der Sloot's [...] "toxicological report shows no signs that he had ingested any kind of drug." [...] Felonies committed {{under the influence of}} drugs can gain leniency in Peruvian courts. Guardia said that the motive for the crime was robbery. Van der Sloot reportedly offered a different motive for killing Flores, stating that he [...] "feared that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the police". On 14 June, Peruvian authorities released written transcripts of Van der Sloot's alleged confession. His mother Anita expressed concern that her son's confession may have been coerced. According to Van der Sloot's former attorney Luz Maria Romero Chinchay, his mother advised him not to make any statements nor sign anything, but it was too late.|$|E

O'Reilly described Naomi as having a [...] "good heart", but when it came to getting what she wants, some of her actions were [...] "questionable". She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the [...] "finer things in life". The actress continued, [...] "On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play." [...] O'Reilly did not think Naomi was bad, but she was spoilt and always tried to get her own way. However, underneath the surface, she was kind and caring. When asked whether viewers would like Naomi, O'Reilly believed that she could turn out to be a [...] "character everyone loves to hate".|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiences}} of Brandi Byrd illustrate another problematic case. Byrd {{was out with}} {{a friend who was}} charged with DUI.

After sitting in jail for six days, Byrd went to court.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1850 {{his bright}} nine-year-old {{daughter}} Annie who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick and, after a painful illness, died on 23 April 1851. During Annie's long illness Darwin had read books by Francis William Newman, a Unitarian evolutionist who called for a new post-Christian synthesis and wrote that [...] "the fretfulness of a child is an infinite evil". Darwin wrote at the time, [...] "Our only consolation is that she passed a short, though joyous life." [...] For three years he had deliberated about the Christian meaning of mortality. This opened a new vision of tragically circumstantial nature. His faith in Christianity had already dwindled away and he had stopped going to church. He wrote out his memories of Annie, but no longer believed in an afterlife or in salvation. Emma believed that Annie had gone to heaven and told this to the children, with the unfortunate result that Henrietta wondered, if all the angels were men, did women go to heaven?, and worried for months that her naughtiness while Annie was alive would mean that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hell unless God forgave her.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mention of}} any {{tensions}} between Jane {{and her husband}} came long after their deaths, when George Wyatt called her [...] "wicked wife, accuser of her own husband, even to the seeking of his own blood," [...] in his biography of [...] Queen Anne, but this view would have been informed by the disastrous Katherine Howard episode, where both she and the queen were executed for treason, and Wyatt's own attempts to exonerate the late Queen. Subsequent generations of historians also believed that Jane's testimony against her husband and sister-in-law in 1536 was motivated by spite rather than any actual belief in their guilt, hence her generally unfavourable historical reputation. A century later, an historian asserted that the reason Jane had testified against them was based purely on her [...] "inveterate hatred" [...] of Queen Anne, which sprang from jealousy at Anne's superior social skills and George's preference for his sister's company to his wife's. This assertion, while romantic, does not hold merit {{when looking at the}} actual records of the period; not only is there no mention of any serious rift between the couple (and the few mentions of their marriage imply at least a tolerable relationship), but by the death of Jane Seymour, Jane had already rebuilt her reputation at court and been one of the Queen's chief mourners (<b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> serve two more of Henry's queens). Georgian and Victorian histories pointed to Jane's own eventual violent death in 1542 to suggest that moral justice had triumphed because [...] "the infamous Lady Rochford... justly deserved her fate for the concern which she had in bringing Anne Boleyn, as well as her own husband, to the block". This view of Jane as accuser, despite lacking historicity, gained traction after her death, and was popularized by subsequent historians.|$|E
