40|$|In the National Survey of Families and Households a {{face-to-face}} interview {{was conducted with}} a randomly selected adult member of each sample household. In addition, if this primary respondent was currently married or cohabiting (with an opposite sex lover/partner) the <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner was {{asked to complete a}} questionnaire covering a variety of aspects of family life. The questionnaire took about 30 minutes to complete. The <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner {{is referred to as the}} "secondary respondent. " (See Sweet, Bumpass, and Call (1988) for a detailed description of survey procedures and content.) The major purposes of the secondary respondent questionnaire were: 1. to obtain current and retrospective characteristics of the <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner directly from him or her, rather than by means of proxy reports from the primary respondent; 2. to obtain information on the relationship between the partners and parenting information from each partner; and 3. to obtain measures of various attitudes and opinions from the <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner.
