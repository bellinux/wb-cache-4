25|$|In 1765 Sir Humphrey Sturt, a local {{landowner}} and MP {{purchased the}} island, {{which in turn}} passed to his sons. Sturt expanded the castle and records suggest that he spent £50,000 on enhancing the island's gardens. Sir Augustus John Foster, a retired British diplomat, bought the island in 1840. Foster experienced bouts of depression and died in Brownsea Castle in 1848 when he slit his throat. In 1852 Brownsea was again up for sale and was sold for £13,000. It was purchased by William Waugh, a former Colonel in the British Army in the belief he could exploit the white clay deposits on the island to manufacture high quality porcelain. A three-storey pottery was built in south-west corner of the island together with a tramway to transport the clay from clay pits in the north. He hoped the clay would be of the same quality as the nearby Furzebrook clay, {{but it turned out}} to be suitable only for <b>sanitary</b> <b>ware.</b> The company employed over 200 people but by 1887 the venture closed due to a lack of demand and the poor quality of the clay.|$|E

5000|$|The Cornsay Colliery, {{worked by}} Messrs. Ferens and Love, was first opened out in 1868, and is {{situated}} within the township of Cornsay, {{but in this}} parish. There are four seams, the whole of which are worked by drifts into the hillsides. The 'Harvey' is 2 feet 8 inches thick; the 'Ballarat' 1 foot 9 inches; the 'Five Quarter' 2 feet 2 inches to 3 feet 6 inches, and the Main coal is 3 feet. The names of the drifts are Low Drift, High Drift, Colpike Drift, and Ford Drift, which give a daily output amounting to 750 tons, about the half of which is converted into coke on the spot, there being 270 ovens. A great feature of this pit is that it yields a splendid fire-clay, which supplies the rather extensive brick, tile, and sanitary pipe-works {{in connection with the}} colliery. It is contemplated by the owners to lay down plant for the manufacture of glazed, <b>sanitary,</b> and other <b>ware,</b> for which the clay is so well adapted. This colliery in its various departments gives employment to an average of 700 men and boys. The royalties worked, besides a large area of freehold owned by themselves, are leased from Ushaw College, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and Miss Taylor-Smith. Hamsteels Collieries and Coke Ovens were commenced in 1867 by Messrs. R. S. Johnson and T. M. Reay, and are now carried on under the title of 'The Owners of Hamsteels Collieries.' There are four seams met and worked, 'The Brockwell' having an average thickness of 3 feet 6 inches; the 'Upper Busty' 1 foot 8 inches; the 'Lower Busty' 2 feet 4 inches; and the [...] "Harvey" [...] about 3 feet 8 inches. The latter seam, which was drifted in 1890, is not of equal quality to the others. There are two shafts 35 and 20 fathoms, as well as three drifts, giving a total yearly output of (when fully working) 280,000 tons. Three-fourths of this output is converted into coke on the spot. This colliery gives employment in its various branches to 680 men and boys. At Malton, coal has also been wrought since 1870, the Malton being in that year opened by Mr. G. Love. It is now worked by S. A. Sadler, Esq., of Middlesbrough. The Harvey, Brockwell, and Busty seams are met here, and worked by drifts, the thickness of the seams ranging from two to four feet. Patent ovens and other important improvements are rapidly developing, and ere long this colliery will employ a large number of men.Cornsay Colliery is a populous village situated on a hillside on the north bank of the Dearness, seven miles and a half west of Durham, and two miles west of Esh.

Here dwell most of the employees of the Hamsteels colliery, and here also is the church, the schools, and Wesleyan and Primitive chapels.Malton is a small colliery village, about {{a mile and a half}} from Quebec. Coal has been worked here for some time, but only in a small way up to the present; there is, however, every prospect of this becoming a large and populous colliery village, as preparations are being made to open out what promises to be a large coal royalty.The Church is a small plain stone building in the Early English style, built in 1875.
