25|$|Changes in European Community {{rules in}} 1984 allowed any carrier to operate intra-European routes, granted that they {{connected}} two regional airports.

40|$|As major {{airports}} in the United States have reached their maximum capacity and became congested, available capacity at surrounding airports has been utilized by {{the emergence of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>airports.</b> Given the expectation of a larger number of operations in the National Airspace System (NAS) in the upcoming years, this trend of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> emergence is likely to strengthen. In order to understand the dynamics of the regional airport systems, a study of the factors that led to the emergence of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> was performed. The distribution of population at the regional level, the existence and the proximity of a secondary basin of population close to <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> were identified as major factors. Ground access and airport infrastructure were also enabling factors. The nature of the regional airport system, in terms of “Hub” versus “non-Hub” was also identified as a contributing factor. The entry of a low cost carrier was determined to be the essential stimulus in the emergence phenomenon. These entries modify the airport dynamics resulting in the stimulation of both local and peripheral markets. Following the entry of a low cost carrier several other carriers, both legacy and low cost, enter and consolidate the growth of the emerging airport. As a consequence of the emergence of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> and their integration into a region wide multi-airport system, they induce impacts on the NAS structure. Recent consolidations of TRACONs (Terminal Area Control) were identified as primary impacts. As there will be increasing pressure of demand on core {{airports in}} the upcoming years, the development of additional <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> will be required. The transition from a single core airport to region wide multi-airport systems and the emergence of new <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> in existing multi-airport systems, impose new constraints that need {{to be taken into account}} in the NAS improvements...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of no-frills airlines is promoting a remarkable {{expansion in the}} number of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> in major metropolitan areas. These new carriers are creating a significant alternative to the traditional full-service carriers. In effect, they are establishing a parallel market and corresponding network of airports. This conclusion results from the analysis of a worldwide database on major metropolitan airports. This effect supplements the "number of originating passengers", that has been the traditional significant factor that promotes the establishment of viable multi-airport systems. This factor maintains its importance, but no longer is as decisive as it has been. Airlines and airport policies further reinforce the independent network of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports.</b> Nofrills airlines that sell only through the web to customers effectively cause their services at <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> to disappear from the airline reservation systems. Airports that choose not to provide low-cost service to no-frills airlines likewise strengthen the role of the <b>secondary</b> <b>airports.</b> Such strategies, most visible in Europe, have led to a remarkable proliferation of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> in unexpected areas. This trend implies a traffic shift away from the expensive, congested airports toward the no-frills, inexpensive and uncongested airports in major metropolitan areas. If the current major airlines do shrink substantially, as could happen, this would greatly change the pattern of airport traffic in major metropolitan areas...|$|R
25|$|The {{armed forces}} signed an {{agreement}} with Braathens, resulting in the airline taking over the three weekly Oslo-services from 1 January 1999. The airport hit a temporary high 190,000 passengers in 2000, largely because of increased military activity. This dropped to 150,000 in 2003. A new terminal opened on 16 January 2004, costing NOK5.85 million. Construction took four months and the main contractor, Thor Olsen, built the terminal without profits. The old terminal building was demolished free of charge. SAS and Braathens merged in 2004, creating SAS Braathens.

25|$|From 1962 until 1998, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (ORD) was {{the busiest}} {{airport in the}} world, {{measured}} {{both in terms of}} total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by Atlanta's Hartsfield in 1998, with 59.3million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4million international passengers in 2008, O'Hare remains one of the two or three busiest airports in the world, and some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major hub for United Airlines and American Airlines, and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world until supplanted by O'Hare in 1962, is now the <b>secondary</b> <b>airport</b> in the Chicago metropolitan area. For a time in the late 1960s and 1970s, Midway was nearly vacant except for general aviation, but growth in the area, combined with political deadlock over the building of a new major airport in the region, has caused a resurgence for Midway. It is now a major hub for Southwest Airlines, and services many other airlines as well. Midway served 17.3million domestic and international passengers in 2008.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} demand for air {{transportation}} and limited capacity at major airports, {{there is a need}} to increase the capacity of airport systems at the metropolitan area level. The increased use of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> has been and is expected to be one of the key mechanisms by which future demand is met in congested metropolitan areas. This thesis provides an analysis of the factors influencing the emergence of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> and the dynamics of multi-airport systems. The congestion of the core airport, the distribution of population at the regional level, the existence and the proximity of a secondary basin of population close to <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> were identified as major factors. Ground access and airport infrastructure, the low level of connecting passengers at the core airport were also identified as a contributing factors. The entry of an air carrier -generally a low-cost carrier- was determined to be an essential stimulus in the emergence phenomenon impacting fares and airport competition levels resulting in market stimulation. But the emergence of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> imposes new constraints that need to be taken into account in the national air transportation system improvements. By providing an identification of the factors that influence the emergence of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> and an understanding of the dynamics of regional airport systems this research provides useful support for the planning and the future development of multi-airport systems. by Philippe A.

It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the core}} {{characteristics}} of Low-Cost Carrier (LCCs) is their use of <b>secondary</b> and regional <b>airports.</b> However, nothing is fixed as the market constantly evolves and carriers modify their strategies {{in order to achieve}} growth. This paper uses the examples of Ryanair, easyJet and Norwegian to show how changes to LCC business models are affecting <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> across Europe. Using a content analysis, this paper first describes how airport choice factors for LCCs have evolved over the last 10 years. This is followed by a data analysis of historical and current airline network capacity to identify how LCC traffic at <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> is developing. The paper finds that cost, demand and efficiency are still the most important criteria for LCCs when choosing an airport to operate from. However, it also identifies that LCCs have become more interested in serving business passengers, which is why they are increasingly using primary airports (accounting for 58 % of their recent capacity growth). Through the use of a selection of case airports it is finally concluded that the evolution of LCCs increases competition between primary and secondary gateways. In most cases, <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> are losing a significant amount of LCC traffic and only sustain flights to less important destinations. This research puts into question the future importance of <b>secondary</b> <b>airports</b> for LCCs. As not all airports have been impacted by the hybridisation of LCCs to the same extent, the results are not equally applicable to the whole European airport industry...|$|R
