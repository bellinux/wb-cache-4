25|$|If a {{game has}} an {{information}} set {{with more than}} one member that game is said to have imperfect information.

Any game without perfect information has imperfect information.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated an A, being described as [...] "an expertly paced race against time". The handling of Anderson's pregnancy was called [...] "creative", while the re-opening of the X-Files unit and the revelation of Krycek as a villainous character were noted as highlights. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen called [...] "Ascension" [...] an [...] "essential" [...] episode, adding that it serves to [...] "raise the stakes without losing {{the core of the}} show's appeal, and solve a technical problem in the most creatively satisfying way possible". Handlen also praised Nicholas Lea's portrayal of agent Alex Krycek, but felt that the character's role as a double agent was revealed too soon in the series. Critical Myth gave this episode 9/10, stating [...] "s convoluted and bastardized as that plot thread would become, at this <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{it was one of the}} best episodes of the series to date." ...|$|E

500|$|New {{developments}} in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> but periodically one is perfected {{to make this a}} greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed [...] "Pan-focus", as I have been active for two years in its development and used {{it for the first time}} in Citizen Kane. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Both Bertz and Griffin {{criticized the}} game's incompetent hit detection system, {{which made the}} experience unfair. Bertz described the game's gunplay as [...] "servicable", while Leack noticed a delay in shooting, which drags the game's pace and leads to a steep learning curve. However, Leack appreciated the game's map design, which opened many possibilities. He also praised its attention to detail and sound design, which can often make a multiplayer match feel like a [...] "great action film". Bertz was disappointed {{by the lack of}} customization options, which did not offer long-term progression for the players. Butterworth similarly criticized the progression system for being slow. As players cannot play as the same operator in the same match, he was often forced to play as the generic [...] "recruit" [...] character when he was only at the beginning <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> He also criticized the limited weapon customization options, which barely affect gameplay. McCaffery described customization as the [...] "least interesting" [...] aspect of the game, and claimed that most gameplay features were locked when players started playing. Griffin, Gies, and Steven Burns from VideoGamer.com were annoyed by the microtransactions featured in the game, with Griffin describing it as a greedy attempt by Ubisoft to make more money, though Davenport did not mind these features as they were limited to cosmetic items and could be unlocked through earning Renown. Bertz was annoyed the lack of clan infrastructure, which may cause players troubles when they were finding matches, while Griffin thought that map rotation often felt random and was disappointed that players cannot vote to decide which map they are going to play next.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the proof}} of a winning {{strategy}} for the first player, {{it is known that}} the hex board must have a complex type of connectivity which has never been solved. Play consists of creating small patterns which have a simpler type of connectivity called [...] "safely connected", and joining them into sequences that form a [...] "path". Eventually, one of the players will succeed in forming a safely connected path of stones and spaces between his sides of the board and win. [...] The final <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> if necessary, consists of filling in the empty spaces in the path.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for IGN, Mikel Reparaz {{gave the}} game an 8.5/10, praising its vibrant, ambitious and {{unexpectedly}} huge open world, featuring natural and fluid parkour movement, enjoyable co-operative multiplayer, increasingly satisfying combat, {{as well as}} the rewarding, memorable and often surprising side-missions, which he described as [...] "the part that the storytelling really shines". However, he criticized the under-developed characters, clichéd antagonist, unstable online matchmaking, occasionally clumsy combat and the punishing difficulty in the early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> He summarized the review by saying that [...] "Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. It {{is one of the most}} engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while." ...|$|E

In a multi-stage game we will assume that <b>the</b> rationality level <b>of</b> a player indicates <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> where he puts cognitive effort to calculate optimal actions. A player of rationality level k plays optimaly in <b>the</b> last k <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and randomizes uniformly {{in the first}} m − k, where m is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> We apply this concept to a Hotelling twostage model and we show that firms with rationality above or equal to 2 choose to locate in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> a set of locations; so minimum differentiation across different rationality levels is achieved...|$|R
