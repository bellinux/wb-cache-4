500|$|The gallery has an {{extensive}} collection of about 60 portraits, including Van Dyck's War and Peace, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Frans Pourbus the Younger aristocratic portrait of Claude Lorraine, Duc de Chevreuse, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II {{and others of}} him by court artist Sir Peter Lely, and portraits of George Digby, Second Earl of Bristol and William, First Duke of Bedford. Visiting the gallery in 1748, the Marchioness Grey described the gallery {{in a letter to}} a friend: [...] "Indeed there is a gracefulness and life in the figures beyond what I ever saw, they are quite animated and a strength of colouring that <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> from one end of that gallery to the other. It is so beautiful that a picture which hangs by it is hurt by its situation." [...] Horace Walpole once wrote: [...] "Althorp has several very fine pictures by the best Italian hands, and a gallery of all one's acquaintances by Vandyke and Lely. In the gallery I found myself quite at home; and surprised the housekeeper by my familiarity with the portraits." [...] The portraits in the Picture Gallery are set in extravagant baroque gilded frames, designed by Robert Spencer, the Second Earl, which feature as [...] "cartouche at the top and a stylised mask at the bottom, with a moulded inner edge, which softens the line between frame and painting". Albert Spencer was so protective of War and Peace, once the most valuable item in Althorp, that he had the nearest tall window in the gallery converted into a door with hinges, so in case of a fire it could safely be lifted outside. There is also a small hidden door between War and Peace and [...] "The Windsor Beauties" [...] cut into the oak which leads to a staircase and the Pink Suite, a guest bedroom. Margaret Douglas-Home, sister of Albert Spencer, lived at Althorp from 1910, and the gallery was a favourite of hers. During the renovation of the 1980s, the old-fashioned celestial and terrestrial globes dating to the George II period were moved from the gallery back to the library.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout history {{many have}} {{understood}} Jesus of Nazareth {{to have been}} a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should [...] "not resist an evildoer" [...] and promoted his turn the other cheek philosophy. [...] "If anyone <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you." [...] The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.|$|E
2500|$|All Maykov's strong points, {{according}} to the critic, relate {{to the fact that}} he learned painting, and, in a way, extended the art into his poetry. Aykhenvald gives him unreserved credit for the [...] "plasticity of language, the unequalled turn at working on a phrase as if it was a tangible material." [...] Occasionally [...] "his lines are so interweaved, the verse looks like a poetic calligraphy; a scripturam continuam... Rarely passionate and showing only distant echoes of original inspiration, Maykov's verse <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> with divine shapeliness... Maykov's best poems resemble statues, driven to perfection with great precision and so flawless as to make a reader feel slightly guilty for their own imperfection, making them inadequate to even behold what's infinitely finer than themselves," [...] the critic argued.|$|E

2500|$|As the Iran nuclear deal {{agreement}} reached between Iran {{and a group}} of world powers (the P5+1). In Friedman's interview, he mentioned that [...] "Our view of the Middle East is deeply colored by Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and they all have their own interest. 15 of the 19 hijackers on 911 were from Saudi Arabia, none from Iran! Iranians had a spontaneous demonstration to support Americans on 911." [...] He added, [...] "What <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> most about Iran (vs. Saudi Arabia) is that Iran has real politics... A country of 85 million people, a great civilization, many educated men and women, if they want to get a bomb WILL get it. They have demonstrated they could do it under the most severe sanctions... Show me where Iranians have acted reckless [...] These are survivors." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{spoke of}} forgiveness, [...] "Blessed are the merciful, for {{they will be}} shown mercy." [...] (NIV) [...] "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift {{there in front of}} the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift." [...] (NIV) [...] "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." [...] Mark 11:25 (NIV)* [...] "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> on one cheek, turn to him the other also." [...] Luke 6:27-29 (NIV) [...] "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."

2500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote [...] "A {{lot of the}} album's {{power and}} strangeness comes from the way [...] cut against the lusciousness of the arrangements... and the loveliness of the melodies." [...] He praised Parker for {{creating}} psychedelia by leaving the listener [...] "simultaneously baffled and intrigued", rather than resorting to cliched psychedelic music effects. Darren Levin of Rolling Stone Australia said [...] "the first thing that really <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> about Currents is how hi-fi it actually is", and that after listening to the opening track, [...] "you really do get the feeling you're watching one of rock's most restlessly creative minds at work". He concluded his review, [...] "For someone who once sang 'Feels like we only go backwards', moving forward seems like Kevin Parker's only preoccupation right now." [...] Levin {{was one of many}} reviewers to compare the album to Daft Punk's 2013 record Random Access Memories. Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that like their first two albums, [...] "The core of Tame Impala is its aura of solitude". He called Currents [...] "a tour de force for the songwriter and his gizmos. But it's also decidedly hermetic, nearly airless." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent said, [...] "while copious application of phasing offers a link to Tame Impala’s psychedelic roots, the absence of guitar wig-outs may disappoint some fans".|$|E

2500|$|The author makes a {{point of}} {{grounding}} his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward, not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; [...] "If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what <b>strikes</b> <b>you,</b> it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series." [...] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner, he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} its unveiling, the {{painting}} received considerable press attention from photographers, cameramen, reporters, and art critics and lovers. The portrait divided critics, seen in a negative light by many. Michael Glover of The Independent [...] described it as [...] "catastrophic", and noted that it lacked context. When presented with Glover's comments on the BBC, the artist laughed them off, quipping [...] "can he draw?" [...] He noted that he believes in his work, and understands {{that there would be}} different points of view. Some critics believed that the shading below her eyes and her jawline aged her. Waldemar Januszczak of the Sunday Times described the portrait as [...] "disappointing", saying that it was [...] "pretty ordinary... He made her look older than she is and her eyes don't sparkle {{in the way that they}} do and there's something rather dour about the face." [...] Robin Simon of the Daily Mail described it as [...] "rotten" [...] and said it is fortunate that Catherine looks nothing like it in real life. Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, compared the depiction of Kate to a character in the Twilight franchise, saying, [...] "The first thing that <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> about Middleton's visage as it looms from the sepulchral gloom of her first official portrait is the dead eyes: a vampiric, malevolent glare beneath heavy lids. Then there's the mouth: a tightly pursed, mean little lip-clench (she is, presumably, sucking in her fangs). And God knows what is going on with the washed-out cheeks: she appears to be nurturing a gobbet of gum in her lower right cheek. The hair is dull and lifeless; the glimpse of earring simply lifts her to the status of Sloaney, rather than merely proletarian, undead." ...|$|E
