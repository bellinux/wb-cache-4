The main result is that the observation of electrical conductivity in strong magnetic fields can reveal such nontrivial topological characteristics of Fermi surface as integral planes, connected with conductivity tensor and locally stable under small rotations of magnetic field. This planes are connected with generic non-closed orbits on the Fermi surface. Some non-generic situations are also discussed. Comment: 21 pages, 9 Encapsulated Postscript figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{real time}} {{implementation}} of Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for a spherical tank to control liquid level is studied. Control <b>of</b> liquid <b>level</b> in a spherical tank is highly non-linear due to {{variation in the}} area <b>of</b> cross <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> system with change in shape. System identification of spherical tank system is done using black box model which is identified to be non-linear and approximated to be a First order plus dead time model. Here the conventional controller parameters are designed based on Ziegler-Nicholas method and its servo and regulatory responses are compared with Fuzzy logic controller based on Mamdani model. From the response curve, obtained using the above controllers, that fuzzy logic controller gives much improved performance which is {{measured in terms of}} overshoot, rise time, set point tracking and performance indices when compared to other conventional controller...|$|R
