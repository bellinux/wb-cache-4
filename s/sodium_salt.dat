5|$|In {{a corner}} of our 60m3 room {{farthest}} away from the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} <b>sodium</b> <b>salt</b> and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E
5|$|Shown {{right is}} an X-ray {{structure}} showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS {{was used as}} a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA can be especially problematic. Potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>salt</b> by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E

5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> from aqueous solutions is rare because <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> {{typically have}} a high affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of long chain {{sulfonic}} acids (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate) {{are often}} included in toothpaste and shampoo. The <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of fatty acids {{may serve as}} soaps and can therefore be called sodium soaps.|$|R
50|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} technology acidic pharmaceutical substances {{are often}} converted into <b>sodium</b> <b>salts,</b> {{because they are}} more stable, more soluble or membrane-permeable than the drug itself. Example of such <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> are (selection): Bispyribac, bithionol, bosentan, brequinar, bromfenac, Cefmenoxime, ceftiofur, citicoline, diclofenac , Floxacillin, fosinopril, naproxen, Netobimin, ozagrel, pantoprazole, pemetrexed, sitamaquin, sitaxentan, sulfamiderazin, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfazecin, thiamylal and mesna. The disodium salt of cromolyn is also used as drug. Most of these <b>salts</b> are <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of organic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids.|$|R

40|$|The {{infrared}} spectra of some hydroxyanthraquinones and their <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> are investigated in the NaCl region.

40|$|Recovery of iron from iron-rich {{diasporic}} bauxite ore via reductive roasting {{followed by}} magnetic separation has been explored recently. However, {{the efficiency of}} alumina extraction in the non-magnetic materials is absent. In this paper, a further study on the digestion of alumina by the Bayer process from non-magnetic material obtained after magnetic separation of reduced iron-rich diasporic bauxite with <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> was investigated. The {{results indicate that the}} addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> can destroy the original occurrences of iron-, aluminum- and silicon-containing minerals of bauxite ore during reductive roasting. Meanwhile, the reactions of <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> with complex aluminum- and silicon-bearing phases generate diaoyudaoite and sodium aluminosilicate. The separation of iron via reductive roasting of bauxite ore with <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> followed by magnetic separation improves alumina digestion in the Bayer process. When the alumina-bearing material in bauxite ore is converted into non-magnetic material, the digestion temperature decreases significantly from 280 °C to 240 °C with a nearly 99 % relative digestion ratio of alumina...|$|R
40|$|Titrations of {{solutions}} of vanaxiyl sulphate have heen {{carried out with}} aqueous solutions of: (a) polyhydroxy alcohols, (b) phenols, (c) <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of mono- and di-hasic carboxylic acids, and (d) <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids® Of the titrants used, the following group gave initial falls in pH values: (a) 0 rth 02 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 dih. ydr 0 x. y benzenes, (b) <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of aliphatic carboxylic acids which have B-hydroxyl groups, (c) <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of aromatic acids with both a hydroxyl group and a benzene ring(s) on the ^-carbon (to the carboxyl group). The above results and the variation in the volume of titrant required to attain the minimum pH value are explained. Using complexing agents {{selected on the basis}} of the anomalous results obtained, twelve vanadyl (iv) complexes, with hydroxy carboxylic acids, the <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> of some of them and ortho-hidroxy benzenes were prepared and investigated. The behaviour of these complexes, their magnetic and spectroscopic properties, and their measured molecular weights and pK values have been correlated with structures proposed for four of them.

40|$|An {{investigation}} has been undertaken {{to determine whether}} ionizing radiation might engender racemization of optically active amino acids, along with their usual radiolysis. As prototypes, crystalline Dand L-leucine, as well as aqueous solutions of their <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> {{were exposed to the}} radiation from a 3000 Ci Co- 60 gamma-ray source. Gamma-ray doses which caused about 68 % radiolysis of solid leucine left a residue which was about 5 % racemized, while racemization proved even greater at lower doses for the dissolved <b>sodium</b> <b>salts.</b> In aqueous solution both percent degradation and percent racemization of the <b>sodium</b> <b>salts</b> were proportional to gamma-ray dosage within the range employed (1, 000, 000 - 27, 000, 000 rads). Implications of these observations for the origin of molecular asymmetry by the beta-decay parity violation mechanism are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Coca-Cola {{announced}} that it would be phasing out sodium benzoate from many of its drinks, but not Fanta and Sprite. As of August 2012, Coca Cola Zero and Barq's root beer still contains benzoate (added as potassium salt and <b>sodium</b> <b>salt</b> respectively).|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} {{typically}} converted to its <b>sodium</b> <b>salt,</b> sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione. Further chlorination gives trichloroisocyanuric acid, 3.

50|$|The {{commercial}} {{manufacture of}} wood pulp grade chemical cellulose using the kraft chemical pulping processes releases resin acids. The Kraft process is conducted under strongly basic conditions of sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfide and sodium hydrosulfide, which neutralizes these resin acids, converting {{them to their}} respective <b>sodium</b> <b>salts,</b> <b>sodium</b> abietate, ((CH3)4C15H17COONa) sodium pimarate ((CH3)3(CH2)C15H23COONa) and so on.

25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of tenatoprazole is double for the (S)-(−)-tenatoprazole <b>sodium</b> <b>salt</b> hydrate {{form when}} compared to the free form in dogs.
