Macdonald's seat was draped in Clanranald tartan and a <b>sprig</b> of heather decorated his desk. Macdonald's body lay in state for three days in the legislative building as more than 100,000 people filed past to pay their respects.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a <b>sprig</b> of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The obverse of {{the dime}} depicts President Roosevelt, with the {{inscriptions}} LIBERTY and IN GOD WE TRUST. Sinnock's initials, JS, are {{found by the}} cutoff of the bust, {{to the left of}} the date. The reverse shows a torch in the center, representing liberty, flanked by an olive <b>sprig</b> representing peace, and one of oak symbolizing strength and independence. The inscription E PLURIBUS UNUM (out of many, one) stretches across the field. The name of the country and the value of the coin are the legends that surround the reverse design, which is symbolic of the victorious end of World War II.|$|E
40|$|The results {{obtained}} reflect the importance {{to know the}} way the generative <b>sprigs</b> form, the technological factors that influence the number of <b>sprigs</b> and, finally, the seed production.

50|$|<b>Sprigging</b> is the {{planting}} of <b>sprigs,</b> plant sections cut from rhizomes or stolons that includes crowns and roots, at spaced intervals in furrows or holes. Depending on the environment, {{this may be}} done by hand or with mechanical row planters. <b>Sprigging</b> uses no soil with the plant, and is an alternative to seeding (planting seeds directly), plugging (transplanting plugs with intact soil and roots), and sodding (installing harvested sheets of sod).|$|R
40|$|Hygrophila polysperma is a plant {{native to}} Asia {{that has been}} {{introduced}} into the Comal River, TX and is thriving while Ludwigia repens, a species native to the river appears to be declining. Both plants have similar morphologies and occupy similar habitats in the river. Two plant competition experiments were conducted to examine the competitive interactions between the two species. First, an experimental design was developed in which established Ludwigia plants were 'invaded' by <b>sprigs</b> of Hygrophila to determine if established Ludwigia populations would be negatively impacted by invasion. The second experiment focused on establishment and growth of <b>sprigs</b> of each species under three competition scenarios. Results show that the continued growth of well-established Ludwigia plants was significantly depressed by the invasion of Hygrophila in comparison with those {{that had not been}} invaded. Furthermore, the growth of Hygrophila <b>sprigs</b> was uninhibited by the presence of Ludwigia, but the presence of Hygrophila negatively impacted the growth of Ludwigia <b>sprigs.</b> There was no difference in the growth of Hygrophila <b>sprigs</b> whether planted alone, with Ludwigia <b>sprigs</b> or even if planted into stands of established Ludwigia...|$|R
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a <b>sprig</b> of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{runs for}} help and goes into the kitchen. Ma Soupswill, the cook, is delighted to help, but Cooper must {{retrieve}} three ingredients: Glowworms, a giant egg, and a <b>sprig</b> of dungweed. After retrieving the ingredients, Ma Soupswill creates a potion to reverse the effects on Amber. However, she unwittingly transforms Amber into an even more hideous monster, having added the wrong spice, and Amber attacks Cooper in anger. Cooper defeats the mutated Amber and Ma Soupswill arrives with the correct spice, finally transforming Amber back to herself. Afterward, Cooper and Amber attempt to escape the mansion but are stopped by Mr. Ribs (Ma Soupswill's assistant). He tells them to help free the other children who are imprisoned all over the mansion. Cooper seeks Crivens {{for help and}} tells him that only the Baron has the key to free them. To get to his room, Cooper must collect three pieces of a rhyme which {{opens the door to}} the Baron's room. Once there, a battle ensues, and Cooper emerges victorious.|$|E
5|$|James, {{under her}} real name, debuted in WWE on the October 10, 2005 episode of Raw as a face, under the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan. The angle had the two Divas {{competing}} together in tag team matches, with James' character becoming increasingly obsessed with Stratus. The storyline included a Halloween costume contest, in which James was dressed like Stratus and helped Stratus retain the Women's Championship in a Fulfill Your Fantasy battle royal at Taboo Tuesday by eliminating herself and Victoria {{at the same}} time. James even began utilizing Stratus' signature finishing moves as her own during matches. James later became the number one contender for the WWE Women's Championship on December 12, by defeating Victoria in a match to determine who would face Stratus at New Year's Revolution. Subsequently, the storyline between James and Stratus developed into a lesbian angle, after James kissed Stratus under a <b>sprig</b> of mistletoe. In the championship match at the pay-per-view, James lost to Stratus.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are {{provided to the}} gods. Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a <b>sprig</b> or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated {{as part of the}} ritual itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, Stratus was sidelined {{with the}} Women's Championship after {{suffering}} a herniated disc, with the storyline explanation that Viscera had injured her at Backlash after she insulted him for losing to Kane. This left the company without a Women's Champion for four months, as Stratus remained the champion {{during the time of}} her injury, thus ignoring the 30 day clause stating that a champion must defend their respective title at least once every 30 days. She returned to Raw on September 12, 2005 as a face by siding with Ashley Massaro against Vince's Devils (Candice Michelle, Victoria and Torrie Wilson). The feud also involved the debuting Mickie James, who introduced herself as Stratus' biggest fan. In November, during the Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show, Stratus took part in an inter-promotional Divas battle royal that was won by SmackDown! Diva Melina. The next week, MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) kidnapped Stratus for Melina, who challenged a tied up and gagged Stratus to a match for the Women's Championship. The two fought at Survivor Series, with Stratus defeating Melina. Stratus and Mickie James continued teaming together in late 2005, while James became increasingly obsessed with Stratus. On the December 26 episode of Raw, the storyline between Stratus and James developed into a lesbian one, when James initiated an intimate kiss with Stratus under a <b>sprig</b> of mistletoe, causing a surprised Stratus to flee the locker room.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{photosynthetic}} activity during transplantation of Posidoniasinuosa Cambridge et Kuo, from Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, were assessed using a Diving-PAM fluorometer. Two transplantation methods, <b>sprigs</b> and plugs (5, 10 and 15 cm diameter) were examined and {{photosynthetic activity}} was compared before, {{during and after}} transplantation. Maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) of transplanted <b>sprigs</b> took 1 – 2 months to increase to the same level recorded at a control meadow, primarily due to desiccation stress suffered during transport. Effective quantum yield () of <b>sprigs</b> decreased below 0. 2 after transplantation, but fully recovered after 3 months and the ETRmax of transplanted plugs took up to 1 week to recover to control meadow values. Once transplanted, the survival of <b>sprigs</b> was reduced due to strong currents and heavy epiphytic fouling, while that of plugs declined due to winter storms and swells. Since the leading human-controlled cause of transplant stress was desiccation, future rehabilitation efforts may be improved by keeping seagrasses submerged at all times during the transplanting process...|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} royal heraldic badge is a <b>sprig</b> {{of common}} broom, {{said to have}} been worn by Geoffrey of Anjou in his cap. The broom plant or Plantegenest (planta genista in medieval Latin), thus became Geoffrey's nickname; 'Plantagenet'. The heraldic device also became the name of the dynasty that was borne from him, which was to rule England for over 300 years. The Plantagenet kings would use this badge, sometimes combining it with other more personal devices. King Henry II used the 'planta genista' as well as an escarbuncle. King Richard I used a star and crescent device, which was also adopted by his brother King John. King Henry III adopted the broom <b>sprig</b> and the star and crescent. His son Edward I in addition to these, added the golden rose device that he inherited from his mother Eleanor of Provence. King Edward II further added the golden castle of Castile, inherited from his mother Eleanor of Castile.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 1561, King Charles IX of France {{received}} a lily {{of the valley}} as a lucky charm. He decided to offer a {{lily of the valley}} each year to the ladies of the court. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a <b>sprig</b> of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on May 1. The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or dog rose flowers.|$|E

25|$|After the war, a {{range of}} options for the RAAF roundel were proposed, {{including}} the Southern Cross, a boomerang, a <b>sprig</b> of wattle, and the red kangaroo. On 2 July 1956, {{the current version of}} the roundel was formally adopted. This consists of a white inner circle with a red kangaroo surrounded by a royal blue circle. The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face in the direction of travel. Low visibility versions of the roundel exist, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey.|$|E

Jenkins and Hewitt {{pulled away from the}} rest on the run, before the New Zealander kicked away in the last few metres to win. Melanie Annaheim managed to out-sprint Norden, Bennett and McIlroy for her first World Series medal. On the Olympic front, Harrison and McIlroy managed to qualify for France and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey was {{the elder}} son of Foulques V d'Anjou and Eremburga de La Flèche, {{daughter}} of Elias I of Maine. He {{was named after}} his great-grandfather Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais. Geoffrey received his nickname from the yellow <b>sprig</b> of broom blossom (genêt is the French name for the planta genista, or broom shrub) he wore in his hat. King Henry I of England, having heard good reports on Geoffrey's talents and prowess, sent his royal legates to Anjou to negotiate a marriage between Geoffrey and his own daughter, Empress Matilda. Consent was obtained from both parties, and on 10 June 1128 the fifteen-year-old Geoffrey was knighted in Rouen by King Henry {{in preparation for the}} wedding.|$|E
