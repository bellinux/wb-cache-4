50|$|Chinkapin oak is classed as {{intolerant}} of shade. It withstands moderate shading when young but becomes more {{intolerant of}} shade with age.

Until the mid-1950s the region [...] "was visited by people and livestock only {{during the rainy season}} and {{at the very beginning of}} the dry season (July to November)." [...] In 1953, J. G. Adam noted that the [...] "groundnut cultivation has transformed the natural vegetation on sandy soils, to note, even at a distance from the water points, a climax, <b>subclimax</b> vegetation which has not been disrupted by cultivation, and hardly changed by grazing, since this has occurred only, until recent years, during the four summer months, where the vegetation is dense and close to standing water." [...] From the mid-1950s, boreholes were drilled and began to provide water to areas of the desert, which enabled pastureland to be used by the farmers all year round. By 1955, fifty wells were reported along the main trek routes to be providing water. Under better conditions, the population of livestock in the desert increased; by the 1990s, it supported livestock herding, cited as [...] "a continuous extension of the desert steppe into the savanna" [...] but one which was [...] "not rich enough to attract herders from the north of the Senegal river." [...] Between 1969 and 1972, the [...] "Study of Natural Pastureland in Northern Senegal" [...] was conducted, assessing the borehole development in the desert and found that the boreholes were still on average 25-30 km apart, which meant that exploitation of land was generally restricted to a 5 km radius of them.

30|$|Although {{the desert}} {{grassland}} is commonly classed as a grassland climax, {{there is considerable}} evidence that the true climax here is low-growing trees and brush with a grass-half-shrub understory.

Much, if not all, of the formation appears to have been held for an indefinite period as a grassland <b>subclimax</b> prior to white settlement with its concomitant domestic livestock grazing and fire control. This theory was proposed by Griffiths (1910) for southern Arizona grasslands that were being invaded by mesquite. He stated that had it not been for repeated fires, the slopes between the desert scrub and the mountain would have been covered by shrubs and trees.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of the literature on the home range of animals, information on the distances of diaspore dispersals by animals is provided for plants of coniferous-broadleaved forests. Mass and moderate dispersals of diaspores are important for formation of plant communities. Diaspores are moved in mass quantities within the diurnal areas of animals and in moderate quantities within the borders of seasonal areas. A continuous series is built on the range of mass dissemination of plant diaspores by animals, from tens of metres (small rodents) to one kilometre (large mammals). In coniferous-broadleaved forests three groups of plant species have been distinguished on adaptation to diaspore dispersals by animals. The first group includes plants with juicy fruits (e. g., Malus sylvestris, Sorbus aucuparia, Vaccinium myrtillus). A wide range of animals disperse diaspores of these plants at a distance of 20 m to 1, 000 m, mainly in the endozoochoric way. The second group includes plants with large and dry seeds (e. g., Corylus avellana, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur). The seeds of these plants are dispersed by animals that stock seeds at a distance of up to 500 m in the synzoochoric way. The third group includes plants with small and dry diaspores (e. g., Aegopodium podagraria, Melica nutans, Stellaria holostea и др.). Their seeds can be moved by large birds, bears, ungulates in the endozoochoric way in large quantities at a distance of up to 1, 000 m. Due to the extremely low number of those animals, plants with small and dry seeds have lost intercenotic diaspore flows that are needed for changes of plant communities and for restoration succession. As a result, <b>subclimax</b> communities with a diminished species composition of plants are formed...|$|E
40|$|The indices found are {{analysed}} as a {{whole and}} general conclusions are drawn from them which may be of use in understanding many of the problems offered by the local flora (Ilhéus). The first column of the tables presented indicates the biological form of the species, showing the nature of the flora and the constitution of the climax. A total of 200 species of phanerophyta were found; 69 macrophanerophyta (trees), 54 are mesophanerophyta (treelets) and 77 are nanophanerophyta (shrubs). The macrophanerophyta are consequently considered as dominants and the meso-and nanophanerophyta as codominants (the biological forms: chamaephyta, hemicriptophyta, criptophyta, geophyta, therophyta, epiphyta and hydrophyta are subdominants), the more so as the first cover 80 % and the others more or less 50 %. This points to a climax of trees and a local vegetation mainly composed of trees also. The smaller forms are left out as they are beyond the present scope of this sort of wort in Brazil. The third column of ecological formulae indicates the reaction of the constituent species to light (C = sciophilous, F = photophilous and I = indifferents), the biological types of vegetation (H = hygrophytes, X = xerophytes and M = mesophytes) and the fidelity of the species to the climax. Of the species studied: 25 are pioneers (P. Table I), 63 are accidentals (A. Table II), 35 are companion species (O. Table III), 19 show preferences (E. Table with vitality Vn), 44 are selective (S. Table V) and 13 exclusive species (L. Table VI). This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} vegetation of the region is in full reconstitution. As to the ecological characteristics of the 200 species studied, 89 are either pioneers (a class separated by the author) or accidentals; this means that the devastated zones are being reconstituted in the subsere both with members of the prisere and alien species. Of the remaining species, 54 are companion, or accompanying species, which appear in most <b>subclimax,</b> serclímax and quasiclimax associations, and 57 are real constituents of the local climax. As all the species except the pioneers, selectives and exclusives (xerophytes and mesophytes) may be considered as hygrophytes this type evidently predominantes in the region and may constitute a hygrophilous serclimax and quasiclímax. In regard to light 101 are sciophilous, 32 indiferents and 67 photophilous. This leads to the conclusion that the vegetation comprises mainly tolerant species, showing the hygrophilous and mesophilous character of the region with a vegetation composed mostly of trees. The presence a large number of sciophilous species is easy to understand as the hygrophilous and mesophilous habitats and the dominance of trees favour the germination and growth of tolerant species. The last two columns analyse the percentage of individuals present and the occurrent classes to which they belong: 92 species vary between 1 and 9 %; 50 between to 10 and 19 %; 36 between 20 and 29 %; 14 between 30 and 39 %; and 8 between 40 and 49 %. Only 8 species belong to occurrence class V; 14 to classe IV; 36 to class III; 50 to class II; and 92 to class I. This leads to the conclusion that the local formation is very unsociable and very complex, though the median coverture is 80 % and the number of species is very large. The analysis of the data also shows that the climax is being reconstituted in the subsere with elements drawn from the prisere and alien species introduced either by man (following desvastation) or by other consequent factors (such as brusque changes of microclimates due to total or partial destruction). This modifies the <b>subclimax</b> appreciably and apparently also the climax of the local regional subsere. As a final conclusion it is suggested that as in the subsere the pioneer formation is xerophilous, the prisere also beging as a xerosere; but as there are and probably always were hydrophilous formation evolving in the same climate, the local climax is composed of species with medium exactions, that is of relative mesophites...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that diverse groups of vegetation with an analogous but not identical floristic composition show an ecological similarity {{which leads to}} a determined type of vegetation. Starting from this fact it becomes evident that the scope of phytosociological work is the establishing of the significance of the species within the association and the discovery of the rules which govern associations. The floristic surveys made in the field have to be analysed statistically so as to obtain satisfactory results. The usefulness of this method depends largely on the possibilities of comparing the results with previous studies of the same kind, in the same country, or elsewhere. The method used in this paper is that of measuring circumferences and counting individuals in the different associations studied because it permits the presentation of the results in tables which show the phytosociological complexity of the Brazilian rain-forests. The classical method of characteristics is valuable because the more evolved an association is the less sociable are the species it contains, so that such groups do not show clear differences between species but rather between sinusia or strata of individuals. Five tables are presented in which several of the qualitative and quantitative characteristics are studied with a view to discussing their value in relation to groups and species. They are: I - Abundance (number of individuals). II - Density (distance in meters between the individuals belonging to each stratum). III - Basal coverture (circles measured in square meters of the mean projection of the individuals on the surface). IV - Basal area (mean circle in square meters occupied by individuals on the surface). V - Frequency, abundance and sociability in relation to occurrence. TABLE I. This table indicates first the number of individuals in relation to the sinusia studied: next, the sum total of the individuals belanging to the strata are given for each association, thus providing the numeric value of the sinusia: finally, the relation between the total number of individuals in the association and the total for the sinusium thus fursnishing the abundance per sinusium, in the classic sence, that is the percentage, or rather the relative number, of the elements which compose the group. CONCLUSIONS. The general character of abundance of the regional vegetation of Ilheos may be summed up in the following way: as an association evolves towards permanent equilibirum the number of individuals the inferior strata diminishes in relation to those of the superior strata which increase. For the shrub sinusium, two important facts were observed: a) in a given association the number of elements of the inferior strata diminishes as the diameter of the individuals increases; b) the percentage of individuals belonging to the shrub sinusium in the sere diminishes as the association evolve. In the subarboreal sinusium it is seen that: in the sere the number of subarboreal individuals does not vary much; whereas in the climax or the prisere there is a fall owing to the equilibrum of the biologic forms. In the arboreal sinusium the following conclusion can be deduced from analogous facts: the number of individuals of the lower strata diminishes as circumference increases. Also, in the sere there is a progressive sequence for the individuals belonging to the superior strata. TABLE II. The relation between the mean distances of individuals belonging to the same stratum and the area of an association is equal to the density. The table shows that the mean density of the association and the distance between the individuals belonging to the strata of the same sinusium in relation to the total number of individuals belonging to the association. CONCLUSIONS. As rule, the density of individuals in the associations studied follows a very general character or at least a regional one: the distance between the individuals in the diverse strata varies according to their abundance and sociability. Two other facts of some sociological importance are: a) in identical strata of the same sere the density of individuals oscillates in an analogous manner in teh subclimaces and varies in the stages which have reached equilibrium. b) the density of individuals varias in accordance with the sinusium and the distances between individuals of the same sinusium varg in accordance with the strata. TABLE III. This table presents the mean basal individual coverture, that is the mean projection of the frond of the various individuals belonging to the same stratum. The means were obtained by measurement in the field, of 100 individuals belonging to each stratum and their projection on the surface. In the latoratory these measurements were converted into mean circles (in square meters) and the result was multiplied by the individuals belonging to the strata corresponding to the sinusium of each association. The result obtained is named basal coverture. CONCLUSIONS. As a rule, the basal coverture of the vegetation of the county of Ilhéus indicates that: {{in the evolution of the}} vegetation the basal coverture of the arbustive sinusium diminishes progressively whereas that of the arboreal one increases. The special norms obtained are: 1) in the shrub sinusium the basal coverture seems to follow a uniform norm, that is, in stages of evolution of the <b>subclimax</b> the basal coverture oscillates with a certain uniformity. 2) in the subarboreal sinusium this fact is related to the vitality and age of the species, as in the <b>subclimax</b> the number of young trees is large and the vitality of the species very variable. This permits the conclusion that: in the sere the basal coverture increases with the evolution of the vegetation and diminishes when an equilibrium is reached. 3) in the tree sinusium the climax association of the prisere and subsere seem to obey a binomial rule, as the coverture (density-abundance) increases until a determined stratum is reached and [...] ...|$|E

It was done during the investigation of sylvan yellow fever, in June 1947, {{with a view to}} establishing the phyto-ecological conditions of the county of Passos. The pe¬riod was, however, too short for definite conclusions to be reached. Thanks are due to Dr. O. R. Causey, Chief of Research on Yellow Fever for transpor¬tation and other help. THE REGIONAL VEGETATION. Aerial photographs of the county of Passos shoto that it is covered by three great types of vegetation: Rain Forest, Secondary Pasture Land and Scrub. 1 Detailed investigation, however, brings out the fact that these correspond to different seres; furthermore, each type presents not only the specific, characteristics of the biological form dominant for the climate, but also are at various stages, which express HABITATS differing from those of the normal sere. The phytogeographic survey of the region shows that most of it is now covered by secondary pasture land (disclimax) in which Melinis minutiflora, v. "fat grass" (fig. 1), predominates. The mosaic of Rain Forest and of small patches of Scrub reveals the effects of human intervention (BARRETO, H. L. de Mello 1); consequently, all the formations have to be regarded as secon¬dary, though some of them probably include relicts of the primitive climax (WARMING, E. 2). On close examination, the Scrub cannot be considered as the climax, because of the following facts: 1. In the zone of Rain-Forest stretches of forest are present in very varied topographic conditions and the reconstitution of the associations show that man has destroyed an ecological unit (fig. 2). 2. In the zone of Scrub the characteristic patches are small. The banks of rivers and brooks, the valleys and ravine and whatever the soil has retained some humidity, is being invaded fry Rain Forest, which seems to be growing under optimum conditions. The Scrub is thus limited to small belts on the calcareous mountains and on sandy soils with alcaline depths (pH abo¬ve 7) which do not retain enough moisture for the Rain Forest that is progres¬sively restricting the area occupied by Scrub. In view of the topographic and present climatic conditions the Rain Forest must consequently be regarded as the regional climax. The presence of ecologically contradictory elements and associations shows that {{the real problem is that}} of the fluctuations of the climate of Passos or even of Minas Geraes during the quaternary and recent periods (DAN-SEREAU, P. : 3), a subject on which little is known and which is tied to the evolution of the climate of Brazil (OLIVEIRA, E. : 4). The transformation of Scrub into Rain Forest has been - observed by the author before, in other parts of Brazil (VELOSO, PL P. : 5). It seems probable that the Rio Grande has also greatly influenced the change of the regional vegetation, by invading areas of Scrub and dislocating the limit of the Pluvial climate towards the Canastra Range, though there are remnants of Scrub (postclimax) transfor¬med into secondary open country (disclimax, fig. 5) by human devastation and the setting of fire to the land. VEGETATION GROUPS OF THE PLUVIAL TYPE. The map of the region also shows that at the present time the small patches of forest (whether devasted or intact) occupy the least accessible places, such as valleys, peaks and abrupt slopes (fig. 2). Even these are now being destroyed, so that in the near future this forested region will be en¬tirely reduced to poor pasture land unless energetic measures of conservation are undertaken in time. The Special Service for Prophylaxis against Yellow Fever installed two of their four Stations for the Capture of Mosquitos in this area, one of them at Batatal and the other at Cachoeira, which have separate formations each of them composed of several associations. Other vegetation formations were also analysed, from the synecological point of view, so as to ascertain of which degree of succession their associations belong. These phytosociological sur¬veys give an idea of the principal characteristics of each station. BATATAL FORMATION. The abrupt nature of the valley has rendered this location inappropriate for agricultural purposes since colonial times. The relict of the primitive forest climax saved by this circumstance has expanded gradually to zones whose paedologic conditions favour the eatablishment of mesophilous species. The aerial photograph shows two small stretches of forest, one apparently primi¬tive, the other composed of associations belonging to the <b>subclimax</b> of the subsere. CACHOEIRA FORMATION. Aerial photographs show that this station is crossed by a small river, which divides it into two separate parts. The first, which presents ecological conditions similar, though not identical to those of Batatal, is favoured by topography and apparently remains primitive forest. Though the topography of the other, on the whole, favours the establishment of groups belonging to the normal sere of the climax, is has been partly devastated recently and the aspect of the associations has been completely modified. It was is this part that the four posts for the capturing of mosquitos were set up. The first forest is favoured by deposition of organic matter, washed out from the nearby devasted areas by torrential rains, and thus provides, an appropriate HABITAT for the climax species with certain hygrophilous trends of the ecological quasiclimax type. This association seems to have reached a biological equilibrium, as the dominates. Gallesia gorarema and Cariniana legalis (fig. 10), present an optimum vitality with a vigorous habit and a normal evolutionary cycle. The Cariniantum legalis Gallesiosum equilibrium, corresponds however, to a provisory association, because if the moving of soil by torrential rains should cease it would become possible...|$|E
40|$|Fire alone, and in {{combination}} with grazing, influence established individual plants, and their respective regeneration potential variously with consequences on species dynamics. This study gives attention {{to the effects of}} fire alone, and {{in combination}} with grazing in underutilized, problem rangeland communities. Firstly, the question exists whether annual fire in fire prone Hyparrhenia hirta dominated veld {{could be one of the}} factors that promote the persistence of this veld type in the Gauteng Highveld. Secondly, the impacts of fire and heavy grazing on species and associated changes in veld condition characteristics are documented in Cymbopogon validus dominated veld in the Eastern Cape. The grazing value of Hyparrhenia hirta dominated rangelands is often managed through frequent burning aimed at encouraging palatable re-growth. Despite this widely adopted practice, research on the effects of fire on H. hirta seed production (seed banks) and seed dynamics and therefore its regeneration potential, is lacking in South Africa. This study quantified and compared H. hirta soil seed bank density, and seedling emergence in the field in an annually burned site versus a > 2 year fire return interval site. It was hypothesized that H. hirta seed bank densities and seedling emergence would be greater in annually burned veld compared to > 2 year fire return interval veld. The seedling emergence method was used to determine seed bank densities of soil samples collected from the two sites. Seedling emergence was quantified and monitored under individual treatments within burn (clipping, soil disturbance, control) and unburned sites (soil disturbance, litter, clipping, and control) over a single growing season. Results revealed that H. hirta seed bank densities were nearly two fold higher in the annually burned site but not significantly so. In the seedling emergence trial, no consistent trend was identified in individual treatments but emergence was generally favored in control plots (associated with standing vegetation), and reduced in clipped plots (associated with a short sward). However, analysis of the pooled data (annually burned site versus > 2 year fire return interval site) revealed a significant increase (p< 0. 0001) in emergence in the annually burned site. It was concluded that frequent burning of H. hirta dominated stands may be one of the factors that facilitates its dominance, through increasing seed additions to the seed bank. This is likely the case where H. hirta is underutilized after burning, therefore allowing seed to set and encouraging its availability in the seed bank. Furthermore, underutilization inadvertently results in burning in subsequent years with accumulative effects on the soil seed bank, and subsequent emergence patterns. In the high rainfall, sourveld grasslands of the Eastern Cape, the eradication of underutilized stands of Cymbopogon validus has been directed through burning and intensive grazing on the farm Glen Gregor, outside Bedford. At this study site, species composition of standing vegetation, basal cover, tuft diameter and standing biomass were sampled in top and bottom slopes of five camps representing a gradient of fire and grazing management intensity. Additionally, the composition of the soil seed bank was determined through the seedling emergence method from soil collected from the same sites. Results showed that the success of C. validus eradication was not determined by burning alone, as burning without the required post fire grazing maintained a dominance of C. validus. Cymbopogon validus decreased along the grazing gradient according to the total number of seasons that a camp was grazed after burning. Heterogenous topography in camps with steep top slopes and gentle bottom slopes meant grazing was concentrated in bottom areas, reflected by significant reductions of C. validus compared to top slopes. In contrast, even utilization in camps of uniform topography reduced the prevalence of C. validus over the whole camp, reflected by similar frequencies in top and bottom slopes. Cymbopogon validus dominated sites were associated with large areas of bare ground between large tufted individuals. In contrast, C. validus eradication through fire and intensive grazing went hand in hand with the occupation of large bare spaces by other species, predominantly Sporobolus africanus, Cynodon dactylon and other <b>subclimax</b> species which lead to increases in basal cover. Cymbopogon validus was increasingly absent from the seed bank as its frequency was reduced in the sward. The presence of other species in the seed bank, regardless of C. validus dominance could indicate a highly functional role of the seed bank in this mesic environment. It is proposed that once established (as C. validus is suppressed) it is these individuals that will provide the source of additional seed for subsequent population establishment. Windows of opportunity for establishment are facilitated by cycles of intense grazing that prevent C. validus from growing out and dominating the canopy. After 17 years, the sward is increasingly composed of a variety of species with favorable grazing characteristics. Prior to targeting C. validus with fire and heavy grazing, areas occupied by C. validus dominated veld were in a poor condition and offered zero contribution to livestock production. Through burning and intense grazing, management was primarily able to make use of underutilized C. validus swards. Veld condition improved as the consequent species replacement that followed now caters for breeding stock, thus increasing livestock production in previously unavailable rangelands. Both H. hirta and C. validus are competitive Increaser I species (species increasing in underutilized veld) that dominate in end point or climax grassland states. That these species are prone to underutilization (low quality mature sward) means fire is a common and often necessary tool used to stimulate higher quality forage. However, this study has shown that annual burning of H. hirta (without grazing) increases seed banks and therefore maintains a consistent source of seed to maintain its dominance. The value of burning C. validus veld is only realized when combined with intense and efficient post fire grazing. A sustained cycle of heavy grazing and rest eliminates this unpalatable climax community and facilitates the development of a sub climax sward with improved veld condition characteristics favoring livestock production. In conclusion, both studies emphasize the importance of post fire grazing to manage and control unpalatable climax swards. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.
