The goal {{of this paper is}} to study financial systems convergence through the lens of household asset allocation. We analyze s and ß convergence of total household financial assets and their main components: deposits, <b>securities</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares,</b> shares and other equity, insurance technical reserves. The novelty of the paper is to exploit a database containing time series since 1980 for nine OECD countries. Using disposable income as a scale variable, we found convergence of household total financial assets, insurance technical reserves and shares and other equity. Weaker results are obtained for convergence of household <b>securities</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares,</b> and currency and deposits. In a nutshell, financial systems show signals of convergence in asset allocation, but national characteristics persist when households invest in securities and deposits. financial systems, alpha and beta convergence...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to study the}} special rights other than shares in Spanish Law {{and the protection of}} their holders in cross-border mergers of limited liability companies within the European Union frame. Special rights other than shares are recognised as an independent legal category within legal systems of some EU Member States, such as Germany or Spain, through the implementation of the Third Directive 78 / 855 /CEE concerning mergers of public limited liability companies. The above-cited Directive contains a special regime of protection for the holders of <b>securities,</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>shares,</b> to which special rights are attached, consisting of being given rights in the acquiring company, at least equivalent to those they possessed in the company being acquired. This safeguard is to highlight the intimate connection between this type of rights and the company whose extinction determines the existence of those. Pursuant to the Directive 2005 / 56 /CE on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, each company taking part in these operations shall comply with the safeguards of members and third parties provided in their respective national law to which is subject. In this regard, the protection for holders of special rights other than shares shall be ruled by the domestic M&A regime. As far as Spanish Law are concerned, holders of these special rights are recognized a right of merger information, in the same terms as shareholders, as well as equal rights in the company resulting from the cross-border merger. However, these measures are not enough guarantee for a suitable protection, thus considering those holders of special rights as special creditors, sometimes {{it will be necessary to}} go to the general protection regime for creditors. In Spanish Law, it would involve the recognition of right to the merger opposition, whose exercise would prevent the operation was completed until ensuring equal rights. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main issue}} is to {{determine}} when {{and under what circumstances}} loans that are traded become debt securities. This is an important issue because virtually all loans are potentially tradable and trading has increased. Classifying traded loans as securities also has consequences for valuation as positions on debt securities are valued at market prices and those on loans at nominal values. BOPTEG Background Paper for Issues # 12 / 13 reviews existing statistical standards and discusses some possible options. BOPTEG Issues Paper # 12 deals with a related issue of the classification of securities between portfolio investment and other investment within the functional classification of financial assets/liabilities. 1.
