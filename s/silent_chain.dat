40|$|Sustained {{and coordinated}} {{vaccination}} efforts have brought polio eradication within reach. Anticipating {{the eradication of}} wild poliovirus (WPV) and the subsequent challenges in preventing its re-emergence, we look to the past to identify why polio rose to epidemic levels in the mid- 20 th century, and how WPV persisted over large geographic scales. We analyzed an extensive epidemiological dataset, spanning the 1930 s to the 1950 s and spatially replicated across each state in the United States, to glean insight into the drivers of polio's historical expansion and the ecological mode of its persistence prior to vaccine introduction. We document a latitudinal gradient in polio's seasonality. Additionally, we fitted and validated mechanistic transmission models to data from each US state independently. The fitted models revealed that: (1) polio persistence {{was the product of}} a dynamic mosaic of source and sink populations; (2) geographic heterogeneity of seasonal transmission conditions account for the latitudinal structure of polio epidemics; (3) contrary to the prevailing "disease of development" hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio's historical expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather than improvements in sanitation and hygiene; and (4) the absence of clinical disease is not a reliable indicator of polio transmission, because widespread polio transmission was likely in the multiyear absence of clinical disease. As the world edges closer to global polio eradication and continues the strategic withdrawal of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), the regular identification of, and rapid response to, these <b>silent</b> <b>chains</b> of transmission is of the utmost importance...|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{intake and exhaust}} ports and intake and exhaust manifolds are shape optimized for better volumetric efficiency. Mitsubishi lowered the friction of the engine by including elastic grinding of the valve stems, adopting a high-efficiency shroud equipped plastic impeller in the water pump and using 0W-20 low-viscosity oil. Mitsubishi increased the combustion efficiency by optimizing {{the design of the}} {{cylinder head}} intake and exhaust ports, by incorporating the MIVEC system on both intake and exhaust valves and by using injectors that give an ultra micro droplet fuel spray. To lower the engine's weight, Mitsubishi used die-cast aluminium for the cylinder block, plastic for the cylinder head cover and intake manifold, and stainless steel for the exhaust manifold. The engine features a compact balancer shaft module with an integrated oil pump. A <b>silent</b> <b>chain</b> is used to drive the camshafts. The compact balancer module, the <b>silent</b> <b>chain,</b> the stable combustion yielded by the intake and exhaust MIVEC system, and high rigidity designs for the cylinder head and cylinder block realize low vibration and noise.|$|E

40|$|Seasonality is {{a feature}} of all {{ecological}} systems. Earth's terrestrial and pelagic life has evolved in a highly seasonal abiotic environment with intra-annual variation in photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation, among many other abiotic and biotic factors. Seasonal aspects of mammals and birds include seasonally varying birth rates, seasonal changes in endocrine hormones, and seasonal variation in immunity. One area where seasonal biology is particularly salient is disease ecology. The mechanisms underlying the seasonality of communicable diseases are poorly understood. I propose {{that much of the}} unexplained seasonality observed in infectious disease dynamics could be attributed to seasonal biology, including (1) birth seasonality, (2) seasonal variation in immunity, and (3) seasonal cycles in parasite traits and parasite population parameters. In my dissertation, I present work on various aspects of seasonality. In Chapter II, I explored the seasonality of births in human populations and quantified the effects of birth seasonality on measles epidemics. In Chapter III, I reviewed circadian and circannual rhythms in host and parasite populations, and proposed both ecological and evolutionary models for integrating biological rhythms into the study of infectious diseases. In Chapters IV [...] V, I presented my in-depth ecological studies of poliovirus, a notoriously seasonal summertime infection. I explored geographical variation in polio's seasonality and tested whether human birth seasonality or transmission seasonality drove epidemics of this disease. In addition to studying polio seasonality, I revealed the connection between (i) polio's emergence and human demography, (ii) the geographical distribution of poliovirus and its persistence, and (iii) polio symptomatology and <b>silent</b> <b>chains</b> of transmission. Lastly, I highlighted the public health implications of seasonal transmission by measuring the efficacy of the two polio vaccines and discussing how seasonality can be utilized for vaccine interventions...|$|R
50|$|Engine {{timing was}} {{controlled}} by the all-steel, <b>silent</b> Morse timing <b>chain</b> (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|R
50|$|Most {{amino acids}} are {{specified}} by multiple codons demonstrating that {{the genetic code}} is degenerate. Codons that code for the same amino acid are termed synonyms. Silent mutations are base substitutions that result in no change of the amino acid or amino acid functionality when the altered messenger RNA (mRNA) is translated. For example, if the codon AAA is altered to become AAG, the same amino acid - lysine - will {{be incorporated into the}} peptide <b>chain.</b> <b>Silent</b> mutations can also be produced by insertions or deletions, which cause a shift in the reading frame. An example of this is shown with modification to the sequence AUGAAAGAGACGU. If a deletion occurred at the sixth position, the sequence would be converted to AUGAAGAGACGU. If the reading frame begins at the first position of the peptide chain, in either sequence given, the amino acid following the start codon AUG would be lysine. Such frameshift mutations can lead to deleterious effects on the peptide chain, including insertion of different amino acids or premature truncation of the protein.|$|R

40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{automotive}} industry {{is to achieve}} compact, efficient, reliable systems. Engine timing drives used in engines {{are one of the}} most critical systems. Timing belts are subjected to excessive elongation and wear, while timing gears contribute excess mass and inertia in the system. Hence timing chains are preferred widely, in various high performance engines. Chain drives are easy to assemble and adjust, highly efficient, durable, reliable, compact and capable of attaining a wide range of power and speed capacities. In spite of these advantages their complex dynamic behaviour is not well researched.

40|$|Background: Some of {{the genetic}} {{variants}} of hemoglo-bin (Hb) and their chemically modified species are known to affect the measurement of Hb A 1 c. The pur-pose {{of this study was}} to characterize Hb species in the blood sample of a 74 -year-old German male with an exceptionally low Hb A 1 c value. Methods: Hemolysates from the propositus and a healthy individual were analyzed by electrophoresis, cation-exchange HPLC, boronate affinity chromatogra-phy, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESMS). Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, and the sequencing was performed on an ABI 310 sequencer. Functional properties of Hb were determined by oxygen equilibrium studies and CO recombination kinetics after flash photodissociation. Glycohemoglobin species were synthesized by incubating hemolysates with glu-cose. Results: A novel, electrophoretically <b>silent</b> <b>chain,</b> 5 (A 2) Pro 3 Ala or Hb GoÌˆrwihl, was detected by cation-exchange HPLC. It accounted for 44 % of the total Hb and had functional properties similar to those of normal Hb A and a mild degree of heat instability. During incubation with glucose, glycation of the chains (as-sessed by ESMS) in the hemolysate of a healthy volun-teer was twice as fast as in hemolysate from the propos-itus. Conclusions: The substitution 5 (A 2) Pro 3 Ala seems to affect neither the functional properties nor the het-erotropic interactions of Hb, but slows glycation of the N-terminal valine by an unknown mechanism...|$|E
