40|$|Distributed {{learning}} in groups is usually supported by computer-supported collaborative learning environments. Although these environments {{have the potential}} to facilitate working in groups, they often do not fulfill this potential because of their inability to provide a sound <b>social</b> <b>space</b> where <b>social</b> relationships exist and where a sense of cohesiveness and community is achieved. This article reports on the construction and validation of a self-reporting (Dutchlanguage) <b>Social</b> <b>Space</b> Scale. The raw <b>Social</b> <b>Space</b> Scale was launched in three different distance education courses from the Open Universiteit Nederland using two different computer-supported collaborative learning environments. Factor analysis revealed that the <b>Social</b> <b>Space</b> Scale has two interpretable factors which are identified as the Positive Group Behavior dimension and the Negative Group Behavior dimension. The raw <b>Social</b> <b>Space</b> Scale was refined thereby reducing the number of test items from 44 to 20; each dimension encompasses 10 items. The internal consistency was 81 for the total scale, 92 for the Positive Group Behavior dimension and 87 for the Negative Group Behavior dimension. A nomological network was used for further validation. The findings suggest that the <b>Social</b> <b>Space</b> Scale has potential to be useful as a measure for <b>social</b> <b>space.</b> However, it must be realized that this measure is a first step and further validation research is needed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>space</b> is {{predominantly}} viewed by literature as masculine, i. e. {{it produces a}} framework of masculine hegemony regarding, in the first place, the distribution of work, time, and place (Bourdieu, 2000 : 17 - 18). The order constructed renders <b>social</b> <b>space</b> public, hegemonic, and heterosexual (see Hanson and Pratt). This transparent space (Rose, 1993 : 40), however, also entails a feminine <b>social</b> <b>space,</b> which, on the one hand, bears similar traits to masculine transparent space regarding its structure; and, on the other hand, is contested by the urge of subjective place-construction in an alternative <b>social</b> <b>space.</b> This characterization also holds for Hurston’s feminine <b>social</b> <b>space.</b> The reasons are twofold: a) feminine <b>social</b> <b>space</b> is structured on similar premises as its masculine counterpart, i. e. to maintain the female status quo via subversive power mechanisms; b) this female status quo exists much in relation to masculine transparent space, {{as a kind of}} subspace, which shows the naturalization of (white) masculine values in the female consciousness. In this way, Hurston’s struggle to establish a genuine feminine space marks also the strife against a feminine transparent space. I have already discussed Hurston’s individual response elsewhere.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of cultural capital across borders {{is a common}} topic in transnational sociology. While the majority of studies investigates the opportunities and challenges of adult migrants and their social mobility in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces,</b> children in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> are predominantly acknowledged either as indicators for their migrant population's mobility rates or as 'left-behinds'. While the first branch of literature investigates migrant population only {{in relation to the}} immigration country, the other does argue from a transnational perspective yet the ramifications and challenges of co-present parent-child relations in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> are an understudied topic. This article aims to raise awareness that the ways migrants raise their children in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> is a crucial site to study the broader topic of the modes of the (re-) production of transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces.</b> This is so because the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital is the main mechanism operating in the reproduction of unequal social structures and therefore also of transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces.</b> Based on twenty semi-structured interviews with migrants from Poland in Germany, this article sheds light on migrant parents' childrearing orientations in relation to language and education.
