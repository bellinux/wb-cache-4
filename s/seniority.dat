5|$|On 24 April 2002, SAS {{announced}} that all handling services operated by Braathens {{would be taken}} over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their <b>seniority.</b> No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case ended in the courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same <b>seniority</b> as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees, those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their <b>seniority.</b> The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying the employees their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the employees.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most <b>seniority</b> of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more <b>seniority</b> than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

5|$|Barrons was {{promoted}} to brigadier on 31 December 2003, with <b>seniority</b> from 30 June 2003. Upon promotion, he was posted to Northern Ireland, commanding 39 Infantry Brigade in Belfast, a position he held for two years. After Northern Ireland, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff, Commitments in 2005, with day-to-day responsibility for British Army operations.|$|E
5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same <b>seniority</b> roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5|$|In March 1777, Scott {{returned}} to his Virginia farm, taking his first furlough {{in more than a}} year. In recognition of his service with Washington, Congress commissioned him a brigadier general on April 2, 1777. At Washington's request, he {{returned to}} Trenton on May 10, 1777. His 4th Virginia Brigade and another brigade under William Woodford constituted the Virginia division, commanded by Adam Stephen, who had been promoted to major general. With Stephen and Brigadier General William Maxwell ill, Scott assumed temporary command of the division between May 19 and 24. Washington spent much of the summer of 1777 trying to anticipate and counter the moves of British General William Howe, and the lull in the fighting allowed Scott time to file a protest with Congress regarding how his <b>seniority</b> and rank had been calculated. After eight months of deliberation, Congress concurred with Scott's protest, placing him ahead of fellow brigadier general George Weedon in <b>seniority.</b>|$|E

5|$|Specter was {{instrumental}} in ensuring that the act allocated an additional $10 billion to the National Institutes of Health {{over the next two}} years. In late April 2009, facing a tough Republican primary, Specter switched to the Democratic party giving Democrats a super-majority. He was then denied <b>seniority</b> on Senate committees by his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The post is {{somewhat}} analogous to a Secretary in a State government. But because of <b>seniority,</b> office-bearers can hold senior positions {{such as that}} of Principal Secretary of a state government department, and in Union Territories, they can hold the position of Chief Secretary of a UT government.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Downey {{announced}} that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon <b>seniority</b> over the senators sworn in during January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his <b>seniority,</b> since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.|$|E

5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his <b>seniority</b> in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E

5|$|His {{father had}} him crowned king in 1057 or 1058. Solomon's {{coronation}} was a fundamental condition of his engagement to Judith, a sister of Henry IV, King of Germany. Their engagement {{put an end}} to the more than ten-year-long period of armed conflicts between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, Béla, who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of <b>seniority.</b> Béla had, since around 1048, administered the so-called ducatus or duchy, which encompassed one-third of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757.

It was conventional at the time to omit surnames for minor figures in the annals of Chinese history, and thus this is not unusual.|$|E
5|$|On 25October, the {{division}} was broken up and all troops {{were transferred to}} Special Force. Symes, despite his <b>seniority,</b> became Wingate's second-in-command and tried to prevent the further break-up of {{the division}}al units to retain the traditions, histories and esprit de corps of the British Army's regimental structure, which reconciled his men and helped to ensure a smooth transition to Special Force. Having ceased to exist, the 70th Division was officially disbanded on 24 November.|$|E

5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of <b>seniority.</b> Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter {{subsided}} into a genteel poverty, {{using the}} Guardian {{as an ongoing}} voice of protest. He lobbied for anti-lynching bills in Congress, with limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to {{the total population of}} the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by <b>seniority.</b>|$|E

In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of <b>seniority</b> did not afford him much influence.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{attained}} general officer {{status with}} promotion to acting major general in 1991 and took command of North East District and 2nd Infantry Division.

President escorted them to port at Malta before rejoining Constitution.|$|E
5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was {{the construction of a}} dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in <b>seniority</b> in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.|$|E
