25|$|Uranium {{and some}} other {{elements}} can {{be removed from the}} salt by a process called fluorine volatility: A <b>sparge</b> of fluorine removes volatile high-valence fluorides as a gas. This is mainly uranium hexafluoride, containing the uranium-233 fuel, but also neptunium hexafluoride, technetium hexafluoride and selenium hexafluoride, as well as fluorides of some other fission products (e.g. iodine, molybdenum and tellurium). The volatile fluorides can be further separated by adsorption and distillation. Handling uranium hexafluoride is well established in enrichment. The higher valence fluorides are quite corrosive at high temperatures and require more resistant materials than Hastelloy. One suggestion in the MSBR program at ORNL was using solidified salt as a protective layer. At the MSRE reactor fluorine volatility was used to remove uranium from the fuel salt. Also for use with solid fuel elements fluorine volatility is quite well developed and tested.|$|E
500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and <b>sparge</b> water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E

As a first step the performance of the model was evaluated by comparison with experimental data. Subsequently, four different perforated plates with different <b>sparged</b> areas were used as a gas <b>sparger.</b> Distributions of liquid velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and void fraction in the central plane were compared for the four different systems. Furthermore, the effect of the <b>sparger</b> location was also investigated. It was found that the liquid-phase circulation becomes more pronounced as the <b>sparged</b> area location is more distant {{from the center of the}} bottom plate. Finally, gas-phase residence time distributions (RTD) were obtained from the simulations. By employing standard axial dispersion model, the gas-phase mixing in the bubble column was characterized.

2500|$|Some {{elements}} like Xe and Kr {{come out}} easily as gas, assisted by a <b>sparge</b> of helium. In addition {{a part of}} the [...] "noble" [...] metals are removed together with the gas as a fine mist. Especially the fast removal of Xe-135 is important, as this is a very strong neutron poison and makes reactor control more difficult if left in the reactor. Removal of Xe also improves neutron economy. The gas (mainly He, Xe and Kr) is held up for about 2 days until a large fraction of the Xe-135 and other short lived isotopes have decayed. Most of the gas can then be recycled. After an additional hold up of several months, radioactivity is low enough to separate the gas at low temperatures into helium (for reuse), xenon (for sale) and krypton. The krypton needs storage (e.g. in compressed form) for an extended time (several decades) to wait for the decay of Kr-85.|$|E

40|$|The {{degree of}} waste paper {{recycling}} {{has been increasing}} steadily in North America over the last decade. Today, it is recognized that the flotation deinking process {{is one of the}} most important processes in waste paper recycling. This is demonstrated by the numerous variety of industrial flotation cell technologies currently available. Column flotation, developed in the mineral processing industry, is proposed as an alternative to other flotation technologies due to its low capital costs and improved separation performance. The flotation column requires an air <b>sparging</b> device to produce bubbles. Previous experimentation has shown that columns run with internal porous spargers initially produced excellent ink recoveries and low organic losses but eventually the <b>sparging</b> system plugged and performance deteriorated. In this work, an air <b>sparging</b> technique, based on a static inline pipe mixer was compared to a porous <b>sparger.</b> Both air <b>sparging</b> systems were evaluated in-plant on a lab scale flotation column to determine their relative merits, confirm previous work and compare to a circuit of full scale deinking cells. The effects of gas rate, retention time, wash water rate, froth height were investigated. It was found that the static mixer <b>sparger</b> was an excellent alternative to conventional porous spargers due to its stable operation and ability to control bubble size. As with porous spargers, the bubble surface area rate produced by the <b>sparging</b> system was found to be an important parameter in determining ink recovery.

50|$|The grains are {{infused with}} yet hotter water to rinse more sugars from the mash {{in a process}} known as {{sparging}}. There are two types of sparging. Fly sparging and batch sparging. Fly sparging involves rinsing the grain bed by adding small amounts of hot water to the top while draining equal amounts from the bottom. Batch sparging involves adding all or most of your <b>sparge</b> water at one time to the grain bed and slowly draining it from the bottom. The sparging process will also stop any further enzymatic activity if much hotter water is used; conversely the mash may be heated to around 80 C to end such activity prior to placing it in the lauter-tun, and to prevent cooler grain from lowering the <b>sparge</b> water temperature to a lower than desirable figure.|$|E
50|$|As culture growth occurs, {{carbon dioxide}} is {{produced}} and released through a vent {{at the top of}} the loop. A heat exchanger, located in the union between the towers at their base, allows excess heat generated by the culture to be removed. One tower within the pair contains a <b>sparge</b> bar, also located towards the tower's base. Air and ammonia are injected through the <b>sparge</b> bar to provide the oxygen and nitrogen required for respiration and protein production. This sparging action causes the pair of towers to function as an air lift culture vessel. The broth continually circulates between the two towers; as it is driven upwards by the <b>sparge</b> bar in one tower, it falls in the opposing tower. Such a stirring (or circulating) method can be more preferable for biological cultures as it is less likely to cause damage to cell membranes by mechanical compression or abrasion. The denser Fusarium venenatum culture falls to the base of the loop, where it is removed and heated to 64 °C for 20 minutes. Filtration is used to harvest the Fusarium venenatum, with this then being dried prior to blending with a binder. The majority of Quorn products are bound by rehydrated egg white, which makes them unsuitable for a vegan diet.

40|$|Abstract Efforts to {{increase}} H 2 yields from fermentative H 2 production include heat treat-ment of the inoculum, dissolved gas removal, and varying the organic loading rate. Although heat treatment kills methanogens and selects for spore-forming bacteria, {{the available evidence}} indicates H 2 yields are not maximized compared to bromoethanesulfonate, iodopropane, or per-chloric acid pre-treatments and spore-forming acetogens are not killed. Operational controls (low pH, short solids retention time) can replace heat treatment.
