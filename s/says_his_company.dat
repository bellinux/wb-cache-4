We see digital bits on our new HDTVs, {{listen to them}} over the Internet, and create new ones ourselves every time we take a picture with our digital cameras.

One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, <b>saying</b> that <b>his</b> <b>company</b> would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?"

5000|$|One {{problem in}} {{attracting}} development was Argentina's price controls on natural gas, keeping the price down to US$2.00-$2.50 per million BTU. However, the government exempted tight gas from controls, and in 2011 the Vaca Muerta gas was selling for US$4-$7. The higher gas prices attracted major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Total S.A., and Chevron Corporation to Vaca Muerta. In September 2016, after {{the change of}} government in Argentina, YPF said that proposed new rates for gas would permit the continued development of gas in Vaca Muerta. In May 2013, YPF announced that it had negotiated a joint venture in which Chevron would invest US$1.5 billion drilling 132 wells on the Loma Campana field. [...] Chevron's participation was complicated by efforts by the plaintiffs who obtained a judgement in Ecuador with respect to actions by Texaco in the Lago Agrio oil field to collect the judgement from Chevron's Argentine assets. On September 24, 2013, YPF announced that Dow Chemical Company subsidiary Dow Argentina had signed an agreement to drill 16 natural gas wells in the El Orejano block of the Vaca Muerta formation over a 12-month period, with Dow contributing US$120,000,000 and YPF US$68,000,000. Shell Argentina CEO Juan Jose Aranguren was quoted on December 10, 2013, as <b>saying</b> <b>his</b> <b>company,</b> with 4 producing wells in Vaca Muerta and 2 more drilling, would increase capital spending in Argentine shale to [...] "about" [...] US$500 million in 2014 from US$170 million in 2013.

[...] In January 2015 YPF indicated that it and Chevron had already invested over US$3 billion in their Loma Campana venture, which YPF described as the most important unconventional (oil) project in the world outside the United States.|$|R
5000|$|August 2011 {{came with}} a loss for HBO, no longer with Walt Disney Studios' catalog in Brazil. Other Latin American {{countries}} will remain with Disney's content. The Brazilian transition will occur for two more years - meanwhile, the back catalog will stay with HBO, but the premium window will be exclusive to Telecine, starting in October 2011. The announcement came amidst controversies: Telecine claims to now have over 70% of premieres (Disney included), an argument refuted by HBO, which, in turn, says it has over 50% of top grossing movies. The main issue, however, is that HBO announced that it spontaneously broke up the agreement with Disney to [...] "open space for new Brazilian productions," [...] also contradicting Disney's Latin America VP Fernando Barbosa's statement {{that it was a}} financial issue, Telecine being [...] "more watched and, thus, more profitable."

After multiple failed attempts in locating the Rocket Sales Corporation office, Puri decides to call the number on Rocket Sales Corporation's brochures and the phone at the AYS reception desk begins to ring. After thoroughly insulting him and firing both him and his partners, the MD has Harpreet sign a contract handing over Rocket Sales to him for a final compensation of Re.1 [...] However, AYS is unable to maintain Rocket Sales' commitment to customer satisfaction because of its cold and greedy personnel. The MD, realizing his downfall in purchasing Rocket Sales, visits Harpreet at his new job at Croma, an electronics store, and returns the contract to Harpreet in return for Re.1 [...] He also tells him never to become a businessman again, because he will fail again. However, this is not intended as an insult, but rather as a compliment; he implies that what made Harpreet so successful was his eschewing of 'normal' business practices such as kick-backs, false advertisement, and low wages.|$|R
