5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the Democratic candidate {{by a margin of}} 532 votes.

5|$|In 2013, Bevin {{announced}} he would challenge Kentucky's senior U.S. Senator, <b>Senate</b> <b>Minority</b> Leader Mitch McConnell, in the 2014 Republican primary. Although he gained the support of various groups aligned with the Tea Party Movement, McConnell attacked him repeatedly for inconsistencies in his public statements and policy positions and defeated him by almost 25 percentage points. After announcing he would seek the governorship in 2015, Bevin emerged from a four-way Republican primary, besting his nearest competitor, Agriculture Commissioner James Comer by 83 votes. On November 3, 2015, he defeated the state's attorney general, Democrat Jack Conway, in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the <b>Senate</b> <b>Minority</b> Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican <b>Senate</b> <b>minority</b> vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E

5000|$|After Smith lost to Republican {{candidate}} Herbert Hoover, Robinson {{emerged from}} the campaign a national figure, now known for the impassioned speeches he had made around the country on behalf of Smith and the Democratic platform. He continued to score victories as the <b>Senate's</b> <b>minority</b> leader, but his cooperative relationship with Hoover riled {{the members of his}} party.
