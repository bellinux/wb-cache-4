To hedge against a long futures trade a short position in synthetics can be established, and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} {{can buy the}} stock or instead sell, or [...] "write", a put. The trader selling a put {{has an obligation to}} buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price ("strike price"). If the stock price at expiration is above the strike price, the seller of the put (put writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price at expiration is below the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the trader will lose money, with the potential loss being up to the strike price minus the premium. A benchmark index for the performance of a cash-secured <b>short</b> <b>put</b> option position is the CBOE S 500 PutWrite Index (ticker PUT).|$|E

That the material of which those dust-particles was composed was very various has been ascertained, proved, and recorded by the Krakatoa Committee. The attempt to expound this matter would probably overtax the endurance of the average reader, yet it may interest all to know that this dust-cloud travelled westward within the tropics at the rate of about double the speed of an express train--say 120 miles an hour; crossed the Indian Ocean and Africa in three days, the Atlantic in two, America in two, and, in <b>short,</b> <b>put</b> a girdle round the world in thirteen days. Moreover, the cloud of dust was so big that it took two or three days to pass any given point.

It had thinned away altogether and disappeared in the spring of 1884.|$|E
