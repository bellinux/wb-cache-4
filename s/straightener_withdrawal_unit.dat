50|$|Operating in Watson, ACT, this is {{a two-week}} {{residential}} detoxification unit for adolescents. It can function either as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>unit</b> for young people suffering the effects of prolonged use of highly addictive substances such as opioids, or simply a professionally supervised two-week drug-free break from more intermittent but nonetheless problematic drug/alcohol use.|$|R
50|$|In 1981 the Woodhead {{line was}} closed east of Hadfield. In December 1984 the {{remaining}} section was converted {{to the standard}} 25 kV AC overhead system and the Class 506 EMUs were withdrawn following the last run on 7 December. Following <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>unit</b> 59404-59504-59604 was set aside for preservation, but the rest were all sent to Vic Berry in Leicester for scrap, being cut up in April 1985. They were replaced by Class 303s transferred from Glasgow (themselves since withdrawn). The Manchester-Hadfield line is now operated by Class 323 EMUs.|$|R
2500|$|F block {{opened for}} the first time in September 1988. The {{original}} F Block contained the, then CDT Department (downstairs) and the Business Studies Department (upstairs). Later, there was a major rebuild to the front of F Block, enlarging it to take the ever expanding school administrations. At the same time the Head Teacher's office was moved from C block (now the <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>unit)</b> to a new room in the new F Block.As ICT (IT then) expanded, the Business Studies rooms, F7 and F10 became computer rooms. [...] Recently F12 has been converted to house a number of PCs as has F1 with the addition of 30 PCs to augment the DT graphics lessons.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Withdrawals</b> of <b>units</b> {{started in}} mid-2004, when many new Class 444 and Class 450 [...] "Desiro" [...] units became {{available}} for service. By {{the end of}} 2004 {{just a handful of}} units remained in traffic. The final few units were withdrawn in May 2005, with the last in traffic being 1304/09/12/16, 1392/95/96/97/98, 1499 and 1881/90. The final slam-door service ran on 26 May from London Waterloo to Bournemouth using units 1396, 1398 and 4Vep 3536. Following <b>withdrawal</b> two <b>units,</b> nos. 1304 and 1881, were transferred to [...] "warm storage" [...] for use by Southern if required. Most of the other units were sent for scrap, with the exception of nos. 1392 and 1499.|$|R

50|$|In 1961, two {{withdrawn}} driving motors {{were converted}} to sleet locomotives. These were numbered ESL118A and ESL118B, having previously been 2758 and 2749 respectively. After <b>withdrawal,</b> both <b>units</b> were preserved, eventually locating at the Spa Valley Railway but now moved to Quainton.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the final}} months of traffic several units, {{including}} the first-built, no. 3401, were reformed {{in order to}} allow the vehicles in the best condition to be retained in service. <b>Withdrawals</b> of <b>units</b> picked up pace, with several large culls of units, the last of which occurred in March 2005. Beyond this date only a handful of units remained in traffic, namely nos. 3401/17/81 3516/20/36/76 and 3811. The final normal passenger service was operated on 26 May 2005 from London Waterloo to Bournemouth, using 4Vep 3536 sandwiched between 4Cig units 1396 and 1398. Following <b>withdrawal</b> most <b>units</b> were rapidly towed away for scrap. The [...] "celebrity" [...] blue unit, no. 3417, has been since been sold to the Bluebell Railway.|$|R
50|$|The 256th Mobile Civilian Plant Group, {{stationed}} at Reinsehlen, consisted of around 100 German civilian employees.

40|$|Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Scale-revised (CIWA-Ar) is {{currently}} the "gold standard" {{in the assessment of}} alcohol withdrawal in patients. The initial CIWA-A validation study was based on patients with moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal. The patients in the validation study were treated conservatively, without using benzodiazepines if possible. The validation study excluded patients with dual diagnosis or polydrug use. In contrast, most inpatients in Victorian <b>withdrawal</b> <b>units</b> have mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal and they are all aggressively treated with medications. In practice CIWA-Ar is used in all patients in alcohol withdrawal with or without dual diagnosis or polydrug use. This is despite the fact that CIWA-Ar has not been validated for patients with dual diagnosis or poly drug use. This study explored some of the potential problems and difficulties in the use of CIWA-Ar in a local context...|$|R

50|$|In the Polish Air Force, {{they were}} used from late 1924. Their <b>withdrawal</b> from combat <b>units</b> started in 1927, then {{they were used}} for {{training}} until mid-1930s.|$|R
50|$|With {{the lack}} of ongoing {{operational}} requirements {{and the age of}} the units that were not rebuilt themselves the number of units was reduced throughout the 1980s. Most of the first batch delivered were withdrawn by the end of 1986. Following <b>withdrawal</b> most <b>units</b> were taken to Hutt for scrapping during the early 1990s, though a few were scrapped elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{contract was}} awarded to the BREL-built Class 150. After <b>withdrawal</b> the <b>units</b> were stored at Llandudno Junction carriage sheds until they were purchased by Railtest (later Serco Railtest) who had planned to convert them into test units. However, {{for the same reasons}} which saw their withdrawal from service, Railtest did not go ahead with any conversions and the units were again stored out in the open in the sidings of the Derby RTC.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} early <b>withdrawal</b> of most <b>units</b> must {{be considered}} in the context that the LMS inherited 393 different locomotive classes at Grouping, and LMS chairman Sir Josiah Stamp thought it desirable to reduce this to just 10 classes.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} time perspectives and maladaptive cognitive schemas as predictors of students’ academic engagement and <b>unit</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Two hundred and sixteen students studying an online introductory unit in psychology completed an online questionnaire {{at the start of the}} unit. Their enrolment status was checked at the end of the unit. The strongest predictors of <b>unit</b> <b>withdrawal</b> were cognitive schemas and time perspectives associated with failure and hedonism. The strongest predictors of academic engagement were cognitive schemas and time perspectives associated with self-control and a focus on future outcomes. Based on these findings, psychological and pedagogical interventions aimed at increasing student engagement and reducing student attrition in online units of study are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Sulphuric acid {{pressure}} leaching of limonitic laterites is {{the process}} of choice to recover nickel and cobalt from equatorial lateritic ores, replacing the energy intensive pyrometallurgical methods.. This process achieves a high nickel and cobalt extraction more than 95 % with a high selectivity due to simultaneous iron and aluminium dissolution and precipitation. Experiments were carried out using batch pressure leaching techniques. A titanium autoclave equipped with acid injection and sample <b>withdrawal</b> <b>units</b> was employed. Conditions close to the industrial practice were tested: pulp density 30 %, acid to ore ratio 0. 2 and temperature ranging from 230 to 2708 C. Raw limonite and the evolution of the nature of solid products during leaching were characterised using transmission electron microscopy. It was observed that limonite consists of aggregates of needle-like particles of goethite compacted together. Nickel was found to be predominately associated with this phase. During leaching, goethite dissolves continuously liberating nickel whilst iron re-precipitates as dense hematite particles in solution by ex situ precipitation. Several kinetic models for porous solids were also tested. The grain model was finally proposed to best describe nickel dissolution kinetics. The rate-controlling step was suggested to be pore diffusion o...|$|R

50|$|The Occupation of Gori was the {{military}} occupation of Gori {{and its surrounding}} areas by Russian military forces, which started on 13 August 2008 {{as part of the}} Russo-Georgian War, and ended with the <b>withdrawal</b> of Russian <b>units</b> from the city on 22 August 2008.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War and the {{resultant}} <b>withdrawal</b> of Soviet <b>units</b> in Germany, the army was relocated to Smolensk, where it became a regular combined arms army in 1995 and disbanded in 1998. The army was reformed in 2014 as part of a Russian military expansion.|$|R
50|$|There {{was little}} {{to prevent the}} ELAS from taking full control of the country. With the German <b>withdrawal,</b> ELAS <b>units</b> had taken control of the {{countryside}} and of most cities. However, they did not take full control because the KKE leadership was instructed by the Soviet Union not to precipitate a crisis that could jeopardize Allied unity and put Stalin's larger postwar objectives at risk. The KKE’s leadership knew so, but not the ELAS's fighters and rank-and-file, which became a source of conflict within both EAM and ELAS.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the absence}} of the British cruisers, the destroyers of Task Element 95.12 were ordered on 3 December 1950 to cover the <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>units</b> from Chinnampo by escorting the {{transports}} into the harbour and providing gunfire support during their withdrawal. Reports claiming an emergency arrived from the harbour and the destroyers were forced to sail down the swept channel at night. While making her way up the channel, Sioux ran aground. Able to get herself clear, the destroyer then fouled her starboard screw, forcing her to retire. She and [...] provided a covering force for the withdrawal the next day.|$|R

By the end of 2002, the fleet was again being reduced, with many standard units being sent to Immingham for scrap. The 3 Cep units were all withdrawn by March 2003, as units in traffic beyond this date had to be fitted with TPWS equipment. In the event, only seven units, nos. 1562, 1590, 1592, 1593, 1594, 1602 and 1615 were retained.|$|R
