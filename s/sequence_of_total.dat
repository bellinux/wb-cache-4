The knowledge of the pulp- and solution properties along with the results of the model calculations could be used for optimisation of the bleaching process with respect to reaction time and temperature. Thermodynamics provides a practical tool for the estimation of the chemical states of pulp and paper solutions as well as in hydrometallurgical applications. Such a fundamental approach relates to the chemical energy, chemical reactions, solubility of gases and salts, and an important online process parameter pH.

40|$|Abstract Background Taihu Lake is {{a typical}} plain {{eutrophic}} shallow lake. With rapidly economic development of the lake area, the petroleum products and oil wastewater produced in various processes have been inevitably discharged into Taihu Lake. As the major fresh water resource in the economically developed region of Yangtze River Delta, the water quality and environmental condition of Taihu Lake have the direct bearing on the natural environment and sustainable development of economy in this region. For this reason we carried out the study to explore the composition, distribution characteristics and sources of petroleum contaminants in Taihu Lake. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide the basis for standard management and pollution control of the Taihu Lake environment. Results The result showed that water samples from near industrial locations were of relatively higher petroleum contaminants concentrations. The oil pollutants concentrations in different areas of Lake Taihu ranged from 0. 106 mg/L to 1. 168 mg/L, and the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> contents distribution characteristics of petroleum pollutants from high to low in different regions of Taihu Lake was: “Dapu”, “Xiaomeikou”, “Zhushan Bay”, “Lake center”, “Qidu”. The results showed that total concentrations of n-alkanes and PAHs ranged from 0. 045 to 0. 281 mg/L and from 0. 011 to 0. 034 mg/L respectively. In the same region, the concentrations of hydrocarbon pollutants in the surface and bottom of the lake were higher than that in the middle. Conclusion This paper reached a conclusion that the petroleum contaminants in Taihu Lake mainly derived from petroleum pollution caused by human activities as indicated by OEP, bimodal distribution, CPI, Pr/Ph ratio, the LMW/HMW ratio and other evaluation indices for sources of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{determine}} the total volumetric {{change and the}} relative speed of shrinkage of bulk fill flowable composites during polymerization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A specially designed electronic mercury dilatometer was used to {{determine the}} volumetric change. The light intensity was 500 mW/cm 2. The mercury dilatometer measured the volumetric change every 0. 5 seconds during the 35 second irradiation exposure time. The materials tested were Z 250 as standard and control. Four bulk fill flowable composites were tested. RESULTS: The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> volumetric change was found to be: Z 250 < Filtek bulk fill < Xtra-Base bulk fill < SDR < Venus bulk fill. The speed of shrinkage of the bulk fill flowables was faster than that of Z 250, while the 2 flowables with the highest shrinkage speed (SDR and Venus) also had the highest total volumetric change. Of the different materials tested the volumetric change of Z 250 (1. 13 %) was the lowest and significantly less (p< 0. 05) than that of SDR (1. 55 %) and Venus (1. 72 %). The material with the highest filler content (Z 250) also showed the lowest shrinkage (1. 13 %) but this effect could not be seen in the flowables. In general, it was found that a 35 second irradiation period (with a light intensity of 500 mW/cm 2) was satisfactory for complete polymerization of the resins. CONCLUSIONS: The volumetric changes and speed of shrinkage were higher for all 4 bulk fill flowable composites than for Z 250. SDR and Venus flowables had the fastest and highest volumetric shrinkage. Clinical significance: The manufacturers of bulk fill flowable composites advocate filling layers of 4 mm. However, because of the high shrinkage values found in this study it should be suggested that the standard 2 mm layer increments still be used. It was partly supported by the IADR and the C. H.

The experiments of in situ TR-FTIR spectroscopic characterizations on the reactions of CH 4 over OZ pre-treated Rh/SiO 2 and Ru/SiO 2 catalysts indicated that the products of CH 4 oxidation over Rh/SiO 2 and Ru/SiO 2 greatly depend on the concentration of O 2 - species over the catalysts. On the catalysts with high concentration of O 2 -, CH 4 will be completely oxidized to CO 2. However, if the concentration of O 2 - species over the catalysts is low enough, CH 4 can be selectively converted to CO without the formation of CO 2. The parallel experiments using in situ TR-FTIR spectroscopy to monitor {{the reaction of the}} CH 4 /O- 2 /Ar (2 / 1 / 45, molar ratio) mixture over Rh/SiO 2 and Ru/SiO 2 catalysts show that the mechanisms of synthesis gas formation over the two catalysts are quite different.

The significant difference in the mechanisms of partial oxidation of CH 4 to synthesis gas over Rh/SiO 2 and Ru/SiO 2 catalysts can be well related to the difference in the concentration of O 2 - species over the catalysts under the reaction conditions mainly due to the difference in oxygen affinity of the two metals...|$|E

Our principal results in this area are a characterization of graphs with no K_ 2, 3 -immersion, and a characterization of graphs with neither a K_ 2, 3 -immersion nor a K_ 4 -immersion. We study of the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph with no K_t-immersion. For t??? 7, we determine this maximum value. When 5 ???t??? 7, we characterize the graphs with no K_t-immersion having the most edges. Given an edge-colored graph, a rainbow subgraph is a subgraph whose edges have distinct colors. We show that if the edges of a graph G are colored so that at least k colors appear at each vertex, then G contains a rainbow matching of size floor(k/ 2). We consider the rainbow edge-chromatic number of an edge-colored graph, χ'_r(G), which we define to be the minimum number of rainbow matchings partitioning the edge set of G. A d-tolerant edge-colored graph is one that contains no monochromatic star with d + 1 edges. We off er examples of d-tolerant n-vertex edge-colored graphs G for which χ'_r(G) ???d/ 2 (n- 1) and prove that χ'_r(G) <d(d+ 1) nlnn for all such graphs. We study the rainbow domination number of an edge-colored graph, γ(G), which we define to be the minimum number of rainbow stars covering the vertex set of G. We generalize three bounds on the domination number of graphs. In particular, we show that γ(G) ???d/(d+ 1) n for all d-tolerant n-vertex edge-colored graphs G and characterize the edge-colored graphs achieving this bound. A total acquisition move in a weighted graph G moves all weight from a vertex u to a neighboring vertex v, provided that before this move the weight on v is at least the weight on u. The total acquisition number, a_t(G), is the minimum number of vertices with positive weight that remain in G after a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> acquisition moves, starting with a uniform weighting of the vertices of G. We offer an independent proof that a_t(G) ???floor((|V(G) |+ 1) / 3) for all graphs with at least two vertices. In addition, we characterize graphs achieving this bound. If a_t(G) =(|V(G) |+ 1) / 3, then G∈ T∪P_ 2,C_ 5, where T is the family of trees that can be constructed from P_ 5 by iteratively growing paths with three edges from neighbors of leaves...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of energy input-output in boro rice cultivation was undertaken for well recognized salinity classes (S 1 -S 5) and farm categories (landless, marginal, small, medium, and large) in south-west coastal Bangladesh. A <b>total</b> <b>of</b> 125 target farmers were surveyed by using structured questionnaire during the boro season (January-May 2011). Survey data were converted into energy {{by using the}} respective energy co-efficient equivalents. The results revealed that the <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> energy input were S 1 > S 5 > S 2 > S 4 > S 3 and medium > large > landless > small > marginal among salinity regimes and farm categories, respectively. The seedbed stage consumed the highest energy followed by growing stage, and harvesting and threshing. Inorganic fertilizers accounted for a major share (59. 98...|$|R
40|$|Whole-genome-shotgun (WGS) <b>sequencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> genomic DNA {{was used}} to recover ~ 1 Mbp of novel {{mitochondrial}} (mtDNA) sequence from Pinus sylvestris (L.) and {{three members of the}} closely related Pinus mugo species complex. DNA was extracted from megagametophyte tissue from six mother trees from locations across Europe, and 100 -bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Candidate mtDNA sequences were identified by their size and coverage characteristics, and by comparison with published plant mitochondrial genomes. Novel variants were identified, and primers targeting these loci were trialled on a set of 28 individuals from across Europe. In total, 31 SNP loci were successfully resequenced, characterizing 15 unique haplotypes. This approach offers a cost-effective means of developing marker resources for mitochondrial genomes in other plant species where reference sequences are unavailable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human gut {{microbiome}} can now {{be characterized}} in unprecedented detail by an approach based on high-throughput <b>sequencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> stool DNA, that we name quantitative metagenomics. Central to the approach is a catalog that lists all the genes of intestinal microbes that are known –  9. 9  millions, identified by the analysis of 1267  stool samples. Beyond the gene list, genetic units that carry them begun to be known; many of these correspond to bacterial species that were never isolated and cultured yet. Quantitative metagenomics allows developing powerful algorithms to diagnose a disease, monitor patients and identify individuals at risk to progress towards a disease. This lays ground for developing new approaches to better restore and even preserve the health by modulation of the altered microbiome, which contributes to promote or aggravate a disease...|$|R
