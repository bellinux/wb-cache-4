40|$|In cold-formed steel (CFS) construction, bolted {{connections}} without washers for either oversized or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> may significantly expedite the installation process {{and lower the}} cost. However, the North American Specification (AISI S 100, 2007) for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members requires washers to be installed in {{bolted connections}} with oversized or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> A research project (Phase 1) sponsored by American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) was recently completed at the University of North Texas (UNT) that investigated the performance and strength of bolted CFS connections with oversized and <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> without using washers. The research presented in this thesis is the Phase 2 project in which the bolted CFS connections were studied in a broader respect {{in terms of the}} failure mechanism, the material thickness, and the hole configurations. Single shear and double shear connections without washers using oversized holes, oversized combined with standard or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> were experimentally examined. Combined with Phase 1 results, the Phase 2 gives a comprehensive evaluation of the behavior and strength of bolted CFS connections with oversized and <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> without using washers. Revisions to the existing AISI North American Specification requirements for bolted connections are proposed to account for the reduction in the connection strength caused by the oversized and slotted hole configurations without washers. Specific LRFD and LSD resistance factors and ASD safety factors for different hole configurations in terms of the new proposed methods were presented. ii Copyright 2010 b...|$|E

40|$|Lapped joints of cold-formed steel (CFS) Z-shaped purlins are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} building roof systems. The {{research that has}} been carried out so far for these lapped connections is primarily focused on connections with round holes. However, the lapped connections with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> are extensively used in current construction practice to simplify the erection of continuous Z-shaped roof purlins. There is no design guideline or recommendation available for CFS Z-purlin lapped connections with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> Presented in this paper are the results of an experimental study and analysis of the structural behaviour of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlin connections with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> 42 flexural tests were performed on lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with vertical slotted connections with different lap lengths, purlin depths, thicknesses and spans. The flexural strength and deflection of each specimen were measured. The characteristics of moment resistance and flexure stiffness of the lapped purlins were computed. The test results show that the lapped purlins with vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> may be more flexible than the lapped purlins with round holes or continuous purlins without lapped joint. Thus, the slotted connections may need greater lap lengths to achieve full stiffness of continuous purlins. The results also indicate that the characteristics of moment resistance and flexural stiffness in the slotted connections are dependent on the ratio of lap length to purlin depth, the ratio of lap length to purlin thickness, the ratio of purlin depth to purlin thickness, and the ratio of lap length to span. Based on the results, design recommendations for evaluating the moment resistance and flexural stiffness of lapped slotted connections were proposed...|$|E

40|$|Bolted {{road safety}} barrier {{connections}} utilise <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> that are {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the safety barrier beam. Due to the clearance between the <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> and the bolts, a varying amount of slippage is seen before contact with the edge of the slot is made. The stiffness characteristics of bolted road safety barrier connections have been examined with a representative test coupon that incorporates a full size safety barrier connection slot to industry standard dimensions. Previous research work has successfully determined the stiffness characteristics of the bolted connections at quasi-static strain rates. Representative non-linear finite element models of the bolted test coupons have been constructed. When compared to the laboratory results the initial stiffness, maximum force and displacement of the bolted connections are similar to the finite element model predictions. Current investigations have moved onto strain rates comparable to those observed in actual vehicle crash tests. Explicit dynamic finite element(FE) models have been constructed and validated, using experimental data produced using a series of high strain rate laboratory tests fora number of bolt configurations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the short- and long-term behaviour of injected bolted connections (IBCs) with oversize holes for various injection materials. A central theme in this thesis the demountability of IBCs, {{as a result of}} which several release agents are tested for their suitability in and effects on IBCs. Injection bolts have been used successfully in engineering practice using epoxy resin to limit the amount of slip in bolted shear connections with normal clearance holes, but no explicit results are available for connections with oversize or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> The use of oversize or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> may be beneficial for the (re-) erection process of structures, and thus it is investigated what the effects of such oversize or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> are on the connection behaviour. First, it is examined if grout is suitable as an injection material in injected bolted connections (IBCs), as well as what precautions are necessary to ensure proper demountability of grout- and (epoxy) resin-injected bolted connections. Secondly, the connection behaviour under short-term loading is determined, on the basis of which long-term creep tests are carried out. Finally, a new injection material is developed based on the preliminary conclusions drawn from the short- and long-term tests. It is concluded that IBCs can be demounted by treating the connection members with a release agent. The results of the experiments show that the long-term behaviour of resin-injected connections is governing the design, but that modelling of this time-dependent behaviour requires additional testing. The short and long-term performance of the newly developed material (resin reinforced with steel shot) in IBCs with oversize holes is significantly better than that of only resin, on the basis of which it is recommended to further investigate the potential and behaviour of this material in engineering applications.

40|$|International audienceConnections {{in steel}} {{structures}} are of main {{importance in the}} design process. Cover-plate connections with circular or <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> are of common use in steel structures. The behavior of such connections is characterized by various failure modes. Bearing mode {{is one of the}} most complex due to the distribution of stresses and strain around the loaded holes. This paper deals with the characterization of the behavior of cover-plate bolted joints with <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> Numerical simulations using the Cast 3 M FE package are performed in association with an original experimental method based on full-field measurements. The strain fields obtained with these methods (grid method and Digital Image Correlation (DIC)) give the possibility to observe the evolution of the local deformations in the loaded zones of the connections. These evolutions are compared to those given by the Finite Element model for each configuration at different loadings stages. Thus, the experimental results are used to validate the numerical model. The comparisons are based on the load-displacement curves, the failure modes and the local deformations in the zones around the bolts holes. Six different geometrical parameters of the holes and their positions are considered in the tests. The validated numerical model is used to evaluate the influences of the dimensions of the slotted hole. The results showed that the geometry has a significant influence on the failure mode of the connections such as net section and bearing. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to those given by the analytical approach of Eurocode 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the analytical prediction. The study shows the influence of various geometrical parameters on the resistance and the failure mode of the connections with <b>slotted</b> <b>holes.</b> The strain fields obtained with the grid method and DIC are observed in the plate around the bolt in the elastic and plastic phases. They give the possibility to observe experimentally the evolution of strains in a wide area of the most stressed zones in order to develop more accurate analytical models based on experimental evolutions of strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{solutions}} for in-situ connections of steel tubular towersegments of onshore wind turbines are ring flange connections. These havecertain drawbacks, such as e. g. costly production, long delivery time and ratherlow fatigue endurance. Friction connections with long open <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> havepreviously {{been proven to}} be a competitive alternative. In this work, the newtype of connection is investigated in various scales: segment tests, down-scaledexperiments and full-scale models. The influence of tower cross-section shape,execution tolerance (horizontal gap between the tower segments) and length ofthe connection on the bending resistance is thoroughly studied. In addition,buckling behaviour of the shell {{in the vicinity of the}} friction connection intowers with circular and polygonal cross-sections is analysed in order to checkpossible advantages of either cross-section. The influence of two types of theexecution tolerances on the connection strength is investigated: inwards bent“fingers”, leading to inclined gaps, and a parallel gap created by differentdiameters of the tower segments. Based on validated finite element analysesrecommendations for execution tolerances are proposed. A closer look is taken at the level of bolt forces under load application for thenew friction connections as well as for the ring flange connection. For theformer case, the influence of <b>slotted</b> <b>holes</b> on the joint resistance is checked. For both types of connections, comparison is drawn to hand calculation modelsused in engineering practice. Additionally, the distribution of meridionalstresses in the shell in the vicinity of the connection is studied. Based on the findings from the above described investigations,recommendations for the design of friction connections with open slotted holesin steel tubular towers for onshore wind turbines are given.
