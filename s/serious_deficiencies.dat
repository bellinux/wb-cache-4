25|$|Despite the Treaty of Karlowitz, the Ottomans were unreconciled to {{the loss}} of the Morea, and already in 1702 there were rumours of {{impending}} war, with troops and supplies sent to the Ottoman provinces adjoining the Morea. The Republic was well aware of the Ottoman intentions, and from the beginning of its rule in the Morea, its officials toured the fortresses to ascertain their state and their capacity to resist. However, the Venetians' position was hampered by problems of supplies and morale, as well as the extreme lack of troops available: even while the war was ongoing, in 1690, the Venetian forces in southern Greece numbered only 4,683 men, both mercenaries from Western Europe and local Greeks (recruited {{along the lines of the}} Venetian cernide system); while in 1702, the garrison at Corinth, the main invasion route from the mainland, numbered only 2,045 infantry and barely a thousand cavalry. Although a detailed survey in 1698 found <b>serious</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in all the fortresses of the Morea, little seems to have been done to address them. Almost the only major work undertaken by the Venetians during their rule in the Morea was the new citadel for Nauplio on the height of Palamidi overlooking the city, whose construction began under the supervision of Morosini during the Morean War. In the event, however, the defences of the city held out only for a few days against the determined Ottoman attacks in 1715.|$|E

Monroe decided on political grounds not to offer Henry Clay the State Department, and Clay turned down the War Department and remained Speaker of the House, so Monroe lacked an outstanding westerner in his cabinet.

During Fleet Problem XXI in 1940, the fleet tested its communications procedures under simulated war conditions and discovered <b>serious</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in its existing communications plans.

However, it was obvious that they were nowhere near being the powerhouse that had dominated the league in the previous half-decade. In 1992–93, the Oilers missed the playoffs {{for the first time as}} an NHL team.

[...] The {{township}} was established (circa) 1917 by the Matarawa Land Company as a potential farming area; although a few families had already settled in the area after 1910, and a school with 9 pupils was founded in 1915 (later to become Tokoroa East School). The land was found to be too poor for raising cattle or sheep due to its predominant pumice soils. [...] However, agricultural science showed the land could actually be made to successfully support dairy cattle.

In the 1930s, the deficiency was addressed, and subsequently, cattle farming then became profitable.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{regarded}} the 'martial races' as valiant and strong but also intellectually inferior, lacking the initiative or leadership qualities to command large military formations. They were also regarded as politically subservient or docile to authority. For these reasons, the martial races theory {{did not lead}} to officers being recruited from them; recruitment was based on social class and loyalty to the British Raj. One source calls this a [...] "pseudo-ethnological" [...] construction, which was popularised by Frederick Sleigh Roberts, and created <b>serious</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in troop levels during the World Wars, compelling them to recruit from 'non-martial races'. Winston Churchill was reportedly concerned that the theory was abandoned during the war and wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, India that he must, [...] "rely as much as possible on the martial races". After Indian Independence, the Indian Army abandoned this theory and recruitment took place without discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|Archduke Charles, {{appointed}} Generalissimo {{after the}} debacle of the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, had tried {{for three years}} to improve the Austrian army. Historian David G.

He expanded the number of regular soldiers to 340,000 and created {{a large body of}} 240,000 landwehr troops. He upgraded the artillery corps, adopted the corps organization, and revised the infantry drillbook, incorporating more French-style tactical evolutions. <b>Serious</b> <b>deficiencies</b> remained, however, in Austrian staffwork, in the landwehr organization, and among the non-German nationalities. At the start, only 15,000 of the best landwehr formations were added to the field army while the rest were relegated to garrison duty or the reserves. The Habsburgs did not wish to arm the population for fear of an insurrection and therefore the landwehr was never fully utilized. In Hungary, the nobles and people were cool toward the war and contributed as little as possible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the growth effect of limited availability {{of higher education}} in a simple endogenous growth model with overlapping generations. When the availability is limited, the scarcity of human capital keeps its price high and thereby enables the young households to earn a larger share of the aggregate output.

A further expansion in the availability causes a temporary boom followed by a <b>serious</b> <b>deficiency</b> in investible funds, which substantially lowers the long-term rate of growth...|$|R

Verbal {{inflection}} and non-lexical movement is awkward to notate, and more recent analyses such as those of Ted Supalla have contradicted Stokoe's set of motion phonemes. There is also no provision for representing the relationship between signs in their natural context, which restricts the usefulness of the notation to the lexical or dictionary level. Nonetheless, Stokoe demonstrated for the first time that a sign language can be written phonemically just like any other language.|$|R
