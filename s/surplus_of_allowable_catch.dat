50|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) are fishery rationalization instruments defined {{under the}} Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as limited access permits to harvest quantities of fish. Fisheries scientists decide the optimal amount <b>of</b> fish (total <b>allowable</b> <b>catch)</b> {{to be harvested}} in a certain fishery. The decision considers carrying capacity, regeneration rates and future values. Under ITQs, members of a fishery are granted rights to a percentage <b>of</b> the total <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> that can be harvested each year. These quotas can be fished, bought, sold, or leased allowing for the least cost vessels to be used. ITQs are used in New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Canada, and the United States.

40|$|In the {{southern}} Benguela ecosystem off South Africa, there were recent shifts {{to the south}} and east in the distributions of three forage resources (anchovy, sardine, rock lobster), which probably were influenced by environmental change although fishing too may have played a part. In this study, we review information on trends in distributions and numbers of eight seabirds breeding in South Africa. For five species that feed predominantly on anchovy, sardine or rock lobster, their populations off northwest South Africa decreased markedly. For three of these species, which exhibit behavioural inertia and have restricted foraging ranges when breeding (African penguin, Cape cormorant, bank cormorant), there were large decreases in their overall populations in South Africa. Conversely, for two showing more plasticity and able to range over wide areas or move between breeding localities (Cape gannet, swift tern) there were increases. It is thought that movement of forage resources away from the northern islands led to a mismatch in the distributions of breeding localities and prey of dependent seabirds off western South Africa and to attempts by several species to establish colonies on {{the southern}} mainland closer to food resources. There also were shifts {{to the south and}} east in the distributions of three seabirds that do not compete with fisheries for prey (crowned cormorant, white-breasted cormorant, kelp gull), suggesting some environmental forcing, but decreases of these species off northwest South Africa were less severe and populations in South Africa remained stable or increased in the long term. It is likely, because many fishing plants are located in the northwest, that there was increased competition between seabirds and fisheries for prey as forage resources moved south and east. Potential interventions to mitigate the adverse impacts of distributional changes for seabirds include allocations <b>of</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> shared forage resources at regional levels...|$|R

The 1995 Agreement concluded {{as a result of the}} United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and a number of other international agreements have set the scene for significant change in High Seas fisheries management. In particular, through the auspices of regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and arrangements, state parties will be under an obligation to co-operate and agree, where appropriate, on participatory rights in High Seas fisheries, including allocations <b>of</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> or levels <b>of</b> fishing effort.

Since 2001, the Irish commercial salmon fishery has been managed on the basis <b>of</b> Total <b>Allowable</b> <b>Catch</b> (TAC) in each of 17 salmon fishing districts. This has been made possible by applying a number of new and innovative techniques to the estimation of conservation limits (CLs) and pre-fishery abundance (PFA) for combined stocks in each district. Stock and recruitment parameters from well-monitored European rivers were “transported” to all Irish rivers using a Bayesian hierarchical stock and recruitment (BHSRA) model. This provided the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters and related reference points, including individual river CLs.

These findings motivate discussion of the role of IDR as an observable condition in fisheries recovery. We note the potential to monitor and compare the progress of fishery recovery using the IDR statistic or derivatives that reflect its time path to long run values associated with the stock management goal. We argue that IDR provide the opportunity to aggregate fishers’ tacit knowledge with models of bio-economic optima in understanding the recovery process...|$|R

The data subsets were then used in the standardisation of CPUE and the stock assessment of elephant fish. The catch-and-effort subsets produced different patterns of precision and trends, each of which led to different estimates (and related uncertainty) of model parameters and management reference points.

Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas.
