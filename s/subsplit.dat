40|$|New {{data are}} {{presented}} for {{the concentrations of}} 23 to 27 elements in nine Apollo 16 surface soil samples, two subsplits each of 12 splits of core 60002 - 7, and one <b>subsplit</b> each of 10 splits of drive tube 64002. The surface soils are generally similar to other surface soils collected at their respective stations. All ten 64002 samples are similar {{to each other and}} to the station 4 surface soils and distinctly different from soils at other stations. High iron concentrations previously reported for these same subsplits of 60002 - 7 result primarily from meteoritic metal. One sample from each core is contaminated by stainless steel. The recently proposed ferroan anorthositic norites are required to explain the soil compositions. A yet uncharacterized component with high concentrations of Na, Sr, and Eu is also needed...|$|E

A leaf-labelled tree is a data structure which is a special type of a tree where only leaves (terminal) nodes are labelled. This data structure is used in bioinformatics for modelling of evolution history of genes and species and also in linguistics for modelling of languages evolution history. Many domain specific problems occur {{and need to be}} solved with help of tree postprocessing techniques such as distance measures. Results Here we introduce the tree edit distance designed for leaf labelled trees on free leafset, which occurs to be a metric. It is presented together with tree edit consensus tree notion. We provide statistical evaluation of provided measure with respect to R-F, MAST and frequent <b>subsplit</b> based dissimilarity measures as the reference measures. Conclusions The tree edit distance was proven to be a metric and has the advantage of using different costs for contraction and pruning, therefore their properties can be tuned depending on the needs of the user. Two of the presented methods carry the most interesting properties. E(3, 1) is very discriminative (having a wide range of values) and has a very regular distance distribution which is similar to a normal distribution in its shape and is good both for similar and non-similar trees. NFC(2, 1) on the other hand is proportional or nearly proportional to the number of mutation operations used, irrespective of their type. </p...|$|E
40|$|Inaccurate {{inference}} of positional homologies {{in multiple}} sequence alignments and systematic errors introduced by align-ment heuristics obfuscate phylogenetic inference. Alignment masking, {{the elimination of}} phylogenetically uninformative or misleading sites from an alignment before phylogenetic analysis, is a common practice in phylogenetic analysis. Although masking is often done manually, automated methods are necessary to handle the much larger data sets being prepared today. In this study, we introduce the concept of <b>subsplits</b> and demonstrate their use in extracting phylogenetic signal from alignments. We design a clustering approach for alignment masking where each cluster contains similar columns—similarity being defined {{on the basis of}} compatible subsplits; our approach then identifies noisy clusters and eliminates them. Trees inferred from the columns in the retained clusters are found to be topologically closer to the reference trees. We test our method on numerous standard benchmarks (both synthetic and biological data sets) and compare its performance with other methods of alignment masking. We find that our method can eliminate sites more accurately than other methods, particularly on divergent data, and can improve the topologies of the inferred trees in likelihood-based analyses.

40|$|Meteorites {{ejected from}} the surface of the Moon as a result of impact events are an {{important}} source of lunar material in addition to Apollo and Luna samples. Here, we report bulk element composition, mineral chemistry, age, and petrography of Miller Range (MIL) 090036 and 090070 lunar meteorites. MIL 090036 and 090070 are both anorthositic regolith breccias consisting of mineral fragments and lithic clasts in a glassy matrix. They are not paired and represent sampling of two distinct regions of the lunar crust that have protoliths similar to ferroan anorthosites. 40 Ar- 39 Ar chronology performed on two <b>subsplits</b> of MIL 090070, 33 (a pale clast impact melt and a dark glassy melt component) shows that the sample underwent two main degassing events, one at ~ 3. 88 Ga and another at ~ 3. 65 Ga. The cosmic ray exposure data obtained from MIL 090070 are consistent with a short (~ 8 – 9 Ma) exposure close to the lunar surface. Bulk-rock FeO, TiO 2, and Th concentrations in both samples were compared with 2 -degree Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer (LP-GRS) data sets to determine areas of the lunar surface where the regolith matches the abundances observed on the sample. We find that MIL 090036 bulk rock is compositionally most similar to regolith surrounding the Procellarum KREEP Terrane, whereas MIL 090070 best matches regolith in the feldspathic highlands terrane on the lunar farside. Our results suggest that some areas of the lunar farside crust are composed of ferroan anorthosite, and that the samples shed light on the evolution and impact bombardment history of the ancient lunar highlands...|$|R
40|$|The South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin is the stratigraphically oldest {{identifiable}} lunar {{basin and}} is therefore {{one of the most}} important targets for absolute age-dating to help understand whether ancient lunar bombardment history smoothly declined or was punctuated by a cataclysm. The SPA basin also has another convenient property, a geochemically distinct interior, unobscured by extensive mare basalt fill. A case has been made for the possible origin of the Dhofar 961 lunar meteorite in the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, based on comparing its composition with Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data for the interior of the SPA basin. Dhofar 961 contains several different impact-melt (IM) lithologies. Jolliff et al. described two classes of mafic impact-melt lithologies, one dominated by olivine (Lithology A) and the other by plagioclase (An 95 - 96. 5) (Lithology B). Broad-beam analyses of these lithologies yielded (is) approximately 14. 0 wt% FeO, 11. 7 wt% MgO, and 15. 4 wt% Al 2 O 3. Lithologies A and B differ by approximately 2. 5 % Al 2 O 3, 1. 5 % FeO and 1. 5 % MgO, consistent with the occurrence of olivine phenocrysts in A and plagioclase clasts in B. Both lithologies are considerably more mafic than the Apollo mafic impact-melt breccias, corresponding to olivine gabbronorite. Joy et al. used U-Pb dating to investigate phosphate fragments in the Dhofar 961 matrix and impact-melt clasts. Matrix phosphates have 4. 34 to 4 Ga ages, consistent with ancient KREEP-driven magmatic episodes and Pre-Nectarian ((is) greater than 3. 92 Ga). Phosphates found within Dhofar 961 crystalline impact melt breccia clasts range from 4. 26 to 3. 89 Ga, potentially recording events throughout the basin forming epoch of lunar history. The youngest reset ages in the Dhofar 961 sample represent an upper limit for the time of formation of the meteorite. Joy et al suggested this age represents the final impact that mixed and consolidated several generations of precursor rocks into the Dhofar meteorite group, although they note that further age dating of all the stones is required to test this hypothesis. We received a split of Dhofar 961 from R. Zeigler consisting of a large clast of IM Lithology B, with some light-colored, friable matrix clinging to the external margins of the impact-melt clast. This lithology was not present in the samples investigated by Joy et al. and thus does not have corresponding U-Pb ages on it. We created multiple <b>subsplits</b> of both the IM and matrix lithologies, each weighing several tens of micrograms. We conducted Ar- 40 Ar- 39 dating of this candidate SPA material by high-resolution step heating and comparing it with the regolith that surrounds it...|$|R
