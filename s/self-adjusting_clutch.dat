The five-door Combi-coup√© model was also introduced.|$|E

The rear suspension was a sophisticated monoshock arrangement that used a single rear swingarm tube to carry the driveshaft as well.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{incarnation}} of the Cortina was designed by Roy Haynes, and launched on 18 October 1966, {{four years after the}} original Cortina. Although the launch was accompanied by the slogan [...] "New Cortina is more Cortina", the car, at 168 in long, was fractionally shorter than before. Its 2+1/2 in of extra width and curved side panels provided more interior space. Other improvements included a smaller turning circle, softer suspension, <b>self-adjusting</b> brakes and <b>clutch</b> together with the availability on the smaller-engined models, for the UK and some other markets, of a new five bearing 1,300 cc engine.|$|R
