The next minute--his last on board--was crowded with a tumult of events and sensations which beat about him like the sea upon a rock. I use the simile advisedly, because from his {{relation}} I am forced to believe he had preserved through it all a strange illusion of passiveness, as though he had not acted but had suffered himself to be handled by the infernal powers who had selected him for the victim of their practical joke. The first thing that came to him was the grinding surge of the heavy davits swinging out at last--a jar which seemed to enter his body from the deck through the soles of his feet, and travel up his spine to the crown of his head. Then, the squall being very near now, another and a heavier swell lifted the passive hull in a threatening heave that checked his breath, while his brain and his heart together were pierced as with daggers by panic-stricken screams. [...] "Let go! For God's sake, let go! Let go! She's going." [...] Following upon that the boat-falls ripped through the blocks, and a lot of men began to talk in startled tones under the awnings. [...] "When these beggars did break out, their yelps were enough to wake the dead," [...] he said. Next, after the splashing shock of the boat literally dropped in the water, came the hollow noises of stamping and tumbling in her, mingled with confused shouts: [...] "Unhook! Unhook! Shove! Unhook! Shove for your life! Here's the squall down on us. [...] ." [...] He heard, high above his head, the faint muttering of the wind; he heard below his feet a cry of pain. A lost voice alongside started cursing a <b>swivel</b> <b>hook.</b> The ship began to buzz fore and aft like a disturbed hive, and, as quietly as he was telling me of all this--because just then he was very quiet in attitude, in face, in voice--he went on to say without the slightest warning as it were, [...] "I stumbled over his legs." ...|$|E

5000|$|A logging tool {{description}} {{from the}} Lumberman's Museum at Patten, Maine, reads in part: [...] "A cant dog or cant hook {{was used for}} lifting, turning, and prying logs when loading sleds and on the drive. At first, a <b>swivel</b> <b>hook</b> on a pole with nothing {{to hold it in}} position was used. This was called a swing dingle." [...] However, the term swing dingle is more often published as being a type of logging sled. These early types are also called a ring dog or ring dog cant hook. In 1858, Joseph Peavey, a blacksmith in Stillwater, Maine, made a rigid clasp to encircle the cant dog handle with the hook on one side. It moved up and down, but not sideways. All loggers have used it ever since." ...|$|E

5000|$|Constructing a trotline {{is quite}} simple. Basic {{supplies}} needed are fishing <b>hooks,</b> clamps, <b>swivels,</b> fishing line, and a durable cord or lightweight rope {{used for the}} main line. Before constructing the trotline, {{it is a good}} idea to measure the span of the body of water being fished in order to give the main line an appropriate length.

50|$|Popular among fishermen, tautog have a {{reputation}} for being a particularly tricky fish to catch. Part of this is because of their tendency to live among rocks and other structures that can cause a fisherman’s line to get snagged. The favorite baits for tautog include green crabs, Asian shore crabs, fiddler crabs, clams, shrimp, mussels, sandworms, and lobsters. Tautog fishing may also be difficult due to the tendency of fishermen try to set the hook as soon as they feel a hit, rather than wait for the tautog to swallow the bait. Rigs with minimal beads, <b>swivels</b> and <b>hooks</b> should be used to prevent entanglement with the rocks, reefs or wrecks that tautog frequent.|$|R
5000|$|Many amateur anglers {{also enjoy}} hooking this {{fish in the}} months of June, July and early August. A simple line and jig system is enough to catch the fish as they feast on mayflies and midges. In winter months, {{catching}} whitefish through the ice is very popular, particularly in northern Wisconsin, with many fishing guides specializing in this species. Successful icefishing techniques include using a jigging spoon, {{with at least one}} [...] "slider hook" [...] above and separated from the spoon with a barrel <b>swivel,</b> and all <b>hooks</b> tipped with wax worms. Commercial fishing has allowed for the spread of this fish into many different markets, restaurants, and grocery store shelves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of most surfcasting is {{to cast a}} bait or lure as far out into the water as is {{necessary}} to reach the target fish from the shore. This {{may or may not}} require long casting distances. Basic surf fishing can be done with a fishing rod between 7 feet and 18 feet long, with an extended butt section, equipped with a suitably-sized spinning or conventional (revolving spool) casting reel. In addition to rod and reel, the surf fisherman needs terminal tackle and bait or lure. Terminal tackle is the equipment {{at the far end of}} the line: <b>hooks,</b> <b>swivels,</b> lines and leaders.|$|R
50|$|A trotline {{is a heavy}} {{fishing line}} with baited hooks {{attached}} at intervals by means of branch lines called snoods. A snood is a short length of line which {{is attached to the}} main line using a clip or <b>swivel,</b> with the <b>hook</b> at the other end. A trotline can be set so it covers the width of a channel, river, or stream with baited hooks and can be left unattended. There are many ways to set a trotline, with most methods involving weights to hold the cord {{below the surface of the}} water. They are used for catching crabs or fish (particularly catfish). Trotlines should be used with caution as they are illegal in many states.|$|R
50|$|Longline {{fishing is}} a {{commercial}} fishing technique. It uses a long line, called the main line, with baited hooks attached at intervals {{by means of}} branch lines called snoods (or gangions). A snood is a short length of line, attached to the main line using a clip or <b>swivel,</b> with the <b>hook</b> at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set {{by means of an}} anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. Longliners commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species.|$|R
40|$|Raised in North Carolina {{close to}} the coast {{and down the street}} from the river, I was outside a lot. The summers were long, which allowed my friends and me ample time to explore the woods in our {{neighborhood}} and surrounding areas. We fished often. We would dig up some worms and bicycle down to several different banks or docks and drop a line in. My father always had a motorboat, so on some weekend mornings, we’d wake up super-early, pack some sandwiches and head out for the day. I would spend half the time sorting through Dad’s variety of fishing lures, <b>hooks,</b> <b>swivels,</b> bobbers and weights. His tackle box was packed with shapes and colors, tools and line, only half of which I could figure out a use for. The mystery and ambiguity of these objects kept me fascinated with the thought of their possible uses...|$|R
40|$|Bycatch in {{longline}} fisheries {{threatens the}} viability of some seabird populations. The Hawaii longline swordfish fishery reduced seabird captures by {{an order of magnitude}} primarily through mitigating bycatch during setting. Now, 75 % of captures occur during hauling. We fit observer data to a generalized additive regression model with mixed effects to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on the standardized seabird haul catch rate. Density of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling, leader length and year had largest model effects. The standardized haul catch rate significantly increased with increased albatross density during hauling. The standardized catch rate was significantly higher the longer the leader: shorter leaders place weighted <b>swivels</b> closer to <b>hooks,</b> reducing the likelihood of baited hooks becoming available to surface-scavenging albatrosses. There was a significant linear increasing temporal trend in the standardized catch rate, possibly partly due to an observed increasing temporal trend in the local abundance of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling. Swivel weight, Beaufort scale and season were also significant but smaller model effects. Most (81 %) haul captures were on branchlines actively being retrieved. Future haul mitigation research should therefore focus on reducing bird access to hooks as crew coil branchlines, including methods identified here of shorter leaders an...|$|R
40|$|Skate {{have been}} taken as {{by-catch}} in the South Georgia deepwater bottom longline fishery for toothfish since the fishery {{began in the late}} 1980 s. However, the species impacted, their biology, the nature of the interaction with longlines, the impact of the fishery on them, and the likely methods of reducing these impacts have been little studied. The objectives of this study are to explore the impact of the longline fishery on skate populations around South Georgia and to propose methods for reducing the number of skate deaths. The study was carried out over the period 2001 – 2004, although data from before and after this time have been used in the analysis. The methodology involved observing the capture of skate on fishing vessels around South Georgia, a sub-Antarctic island in the south Atlantic; recording biological and fishery characteristics; designing field sampling protocols for a large group of scientific observers operating on other fishing vessels, undertaking taxonomic analysis and further biological analysis in shore-based laboratories, designing and executing a field experiment on skate discard survivorship; and statistical analysis of a large volume of scientific observer data. Three species were found to be caught on longlines. Amblyraja georgiana had a shallow distribution, being found predominantly between 200 and 500 m, mostly on the continental shelf. A second species, referred to here as A. species anon, was clearly closely related to but significantly different from A. georgiana, having quite different colouration, a different clasper and pelvic structure, different length and age at maturity, and different bathymetric range (predominantly between 1200 and 1600 m, on the shelf slope but with significant numbers occurring in even deeper waters). The third species was Bathyraja meridionalis, which occurred between 300 and 2000 m. Of the three species caught within the fishery around South Georgia, B. meridionalis was found to grow to the largest size and weight of the species caught, reaching estimated, approximate total lengths at 50 % maturity of 121 cm for males and 126 cm for females. Of the two Amblyraja species, A. sp. anon was the larger of the two, reaching estimated total lengths at 50 % maturity of 96 cm for males and 98 cm for females. Insufficient data were collected for either sex to allow for estimates of length at 50 % maturity for A. georgiana, but a mixed-sex estimate of total length at 50 % maturity was 82 cm. For the survival experiment 102 skate from the three species were opportunistically selected from hauled longlines and placed into specially constructed circulating seawater tanks on a fishing vessel for 12 hours. Skate caught at depths between 1200 and 1300 m had an estimated 75 % chance of survival, whereas the predicted survival possibility for skate caught at depths between 1300 and 1500 m dropped to 46 %. Skate taken from depths greater than 1500 m were estimated to only have a 24 % chance of recovery from capture. There was some suggestion that male skate survive better than females. Generalised linear models were constructed to examine the influence of a number of factors on the probability of capturing skate on a longline, and the catch rate of skate. Skate presence on the line and numbers caught were found to increase almost exponentially with depth, with no sign of either the probability of capture or the numbers caught falling off at depths to 1750 m. Month had a significant effect of the number of skate caught, with July having the highest skate catch per unit effort (numbers per hook) of the four month (May to August) fishing season. Soak time had a significant effect on the probability of skate capture which increased the longer a line was left on the bottom. Of the four subdivisions of the South Georgia fishery examined in this study, two areas, Shag Rocks and the north-west of South Georgia were found to have significantly higher skate presence and skate CPUE than the other two areas. Catch rates were significantly elevated when squid bait were used as opposed to fish bait. A number of mitigation measures could be employed to reduce the by-catch and mortality of skates taken as by-catch in the longline fishery. The easiest and most effective method would be to set a maximum depth limit for fishing, which would have the effect of catching fewer skate and ensuring that more of them survived being returned to the sea. A further easy mechanism would be to add a second <b>swivel</b> at the <b>hook</b> end of the hook line, which would allow the skate to rotate freely as they are raised to the surface from the fishing depth of over 1000 m, so reducing injury to the jaw. Other potential options, such as restricting the fishery in July and avoiding the use of squid bait are likely to be met with less enthusiasm by the fishing industry.
