40|$|BACKGROUND Instillation of {{contrast}} medium into <b>stab</b> wounds has shown promising results regarding visibility {{and assessment of}} general <b>stab</b> direction with computed tomography. However, the accuracy of this method [...] and, incidentally also probing of <b>stab</b> wounds [...] has to our knowledge not previously been examined. Also the effect of bluntness of different <b>stabbing</b> objects on the examination of <b>stab</b> wounds was not considered before this study. METHODS Using a pocket-knife, a steak-knife, and a Phillips screwdriver, nine <b>stab</b> wounds each were inflicted to three pork haunches. The depths of the <b>stab</b> wounds were determined by probing and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) after instillation of a contrast medium (CM) and then compared to those observed by dissection, our internal "gold standard". RESULTS In <b>stab</b> wounds inflicted by knives, MSCT-CM and probing provided results which differed by roughly 10 - 11...|$|R

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had <b>stabbed</b> flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin.

Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have <b>stabbed</b> and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E

40|$|The {{hyaluronic acid}} {{receptor}} for endocytosis Stabilin- 2 /HARE mediates systemic clearance of multiple glycosaminoglycans from the vascular and lymphatic circulations. In addition, recent {{in vitro studies}} indicate that <b>Stab</b> 2 can participate in signal transduction by interacting with hyaluronic acid (HA), which results in Erk phosphorylation. However, {{it is not known}} whether <b>Stab</b> 2 function or HA-Stab 2 signaling play any role in embryonic development. Here we show that <b>Stab</b> 2 functions in a signal transduction pathway regulating arterial-venous differentiation during zebrafish embryogenesis. <b>Stab</b> 2 morpholino knockdown embryos (morphants) display an absence of intersegmental vessels and defects in the axial vessel formation. In addition, <b>Stab</b> 2 morphants show defects in arterial-venous differentiation including the expansion of venous marker expression. Simultaneous knockdown of Stabilin- 2 and Has 2, an HA synthetase, results in a synergistic effect, arguing that HA and <b>Stab</b> 2 interact during vasculature formation. <b>Stab</b> 2 morphants display reduced Erk phosphorylation in the arterial progenitors, which is a known transducer of VEGF signaling, previously associated with arterial-venous differentiation. In addition, VEGF signaling acts as a negative feedback loop to repress <b>stab</b> 2 expression. These results argue that <b>Stab</b> 2 is involved in a novel signaling pathway that {{plays an important role in}} regulating Erk phosphorylation and establishing arterial-venous identity...|$|R
