30|$|The present {{paper has}} considered, {{for the first}} time, the {{direction}} finding using a single-vector sensor in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> mutual coupling. <b>The</b> temporal smoothing technique {{has been applied to}} improve <b>the</b> identifiability limit <b>of</b> a single vector.

An efficient ESPRIT-based method, which does not require any calibration sources or iterative operations, has been developed to jointly estimate the azimuth-elevation angles and the mutual coupling coefficients. The CRB for the considered problem has also been derived. Simulation results have been presented showing <b>the</b> <b>superiorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method.|$|R
5|$|While the {{conflict}} between the HVO and the ARBiH contributed to the weakening defence of Jajce, the military <b>superiority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VRS was the principal reason behind the town's capture. Besides the advantage in troop size and firepower, VRS staff work and planning was significantly superior to the organisational efforts of the defenders of Jajce. The principal problem for the defence of Jajce was that the town was defended by two separate command structures, one having authority over ARBiH troops and the other over HVO units.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were {{confined}} to Pola {{for the duration of}} the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and with a shortage of coal, Haus enacted a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical <b>superiority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied navies.|$|E
5|$|By 1911 Germany {{had built}} battlecruisers of her own, and the <b>superiority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ships {{could no longer}} be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified Moltke; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s of a few years earlier.

In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces.

5|$|Lenin {{expected}} Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie {{to oppose}} his government, but {{he believed that}} the numerical <b>superiority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict. In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing Russian Civil War pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik Whites, but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the Green armies, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.|$|E
