5|$|Due to tidal locking, Metis rotates <b>synchronously</b> {{with its}} orbital period, with its longest axis aligned towards Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Due to tidal locking, Adrastea rotates <b>synchronously</b> {{with its}} orbital period, keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter, this being the lowest energy configuration.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates <b>synchronously</b> with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 William Henry Pickering {{discovered}} Phoebe, {{a highly}} irregular satellite {{that does not}} rotate <b>synchronously</b> with Saturn as the larger moons do. Phoebe was the first such satellite found and {{it takes more than}} a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere – a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.|$|E
5|$|Like most of Saturn's larger satellites, Enceladus rotates <b>synchronously</b> {{with its}} orbital period, keeping one face pointed toward Saturn. Unlike Earth's Moon, Enceladus {{does not appear}} to librate more than 1.5° about its spin axis. However, {{analysis}} of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit libration. This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause <b>synchronously</b> activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause <b>synchronously</b> activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates <b>synchronously</b> with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates <b>synchronously</b> {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes <b>synchronously.</b> In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide <b>synchronously</b> with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating <b>synchronously</b> like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Generalized epileptiform {{discharges}} {{often have}} an anterior maximum, {{but these are}} seen <b>synchronously</b> throughout the entire brain. They are strongly suggestive of a generalized epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Eventing: This feature allows listening, forwarding, {{and acting}} on {{management}} and system events. Eventing allows PowerShell hosts {{to be notified}} about state changes to their managed entities. It also enables PowerShell scripts to subscribe to ObjectEvents, PSEvents, and WmiEvents and process them <b>synchronously</b> and asynchronously.|$|E
25|$|Programming {{languages}} typically {{deal with}} this by limiting asynchronicity, for example Java has deprecated the use of its ThreadDeath exception {{that was used to}} allow one thread to stop another one. Instead, there can be semi-asynchronous exceptions that only raise in suitable locations of the program or <b>synchronously.</b>|$|E
25|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{central banks}} {{are not allowed}} to give loans without requiring suitable assets as collateral. Therefore, most central banks describe which assets are eligible for open market transactions. Technically, the central bank makes the loan and <b>synchronously</b> takes an equivalent amount of an eligible asset supplied by the borrowing commercial bank.|$|E
25|$|Proteus orbits Neptune at the {{distance}} approximately equal to 4.75 equatorial radii of the planet. Its orbit {{has a small}} eccentricity and is inclined by about 0.5° to the planet's equator. Proteus is {{the largest of the}} regular prograde satellites of Neptune. It rotates <b>synchronously</b> with the orbital motion, which means that one face always points to the planet.|$|E
25|$|A Kozai {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} the inclination and eccentricity of a perturbed orbit oscillate <b>synchronously</b> (increasing eccentricity while decreasing inclination and vice versa). This resonance applies only to bodies on highly inclined orbits; as a consequence, such orbits tend to be unstable, since the growing eccentricity would result in small pericenters, typically leading to a collision or (for large moons) destruction by tidal forces.|$|E
25|$|The most gregarious of the Antarctic seals, crabeaters {{have been}} {{observed}} on the ice in aggregations of up to 1,000 hauled out animals and in swimming groups of several hundred individuals, breathing and diving almost <b>synchronously.</b> These aggregations consist primarily of younger animals. Adults are more typically encountered alone or in small groups of up to three on the ice or in the water.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Pentium 4 and Pentium D design, the Core 2 technology sees a greater benefit from memory running <b>synchronously</b> with the Front Side Bus (FSB). This means {{that for the}} Conroe CPUs with FSB of 1066MT/s, the ideal memory performance for DDR2 is PC2-8500. In a few configurations, using PC2-5300 instead of PC2-4200 can actually decrease performance. Only when going to PC2-6400 is there a significant performance increase. While DDR2 memory models with tighter timing specifications do improve performance, the difference in real world games and applications is often negligible.|$|E
25|$|Acro dancers {{commonly}} wear flexible, form-fitting {{clothing for}} both safety and aesthetic reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter {{does not move}} <b>synchronously</b> with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. This is especially important when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the safety aspect, form-fitting clothing also helps to expose a dancer's body lines, which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.|$|E
25|$|Charging a {{capacitor}} (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field {{to be applied}} to the dielectric between the electrodes. This field exerts a torque on the molecular dipoles, causing the directions of the dipole moments to align with the field direction. This change in the molecular dipoles is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in dielectric losses (see dissipation factor). The orientation of the dipoles does not follow the electric field <b>synchronously,</b> but is delayed by a time constant that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a hysteresis response of the polarization to the external field.|$|E
25|$|Applying {{this age}} {{to the base}} of the Ediacaran assumes that cap {{carbonate}}s are laid down <b>synchronously</b> around the world and that the correct cap carbonate layers have been selected in such diverse locals as Australian and Namibia. This is controversial because an age of about 580 million years has been obtained for glacial rocks in Tasmania which some scientists tentatively assign to those just beneath the Ediacaran rocks of the Flinders Ranges. The age of the top is the same as the widely recognised age for the base of the Cambrian Period 542± 0.3 Mya, producing a misalignment, as the end of the Edicarian Period should mark the start of the Cambrian Period.|$|E
25|$|Radio signals {{consist of}} {{constantly}} varying electric and magnetic fields arranged at right angles. When {{the magnetic field}} passes a metal object, it will cause the electrons in the metal to begin moving <b>synchronously</b> with the signal. According to Faraday's law of induction, this effect is maximized when the object and field are {{at right angles to}} each other (alternately, one can think of the electric field being in-line with the object). Although radio signals will propagate in any orientation, for the signals considered here the propagation is strongly attenuated if the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the ground. For this reason, radio antennae, both broadcaster and receiver, are normally vertical. Such signals are said to be vertically polarized.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} tagged {{and recorded}} {{the movements of}} young bull sharks in the Caloosahatchee River estuary. Specifically, they were testing {{to find out what}} determined the movement of the young bull sharks. It was found that the young bull sharks <b>synchronously</b> moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed. This large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators. An interesting find was that the movement was directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself. One way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes, the bull shark uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver. Another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|Until 1980, the {{structure}} of the rings of Saturn was explained as being caused exclusively by the action of gravitational forces. Then images from the Voyager spacecraft showed radial features in the B ring, known as spokes, which could not be explained in this manner, as their persistence and rotation around the rings was not consistent with gravitational orbital mechanics. The spokes appear dark in backscattered light, and bright in forward-scattered light (see images in Gallery); the transition occurs at a phase angle near 60°. The leading theory regarding the spokes' composition is that they consist of microscopic dust particles suspended away from the main ring by electrostatic repulsion, as they rotate almost <b>synchronously</b> with the magnetosphere of Saturn. The precise mechanism generating the spokes is still unknown, although {{it has been suggested that}} the electrical disturbances might be caused by either lightning bolts in Saturn's atmosphere or micrometeoroid impacts on the rings.|$|E
25|$|Chicks hatch <b>synchronously</b> with a dense downy coat. The {{coloring}} is white, grey or yellow, {{with dark}} spots {{to aid in}} camouflage. The young are precocial, and can run {{almost as soon as}} they hatch. Soon after hatching the eggs, the male will leave the nest and call the chicks to him with a soft contact call. If threatened, he will freeze and attempt to hide the chicks under his wings or belly. There have been documented cases of females caring for the young; it is thought that this occurs when the male has been killed. Young chicks can feed themselves within the first few days, but the male will bring the food and drop it on {{the ground in front of}} them. The chicks have a high initial mortality rate. However, within a few days they are chasing insects on their own and, at 1–3 weeks, they can fly to branches a metre from the ground. They are self-sufficient within 20 days.|$|E
25|$|V. moorii shows social but not genetic monogamy. Breeding adults spawn {{according}} to the lunar cycle and thus spawn <b>synchronously</b> (see Lunar synchronicity in spawning). This allows males to spawn on eggs that {{do not belong to}} the female he is mated to (also known as parasitic spawning). All offspring within a single brood share the same mother but not the same father. A study found that broods are almost always sired by multiple males (at least two but sometimes more than ten), a rate which is exceptionally high compared to other multiply mating fish. The male mated to the mother of the brood will invest significant resources to protect the territory and brood even though he did not sire the majority of the fry. The female is related to the entire brood and the male is related only to a fraction of the brood, so the female would be expected to provide more care than the male. However, there is no great difference in male parental care and female parental care.|$|E
25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and <b>synchronously</b> takes an eligible asset as collateral. A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply. This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities, or other financial instruments. Monetary targets, such as inflation, interest rates, or exchange rates, are used to guide this implementation.|$|E
500|$|A [...] is an eye {{movement}} involving both eyes moving <b>synchronously</b> and symmetrically {{in the same}} direction.|$|E
500|$|Even in {{a design}} that is {{intended}} to be <b>synchronously</b> tuned, some staggered tuning effect is inevitable because of the practical impossibility of keeping all tuned circuits perfectly in step and because of feedback effects. [...] This can be a problem in very narrow band applications where essentially only one spot frequency is of interest, such as a local oscillator feed or a wave trap. [...] The overall gain of a <b>synchronously</b> tuned amplifier will always be less than the theoretical maximum because of this.|$|E
500|$|The {{bandwidth}} is thus {{reduced by}} a factor of [...] [...] In {{terms of the number of}} stages [...] [...] Thus, the four stage <b>synchronously</b> tuned amplifier will have a bandwidth of only 19% of a single stage. [...] Even in a two-stage amplifier the bandwidth is reduced to 41% of the original. [...] Staggered tuning allows the bandwidth to be widened at the expense of overall gain. [...] The overall gain is reduced because when any one stage is at resonance (and thus maximum gain) the others are not, unlike synchronous tuning where all stages are at maximum gain at the same frequency. [...] A two-stage stagger-tuned amplifier will have a gain [...] less than a <b>synchronously</b> tuned amplifier.|$|E
500|$|Both <b>synchronously</b> tuned and stagger-tuned schemes have {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over schemes that place all the tuning components in a single aggregated filter circuit separate from the amplifier such as ladder networks or coupled resonators. [...] One advantage is that they are easy to tune. [...] Each resonator is buffered from the others by the amplifier stages so have little effect on each other. [...] The resonators in aggregated circuits, on the other hand, will all interact with each other, particularly their nearest neighbours. [...] Another advantage is that the components need not be close to ideal. [...] Every LC resonator is directly working into a resistor which lowers the Q anyway so any losses in the L and C components can be absorbed into this resistor in the design. [...] Aggregated designs usually require high Q resonators. [...] Also, stagger-tuned circuits have resonator components with values that are quite close to each other and in <b>synchronously</b> tuned circuits they can be identical. [...] The spread of component values is thus less in stagger-tuned circuits than in aggregated circuits.|$|E
500|$|By <b>synchronously</b> {{resetting}} all clocks in {{a region}} to one hour ahead of standard time (one hour [...] "fast"), individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier {{than they would have}} otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities. However, they will have one fewer hour of daylight at the start of each day, making the policy less practical during winter.|$|E
500|$|This {{can be done}} straightforwardly for the {{complete}} filter {{in the case of}} <b>synchronously</b> tuned amplifiers where every stage has the same ω0 but for a stagger-tuned amplifier there is no simple analytical solution to the transform. [...] Stagger-tuned designs can be approached instead by calculating the poles of a low-pass prototype of the desired form (e.g. Butterworth) and then transforming those poles to a band-pass response. [...] The poles so calculated can then be used to define the tuned circuits of the individual stages.|$|E
500|$|The {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a separate}} set of three antennas, situated at the centre of an [...] diameter Luneburg lens, which rotated <b>synchronously</b> with the broadcaster under a [...] diameter dome. Multiple feed horns {{were used in the}} receiver to allow reception from many vertical angles at once. Around the receiver dome was a large field of wire mesh, forming a flat ground plane reflector. The ZAR operated in the UHF on various frequencies between 495–605MHz, giving it frequency agility. ZAR had detection range on the order of [...] on a 0.1m2 target.|$|E
500|$|Spores are [...] to spindle-shaped, and are {{flattened}} on one side; {{they have}} dimensions of 54–68µm by 10–13µm. The spores each contain 3–5 oil drops. Although the spores {{have been described}} as smooth in older literature, when viewed with transmission electron microscopy, they are seen to have minute spots or punctures. The spores develop simultaneously (<b>synchronously)</b> within the ascus, a developmental feature shared with the Sarcoscyphaceae genera Cookeina and Microstoma. Like other members of the Pezizales order, the asci of C.geaster have an operculum—a [...] "lid"—that opens when the spores are discharged. However, the operculum of C.geaster develops a two-layered ring zone upon dehiscence, making it structurally distinct from members of both the Sarcosomataceae and the Sarcoscyphaceae families.|$|E
