5|$|Furious at Shrek, Donkey goes to {{the swamp}} where Shrek says he overheard Donkey and Fiona's conversation. Donkey tells Shrek that {{she was talking about}} <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> and urges Shrek to talk to Fiona before she is married. They travel to Duloc quickly, thanks to Dragon, who had escaped her {{confines}} and followed Donkey.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E

5000|$|Absolute outcomes. Regarding help, {{their answer}} tends toward {{complete}} and total outcomes, {{such as the}} ability for someone to convince, cure or overcome <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> alcoholism, or that they could guarantee (make sure) that someone continues on the path to recovery. Although this answer may help dispel the notion that someone has permanent, guaranteed power over another's sobriety, it does not answer the question that someone could provide any measure of direct help or support toward <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> sobriety or treatment of <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> addiction.|$|R

5|$|William last {{appeared}} in documents on 25 July 1217 and was dead by 16 February 1218, probably before 2 December 1217, when <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> is mentioned as archdeacon. On 16 February 1218, John Marshall became {{the guardian of}} Richard, William's nephew and heir, who {{was the son of}} William's brother Richard.|$|E

5|$|At the Lisbon Conference, {{the members}} of NATO agreed to appoint a Secretary General who would direct the organisation's staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the Atlantic Council. The {{position}} was initially offered to Sir Oliver Franks, but he declined. As such, the allies scrambled to find <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to take the position. Two weeks later, the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become Secretary General {{at the suggestion of}} Churchill and Anthony Eden.|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|Greed is {{the first}} main theme that is {{introduced}} into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other themes in the book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near {{to the end of}} the novel, where Artemis is willing to part with a large sum of money to help <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to use them responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society. The Catechism addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{made headlines}} around the globe. Lowell Observatory, {{which had the}} right to name the new object, received more than 1,000 suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> did. Constance Lowell proposed Zeus, then Percival and finally Constance. These suggestions were disregarded.|$|E
5|$|Vachss had {{previously}} worked with Dark Horse Comics {{to produce a}} ten-issue series (1992–1993) titled Hard Looks. Steve Korte of DC Comics's book division approached Vacchs {{with the possibility of}} a partnership. Vachss was hesitant about using creative property that belonged to <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> but recognized the opportunity to reach a new audience. He started writing the novel, on speculation, and DC Comics eventually agreed to the project, allowing Vachss to take some creative liberties.|$|E

5|$|A new comedy duo called Supergirly {{were also}} {{introduced}} from January 2000 {{to fill the}} gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> The sketches would usually culminate with the guests storming off.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart {{instead of his}} mind. Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says {{there is no need for}} Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
