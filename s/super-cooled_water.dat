40|$|Factors {{external}} to the aircraft are often a significant causal factor in loss of control (LOC) accidents. In today s aviation world, very few accidents stem from a single cause and typically {{have a number of}} causal factors that culminate in a LOC accident. Very often the "trigger" that initiates an accident sequence is an external environment factor. In a recent NASA statistical analysis of LOC accidents, aircraft icing was shown to be the most common external environmental LOC causal factor for scheduled operations. When investigating LOC accident or incidents aircraft icing causal factors can be categorized into groups of 1) in-flight encounter with <b>super-cooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> clouds, 2) take-off with ice contamination, or 3) in-flight encounter with high concentrations of ice crystals. As with other flight hazards, icing induced LOC accidents can be prevented through avoidance, detection, and recovery mitigations. For icing hazards, avoidance can take the form of avoiding flight into icing conditions or avoiding the hazard of icing by making the aircraft tolerant to icing conditions. Icing detection mitigations can take the form of detecting icing conditions or detecting early performance degradation caused by icing. Recovery from icing induced LOC requires flight crew or automated systems capable of accounting for reduced aircraft performance and degraded control authority during the recovery maneuvers. In this report we review the icing induced LOC accident mitigations defined in a recent LOC study and for each mitigation describe a research topic required to enable or strengthen the mitigation.

40|$|Aircraft icing {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a significant hazard to aircraft operations in cold weather. When an aircraft or rotorcraft fly in a cold climate, some of the <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets would impact and freeze on the exposed aircraft surfaces to form ice shapes, which can degrade the aerodynamic performance of an airplane significantly by decreasing lift while increasing drag, and even lead to the aircraft crash. In the present study, a series of experimental investigations were conducted to investigate dynamics and thermodynamics of in-flight and impinging water droplets in order to elucidate the underlying physics of the important microphysical process pertinent to aircraft icing phenomena. A novel lifetime-based molecular tagging thermometry technique (MTT) is developed to achieve simultaneous measurements of droplet size, flying velocity and transient temperature of in-flight water droplets to characterize the dynamic and thermodynamic behaviors of the micro-sized in-flight droplets pertinent to aircraft icing phenomena. By using high-speed imaging and infrared thermal imaging techniques, a comprehensive experimental {{study was conducted to}} quantify the unsteady heat transfer and phase changing processes as water droplets impinging onto frozen cold surfaces under different test conditions (i. e., with different Weber numbers, Reynolds numbers, and impact angles of the impinging droplets, different temperature, hydrophobicity and roughness of the test plates) to simulate the scenario of <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets impinging onto the frozen cold wing surfaces. A novel digital image projector (DIP) technique was also developed to achieve time-resolved film thickness measurements to quantify the dynamic impinging process of water droplets (i. e., droplet impact, rebounding, splashing and freezing process).

Some interesting advantages were observed in case of super-cooling type, developed in this paper. The stable operating range was slightly smaller compared with the traditional scraped surface type, and heat transfer coefficients were somewhat smaller due to smaller amount of generated ice fraction as common super-cooling type.

This technology has recently been extended to provide volumetric coverage surrounding an airport. Building on the existing vertical pointing system, the new method for providing volumetric coverage utilizes a vertical pointing cloud radar, a multi-frequency microwave radiometer with azimuth and elevation pointing, and a NEXRAD radar. The new terminal area icing remote sensing system processes the data streams from these instruments to derive temperature, liquid water content, and cloud droplet size for each examined point in space. These data are then combined to ultimately provide icing hazard classification along defined approach paths into an airport. To date, statistical comparisons of the vertical profiling technology {{have been made to}} Pilot Reports and Icing Forecast Products.

40|$|The threat for {{aircraft}} icing in clouds {{is a significant}} hazard that routinely impacts aviation operations. Accurate diagnoses and forecasts of aircraft icing conditions requires identifying the location and vertical distribution of clouds with <b>super-cooled</b> liquid <b>water</b> (SLW) droplets, {{as well as the}} characteristics of the droplet size distribution. Traditional forecasting methods rely on guidance from numerical models and conventional observations, neither of which currently resolve cloud properties adequately on the optimal scales needed for aviation. Satellite imagers provide measurements over large areas with high spatial resolution that can be interpreted to identify the locations and characteristics of clouds, including features associated with adverse weather and storms. This paper describes new techniques for interpreting cloud products derived from satellite data to infer the flight icing threat to aircraft. For unobscured low clouds, the icing threat is determined using empirical relationships developed from correlations between satellite imager retrievals of liquid water path and droplet size with icing conditions reported by pilots (PIREPS). For deep ice over water cloud systems, ice and liquid water content (IWC and LWC) profiles are derived by using the imager cloud properties to constrain climatological information on cloud vertical structure and water phase obtained apriori from radar and lidar observations, and from cloud model analyses. Retrievals of the SLW content embedded within overlapping clouds are mapped to the icing threat using guidance from an airfoil modeling study. Compared to PIREPS and ground-based icing remote sensing datasets, the satellite icing detection and intensity accuracies are approximately 90 % and 70 %, respectively, and found to be similar for both low level and deep ice over water cloud systems. The satellite-derived icing boundaries capture the reported altitudes over 90 % of the time. Satellite analyses corresponding to the time and location of several recent aviation accidents and with icing PIREPS are also presented that reveal skill in identifying severe icing conditions. These results demonstrate the utility of satellite cloud retrievals for quantitatively diagnosing the potential for icing conditions on temporal and spatial scales that should be useful to the aviation community. Plans are being developed to deliver these new satellite products to the GOES-R Proving Ground in the near future {{so that they can be}} evaluated in operational applications...|$|R
40|$|Positive {{lightning}} flashes {{are known}} to be more intense and cause more damage than negative flashes, although positive flashes only occur about 10 % of the time. This study expounds on cloud microphysical aspects of thunderstorms and investigates the occurrence, timing and location of ice particles within thunderstorms and correlates this to the occurrence of positive cloud-to-ground lightning events. Satellite data obtained from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, were used to: 1) depict Cloud Top Temperatures (CTT) by considering Infra Red (IR) radiation with a wave length of 10. 8 μm, 2) compare results from the CTT with the Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) calculated by subtracting IR 10. 8 μm from IR 8. 7 μm, 3) after the cloud particle phase was determined from the abovementioned comparison, the sum of cloud-to-ground lightning strokes over a 1 -hour period around the time of a reported lightning fatality was compared with cloud microphysical properties and then 4) these results were further compared with the lightning polarity obtained from the South African Weather Service (SAWS) Lightning Detection Network (LDN) data set. Four case studies were identified to investigate from the many available case study dates. These four cases occurred on 3 separate days namely: 1) 22 November 2007, iii 2) 10 February 2009 and 3) 29 October 2009. There were two fatal events reported on 22 November 2007 and therefore two cases studies were compiled for this one date. On 10 February 2009 over 250 insurance damage claims were honoured but no fatality was reported. The three case studies mentioned above were classified as primary case studies. The 29 October 2009 case was classified as a secondary, more generalized case which was chosen in order to test whether the results gained from the first three cases were indeed noteworthy. Results gathered from two of the three primary case studies showed that the fatalities occurred when the most intense part of the thunderstorm was to the east of the location where the lightning struck the victims, although actual storm properties were not considered as being particularly severe. The lightning data for the primary case studies showed that the percentage of cloud-to-ground lightning was within 10 % {{of the total number of}} strokes recorded for 22 November 2007, and above 10 % for 10 February 2009. In the one secondary case study of 29 October 2009 the percentage of positive lightning was only between 2 % and 4 % of the total number of strokes recorded, which was significantly lower than in the three primary cases.

It appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition to generate such intense convection. Convergence of moist enthalpy near the ground is also found. The passage of a cold front creates instabilities and causes upward motion on the warm side of the front, facilitating the development of deep convection. In some cases, low-level flow around a mountain creates wind convergence on the lee side, associated with lifting of air parcels.

40|$|Information {{about the}} {{location}} of enhanced convective regions and <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> droplet clouds is one major task of aviation meteorology. Deep convective cores are mainly responsible for an increasing amount of delayed flights during the last years leading to enormous economical losses (Evans 2002). Moreover, the majority of aviation accidents is caused by turbulences connected with deep convective regions (Proctor et al. 2002). Super-cooled cloud droplets are on their part responsible for wing glaciation. According to Mingione (1998), wing glaciation was the main cause for about 800 serious incidents and plane crashes between 1975 and 1988. While jet planes produce enough heat to stoke their wings properly, small and medium planes with energy-saving engines and carbon fibre cabins often have no adequate exterior shell heating and moreover {{are not able to}} climb above the critical height for wing glaciation of about 5000 meter. Therefore an operational cloud process identification tool (CPI) for retrieving and visualising cloud processes for general aviation using multispectral data is developed.

M. CST. The freezing precipitation resulted in dangerous travel conditions, causing several automobile accidents, along with the delay and temporary closing of area public schools 8 March 1999. The freezing rain changed over to snow later the same morning. A forecast for snow, rather than freezing precipitation, was issued by the local forecast office. The forecast issued was based predominately on numerical weather prediction guidance, and the observed temperature profile of the atmosphere. The observed temperature profile of the atmosphere was below 0 °C throughout its entire vertical extent. The {{purpose of this study}} is to present important components of cloud microphysics that will be useful in an operational forecasting environment. It has been shown in numerous studies that clouds consist predominately of water vapor until the cloud reaches a critical temperature of - 15 °(Rogers and Yau, 1989.) In general, for the lower 48 conterminous states, ice crystal growth by deposition, aided by the presence of ice nuclei (predominately vermiculite), is maximized at - 15 °C (Houghton, 1950.) In this particular situation, an operational forecaster must possess a basic understanding of cloud microphysics in order to accurately assess the atmospheric potential for liquid versus freezing or frozen precipitation. Numerical weather prediction guidance, nomograms, and thickness schemes did not accurately predict precipitation type in this particular atmospheric environment, which included a low level stratus cloud layer at a temperature between 0 °C and - 10 °C. For this case, the synoptic and sub-synoptic-scale environment, as well as vertical atmospheric structure will be examined. By substituting the latent heat of sublimation for the latent heat of evaporation in the Clapeyron-Clausius equation, where Hvap = 597. 3 cal/gm, and Hsub= 677. 0 cal/gm, then solving for temperature, it shows that the saturation vapor pressure over ice is less than over water (Smith, 1995.) Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure of <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets is more than that of ice nuclei. Because of this difference in saturation vapor pressures, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water vapor droplets in the cloud (the Bergeron Process, Ahrens, 1991.) At temperatures between - 10 °C and - 15 °C, ice crystal growth is maximized, as the difference in saturation vapor pressure is greatest (Neuberger, 1967) Once the ice crystal growth process begins, the threat of liquid precipitation falling from the cloud and freezing on surface features becomes minimal. It follows logically then, that at temperatures between 0 °C and - 10 °C, there is a greater threat of <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets falling from the cloud, freezing as they deposit on surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic {{ice shelves}} are fed {{primarily}} by the glaciers flowing into them. Downstream of promontories separating these glaciers, <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> can rise and freeze into suture zones, leading to the accretion of marine ice. Marine ice bodies {{have been found in}} several Antarctic ice shelves, but little is known about their detailed geometry, rate of accretion, or influence on ice dynamics. In this study we investigate marine ice in a suture zone downstream of the Joerg Peninsula {{in the southern part of}} the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula. We present ground penetrating radar data from which we infer the boundaries between the meteoric and marine ice bodies and, in combination with GPS data and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, estimate marine ice thickness within a suture zone. We show that the Joerg Peninsula suture zone contains marine ice layer, which is increasing in thickness along-flow from 140 m to 180 m over 20 km, implying an average basal accretion rate of 0. 5 m a- 1 in our study area. We examined the impact of this marine ice on ice shelf dynamics by modeling the suture zone within an ice flow model. The results, which replicate observed surface velocities and strain rates, show that the warmer and thus softer ice of the suture zone serves to channel shear deformation. This enables decoupling of neighboring flow units with different follow velocities, while maintaining the structural integrity of the ice shelf...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of circumstantial {{evidence}} suggests that ice nucleation active (Ice(+)) bacteria contribute to the initiation of precipitation by heterologous freezing of <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> in clouds. However, {{little is known about}} the concentration of Ice(+) bacteria in precipitation, their genetic and phenotypic diversity, and their relationship to air mass trajectories and precipitation chemistry. In this study, 23 precipitation events were collected over 15 months in Virginia, USA. Air mass trajectories and water chemistry were determined and 33 [*] 134 isolates were screened for ice nucleation activity (INA) at - 8 [*]°C. Of 1144 isolates that tested positive during initial screening, 593 had confirmed INA at - 8 [*]°C in repeated tests. Concentrations of Ice(+) strains in precipitation were found to range from 0 to 13 [*] 219 colony forming units per liter, with a mean of 384 ± 147. Most Ice(+) bacteria were identified as members of known and unknown Ice(+) species in the Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae families, which nucleate ice employing the well-characterized membrane-bound INA protein. Two Ice(+) strains, however, were identified as Lysinibacillus, a Gram-positive genus not previously known to include Ice(+) bacteria. INA of the Lysinibacillus strains is due to a nanometer-sized molecule that is heat resistant, lysozyme and proteinase resistant, and secreted. Ice(+) bacteria and the INA mechanisms they employ are thus more diverse than expected. We discuss to what extent the concentration of culturable Ice(+) bacteria in precipitation and the identification of a new heat-resistant biological INA mechanism support a role for Ice(+) bacteria in the initiation of precipitation...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} non-dimensional parameters used in ice-accretion modeling and scaling studies is the freezing fraction defined by the heat-balance analysis of Messinger. For fifty years this parameter has been used to indicate how rapidly freezing takes place when <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> strikes a solid body. The value ranges from 0 (no freezing) to 1 (water freezes immediately on impact), and the magnitude has been shown {{to play a major role}} in determining the physical appearance of the accreted ice. Because of its importance to ice shape, this parameter and the physics underlying the expressions used to calculate it have been questioned from time to time. Until now, there has been no strong evidence either validating or casting doubt on the current expressions. This paper presents experimental measurements of the leading-edge thickness of a number of ice shapes for a variety of test conditions with nominal freezing fractions from 0. 3 to 1. 0. From these thickness measurements, experimental freezing fractions were calculated and compared with values found from the Messinger analysis as applied by Ruff. Within the experimental uncertainty of measuring the leading-edge thickness, agreement of the experimental and analytical freezing fraction was very good. It is also shown that values of analytical freezing fraction were entirely consistent with observed ice shapes at and near rime conditions: At an analytical freezing fraction of unity, experimental ice shapes displayed the classic rime shape, while for conditions producing analytical freezing fractions slightly lower than unity, glaze features started to appear...|$|E
40|$|Electrified {{thunderstorm}} anvil clouds {{extend the}} threat of natural and triggered lightning to space launch and landing operations far beyond the immediate vicinity of thunderstorm cells. The deep convective updrafts of thunderstorms transport large amounts of water vapor, <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> droplets and ice crystals into the upper troposphere, forming anvil clouds, which are then carried downstream by the prevailing winds in the anvil formation layer. Electrified anvil clouds have been observed over the space launch and landing facilities of Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), emanating from thunderstorm activity more than 200 km distant. Space launch commit criteria and flight rules require launch and landing vehicles to avoid penetration of the non-transparent portion of anvil clouds. The life cycles of 167 anvil clouds over the Florida peninsula and its coastal waters were documented using GOES- 8 visible imagery on 50 anvil case days during the months of May through July 2001. Anvil clouds were found to propagate at the speed and direction of upper-tropospheric winds in the layer from 300 -to-l 50 mb, approximately 9. 4 km to 14 km, with an effective average transport lifetime of 2 hours and {{a standard deviation of}} approximately 30 minutes. The effective lifetime refers to the time required for the nontransparent leading edge of an anvil cloud to reach its maximum extent before beginning to dissipate. The propagation and lifetime information was incorporated into the design, construction and implementation of an objective short-range anvil forecast tool based on upper-air observations, for use on the Meteorological Interactive Data Display System within the Range Weather Operations facility of the 45 th Weather Squadron at CCAFS and the Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center...|$|E
40|$|Retrieval of multi-layered cloud properties, {{especially}} {{ice water}} path (IWP), {{is one of}} the most perplexing problems in satellite cloud remote sensing. This paper develops a method for improving the IWP retrievals for ice-over-water overlapped cloud systems using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) and Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) data. A combined microwave, visible and infrared algorithm is used to identify overlapped clouds and estimate IWP separately from liquid water path. The retrieval error of IWP is then evaluated by comparing the IWP to that retrieved from single-layer ice clouds surrounding the observed overlapping systems. The major IWP retrieval errors of overlapped clouds are primarily controlled by the errors in estimating the visible optical depth. Optical depths are overestimated by about 10 – 40 % due to the influence of the underlying cloud. For the ice-over-warm-water cloud systems (cloud water temperature Tw> 273 K), the globally averaged IWP retrieval error is about 10 %. This cloud type accounts for about 15 % of all high-cloud overlapping cases. Ice-over-super-cooled water clouds are the predominant overlapped cloud system, accounting for 55 % of the cases. Their global averaged error is ∼ 17. 2 %. The largest IWP retrieval error results when ice clouds occur over extremely <b>super-cooled</b> <b>water</b> clouds (Tw 6 255 K). Overall, roughly 33 % of the VIRS IWP retrievals are overestimated due to the effects of the liquid water clouds beneath the cirrus clouds. To improve the accuracy of the IWP retrievals, correction models are developed and applied to all three types of overlapped clouds. The preliminary results indicate that the correction models reduce part of the retrieval error. Key words: Ice water path, multi-layered cloud, microwave imaging, retrieval error...|$|E
