500|$|The {{various forms}} of {{periodic}} tables {{can be thought of}} as lying on a chemistry–physics continuum. Towards the chemistry end of the continuum can be found, as an example, Rayner-Canham's [...] "unruly" [...] Inorganic Chemist's Periodic Table (2002), which emphasizes trends and patterns, and unusual chemical relationships and properties. Near the physics end of the continuum is Janet's Left-Step Periodic Table (1928). This has a structure that shows a closer connection to the order of electron-shell filling and, by association, quantum mechanics. A somewhat similar approach has been taken by Alper, albeit criticized by Eric Scerri as disregarding the need to display chemical and physical periodicity. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the continuum is the ubiquitous common or standard form of periodic table. This is regarded as better expressing empirical trends in physical state, electrical and thermal conductivity, and oxidation numbers, and other properties easily inferred from traditional techniques of the chemical laboratory. Its popularity is thought to be a result of this layout having a good balance of features in terms of ease of construction and size, and its depiction of atomic order and periodic trends.|$|E

He did however remark that the episode allowed him to see how far the show had improved since its first season. In a slightly more positive review, MTV's Josh Wigler wrote [...] "As far as standard installments of Fringe go, 'Unearthed' ranks <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the pack, but the quality diminishes due to its awkward placement in the middle of season two". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 6.4/10, commenting that it was [...] "cheesy, with mediocre writing and some fairly bad performances from the guest supporting cast". Isler found little to redeem the episode, and wished the story's partial focus on the intersection of science and faith had been further explored.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} was {{initially}} intended {{to take place in}} an actual Los Angeles neighborhood until the production team realized the difficulties that would ensue. [...] Instead they chose Colonial Street, a backlot street set at Universal Studios Hollywood. The house sets on Colonial Street had been used in numerous film and television productions as early as 1946. Many of the sets, whose styles ranged from contemporary to Victorian to ranch, were remodeled to create a uniform neighborhood. Cherry and production designer Thomas A. Walsh wanted the street to recall the Eisenhower era and convey traditional American values, but appear modern at the same time. Walsh viewed episodes of Father Knows Best, My Three Sons, and Leave It to Beaver, among other television series, to capture the visual style of classic conservative America. Walsh commented, [...] "We were trying to honor that sensibility {{and at the same time}} create an everyplace that was neither a red state nor a blue state." [...] Instead, Walsh insisted that the street was in [...] "kind of a pink state. We're <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of America's soul." [...] Refurbishments of the house sets, which included building interior rooms, cost around $700,000. While Walsh strove for a visually unified look for the street as a whole, he carefully designed the interior of each home to reflect the tastes and budgets of the characters.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> judging <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> to be a compromise, {{architectural}} {{practice has}} the tendency towards the extremes, producing rhetorical architectural gestures and self-fulfilling prophecies. After the coining of <b>the</b> term modernity <b>in</b> 1863 by Beaudelaire, {{as being the}} conjoining of the ephemeral and fleeting with the eternal and immutable Architecture has wavered from opposition to opposition. However oppositions, up to now, could not provide for satisfactory solutions.

In that sense, both modernism and postmodernism as such {{can be regarded as}} tendencies towards extremes. Moreover modernism was even able to produce extremes within its own thinking. Hence functionalism claimed that every function could have its own single optimum. Thus the Raumplan provided many functions in an array of single optima while <b>the</b> Plan Libre, <b>in</b> its spatial redundancy, provided many functions, yet no optimum at all. In desperate attempts to catch up with their Zeitgeists, architects thus sought answers in polarities. Almost negativist like: If not A than B!
