These authors studied the effect of salinity on IFT {{and concluded that the}} decrease in salt concentration from 200, 000  mg/L to 50, 000  mg/L did reduce the IFT. They named the 50, 000  mg/L brine as low-salinity brine. The reduction in IFT results in the weakening of the intermolecular forces between oil and brine which assisted by the gravity effects promotes oil detachment from the brine. Category 1 also includes three different natural brines (SW, FW and IW) without dilution or sulphate spiking. The SW shows the least IFT compared to FW and IW, which is due to least amount of TDS in the SW.|$|E

In this study, female E. sinensis after their puberty molt were subjected to four salinities of 0, 6, 12, and 18 ‰ for 40 days to investigate the salinity effects on their ovarian development as well as a range of important physiological parameters. Elevated salinity accelerated the ovarian development with ovigerous crabs found at salinity treatments of 12 and 18 ‰ despite no copulation had occurred. Meanwhile the survival rate of female crabs <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>trend</b> with increasing salinity. Higher salinity also led to increased hemolymph Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Cl−, and Mg 2 + concentrations. The 6 ‰ treatment had the highest contents of hemolymph total and major free amino acids while the Na+/K+ -ATPase activity in the posterior gills was the lowest among treatments. Total n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (∑n- 3 PUFA) and n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA ratio in the anterior gills <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>decreasing</b> <b>trend</b> with salinity while 18 ‰ had the highest ∑PUFA and ∑n- 6 PUFA. The ∑n- 3 PUFA content and n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA ratio of the posterior gills <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> fluctuating pattern and the highest value was detected at 0 ‰, while an increasing trend was found for the ∑n- 6 PUFA with increasing salinity.
