In regression analysis, consumption by friends, <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> availability within school, and personal characteristics (age, gender, education level, body mass index) were examined as determinants of <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> consumption. <b>Snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> consumption was higher in boys, soft drink consumption was higher in lower educated adolescents, <b>and</b> <b>snack</b> consumption was higher in adolescents with a lower body weight.

The association between individual <b>and</b> peer <b>snack</b> consumption was strong in boys, adolescents with a lower education level, and adolescents with lower body weights. Our study shows that individual <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> consumption is associated with specific combinations of consumption by peers, availability at school, and personal characteristics...|$|R

25|$|Sydney Lewis Hall is {{the home}} of the school of law on the {{historic}} campus of Washington and Lee in Lexington, Virginia. Lewis Hall was built in 1977 with a $9 million gift from Best Products founder Sydney Lewis and his wife Frances of Virginia. Lewis Hall was designed by Marcellus Wright Cox & Smith Architects in the Mid-century modern style. In addition to lecture halls, classrooms, and offices for faculty and staff, Lewis Hall houses the 150-seat Millhiser Moot Courtroom with the accompanying Robert E. Stroud Judge's Chambers and the Roger D. Groot Jury Room. The Millhiser Moot Courtroom serves as the continuity of operations site for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Lewis Hall also has a cafeteria for students, staff, and faculty called the Brief Stop, which serves food, <b>snacks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinks.</b> As part of its recently completed $35 million campaign, Honor Our Past, Build Our Future, the School of Law began an $8 million renovation and modernization project in the summer of 2014 and completed in the summer of 2015. The project resulted in more flexible space for student collaboration and study, new homes for four of the school's legal clinics and student organizations, more natural lighting, a new library reading room, a new high-tech trial courtroom, and an improved entry sequence and navigation for the building.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Frequent high {{caloric intake}} (snacking) induces overweight. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the impact of social and {{physical}} environmental factors on the snacking behavior of adolescents. Design: cross-sectional population based study Method: Snacking behavior of individuals and their peer-group members (cliques) was assessed in 749 adolescents (398 girls, 351 boys, mean age 14. 9, range 12. 4 - 17. 6 years). <b>Snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> availability at school were observed. In hierarchical stepwise regression analysis, clique consumption, <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> availability at school, and person characteristics (age, gender, education level, and body mass index), were examined as determinants of snacking behavior. Individual consumption was also predicted from clique consumption combined with school availability and person characteristics. Results: <b>Snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> consumption was higher in boys than in girls, soft drink consumption was higher in adolescents with lower education, <b>and</b> <b>snack</b> consumption was lower in adolescents with a lower body weight. Clique <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> consumption were associated with individual <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drink</b> intake, particularly in case of more availability of <b>snacks</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drinks,</b> <b>and</b> in boys, adolescents with a lower education level and adolescents with lower body weights. Conclusion: More snacking in adolescents is associated with more snacking in the peer group they belong to, especially in schools with high availability of <b>snacks</b> <b>and</b> soft <b>drinks,</b> in boys, <b>and</b> in lower educated or normal weight adolescents. These findings offer opportunities for influencing individual behavior by preventive programs e. g., by peer education in targeted groups. Future research is suggested for evaluating the potential effect of such programs...|$|R
