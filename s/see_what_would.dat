After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he missed it. As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown the question to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly answered the question, he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the high}} points of Lynch's first term as Taoiseach, and {{possibly}} {{one of the most}} important events in modern Irish history, was Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community. Lynch personally steered the application for membership and the acceptance of membership by a five to one majority in a referendum shows that the vast majority of the country was behind him. Ireland officially joined, along with its nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom and Denmark, on 1 January 1973. Patrick Hillery became Ireland's first European Commissioner. In appointing Hillery Europe was gaining one of Ireland's most experienced politicians, while on the other hand Lynch was losing one of his staunchest allies. The admittance of Ireland was the culmination of a decade of preparation which was begun by Lynch and his predecessor, Seán Lemass, who unfortunately did not live to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have been his greatest achievement.|$|E

25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

Brian wonders if a hypothetical external viewer of the simulation would feel cheated by what was ultimately a [...] "dream sequence," [...] but Stewie argues that a computer simulation is totally different. Stewie then claims {{that he is not}} yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation. Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like the final episode of The Sopranos, where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, the scene cuts to black mid-sentence.|$|E

The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp.

500|$|As the {{war began}} to wind down with Germany's {{surrender}} in May 1945, the team parlayed Brown's ties to college football and the military to build its roster. The first signing was Otto Graham, a former star quarterback at Northwestern University who was then serving in the Navy. The Browns later signed kicker and offensive tackle Lou Groza and wide receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Fullback Marion Motley and nose tackle Bill Willis, two of the earliest African-Americans to play professional football, also joined the team in 1946. Cleveland's first training camp took place at Bowling Green University in northwestern Ohio. Brown's reputation for winning notwithstanding, joining the team was a risk; the Browns and the AAFC were nascent entities and faced tough competition from the NFL.

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain.

I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty."

500|$|Ferdinand's actions {{constituted}} a definitive de facto break {{both with the}} autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government {{was seen as an}} alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the [...] "ancien régime" [...] did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society. Liberals {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.|$|E
500|$|Teach had at some stage learnt of {{the offer}} of a royal pardon and {{probably}} confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it. [...] The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5January. [...] Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach {{at risk of being}} hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions. [...] Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen to another captain. [...] Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon. [...] He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission. [...] Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him. [...] He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27September 1718 {{at the mouth of the}} Cape Fear River. [...] All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.|$|E

[...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. You could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E
