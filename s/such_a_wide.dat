Since making the beams bright enough at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E

Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star. The stars have <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid. The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Resistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not {{in session}} when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams {{therefore}} used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same. By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott. Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, a series of popular essays by John Dickinson which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> audience.|$|E
5|$|Riverside and Brooklyn saw modest growth until 1887, {{when the}} city of Jacksonville annexed them and {{established}} a streetcar line. Following the Great Fire of 1901, which destroyed most of Downtown Jacksonville, many displaced residents moved to Riverside. Wealthy citizens built mansions close to the river, while the less well-to-do purchased more modest bungalows and other plantation houses further inland. The neighborhood grew steadily, with development continuing well beyond its original bounds to the south, until {{the collapse of the}} Florida land boom in the late 1920s. During this period, so many architects working in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety of contemporary styles experimented in Riverside that it has become the most architecturally diverse neighborhood in Florida. Largely due to Riverside's profusion of bungalow plantation houses, Jacksonville has what is likely the largest number of such structures in the state.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and {{are related to the}} circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E

25|$|By September 1937, {{all eight}} Gladiator squadrons had {{achieved}} operational status and had formed the spearhead of London's air defences. Difficulties with introducing the type had been experienced. Although the Gladiator was typically well liked by pilots, the accident rate encountered during operational {{training for the}} type were so numerous that a small replacement batch of 28 Gladiator Mk IIs was hurriedly produced. Most accidents were caused by pilots being caught out by the fighter’s increased wing loading and many aviators had little experience in landing aircraft with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> flap area. The aircraft {{had a tendency to}} stall more abruptly, frequently dropping a wing while doing so.
