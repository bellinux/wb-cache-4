50|$|As an r-selected <b>species,</b> <b>capelin</b> {{have a high}} {{reproductive}} potential and an intrinsic population growth rate. They reproduce by spawning and their main spawning season occurs in spring, but can extend into the summer. The majority of capelin are {{three or four years}} old when they spawn. The males migrate directly to the shallow water of fjords, where spawning will take place, while the females remain in deeper water until they are completely mature. Once the females are mature, they will migrate to the spawning grounds and spawn. This process usually takes place at night. In the North European Atlantic spawning typically occurs over sand or gravel at depths of 2 to(-) 100 m, but in the North Pacific and waters off Newfoundland most spawn on beaches, jumping as far up land as possible, with some managing to strand themselves in the process. Although some other fish species leave their eggs in locations that dry out (a few, such as plainfin midshipman, may even remain on land with the eggs during low tide) or on plants above the water (splash tetras), jumping onto land en masse to spawn is unique to the capelin, grunions and grass puffer. After the female capelins have spawned, they immediately leave the spawning grounds and will potentially spawn again in the following years if they survive. The males do not leave the spawning grounds and will potentially spawn more than once throughout the season. Male capelin are considered to be semelparous because they die soon after the spawning season is over.|$|E

In the model, both harp seals and minke whale, and cod, prey on capelin, herring and cod, and in addition, herring prey on capelin larvae. Cod {{is the most important}} predator. Information on food preferences and food requirements obtained from the Norwegian research program on marine mammals is used to quantify the predation by marine mammals on fish. The sensitivity of the model to the stock sizes and food preferences of harp seals and minke whales is investigated, to-gether with the sensitivity to the food preferences of cod. A tentative conclusion on likely effects of an increasing whale stock is that the herring stock will be most heavily affected. An increasing harp seal stock will most heavily affect the capelin and cod stock. The model is more sensitive to changes in the food preferences of cod than to changes in food preferences or stock sizes of marine mammals...|$|E
40|$|Multi-species and {{ecosystem}} modelling are increasingly touted as essential approaches {{in the future}} of fisheries management. These methodologies can involve the amalgamation of data on the landings, biomass, consumption, production, and diets of many species or species groups in current time, the future and in the re-examination of the past. The Ecopath approach was used to construct two mass balance ecosystem models for the southern Labrador Shelf, Northeast Newfoundland Shelf and Grand Bank in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) Divisions 2 J+ 3 KLNO the first for the time period 1954 - 1956 and the second for 1968 - 1970. Our models increased the temporal resolution of ecosystem models developed by The Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia. The start (1950 s) and rapid expansion (1960 s) of industrial harvesting by factory freezer trawlers during these time periods resulted in massive increases in fishing effort, the total catch increased by 30 %, and there was extensive spatial intensification and expansion, particularly on the Labrador Shelf. Biomass declines in adult and juvenile Atlantic cod, harp seals, and their main prey <b>species</b> <b>capelin</b> and sandlance were evident. A change in predator/prey relationships between the two time periods was expected, but not found. An increase in the biomass of some invertebrate species groups was expected, but not evident, possibly due to sparse historical data. System ratios and indicators pointed to the latter ecosystem as nearer to a state of being 'fished down', perhaps indicating the onset of the trophic shift evident in the late 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|E

It is concluded that these two features are closely correlated and that the decimation of the stock {{of one of the}} major prey <b>species,</b> the <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus), is ultimately largely responsible...|$|R
5000|$|The diet of the {{hooded seal}} is {{composed}} primarily of various amphipods (crustaceans), eeuphausiids (krill), and fish, including Atlantic Argentine, capelin, Greenland halibut, cod, herring, and redfish.

Minke whales are estimated to consume 633,000 tons of Atlantic herring per year in part of Northeast Atlantic. In the Barents Sea, it is estimated that a potential net economic loss of five tons of cod and herring per fishery results from every additional minke whale in the population due the fish consumption of the single whale.|$|R
40|$|Skannet av biblioteketThe multi species model Systmod is a {{conceptual}} model, which gives a quantitative {{description of the}} production of biomass for the <b>species</b> <b>capelin,</b> herring and cod in the Barents Sea. Each of these species is modeled as conventional single specie models, where the specie interactions {{are related to the}} climate, and taken care of as mortality (predation) and food (growth) related to availability of prey. The model is coded and implemented by use of the dynamic simulation tool "Powersim' 7 Studio 7 ", and the parameters are determined by tuning against relevant data from the period 1982 to 2005. The model simulates reasonably well the observed coherence between climate, fish stocks and catches in the actual period. The capeliu is the most important feed for the cod. The most important specie interactions conceming the yield of cod is the influence of immature herring on the recruitment of capelin and the predation of cod of mature capelin and its own cod fry. Strong age groups of herring reduce the recruitment of capelin which reduce the growth of cod and delays the maturation of cod. Declining availability of capelin increases the cannibalism of cod, depending on the volume of recruits {{and the size of the}} older age groups of cod. These relations, in combination with climate variability and changes, are determinant for the dynamics of the system. The simulations indicate that optimal survival of legal catchable cod (above 3 years) are achieved by an equilibrium spawning stock of cod around 300 000 tons, corresponding to an instantaneous length hased mortaiity (F) of 0. 6. For larger stocks, those are stocks with less mortality, cannibalism increase severely and reduce the recruitment to the legal catchable stock of cod. Optimal equilibrium yield is achieved for F = 0. 8, which corresponds to an equilibrium spawning stock of just above 200 000 tons. This is in accordance with ACFM's calculation of minimum acceptable spawning stock Blim of 220 000 tons corresponding to an age based Flim of 0, 74. The results are also in accordance with historical data showing that the strongest year classes measured after 1950 is recmited from spawning stocks of around 200 000 tons...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} feeding {{relationships}} of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on its major prey species within the Barents Sea using the newly developed Atlantis {{model for the}} region. Atlantis is an end-to-end model designed to explore {{the response of the}} ecosystem under different biological, environmental and fisheries scenarios. However, before one can develop such scenarios, the model needs to be tuned through a diet matrix that should reflect the observed diets of the major species in the system. Generating a realistic diet composition is achieved by adjusting indices linked to the strength of the predation for each prey species. The major work carried out within the thesis has been on the tuning of the cod diet. Five different model runs with different diet indices are presented and evaluated by comparing the results with the cod diet documented in the joint Russian-Norwegian (PINRO-IMR) stomach content database. Emphasis in the thesis was placed upon the prey <b>species,</b> <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus) and polar cod (Boreogadus saida). A diet matrix was achieved that was able to reproduce, within an order of magnitude, the natural consumption with regards to relative amounts in terms of number of individuals and biomass of the different prey species. Higher predation pressure was found to reduce prey abundance as expected, and a negative correlation was found between cod and capelin, and also with polar cod but the relationship was much weaker than for capelin. The abundance of polar cod correlated with the amount of capelin consumed, i. e. high predation of cod on capelin results in increasing polar cod abundance. Individual weight of cod was observed to decline when there was high abundance of cod suggesting evidence of density dependent processes. Although the relative rankings of prey species consumed based on numbers of individuals and biomass generally matched the database, the absolute values did not with the model underestimating the total consumption. Suggestions for improvements in the tuning process are provided such as tuning more parameters, for example, growth and consumption rates and resolving temporal as well as geographic distributions to better determine the overlap between predators and prey. Finally, possible future research using the Atlantis model is presented...|$|E
40|$|The Northwest Atlantic {{ecosystem}} {{is currently}} undergoing changes in species interactions and ocean climate. Capelin (Mallotus villosus), the dominant forage {{fish in the}} ecosystem, is the main prey item of marine birds, mammals and piscivorous fish. In the 1990 s, spawning capelin were small, spawned later, shifted their distribution southerly to non-traditional areas compared to historical accounts, and abundance estimates have varied widely. During these changes and divergent biomass estimates, this research was initiated. The focus of this thesis is the multi-scale behavioural interactions of marine predators and prey: a marine diving bird, the common murre (Uria aalge), and its main prey <b>species,</b> <b>capelin.</b> This study integrates both colony-based and vessel-based techniques. I showed that some aggregations of capelin are stable {{in space and time}} on a number of scales: fine- (1 - 100 m; minute-hour), coarse- (1 - 100 km; day-week) meso-scale (100 - 1000 km; annual), allowing murres to use memory to locate prey at sea during different periods during their annual cycle. Social foraging techniques appeared to be important on fine- and coarse-scales (local enhancement, network foraging) while no evidence was found for social foraging techniques over larger spatial scales (Information Center Hypothesis). Spatial scales at which murres tracked capelin were highly variable, as found in other studies examining predator-prey interactions of mobile organisms. The tracking scales of murres to capelin were smallest during the breeding (0. 8 - 5. 1 km) and pre-breeding periods (3. 1 - 8 km), compared to post-breeding (6. 0 - 50. 0 km). This variability in spatial associations between predators and their prey was likely due to different energetic requirements, locomotory constraints and search strategies used among these periods. Inter-colony comparisons of provisioning behaviour by murres revealed low feeding rates of chicks at the largest murre colony in eastern Canada relative to a smaller colony, which resulted in the lowest average mass and condition of fledgling murres (191. 6 ± 4. 0 g) reported in the literature. Density-dependence, both while foraging at sea and rearing chicks at the colony, and prey distribution around the largest colony resulted in additional provisioning constraints relative to a smaller colony and divergent life history strategies at the two colonies. Poorer chick condition, and presumably lower recruitment, may have resulted in a lack of population growth at the larger colony, which contains 85 % of the common murres in the Northwest Atlantic. Clearly, common murres interact with their prey over multiple temporal and spatial scales and these behavioural interactions are manifested in demographic parameters...|$|E

40|$|The Scenario C project aims at {{a dynamic}} minimal {{realistic}} model for capelin, herring, cod, harp seals and minke whales in the Barents Sea and for herring in the Norwegian Sea. This report {{is an attempt}} to estimate a consumption function for cod from estimated monthly abundances of capelin, herring and younger cod in regions of the Barents Sea, and the observed stomach contents of cods. The data are obtained from Institute of Marine Research. A discrete choice model for the diet choice and consumption function of cod in the Barents Sea is implemented using the data of cod and three main prey <b>species</b> (herring, <b>capelin,</b> cod) from 1992 - 2000. It uses the notion of choice probability to describe the foraging behavior. In particular, it estimates how prey selection varies with respect to environmental changes. By using diet choice model, prey consumption can be easily computed and predicted from environmental variables. In conclusion, the empirical results are quite consistent with the hypothesis that prey selection probability is highly related to the biomass amount of the specific prey. Particularly when the biomass is at low levels, even a small increase will lead to a large probability change, with the more available biomass, the smaller the growth. At high levels, the probability is nearly linear in biomasses. As a whole, the probability change is modeled to have a logistic pattern. In addition, it shows that cod prefers capelin, rather than young cod and herring. Emneord/Keywords: Scenario, cod, predation, multinomial logit model...|$|R
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey <b>species</b> were <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{on the basis}} of distributions of fish resources and temperatures observed during surveys in the Barents Sea over the period 1983 - 1987. It is found to be useful (although not detailed enough, due to lack of data) for predicting fish migrations at least two to three months ahead of the last survey. This might, for instance, be of great interest for predicting contacts between fish stocks and oil slicks in scenarios of possible oil pollution in the Barents Sea. The model is based on general knowledge of seasonal fish migration modified by seasonal variations in average sea temperature at 50 - 200 m depth. It is postulated that the fish migrate towards a "preference" temperature, either directly, in order to satisfy metabolic requirements, or indirectly, as when attracted by concentrations of food organisms. The highest "preference" temperature, 5. 5 °C, is estimated for southwards winter migration of mature cod and haddock (e. g. to the spawning grounds in the Lofoten-Vesterålen area). For mature capelin 3. 5 °C seems to be the "preference" temperature in the model for southwards winter migration (mainly towards the spawning grounds near Finnmark). During summer the older cod and haddock, preferring the higher temperatures, migrate a shorter distance northwards to feed than do the younger mature and the immature fish of these species. In the model 5. 5 °C is, therefore, used as the "preference" temperature for the northeastwards summer migration of old cod and haddock, while 3. 0 °C is applied as the best "feeding migration" temperature during the same period for younger fish of these <b>species.</b> As <b>capelin</b> in summer may live far north of cod and haddock, the "preference" temperature for northwards summer migration is expected to be lower than for cod and haddock.

Based on available estimates of the total food consumption of the cetaceans in the area, this paper explores potential interactions between three baleen whale species off Iceland and the relevant fish resources that constitute {{a part of their}} diet prey. The three species of whales are fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest cetacean con-sumer in this area, feeding mainly on krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) but also preying on some fish <b>species</b> like <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus); minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), taking krill as well as a variety of fish, including capelin and gadoids (e. g. cod, Gadus morhua); and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) assumed to be feeding mainly on capelin. The study is based on a variety of assumptions regarding stock sizes, food prefer-ence, potential rates of increase and harvesting strategies. A single-species model devel-oped for investigating the effects of different utilization policies of the Icelandic cod stock is combined with a crude multispecies model and these are used to study the poten-tial impacts on capelin and cod stocks by various developments of the whale stocks under consideration. A Pella-Tomlinson like model is used to describe the whale stocks. The population and fisheries dynamics for shrimp (Pandalus borealis) and capelin (both im-portant food items for cod) are described using simple models. Thus, only aggregates such as total, recruiting or adult numbers or biomass are considered as opposed to the fully age-class based cod model. The results indicate that both minke and humpback whales may have significant di-rect impact on the status of the capelin stock. The effects of fin whale predation on the capelin stock seems less significant unless such consumption occurs outside the sampled area, which is quite possible. The impact of the three baleen whale species on the devel-opment of the cod stock is uncertain, but may be considerable...|$|R

Temperatures and salinities have been frequently above the long-term mean in the waters to the south and west of the country, and these conditions have also influenced the shelf area north of the country.

40|$|A {{combined}} acoustic {{and bottom}} trawl survey for demersal {{fish in the}} Barents Sea has been conducted annually since 1981. The main aim is to map the spatial distribution and obtain indices of abundance (numbers at age) of cod, haddock, redfish and Greenland halibut. In addition other biological information and CTD-data are collected. The survey covers an area of about 150, 000 square nautical miles, and is carried out with 3 vessels and about 25 scientific staff {{for a period of}} 25 - 30 days. The abundance indices and weight at age data are used directly in the stock assessments in ICES. Stomach data of cod are together with other information used to estimate the Northeast Arctic cod stock's consumption of important prey <b>species,</b> e. g. <b>capelin,</b> cod and haddock. This information is further used in the assessment of these species. The tuning diagnostics indicate that the indices from the survey are the most reliable among the tuning data, and the assessments of Northeast Arctic cod and haddock are thus heavily dependent on the results of the survey. Since the management relies heavily on the assessments, the surveys can have a direct effect on the TAC's. Several changes in survey methodology aiming at increased reliability of the results have been introduced. Some of these changes had large effects on the index level. The time series have therefore been adjusted in order to maintain and improve comparability.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) from Skellig Michael, south-west Ireland, was investigated using geolocation loggers between the 2010 and 2011 breeding seasons. All tracked birds travelled rapidly west into the North Atlantic {{at the end}} of the breeding season in August, with the majority undertaking transatlantic trips from Ireland to the Newfoundland-Labrador shelf. The furthest distance from the colony reached by each bird was not influenced by body mass or sex and was achieved in approximately 20 days. By October, all birds had moved back to the mid Atlantic where they remained resident until returning to the breeding colony. The most parsimonious explanation for the rapid, directed long-distance migration is that birds exploit the seasonally high abundance of prey [e. g., fish <b>species</b> such as <b>capelin</b> (Mallotus villosus) and sandlance (Ammodytes spp.) ] off the Canadian coast, which is also utilised by large populations of North American seabirds at this time. Once the availability of this short-term prey resource has diminished, the tracked puffins moved back towards the north-east Atlantic. A relationship between relative abundance of puffins and zooplankton was found in all winter months, but after correcting for spatial autocorrelation, was only significant in November and January. Nevertheless, these results suggest a potential switch in diet from mainly fish during the breeding and early post-breeding periods to zooplankton over the remaining winter period. This study suggests that puffins from south-west Ireland have a long-distance migration strategy that is rare in breeding puffins from the UK and identifies a key non-breeding destination for puffins from Ireland. This has implications for the susceptibility of different breeding populations to the effects of possible climatic or oceanographic change...|$|R

During {{the past}} three decades {{considerable}} changes have taken place within the Icelandic pelagic industry which, previously considered rather fragmented, is now a highly concentrated vertically integrated industry due to considerable consolidations of quotas. During this period, changes in the ecosystem around Iceland have also brought valuable pelagic species such as Atlanto-Scandian herring and Atlantic mackerel to the EEZ, while other <b>species</b> such as <b>capelin</b> have declined. Part of the concentration within the pelagic sector can be attributed to changes in the ITQ management system and company adjustments to laws and regulations.   Another aspect {{can be attributed to the}} entrance of valuable species into the Icelandic EEZ and decreasing quotas of fishmeal oriented species. Finally technology changes have increased production efficiency in processing and fisheries. All this has altered the Icelandic pelagic industry in three ways: Firstly, processing for human consumption has increased with additional species and advances in processing technology.   Secondly, raw material for the fishmeal industry has declined parallel with lower capelin quotas.   Thirdly, a number of processing utilities and vessels have been scrapped, affecting employment in many fishing villages...|$|R

The time step is one month, {{and there are two}} areas (The Barents Sea and parts of the Norwegian Sea). There is a food-web with minke whales as top predators, {{consuming}} herring, capelin and cod according to a non-linear consumption function in available prey abundance. The consumption function for minke whales is roughly estimated. The opportunistic minke whale may forage on plankton and other ®sh than cod, capelin or herring, and is thus, modelled as having carrying capacity and demographic parameters independent of the status of the ®sh stocks in the model. The ®sh-®sheries are managed by ®xed VPA-based ®shing mortalities (cod and herring) and Captool (capelin), while minke whaling is managed according to the RMP of the IWC. The model is stochastic in ®sh recruitment and in survey indices for minke whales. The model is simulated over 100 -year periods in a number of scenarios spanned by nine experimental factors. The core of the experimental design is an orthogonal array with 27 points. The primary study variable is the tuning of the RMP, and the response variables are catches and stock sizes of cod, herring and minke whale. The responses are taken as yearly means over the last 90 years of the period. When the tuning of the RMP is changed from the current level of targeting the ®nal stock at 72 % of carrying capacity to 60 %, the annual catch of whales increases with some 300 animals, while the annual catch of cod increases with some 0. 1 million ton on the average. For herring, no clear main effect was found on catc...|$|R

These assessments have led to severe fishing cuts {{over the past few}} years, have consequently threatened the centuries-old Atlantic cod fishery along the New England coast and put the livelihood of thousands of fishermen at risk. Amidst this fisheries crisis, calls by elected officials, environmental groups and fishing consortiums were made for an Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) survey of the Gulf of Maine cod stock. Typically, cod stock assessments incorporate data collected from conventional acoustic and trawl line transect surveys that highly undersample the marine environment in space and time and lead to ambiguities in population estimates. The combination of conventional methods and OAWRS techniques, however, has been demonstrated to provide rapid and accurate fish stock assessments over ecosystem-scale areas for other species. In this thesis, the feasibility of accurately surveying cod stocks with OAWRS is theoretically assessed. These theoretical predictions are then experimentally verified by successfully sensing cod with OAWRS over ecosystem scales in the Nordic Seas. Following direct requests by Massachusetts state officials to determine if OAWRS could be used to detect and survey the reported waning cod populations in coastal New England waters, we obtained measurements of typical aggregation densities and occupancy depths of spawning cod in Ipswich Bay from conventional echosounder surveys conducted in Spring 2011. Cod length distributions were also measured from which we estimated the swimbladder resonance frequencies of local cod via a harmonic oscillator model that includes the effects of damping, the cod's swim bladder air volume at a given neutral buoyancy depth as well as changes to this volume for deviations from neutral buoyancy depth. The optimal frequency for OAWRS detection typically corresponds to that where the resonance peak is found. We showed that our theoretical estimates of cod swimbladder resonance matched very well with independent measurements of caged cod resonance from decades old Norwegian data. Using parabolic equation modeling of ocean waveguide propagation, the scattered level of typical spawning cod aggregations was estimated and compared with that from seafloor scattering, which is a typical limiting factor in long range active sensing. Seafloor scattering was estimated via a Rayleigh-Born approach we developed, where the magnitude squared of seafloor scattering amplitude was empirically determined from thousands of measurements made during major OAWRS experiments along the US Northeast coast. It was found that near cod swimbladder resonance (roughly 150 - 600 Hz), determined from the New England length and depth distribution data, OAWRS was capable of robustly detecting spawning cod aggregations from many tens of kilometers in range with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNRs) greater than 20 dB for typical spawning cod configurations in New England waters. Above the resonance frequency peak, it is possible to detect cod for typical shoaling densities because cod scattering reaches a plateau due to geometric scattering that is above the seafloor scattering trend for typical OAWRS frequencies. Well below the resonance peak, scattering from cod is expected to fall off rapidly and faster than seafloor scattering, and so provides important information about resonance behavior but can be difficult to probe given the very low frequencies involved. This theoretical feasibility study emphasized the need for a low frequency source that spans cod swimbladder resonance and helped demonstrate the potential for use of OAWRS for cod assessments over ecosystem scales. To confirm our theoretical predictions on the OAWRS detection of cod and other keystone fish species, we designed, prepared and conducted a major oceanographic experiment in the Nordic Seas in the Arctic in the winter (February-March) of 2014 using three major research vessels, the US RV Knorr, the Norwegian RV Johan Hjort and the Norwegian FV Artus. The Nordic Seas 2014 experiment was conducted in difficult gale and hurricane force weather conditions along most of Norway's western and northern coast. MIT's OAWRS Source, obtained through a NSF-Sloan MRI grant, spanned the 800 - 1600 Hz range, and the receiver was ONR's Five Octave Receiver Array (FORA). Unlike the declining trend of cod population in New England waters, cod population in the Nordic Seas has been thriving for many years and is currently at its healthiest recorded state. The experiment period was chosen such that it coincided with the peak spawning period of cod along the coastal Lofoten region in Norway where they congregate in high densities, as well as other keystone species that migrate from the ice-edge to spawn in some of the world's largest mass migrations. In planning, we determined likely spawning grounds for cod, and other keystone <b>species</b> such as <b>capelin,</b> herring, and haddock using historic survey data collected along the Norwegian coast. With our calibrated model of fish swimbladder resonance and historic length distribution data from Norway, swimbladder resonance frequencies and target strengths of these fish species were estimated. We also determined optimal OAWRS ship tracks for remote detection of these species above seafloor scattering using waveguide propagation modeling. While the OAWRS frequencies were greater than those expected for cod swimbladder resonance, cod shoals over ten kilometers in length were robustly detected and successfully imaged from tens of kilometer ranges during the experiment. This produced the first instantaneous images of a vast cod shoal. It also confirmed our predictions that OAWRS can be used to remotely sense and survey cod populations. Our theoretical predictions suggest that the use of lower OAWRS frequencies near cod swimbladder resonance would lead to greater dynamic range in population density estimates. The Nordic Seas experiment provided the first look revealing the entire horizontal morphology of vast cod, capelin, haddock and Norwegian herring shoals. This was done with instantaneous OAWRS imaging. The presence of multiple shoaling fish species during the Nordic Seas experiment provided us with a unique opportunity to study general shoaling behavior across species over ecosystem scales with OAWRS. For example, many pelagic and demersal fish species are known to undergo distant migrations for feeding, spawning and overwintering year after year. This suggests that migrating populations have an ability to efficiently sense their environment. By combining OAWRS estimates of fish scattering strength and population density obtained from simultaneous depth echo-sounding along line transects, areal population densities over entire shoals were determined. This enabled estimation of total shoal population, shoal aspect ratio, and shoal migration speed via cross correlation of population density over time. It was shown that across several species, as shoal population increased (tens of thousands to hundreds of millions of individuals), shoal aspect ratio also increased (roughly from one to ten). Single-celled organisms with higher aspect ratios have been shown to more efficiently and accurately detect chemical gradients at microscopic scales. The high-aspect ratio or elongated morphology of a large migrating fish shoal is consistent with the entire shoal serving the function of a biological antenna for efficient spatial and temporal sensing of mesoscale processes in the environment. We also studied the evolution of air resonance power efficiency in the violin and its ancestors. We collected historical data, including samples from roughly 500 classical Cremonese violins from the renowned workshops of Amati, Stradivari and Guarneri, to establish historic time series of key design traits. We determined the primary physical mechanisms governing radiated air resonance power in the violin and its ancestors and used this knowledge to explain the evolutionary trends we discovered. by Ankita Deepak Jain.
