500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E
2500|$|Li {{returned}} to the national team in 2004. Jiang Shan married Li on 27 January 2006, and became her personal coach. Li quit the national team {{as well as the}} state-run sports system in 2008 under an experimental reform policy for tennis players. This change was called [...] "Fly Solo" [...] (单飞) by Chinese media. As a result, Li had the freedom to hire her own coaching staff and she would be solely responsible for the cost of training and coaching and tour expense. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> more of her winnings, with only 8 percent of her winnings going to the Chinese Tennis Association development fund as opposed to 65 percent previously. In the summer of 2012, the requirement of contribution to the Chinese tennis development fund was lifted and Li kept all her prize money.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{moved into}} night {{formation}} at 2117. Sunset {{had been at}} 2000, with full darkness by 2100. The ships were travelling approximately SSE with the battleships in four columns one mile apart which were intended to travel parallel courses in a compact block giving minimum opportunity for surprise torpedo attack. The western column comprised the Second Battle Squadron of eight ships commanded by Martyn Jerram. The next column one mile to the east was the Fourth Battle Squadron led by , Jellicoe's flagship. Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee on [...] commanding the fourth division (a division of four ships being half a squadron of eight), was second in command of this squadron. The third column consisted of the First Battle Squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Cecil Burney [...] from [...] Marlborough had been damaged by a torpedo strike [...] but reported <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> up with a speed of seventeen knots. This [...] proved optimistic, {{with the result that}} the half-squadron [...] 5th division maintained its allotted position, but Marlborough and the other three ships of the 6th division fell progressively behind. The Fifth Battle Squadron commanded from [...] by Hugh Evan-Thomas of only three fast battleships ( [...] having returned to port damaged after taking part in the initial battlecruiser action), took up a position between the two separating halves. At 2203 the 5th Battle Squadron reversed course for five minutes so as to fall back closer to Marlborough.|$|E

2500|$|Of the {{decision}} to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa {{was under the impression}} Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. [...] "She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them," [...] he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. [...] "Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [...] a legend now," [...] said Rothenberg. [...] "Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually {{come to terms with the}} likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she would have done the same thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. [...] "That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can you go and still be the good guy in order to save your people. Lexa had that choice in [...] 15. Obviously, it landed very emotionally for both of them, but especially on Clarke," [...] he stated. [...] "In [...] 16, Clarke had a similar choice and I hope that over the course of the first part of , Clarke will eventually come to see it that way. If she can't, then they'll never figure out a way to make peace with each other".|$|E

60|$|The {{thing had}} been {{so close to the}} top of her mind ever since she had come to the {{knowledge}} of it that it had been hard for her to keep it down. Now <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> it down no longer.|$|E

60|$|Meg was in {{a perfect}} fright lest he should guess right too soon; {{shrinking}} away, as she held the basket towards him; curling up her pretty shoulders; stopping her ear with her hand, as if by so doing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the right word out of Toby’s lips; and laughing softly the whole time.|$|E
