25|$|Controller: The {{controller}} is an ECU type {{unit in the}} car which receives {{information from}} each individual wheel <b>speed</b> <b>sensor,</b> in turn if a wheel loses traction the signal {{is sent to the}} controller, the controller will then limit the brake force (EBD) and activate the ABS modulator which actuates the braking valves on and off.|$|E
25|$|Speed sensors: A <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E

The <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> for the rear wheels is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. The rear wheels, however, are monitored together; they both have to start to lock up before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the rear wheels will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for the rear wheels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Among the {{complete}} family of sensors for automotive safety, consumer and industrial application, <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> {{stand out as}} one of the most important. Actually, <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> have the diversity to be used in a broad range of applications. In todayâ€™s automotive industry, such sensors are used in the antilock braking system, the traction control system and the electronic stability program. Also, typical applications are cam and crank shaft position/speed and wheel and turbo shaft speed measurement. In addition, they are used to control a variety of functions, including fuel injection, ignition timing in engines, and so on. However, some types of <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> cannot respond to very low speeds for different reasons. What is more, the main reason why such sensors are not good at detecting very low speeds is that they are more susceptible to noise when the speed of the target is low. In short, they suffer from noise and generally only work at medium to high speeds. This is one of the drawbacks of the inductive (magnetic reluctance) <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> and is the case under study. Furthermore, there are other <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> like the differential Hall Effect sensors that are relatively immune to interference and noise, but they cannot detect static fields. This limits their operations to speeds which give a switching frequency greater than a minimu...|$|R

50|$|This {{transmission}} has {{a separate}} oil for the differential in the transmission, {{so there are}} two fluid levels to check. The differential fluid is checked by unscrewing the <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> gear assembly {{and use it as}} a dipstick. The <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> gear assembly is located on top of the transmission just above the right inner CV joint. Differential is emptied by removing the final drive cover on the rear of the transmission or by vacuum extraction through the <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> hole. Vacuum extraction is the more attractive option since a paper gasket seals the steel cover and access is very difficult. Filling is through the <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> hole. Differential oil capacity is about 1 liter. An acceptable differential oil is Redline synthetic MT-90 75W90 gear oil or any synthetic 75W90 GL4 gear oil. Be very careful not to introduce sand or dust into the differential, as the differential has no way to filter its oil.|$|E
