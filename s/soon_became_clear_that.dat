5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Jones and Bostock {{could not get}} along together, but Kenney preferred to have Bostock in operational command, and although he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} Battle of Finschhafen, it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the strength of}} the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.|$|E
25|$|It <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the young}} criminals are only pawns in the criminal, sadistic {{games of the}} prison guards and their commander.|$|R
50|$|Despite their similar {{background}} it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Muslim Hasan and non-Muslim Vuko {{are very}} different. Their continuing interaction results in ever increasing tension between them, ultimately with tragic consequences.|$|R
50|$|Fry {{then moves}} in with Bender. Bender {{lives in a}} robot {{apartment}}, which {{is little more than}} a two-cubic meter stall, and it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Bender's cramped apartment cannot meet Fry's needs.|$|R
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this {{would take more than}} six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
5|$|When first planned, the {{landings}} were to {{take place}} simultaneouslyOverlord in Normandy and Anvil {{in the south of}} France. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a dual landing was impossible to conduct with the available forces. The expansion of Overlord from a three- to a five-division front required many additional LSTs, which would have been needed for Anvil. At the same time, another Allied amphibious landing in Italy at Anzio had gone badly. All of these resulted in the postponing of Anvil by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed {{to the idea of}} any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5000|$|Fiz {{arrives in}} South Africa {{to make sure}} that Chesney was safe. Fiz finds Chesney in a {{wheelchair}} but it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Cilla had lied about Chesney's accident and that Chesney is not in fact injured.|$|R
50|$|Hiding {{out in an}} {{abandoned}} house in the desert, the pair embarks on a torrid journey of sensual and romantic discovery, who rekindles her will to live, but it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> things can't stay this way forever.|$|R
5|$|In 1993, Sunderland's planned {{new stadium}} {{was on the}} {{shortlist}} for Euro 96 venues, as England had been named as hosts of the competition in May 1992. However, it <b>soon</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a new stadium in Sunderland would not be ready {{in time for the}} tournament.|$|R
5|$|In 1804, {{at the end}} of the Peace of Amiens, Hope briefly took {{command of}} HMS Atlas, but it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his health was failing and he could no longer {{maintain}} an active naval career. Retiring from the navy on half-pay, Hope was an invalid from 1804 until 1807, when a return to health permitted him to take a post as a Lord of the Admiralty. Hope changed positions several times in this role, but he held onto the position for twenty years as a political favourite, a status maintained by being almost totally politically inactive. In 1812, Hope was advanced to rear-admiral and in January 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on the reorganisation of the order, and was invested later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next ten days the {{battalion}} was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island, with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the Australian 2/7th Battalion at 42nd Street on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed, with the Māori accounting for 100. However, it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards Sfakia. The 5th Infantry Brigade took turns with two Australian battalions and the commandos of Layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} {{recording the}} construction of the third Auberge d'Italie, but work began in 1574 and the building was inaugurated in September 1579. When the first floor was completed, construction {{of the rest of the}} building was suspended, but it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the building was too small. On 25 August 1582, the decision to built a second floor was taken. Master mason Gio Andrea Farrugia was responsible for the construction, but he died before the project was completed. Construction continued throughout the 1580s, and was completed in around 1595. Apart from Cassar and Farrugia, several other architects and master masons were responsible for {{the construction of}} the auberge, including the engineer Francesco Antrini.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Shiva Mukti is an overworked {{psychiatric}} doctor {{working in}} London. He feels dissatisfied. After {{an encounter with}} Dr Zack Busner the two begin trading patients of interest. However it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> despite Busner's failing health {{he is determined to}} exact his calculated revenge upon Dr. Mukti.|$|R
50|$|The Aussie ladettes are {{stripped}} {{down to their}} ill-fitting undies and it's soon all too obvious that these are tattooed recruits of the rawest kind. Dispensing with niceties, the staff get to work and, as lessons begin in earnest, it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the ladettes are up against formidable opposition.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} of the Charon, {{who has been}} imprisoned in the Nightland for the past one thousand years, though he is released upon the world by Tensor. It <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Rulke's evil reputation is, at least partly, a lie. Rulke is obsessed with the survival of his people.|$|R
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to {{what they saw as}} shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was {{responsible for the deaths of}} three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted {{together to make a}} block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E
50|$|The story {{switches}} {{back and}} forth between the present day and the time of the killings. As the police investigation closes in on the four men, they turn on each other. It <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> one of them will have to take the blame, or they will all be convicted.|$|R
50|$|It <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the family}} can only see the three new Alices while the real Alice is {{invisible}} to all of them. Although she enjoys having more time to herself, she misses out on contact with her children and is unimpressed when the loving wife gets intimate with her husband Rex.|$|R
50|$|Candace's foreman is {{beaten by}} a henchman of Jarboe's. She {{tries to get}} Larkin to work for her, but he declines. Into town ride Charlie and Jo, curious about Silver City mining opportunities. They are shocked to find Larkin there. It <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Jo only married Charlie for his money, not for love.|$|R
25|$|Then, in 1976, {{came the}} Hibernia oil strike, which changed the {{fortunes}} of the area. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> offshore Newfoundland could and did host large oil fields.|$|E
25|$|Despite Donahue's {{energetic}} campaigning, it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{his candidacy}} was profoundly limited by {{his ties to}} the Kirkland regime. Donahue was forced to defend {{the status quo and}} deny the magnitude of the labor movement's problems when he believed otherwise.|$|E
25|$|It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the {{kinematic}} (single scattering) theory, {{which had}} been successfully used to explain X-ray diffraction experiments, was inadequate for the quantitative interpretation of experimental data obtained from LEED. At this stage a detailed determination of surface structures, including adsorption sites, bond angles and bond lengths was not possible.|$|E
50|$|It <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Mary's not {{the only}} thing Don's {{forgotten}} about. It looks like both Don and Larry are in such a muddle they, and, their school, are going to lose the track meet. Once again, it's up to the girls to sort out the mess, and spur them on to victory.|$|R
50|$|Jaded by a {{world which}} has deceived him, an older gentleman withdraws from society into a somber and lonely existence. When a crisis {{develops}} in his city, it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{he has led}} a more than unusual life. He {{is a man with}} secrets, bitterness, lies, and regret - and he's being watched.|$|R
50|$|You Are Empty is a first-person shooter {{video game}} based in a fictionalized postwar Soviet Union. The game {{begins with the}} protagonist waking up in a ruined hospital, and it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the populace has been afflicted by {{mutation}} and madness. He then must battle to stay alive and unravel the mystery.|$|R
25|$|There then {{followed}} a significant gap in his first-class career. London County's first-class days were at an end, and Bale {{had the misfortune}} to be a contemporary at Surrey with Herbert Strudwick. It <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the exceptional Strudwick was {{not likely to be}} dislodged as the county's regular keeper. Bale played a few times for Surrey's Second XI in 1905, but then determined to qualify for another county, Worcestershire.|$|E
25|$|The {{sections}} of the Green Line that delineate the boundaries between Israel, the West Bank and Gaza run through heavily populated regions. The Line corresponds to the military front of the 1948 War, and while the considerations dictating its placement were primarily military, it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> in many places it divided towns and villages, and separated farmers from their fields. Consequently, the Green Line underwent various slight adjustments, and special arrangements were made for limited movement in certain areas.|$|E
25|$|This kind of {{strategy}} worked {{well at the}} front, but it <b>soon</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a lack of training, experience and coordination between the Fliegerdivisions (Flying Divisions) and the AAA arm, when dealing with strategic defensive operations, made an effective defence difficult. With the AAA defences ineffective and seven Gruppen covering German air space, the vital industries were not well protected. This system remained in place for so long because the Allied air forces were too weak {{to take advantage of}} the situation.|$|E
5000|$|Zarek and Gaeta end up only {{controlling}} Galactica for a {{brief period}} of time.

25|$|Baron {{is confronted}} by the sheriff on the risks and meaning of killing the {{president}} and Baron's remaining henchman begins showing some reluctance. For Baron, however, these are the very least of his concerns and it <b>soon</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he is a psychopath whose pleasure comes from killingwho and why he kills being of little importance to him.|$|R
