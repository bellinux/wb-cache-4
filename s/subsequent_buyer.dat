5000|$|A {{bona fide}} {{purchaser}} (BFP)referred to more completely as a {{bona fide purchaser}} for value without notice is a term used predominantly in common law jurisdictions in the law of real property and personal property to refer to an innocent party who purchases property without notice of any other partys claim to the title of that property. A BFP must purchase for value, meaning {{that he or she}} must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, recording ones interest protects an owner from losing that interest to a <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyer</b> who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, some jurisdictions (so-called [...] "race-notice" [...] jurisdictions) require the BFP himself or herself to record in order to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance.|$|E
5000|$|To {{create an}} easement, first, under Law of Property Act 1925 section 65(1) a {{landowner}} may expressly grant a neighbour a right over his land, or may reserve a right when selling {{a portion of}} land to someone else. Second, an easement may also come about through an express assurance, triggering proprietary estoppel. This {{was the case in}} Crabb v Arun District Council, where a landowner acquired an easement after the council assured him they would leave him access to his land over theirs, when he sold another portion that gave the route in from the main road. Third, the law may find easements by a process of construction, in general, if they are necessary for property's reasonable enjoyment. The rules are analogous to incorporation and implication terms in contracts, so for instance in Green v Lord Somerleyton Jonathan Parker LJ approved an easement for drainage of water from Lord Somerleyton's land into Green's dykes, because when land was sold on in 1921 its proper construction incorporated a drainage deed. In Kent v Kavanagh it was clarified, however, that because reasonable enjoyment was the aim of implication, an easement was only to be implied in situations where land was in common ownership and occupation. This test was satisfied on those facts, where two semi-detached houses had a small path between them to access the back gardens, and a <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyer</b> wished to build into its half of the path. Chadwick LJ held the easement was necessary for enjoyment of the back garden. Fourth, under Law of Property Act 1925 section 62, easements that are [...] "appertaining or reputed to appertain to the land" [...] at the time of a conveyance will bind the purchaser. So in Hair v Gillman a lady who parked her car in a neighbour's forecourt while she had a seven-year lease acquired a crystallised lease when she subsequently bought the house. If easements are used for twenty years, however, a fifth method of acquiring a crystallised legal right is through the Prescription Act 1832. This method comes from simple period of extended use, and does not require showing any need for the easement. There are also a range of statutory easements, including, notably, [...] "wayleaves" [...] reserved by public authorities to install pipes or cables, and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 which extended the registered number of private and common lands where people have the [...] "right to roam" [...] for recreation. However created, an easement ought to be registered to ensure protection. An easement that is not registered will be recognised as an over-riding interest according to LRA 2002 Schedule 3, paragraph 3, if known to a person to whom land is sold and if the easement is obvious on a reasonably careful inspection, but only if the easement is acquired at law (not equity) since 13 October 2003.|$|E

40|$|We {{determine}} the mechanism that a rational, profit-maximizing seller {{would use to}} revise his reservation price for a heterogeneous or infrequently exchanged good. For instance, while one dimension of a home's quality may be easily determined in competitive markets (e. g., the valuation of floor size, location, etc.), other dimensions of quality may be idiosyncratic (unit specific) and unobservable by the seller (e. g., aesthetics of the home). Here, a seller of a new or infrequently exchanged housing unit may use sales success information to revise his expectation of the unit's market-determined value and hence revise his reservation price. The rational seller will, upon arrival of the first buyer inspecting the unit, determine a sequence of reservation prices for this and expected <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyers.</b> This price sequence falls for <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyers</b> and starts from a lower initial price if the first buyer arrives later than expected. Through this mechanism, we offer an explanation for price dispersion and vacancy durations in housing markets. While we explicitly model {{the real estate market}} here, this price revision mechanism is also applicable to rental markets, labor markets, used car markets, and other markets characterized by heterogeneity and infrequent sales.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the right of}} first offer signed by a seller and a buyer, prior to the seller’s bargaining with the buyer and subsequent buyers. The seller has only one asset to sell. The right of first offer prevents the seller from selling his asset to subsequent buyers at a price below the price he offers to the first buyer. This contract may reduce the seller’s trading opportunities with subsequent buyers. Such effects may make the seller less aggressive in bargaining with the first buyer, who is privately informed about his valuation, and therefore may increase the joint surplus for the contracting parties. In particular, when the subsequent market has many competitive buyers, the right of first offer increases the joint surplus for the contracting parties when subsequent buyers ’ valuations {{are likely to be}} high and when there is a large probability that the seller will learn about the subsequent buyers ’ valuations. When there is only one buyer in the subsequent market, the right of first offer may have strategic effects to increase the price paid by the <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyer.</b> The right of first offer more likely increases the joint surplus for the contracting parties when the <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyer</b> has greater bargaining power. Different from many other strategic contracts, the right of first offer reduces the probability of trade, but may also lead to a more efficient allocation of the asset between buyers. Accordingly, it may increase social welfare and courts should enforce such a contract under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the right of}} first offer, which requires a seller to bargain with the contracted buyer before subsequent buyers arrive. The contract also prevents the seller from selling his unique asset to subsequent buyers at a price below what he offers to the contracted buyer. The right of first offer makes the seller less aggressive in bargaining with the contracted buyer, who is privately informed about his valuation. Such a contract can reduce inter-temporal misallocation, in which a <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyer</b> gets the asset when the contracted buyer has higher valuation. But it also may cause misallocation in which the contracted buyer gets the asset when subsequent buyers have higher valuations. Overall, whether the right of first offer can increase the joint surplus for the seller and the contracted buyer, {{as well as social}} welfare, depends on the contracted buyer's renegotiation power and the distribution of the buyers' valuations. This paper also discusses the differences between the right of first offer and the most-favored-customer clause. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{identify}} {{initial public}} offerings (IPOs) as a setting to study the effect of capital gains taxes on asset prices. The initial (first-day) stock returns are a proxy for the short-term taxable gains incurred by initial investors who bought shares at the offer price. If initial investors are able to shift the short-term capital gains tax burden from selling their shares to equity issuers or <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyers,</b> then the magnitude of IPO under-pricing should increase in short-term capital gains taxes. On the other hand, a historically lower long-term capital gains tax rate offers initial investors the opportunity to reduce capital gains taxes by delaying the sale of their shares. If these tax savings are important, then the magnitude of IPO under-pricing should decrease in long-term capital gains tax rate. We provide empirical evidence supporting both predictions. Our results suggest that taxes {{play an important role}} in IPO under-pricing and, more broadly, in valuing securities...|$|R
5000|$|Attachment of a {{security}} interest does not ensure that the secured party's interest in the collateral will be superior to the interest of other lienors or <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyers,</b> lessees, or licensee. In general, to obtain priority over such other claimants, the security interest must be [...] "perfected." [...] Although some security interests are perfected automatically upon attachment, see U.C.C. § 9-309, for most perfection must be achieved through compliance with statutory procedure designed to give the world notice that the collateral is encumbered.

40|$|Macro-prudential {{policy is}} {{designed}} to address risk at a systemwide level, an exam-ple of which is mortgage default following a period of excessive residential property lending. Policy tools to address this risk, such as caps on loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) ratios should by design reWect the risk proVle of lending. This research considers the heterogeneity of default risk between Vrst time buyers and second and <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyers</b> and Vnds that Vrst time buyers have lower default rates having con-trolled for borrower and loan characteristics. The potential implications for the macro prudential policy setting are empirically analysed: the default-diUerential {{between the two groups}} linearly increases with LTI and a non-linear diUerence is found to be max-imised at 80 - 85 per cent for LTV. In addition, the role for a rule designed on house valuation is examined, with results showing a diminishing default-diUerential as val-uations increase. This research is consistent with diUerential regulatory treatment of Vrst time buyers with default risk remaining comparable to the remainder of mortgage lending...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} whether corporations should owe {{fiduciary duties}} to its preferred stockholders as preferred stockholders across all settings of preferred stock holding. In one context, sophisticated venture capitalists purchase preferred stock after carefully negotiating the stock price, {{control over the}} corporate governance, and other key stipulations by contract. Additionally, because the initial preferred stockholder could protect its interests through staged financing or board control, the preferred stockholder might not discount the stock even if it lacked protection since the other protective devices made the lack of such protections inconsequential so the initial holders won’t pay for these added fiduciary protections. In such settings {{it does not make}} sense for the corporation to owe fiduciary duties to the preferred stockholders as preferred. In fact, doing so rearranges the basis on which the initial stockholders purchased the stock and implying a fiduciary term constitutes a hit to the common stockholders and thus ignores the terms of the claimants and the risk and targeted return for each of them. However, while it makes sense for sophisticated venture capitalists to rely only on bargained-for contractual protections, this Article identifies two specific contexts where a limited fiduciary obligation should be extended to preferred stockholders who lack bargaining power. The first is when non-working children are given preferred stock in a family business. The second is when a corporation takes on a new unfamiliar product line, allowing common stockholders to wipe out the value of publicly traded preferred stock. When the preferred stock is purchased in the public marketplace, the preferred stockholders will not have any bargaining power in the preferred stock’s contractual arrangement. Moreover, the additional terms routine in shareholder agreements between VC’s and founders are almost never found in the Charter documents, so those provisions won’t be transferable. To the subsequent purchaser of preferred stock the lack of such protections might call for a limited fiduciary duty if the markets for preferred stock are not as efficient as for common stock or if there are chinks in the efficient capital market hypothesis. Where the disciplining effects of the market are weaker, <b>subsequent</b> <b>buyers</b> of the preferred stock may not price the stock accurately to reflect the lack of transferable protections, providing a justification for a limited fiduciary duty in that context if implying the term would add value. to be published by the Rutgers University Law Review...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{typically}} {{are concerned with}} a price that equates supply and demand, {{but in many cases}} the price is below the market-clearing level and excess demand queued. Although it is sometimes difficult to measure excess demand in real market, we can infer excess demand when we have difficulty in making reservations for well-known restaurants or best plays. ^ Specifically, it is an interesting economic puzzle that carmakers accept excess demand often during the initial periods when new cars were introduced. In face of uncertain demand, carmakers have an incentive to specify relatively a high, not low inventory level during the initial periods. The reason is that the leftover inventory conveys information about an uncertain demand function and increases the informativeness of the inventory signals for newly introduced cars. Typical studies on inventory are also emphasizing that the firm has inclination to hold a relatively high inventory when the firm is facing high uncertainty in the market. Therefore, from the view of typical inventory theory, {{there is no reason for}} carmakers to hold relatively low inventories during the initial periods when demand uncertainty is relatively high. ^ This thesis introduces a countervailing reason for an initial relatively low inventory that depends on a consumption externality among consumers. We assume that consumers make their quality inference in part on the basis of past excess demand for the good. For example, often consumers are aware of the difficulty of making reservations or queues at well-known restaurants, long waiting list to take delivery of some cars, and long lines to enter the best plays. In such cases, they infer high quality. Thus, excess demand in the previous period can influence <b>subsequent</b> potential <b>buyers</b> 2 ̆ 7 purchasing behavior. It is then rational for a firm introducing a new product to adjust its initial production and price to increase the likelihood of excess demand in an attempt to influence potential consumers 2 ̆ 7 perception of quality and thus subsequent demand. We formally develop a model that demonstrates this result in the context of a market with demand and quality uncertainty. The model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions are tested using an extensive data set of inventories and sales for new luxury and sports cars over the past 15 years. The empirical results are consistent with the theory. ...|$|R
