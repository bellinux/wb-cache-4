40|$|The Dirac fermions of Sb square net in AEMnSb(2) (AE = Sr, Ba) are {{investigated}} by using first-principles calculation. BaMnSb 2 contains Sb square net layers with a coincident stacking of Ba atoms, exhibiting Dirac fermion behavior. On the other hand, SrMnSb 2 has a <b>staggered</b> <b>stacking</b> of Sr atoms with distorted zig-zag chains of Sb atoms. Application of hydrostatic {{pressure on the}} latter induces a structural change from a staggered to a coincident arrangement of AE ions accompanying a transition from insulator to a metal containing Dirac fermions. The structural investigations show that the stacking type of cation and orthorhombic distortion of Sb layers are the main factors to decide the crystal symmetry of the material. We propose that the Dirac fermions {{can be obtained by}} controlling the size of cation and the volume of AEMnSb(2) compounds. close 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{research}} work proposed here aims at studying, from the experimental and numerical standpoints, {{the damage and}} failure mechanisms of heterogeneous laminates containing discontinuous plies. To this end, a fully customizable finite element model has been developed, where bilinear cohesive zone elements are placed at the interfaces between each elementary unidirectional composite patch constituting the plies. Damage and failure mechanisms are observed by performing multi-instrumented mechanical tests (acoustic emission, edge micrographs, stereo-image correlation). Simulations and experimental studies revealed ply cuts as initiators of delamination cracks. Moreover {{the role of a}} geometric parameter (the minimum length between cuts l s over the ply thickness t d) on failure mode has been investigated in the simple configuration of a perfectly <b>staggered</b> <b>stacking</b> made of unidirectional cut plies.

The X-ray diffraction pattern of Pβ′ (mst) displays several reflections {{in the range}} from 1 / 25 to 1 / 2. 8 nm− 1, which can all be indexed on a two-dimensional monoclinic lattice (space group p 2) with a= 26. 2, b= 8. 63 nm and γ= 107 °. In contrast to the stable ripple phase, which shows a sawtooth like surface profile and an almost constant bilayer thickness, the electron density map of the metastable ripple phase shows an almost symmetric surface profile with a modulation length of 26. 2 nm. The lipid bilayer thickness varies from 3. 9 to 4. 4 nm, which most likely arises from a continuous periodic change of the tilt of the chains to the surface normal of between 30 and 40 degrees.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{superstructure}} ordering in the “ chain " layers of Ga (Co) substituted YBCO intergrowths with general formula (REO 2) NSr 2 MCu 2 O 5 (M = Co, Ga; n = 1, 2, [...] .) is proposed. By Ga or Co substitution for Cu, {{the structure of}} the “ chain" layer changes : instead of the CuO 4 planar squares, the chains consist of MO 4 tetrahedra (M = Ga, Co) running along the [110] perovskite direction. The existing model for the Ga substituted “ 123 " implies that all the chains are the same. Our new model is {{based on the results of}} Electron diffraction and High-resolution electron microscopy investigations. The model reveals the occurrence of two types of chains as a consequence of “opposite" R ordering between neighbouring tetrahedra. The corner linked tetrahedra in each chain appear as alternatingly rotated in opposite sense, and a chain itself, as being displaced with respect to the underlying structure in one of two senses; either forth (right) or back (left) along the chain direction. The regular alternation of chains of opposite type doubles the periodicity within a layer and induces the possibility for intrinsic disorder in the chain layer stacking sequence. The planar superstructure and a <b>staggered</b> <b>stacking</b> of the tetrahedral chain layers is found irrespective of the rest of the intergrowth structure.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} crystal {{symmetry}} and charge stripe order in Pr 1. 67 Sr 0. 33 NiO 4 and Nd 1. 67 Sr 0. 33 NiO 4 {{has been studied}} by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction. In contrast to tetragonal La 1. 67 Sr 0. 33 NiO 4, these crystals are orthorhombic. The corresponding distortion of the NiO 2 planes is found to dictate {{the direction of the}} charge stripes, similar to the case of diagonal spin stripes in the insulating phase of La 2 -xSrxCuO 4. In particular, diagonal stripes seem to always run along the short a-axis, which is the direction of the octahedral tilt axis. In contrast, no influence of the crystal symmetry on the charge stripe ordering temperature itself was observed, with T_CO 240 K for La, Pr, and Nd. The coupling between lattice and stripe degrees of freedom allows one to produce macroscopic samples with unidirectional stripe order. In samples with stoichiometric oxygen content and a hole concentration of exactly 1 / 3, charge stripes exhibit a <b>staggered</b> <b>stacking</b> order with a period of three NiO 2 layers, previously only observed with electron microscopy in domains of mesoscopic dimensions. Remarkably, this stacking order starts to melt about 40 K below T_CO. The melting process can be described by mixing the ground state, which has a 3 -layer stacking period, with an increasing volume fraction with a 2 -layer stacking period.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the versatile synthesis and self-organization of C 3 -symmetric discotic nanographene molecules {{as well as}} their potential applications as materials in molecular electronics. The details can be described as follows: 1) A novel synthetic strategy towards properly designed C 3 symmetric 1, 3, 5 -tris- 2 ’arylbenzene precursors has been developed. After the final planarization by treatment with FeCl 3 under mild conditions, for the first time, it became possible to access a variety of new C 3 -symmetric hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) and a series of triangle-shaped nanographenes. D 3 symmetric HBC with three alkyl substituents and C 2 symmetric HBC with two alkyl substituents were synthesized and found to show the surprising decrease of isotropic points., the self-assembly at the liquid-solid interface displayed a unique zigzag and flower patterns. 2) Triangle-shaped discotics revealed a unique self-assembly behavior in solution, solid state {{as well as at the}} solution-substrate interface. A mesophase stability over the broad temperature range with helical supramoelcular arrangement were observed in the bulk state. The honeycomb pattern as the result of novel self-assembly was presented. Triangle-shaped discotics with swallow alkyl tails were fabricated into photovoltaic devices, the supramolecular arrangement upon thermal treatment was found to play a key role in the improvement of solar efficiency. 3) A novel class of C 3 symmetric HBCs with alternating polar/apolar substituents was synthesized. Their peculiar self-assembly in solution, in the bulk and on the surface were investigated by NMR techniques, X-ray diffraction as well as different electron microscope techniques. 4) A novel concept for manipulating the intracolumnar stacking of discotics and thus for controlling the helical pitch was presented. A unique <b>staggered</b> <b>stacking</b> in the column was achieved for the first time.

40|$|International audienceThe {{nature of}} {{interactions}} between face-to-face <b>staggered</b> <b>stacked</b> quinoid rings with pi-systems, observed {{with a short}} inter-ring centroid. centroid distance, is analyzed by experimental and theoretical methods. Charge density studies based on X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations, complemented by impedance spectroscopy, were employed to define the electronic and structural characteristics of the quinoid rings responsible for their interactions within the crystal packing. The crystal packing is mainly stabilized by strong electrostatic interactions between the K+ cation and the hydrogen chloranilate anion. The proximity and orientation of the stacked quinoid rings in parallel glide-plane arrangement are partly governed by the non-covalent interactions within the dimer. The estimated contribution of dispersion energy to the stacking of the rings about 10 kcal mol(- 1), as calculated by DFT methods, is comparable to medium-strong hydrogen bonding. The electronic structure of 3, 6 -dichloro- 2, 5 -dihydroxyquinone monoanion exhibits alternating electron-rich and electron-poor regions. The calculated electrostatic energy shows variations with the relative orientation of rings within dimers reaching ca. 10 - 15 kcal mol(- 1). Thus, the nature of interactions between pi-systems of quinoid rings can be described by a polar/pi model where electrostatic complementarity plays a determinant role in pi-stacking orientation. These interactions have great potential in crystal engineering and may be employed {{in the design of}} functional materials...|$|R

40|$|The quasi-two-dimensional nickelate La 4 Ni 3 O 8 (La- 438) is an anion {{deficient}} n= 3 Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phase {{that consists}} of trilayer networks of square planar Ni ions, formally assigned as Ni 1 + and Ni 2 + in a 2 : 1 ratio. While previous studies on polycrystalline samples have identified a 105 K phase transition with a pronounced electronic and magnetic response but weak lattice character, no consensus {{on the origin of}} this transition has been reached. Here we show using synchrotron x-ray diffraction on high-pO 2 floating-zone grown single crystals that this transition is driven by a real space ordering of charge into a quasi- 2 D charge stripe ground state. The charge stripe superlattice propagation vector, q=(2 / 3, 0, 1), corresponds with that found in the related 1 / 3 -hole doped single layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate, La 5 / 3 Sr 1 / 3 NiO 4 (LSNO- 1 / 3, Ni 2. 33 +) with orientation at 45 -degrees to the Ni-O bonds. Like LSNO- 1 / 3, the charge stripes in La- 438 are weakly correlated along the c axis to form a <b>staggered</b> ABAB <b>stacking</b> that minimizes the Coulomb repulsion among the stripes.

40|$|The self-assembling {{behaviour}} of 2. 6 nm thin PbCO 3 nanoplatelets with discorectangular {{shape and}} uniform {{width and thickness}} occurring after their formation in nonionic water-in-oil microemulsions has been investigated using synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S) TEM). The presence of attractive depletion forces originating from the ubiquitous microemulsion droplets triggers {{a new type of}} superstructure at low particle concentration. Instead of the universally observed formation of face-to-face assembled lamellar mesostructures, the nanosheets self-organise into extended ribbon structures, whereby each on top lying sheet is displaced by a constant shift in the length and width directions leading to a so far unprecedented <b>staggered</b> zigzag-type <b>stack</b> assembly with restricted height. This type of stacking gives rise to a complex interference pattern in the isotropic small angle scattering of the stacked ribbon assemblies (SRAs) in reverse micellar solution. Different to the, for lamellar-structured nanosheets typical, diffraction peaks at multiples of the wave vector corresponding to one particular repeat distance, the scattering peaks measured in this study are asymmetric, displaying a shoulder on their low wave vector side. The asymmetric shape of the observed face-to-face correlation peaks indicates that the SRAs do not extend in one direction only. Their scattering behaviour is analysed by expanding the Kratky–Porod structure factor for stacking plates into three dimensions. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) -STEM tilt series have complementary been acquired to retrieve three-dimensional structural information on the SRAs in the dry state and to confirm the model used for the refinement of the SAXS data...|$|R
40|$|A {{first study}} on the {{continuous}} adjoint formulation for aerodynamic optimization design of high pressure turbines based on S 2 surface governed by the Euler equations with source terms is presented. The objective function is defined as an integral function along the boundaries, and the adjoint equations and the boundary conditions are derived by introducing the adjoint variable vectors. The gradient expression of the objective function then includes only the terms related to physical shape variations. The numerical solution of the adjoint equation is conducted by a finite-difference method with the Jameson spatial scheme employing {{the first and the}} third order dissipative fluxes. A gradient-based aerodynamic optimization system is established by integrating the blade <b>stagger</b> angles, the <b>stacking</b> lines and the passage perturbation parameterization with the quasi-Newton method of Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS). The application of the continuous adjoint method is validated through a single stage high pressure turbine optimization case.

40|$|UnrestrictedProtein misfolding is {{a common}} motif {{in a number of}} human diseases, {{including}} Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and type II diabetes mellitus (TTDM). In TTDM, over 90 % of patients are found to have pancreatic amyloid deposits upon autopsy. These deposits are primarily composed of a 37 -residue human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP). Evidence suggests an association between these amyloid plaques and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Elucidating the structure of these deposits and the effects modifiers have on the misfolding pathway can help further the understanding of its toxicity and could be of use in the design of drug inhibitors for amyloid diseases. I used site-directed spin-labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to analyze spin-labeled derivatives of hIAPP to determine structural features of the peptide in its fibrillar form. Using continuous-wave EPR and four-pulse DEER coupled with computational modeling, I determined a detailed structural model of hIAPP fibrils. The N-terminal and C-terminal regions are less ordered and more mobile and there is a turn region between residues 19 - 30 located between two β-strands (13 - 18 and 31 - 36). My findings also show that the β 1 and β 2 strands from one molecule of hIAPP are staggered in relation to one another. The <b>staggered</b> peptide <b>stacks</b> directly on another staggered peptide, forming a protofilament with a twist that I aptly call a β-spiral motif. In addition to these structural findings, I have studied the effects of modifiers, such as curcumin and annexin proteins, to the misfolding of amyloid fibrils. Using EPR, ThT and EM, I found that these molecules or proteins seem to alter hIAPP, Aβ and α-synuclein fibril formation and fibril morphology. Additionally, studies of these modifiers in tissue culture and animal models showed reduced toxicity and protein aggregation.; Both the identification of hIAPP structure and the role of amyloid modifiers can give way to therapeutic intervention of amyloid diseases...|$|R
