For example, carbon nanotubes, as the <b>special</b> <b>carbon</b> nanomaterials, have been investigated for their effects on the cells, animals and environment, and evaluated for their biosafety [9 – 13]. Graphene is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional (2 D) honeycomb lattice and is a basic building block for graphitic materials of all other dimensionalities with unique physical, chemical, and mechanical properties [14, 15].
