As a result, using second-order Delta-Sigma modulator makes low switching rate compared with first-order Delta-Sigma and hysteresis modulators under same sampling frequency. So, applying this modulator increases system efficiency and reduces cost of switches.

The {{hybrid power system}} consists of a fuel cell stack connected with a diode, a lithium-ion battery pack connected with a DC/DC power converter and another diode.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{divestiture}} on the efficiency and costs of electric utilities. The empirical literature shows that there exist economies of scope for electric utilities and that divestiture decreases distribution efficiency but increases generation efficiency. This paper is to bring together these different results. Our analysis covers distribution, transmission, and <b>power</b> <b>sourcing.</b> Our data is an unbalanced panel of about 138 US electric utilities for the years 1994 to 2006 over which we observe 30 divestitures between 1997 and 2003. First, we regress firmlevel efficiencies for distribution and <b>power</b> <b>sourcing</b> on various divestiture indicators. Second, we compare the weighted cost between divested and non-divested firms and calculate a net present value {{for the entire sample}} of divestitures. Last, we regress net benefits from divestiture on the distribution side on the net benefit for <b>power</b> <b>sourcing</b> to see whether individual firms successfully off-set any costs of divestiture. We find that divestiture reduces distribution <b>efficiency</b> but increases <b>power</b> <b>sourcing</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Both effects depend on the amount of own nuclear generation output but not fossil-fuel or hydro output. The net present value for all divestitures in our sample is $ 11. 3 billion. It seems that relatively lower costs of power outweigh losses in economies of scope as well as other restructuring costs. However, lower costs of power might be the result of favourable contracts put in place at the time of divestiture. Our study complements traditional studies of economies of scope and shows that divestitures might well be worth it. Electric utilities, divestiture, economies of scope, net present value...|$|R

However, nodes in these networks are susceptible to high failure rate due to battery depletion, environmental changes and malicious destruction. Since each node operates with limited <b>sources</b> of <b>power,</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> is an important metric to be considered for designing communication schemes for MANET and WSN.

In past two decades, spectrum and <b>power</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of wireless networks are optimized separately. However, {{to increase the}} spectrum efficiency while reducing the energy consumption, {{it is necessary to}} jointly optimize spectrum and <b>power</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of wireless networks. Supporting the statistical quality of service (QoS) provisionings for real-time traffic is crucial, but imposes new challenges, in the next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to jointly optimize effective spectrum efficiency (ESE) and effective <b>power</b> <b>efficiency</b> (EPE) under different statistical QoS guarantees constraints to support the real-time traffic over wireless networks. In particular, we derive the relationship between ESE and EPE under statistical QoS provisioning constraint.

In the MB region, we propose a novel strategy to achieve the joint effective spectrum and <b>power</b> <b>efficiencies</b> optimization using the average transmit power control.
