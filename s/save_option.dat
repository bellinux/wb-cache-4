500|$|The {{player can}} {{press a button}} to have Ninten [...] "check" [...] or [...] "talk" [...] with nearby people, animals, and objects. The game shares {{similarities}} with its sequel, EarthBound: there is a game <b>save</b> <b>option</b> through using a phone to call Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money. The members of Ninten's party are all visible on the overworld screen at once, and are analogous to EarthBound party members in style and function. Mother world map does not keep locations separate, and instead connects all areas (akin to the Pokémon series games). The game's story begins as Ninten discovers a music box and receives the journal of his great-grandfather, who studied psychic powers nearly a century earlier. Ninten is attacked by household items, and ventures outside to find a crazy world with hostile everyday objects and other odd events.|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} known for its {{combination}} of humorous and emotionally evocative tones. Itoi wanted to tell Mother 3 through a technique that swapped the active player-character, which he first attempted in EarthBound. The two games also share similar visual styles, both with psychedelic battle backgrounds and cartoonish art. While Mother 3 music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects. EarthBound characters such as Mr. Saturn recur, and RPGamer wrote that Mother 3 final chapter is [...] "full of blatant links" [...] between the games of the series. Mother also shares similarities with its sequel, such as the game <b>save</b> <b>option</b> through phoning Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money. Additionally, the members of the party follow behind the protagonist on the overworld screen in the first two games. Ninten's party members in Mother are analogous to those of EarthBound in style and function.|$|E
500|$|The Jaguar {{version was}} noted by critics as having {{problems}} such as slowdown and lack of a <b>save</b> <b>option,</b> although some liked the graphics and gameplay. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the game itself is great fun, but that the Jaguar conversion had confusing menus and dithered text which is excessively difficult to read. GamePro echoed these criticisms and further stated that the Jaguar version suffers from frustrating slowdown. They summarised that [...] "Ocean didn't work hard enough to make Theme Park look and sound good on the Jaguar". A reviewer for Next Generation took the reverse position, saying that the Jaguar conversion [...] "is seamless" [...] and the game itself was mediocre. Their elaboration was that [...] "Slow gameplay and confusing layouts keep it from ever achieving the addictiveness of the other 'god' games, and most players will find themselves bored before they've even run {{through all of the}} options". German magazine Atari Insides reviewer complimented the addictiveness, but the lack of save opportunities was criticised, and a reviewer from ST Computer believed the game's complexity and colourful graphics assured it of being long and attractive. Mega Funs main criticism of the Jaguar version was its inability to save in-game.|$|E
5000|$|The SolarMESH project {{examined}} {{the potential of}} powering 802.11-based mesh networks using solar power and rechargeable batteries. Legacy 802.11 access points {{were found to be}} inadequate due to the requirement that they be continuously powered. The IEEE 802.11s standardization efforts are considering power <b>save</b> <b>options,</b> but solar-powered applications might involve single radio nodes where relay-link power saving will be inapplicable.|$|R

50|$|Killer Instinct Gold is {{compatible}} with the Nintendo 64s Controller Pak to <b>save</b> <b>options</b> and high scores, though the cartridge also includes battery save. Due to cartridge size limitations, several frames of character animation and the FMVs were removed, the later being replaced with 2d animations. Each characters multiple endings were also reduced to one ending a character; these new endings sometimes combining elements from more than one of a characters arcade endings.|$|R
50|$|A <b>save</b> <b>option</b> {{was added}} to both the {{arranged}} version and classic version.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} Master System games, R.C. Grand Prix {{does not have}} a battery <b>save</b> <b>option,</b> meaning the game cannot be saved. This also {{includes}} the final score of the game.|$|E
5000|$|Sinclair User: [...] "The music, Henry Mancini's 'March of the Baby Elephants', is cleverly done, {{but not so}} cleverly {{that you}} don't {{want to use the}} OFF option after a few minutes. As with most games of this type, my main {{complaint}} is that it's much too complicated to solve at one sitting, and there's no <b>SAVE</b> <b>option.</b> Just Gremlin Graphics being naughty, I suppose." ...|$|E
500|$|Sonic 3 & Knuckles {{allows the}} player to play Sonic 3 levels as Knuckles or Sonic & Knuckles levels as Tails or both Sonic and Tails.

5000|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of previous installments, players control new protagonist Nick Ramos in third person. Players' primary focus is to search for supplies and weapons in order to fight many undead and complete missions. Dead Rising 3 is set in a vast, open world environment which is much larger than the worlds of Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 combined. The game can render three times as many zombies on-screen at once as its predecessor. Players can save their progress anywhere, as opposed to limiting saves to toilets. The game includes a [...] "Nightmare Mode" [...] for those who would prefer the traditional time limit and <b>save</b> <b>options.</b> The game does not have load times.|$|R
50|$|Players take on {{the role}} of a warrior/adventurer in the magical, feudal world of Diurla. Play begins at the Main Hall of the Guild of Free Rogues, where the player creates a character, buys {{equipment}} and learns spells before venturing out to gain wealth and experience. Each scenario has a different goal, and typically a time limit. A <b>save</b> <b>option</b> is available, allowing the player to suspend the game and pick it up later.|$|E
50|$|Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In (released in Europe {{as simply}} Project I.G.I.) is a {{tactical}} first-person shooter video game developed by Innerloop Studios and released on December 15, 2000 by Eidos Interactive. Upon release the game received mixed reviews {{due to a}} number of shortcomings, including poorly programmed A.I., lack of a mid-game <b>save</b> <b>option,</b> and the lack of multiplayer features. However it was praised for its superb sound design and graphics, thanks in part to its use of a proprietary game engine that was previously used in Innerloop's Joint Strike Fighter.|$|E
5000|$|Computer Gaming World criticized Global Commanders {{music and}} lack of a <b>save</b> <b>option.</b> It {{concluded}} [...] "the game can be entertaining, but overall, the inconveniences may outweigh the advantages". A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two stars out of five, stating that [...] "it bears little resemblance to reality and has limited entertainment value". The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #140 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

50|$|Shien's Revenge {{is played}} from a first-person {{viewpoint}} as the player aims a cursor at enemies to either throw shurikens or slash with a kunai dagger. There are six long levels, each with scaling bosses that nearly fill the screen. A set of candles indicates the Shien's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and magic scrolls can {{be picked up}} by defeating enemies; the use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen. The game uses the SNES Mouse or a light gun as optional controllers and includes a password <b>save</b> <b>option</b> which allows players to continue their journey at a later time.|$|E
5000|$|During 1990, the Lynx had {{moderate}} sales. In July 1991, Atari Corp. {{introduced the}} Lynx II {{with a new}} marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari Corp. as the [...] "Lynx II") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power <b>save</b> <b>option</b> (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.|$|E
40|$|Regional palaeocurrent {{datasets}} {{frequently are}} stored in multiple files, whereby each file contains observations from a specific location, formation and suite of sedimentary structures. Interpretative analysis of such data often involves the graphical examination or comparison of either individual or groups of files. This task has been simplified {{by the development of}} PC 99, a Visual Basic computer programme that functions in the Microsoft Windows operating environment. PC 99 makes it possible to quickly combine the data in related files into a single “memory-resident” (memory) file. Up to 10 memory files can co-exist at any one time and these may be concurrently viewed and compared graphically using a “circular diagram” facility. Individual memory files may also be viewed as rose diagrams. The graphics generated may be saved to the Windows clipboard for export to third-party applications. PC 99 - compatible input files may be generated using a simple data-entry window and the data may be corrected for magnetic variation prior to plotting. The programme also supports a range of print and <b>save</b> <b>options...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Computer Gaming World opined {{praised the}} Amiga version's {{graphics}} but called the Commodore 64 version [...] "extremely disappointing", and criticized {{the lack of}} a <b>save</b> game <b>option</b> as [...] "extremely frustrating".

An English software patch was made for the 2.0 version by independent developers, but it was rendered obsolete when Olympus released version 2.1. This version created a new <b>save</b> folder <b>option</b> for remix cubes and made minor changes and additions to the remix function and to the program itself.|$|R
50|$|Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi follows {{closely the}} {{standard}} {{set by the}} previous two Super Star Wars games, {{with the return of}} selectable characters (on specific levels), multiple playable characters and Mode 7 quasi-3D vehicle sequences. The controls are identical to the second game, and this installment also includes its predecessor's password <b>save</b> <b>option.</b> It loosely follows the plot of Return of the Jedi, with some added scenes, such as Luke Skywalker having to fight through the Death Star to get to Emperor Palpatine. In addition to the standard Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca, Princess Leia and Wicket appear as playable characters.|$|E
5000|$|Davis Cup Tennis {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from gaming press, {{who felt that}} the game was lackluster compared to Virtua Tennis. GameSpot's Frank Provo and IGN's Craig Harris both criticized {{the lack of an}} in-game <b>save</b> <b>option</b> that you could activate during your match, with Craig Harris remarking that the design [...] "isn't exactly handheld friendly". Frank Provo felt that the larger variety of techniques found in Virtua Tennis made it [...] "the better option". GameSpy's Avi Fryman remarked on the game's averageness in comparison to its competitors, commenting [...] "... if all available copies of Virtua Tennis and Mario Tennis suddenly vaporized, there might be a reason for casual gamers to pick this one up." ...|$|E
50|$|While Tina Marie Goff {{continues}} {{her role}} as Ms. Frizzle in the software series, {{this is the first}} game of the software series to replace the original voice actors of the eight children from the television show. In this game, the user has to find all the four missing animals from the incorrect habitats and send them back to their own habitats where they each belong. Unlike the previous games, the user enters his or her name before playing the game instead of creating a file within creating a face on the Driver's License screen, and the <b>save</b> <b>option</b> was removed so the game is automatically saved when quitting the game. When traveling to certain habitats, one of the children is transformed into an animal, e.g. Arnold becomes a bull frog in the swamp.|$|E

50|$|It has a {{different}} story, but {{can be considered as}} a light version of Dungeon Master. Theron's Quest doesn't contain all of the items, spells and monsters featured in Dungeon Master. Theron's Quest contains seven small dungeons instead of one big dungeon, which however are partially identical or inspired by the original dungeons of Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back. As in the original, the player goes on a quest with a team of up to four champions fighting through dungeons gaining experience and finding items. In contrast to the original, the player takes the role of a character named Theron and three other champions. After successful completion of each dungeon, the whole party loses its collected items and the three champions lose their skills and statistics. Further, the game can only be saved between dungeons. The lack of the original <b>save</b> <b>option</b> during a level has been replaced by many resurrection 'Altars of VI'. There are also fewer monsters to fight which renders the game easier than the original.|$|E
40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track III: Energy InfrastructureThe central {{objective of}} the MU Extension Agriculture and Natural Resource Program is to improve quality of life, enhance the economic viability, and protect the environment for all Missourians through research-based education and applied research. A major focus of this effort {{is based on the}} development of a "new agricultural energy based economy' that will add value to the commodities raised and reduce the input cost for Missouri agricultural producers and agribusinesses and conserve energy consumption. Comprehensive energy educational programs and demonstrations have been delivered across the State of Missouri by University of Missouri Extension Faculty on topics such as on-farm energy conservation, wood to energy, methane generation, wind energy and solar energy considerations. Other programs include: Low-Cost/No-Cost Energy <b>Saving</b> <b>Options</b> for Home and Farm, Economics of Biomass Fuels, Alternative Fuels on the Farm (covers ethanol, biodiesel and biomass), Feeding Bio-fuel By Products, producing ethanol from various sources and Energy-Efficient Landscape Design. Examples of some of the impacts of this programmatic effort are development of a biodiesel facility with annual sales of nearly $ 100 million and a staff of 50 employees; an ethanol production facility now operational with annual sales inxcess of $ 100 million and about 45 5 employees; Irrigation scheduling that increased gross profits of irrigators in Missouri by $ 10 million a year {{and at the same time}} reduces their fuel consumption and costs.
