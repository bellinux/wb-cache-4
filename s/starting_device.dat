It appeared at the New York Auto Show in 1900. By 1901, 140 cars were made. One of its distinctive features was an automatic <b>starting</b> <b>device.</b> After producing a six-cylinder car, the company folded in 1902.|$|E

50|$|Fully {{automatic}} time (abbreviated FAT) {{is a form}} of race timing {{in which}} the clock is automatically activated by the <b>starting</b> <b>device,</b> and the finish time is either automatically recorded, or timed by analysis of a photo finish. The system is commonly used in track and field as well as horse racing, dog racing, bicycle racing, rowing and auto racing. In these fields a photo finish is used. It is also used in competitive swimming, for which the swimmers themselves record a finish time by touching a touchpad {{at the end of a}} race. In order to verify the equipment, or in case of failure, a backup system (typically manual) is usually used in addition to FAT.|$|E
50|$|To get the {{locomotive}} moving, a hand-controlled high-pressure steam valve was provided, {{by means of}} which the driver could admit a proportion of high-pressure steam into the low-pressure cylinders. Although it was intended by its designers as a <b>starting</b> <b>device</b> only, the direct steam valve was consistently misused by drivers to help them over heavy grades, {{at the expense of}} operating efficiency and of their fireman. According to the Vauclian notes, {{the locomotive}}s were to be driven on the reversing lever in such conditions, but that was clearly not a practice used by VR staff at the time. Due to the consequent high cost of maintenance, the entire class was rebuilt as simple expansion locomotives between 1912 and 1913.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1903, {{the company}} advertised their latest model, the Century Tourist for $750. The car was {{described}} as having a [...] "roomy body, with a wide and comfortable seat, an unusually long wheelbase, complete with the Century spring suspension, on four long and elastic springs." [...] The vehicle was [...] "carefully designed" [...] after {{years of experience in}} motor vehicle building and thoroughly tested for months before it was placed upon the market. It had a one-cylinder water-cooled motor of seven-horsepower which [...] "runs with little noise or vibration." [...] The company bragged that the motor [...] "can be started from the ground or seat" [...] and due to a new <b>starting</b> <b>device,</b> a [...] "back kick" [...] was now impossible. The body could be removed from the steel frame by removing eight bolts and the gasoline tank capacity was enough for a run of 175 mi. The box front was entirely designed for luggage and every part in the car was interchangeable. The transmission and power equipment was easily accessible and one level controlled two-speeds forward and reverse. The car also had two double-acting brakes and 28 in artillery wheels and 3 in detachable tires. The engine and body were all built by Century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automated Mechanical Transmission (AMT) {{is applied}} {{as a new}} <b>starting</b> <b>device</b> for belt {{conveyor}} in the paper. Simulation model of AMT driving belt conveyor is established in AMESim. Simulations of start-up process at first gear condition and shifting process from first to eighth gear are discussed. Belt velocity is accepted as the law of gearshifts to judge the moment of shifting. Simulation results show that AMT could achieve the purpose of belt conveyor’s soft-starting gradually. The belt appears short-time acceleration mutations during shifting process which results in the belt maximum tension, the driving pulley torque, and other parameters changing within their allowable limits. The belt maximum tension appears short-time mutations when the clutch is just engaged, {{in which case the}} peak value of belt maximum tension can achieve 110 KN approximately, and is less than its allowable limit.

By {{detecting the}} rotor position and inputting a variable frequent current to the stator windings, the LCI can drive the motor from standstill to a given speed. Thus, rotor position detecting method comes {{to be the key}} techniques, but at the ultra-low speed period, the motor’s terminal voltage is too low to accurately sampling and is vulnerable to the interference, which brings risks to the variable frequency driving. In this paper, through analyzing the principles of LCIs and synchronous machine, a constant frequency electrical angle control methods is introduced to solve the difficulty of detecting the rotor position in the low speed period. A 98 MW synchronous machine driven with an 18 MW LCI are experimented in MATLAB and RTDS systems, the results show that the proposed control strategy can realize soft-start of the wound-field synchronous motor without detecting rotor’s position...|$|E
40|$|Geared neutral {{transmissions}} {{still hold}} {{the promise of}} unparalleled transmission properties. The mechanism {{eliminates the need for}} a <b>starting</b> <b>device</b> and auxiliary clutches and gears for reverse. A very good launch feel without the use of a torque converter should be one of the main benefits. When combined with two clutches, resulting in a two-stage split-torque geared neutral transmission, the system can be augmented such that very high overdrive ratio's can be obtained, allowing low engine speeds at intermediate engine power levels to reduce fuel consumption. The mode shift can be carried out with a synchronised clutch. One of the main points of concern is the loading of the V-belt-type variator in and around the geared neutral point. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to address this issue in some de! tail, taking both slip and torque loss into account. Variator control and variator loading in and around the geared neutral point will be addressed...|$|E
