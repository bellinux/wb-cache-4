500|$|Jim Farber of the New York-based Daily News {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "It suffers from a {{similarly}} meandering melody and ponderous progression. The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune", but [...] "even so, the luster of Adele's tone, and the bravura arc of her vocal, makes it enjoyable enough. And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{ranked the}} song amongst the top tracks on Kiss & Tell. Mikael Wood of Billboard gave the song a {{positive}} review, stating that it [...] "has a juicy and instantly memorable vocal hook". In {{a review of}} the album, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy coined the song [...] "electro-thumping", commenting that it was [...] "as innocent as the purity ring on Gomez's finger and showcases her polished vocals perfectly." [...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's too <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune." [...] Although stating that it was very cliche, a writer for Popjustice said that the song [...] "seems like a boundary-smashing avant garde curiosity when you put it alongside most other Hollywood Records output." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked [...] "Naturally" [...] at number eighty-four on his list of [...] "Top 100 Pop Songs of 2010".|$|E

2500|$|Three {{days after}} the speech, a {{strengthening}} of the pro-Western coalition in the Lebanese general election with a loss for Hezbollah was perceived by some foreign policy analysts {{to be at least}} in part due to Obama's speech. Several others stated that the speech played only a minor role compared to domestic events such as a last-minute appeal by Lebanon's Maronite patriarch asking Christians to vote against Hezbollah. For example, Lydia Khalil of the Council on Foreign Relations commented that [...] "t is too <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what the ultimate Obama effect will be." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We do {{not suggest}} {{that the risk of}} discriminatory {{enforcement}} is insignificant here," [...] Marshall admitted, since the village had said that it had relied on the experience of its police officers and would do so in the future. But it was too <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if that would lead to constitutional issues in practice. And furthermore, it was likely that [...] "the village w take no further steps to minimize the dangers of arbitrary enforcement" [...] since it could adopt administrative regulations that could narrow or clarify the vague terms in the ordinance. In fact, Marshall wrote, the village's decision to base its enforcement on the marketing of products, rather than their design, was a better standard since it did not require analysis of each individual item, and thus was less likely to be enforced unfairly.|$|E
2500|$|Piece by Piece {{fulfilled}} the recording contract Clarkson had signed {{as part of}} winning American Idols first season in 2002 with 19 Recordings and RCA Records, making her a free agent and the first American Idol contestant to successfully complete the feat. In a report published by Billboard, it was stated that Clarkson was currently in early stages to directly sign a contract with RCA in contrast to her previous arrangement where 19 Recordings kept phonographic rights licensed to RCA. Despite RCA's advantage, Billboard argued that the Big Machine Label Group could be a serious contender following Clarkson's history with Clive Davis, RCA's former chief executive and Sony's current chief creative officer. Billboard also reported that Piece by Pieces debut {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 earned Clarkson a leverage, with one prominent talent manager saying: [...] "That's a good time to mention you're a free agent, when you have a No. 1 album." [...] Music industry analysts also divulged that compared to her previous contract with a US $500,000 (US $ adjusted for inflation) advance per album, Clarkson could receive up to US $1â€“3 million advance per album in a new term. However, Clarkson's manager, Narvel Blackstock, asserted that the probability of Clarkson re-signing with RCA was too <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> In an interview with Billboard, RCA executives Peter Edge and Tom Corson stated that Clarkson had entered negotiations for directly signing a multi-album record contract with RCA. However, on June 24, 2016, Clarkson announced she had signed a long-term worldwide deal with Atlantic Records.|$|E

60|$|Demi {{tried to}} express himself clearly, but forgot his dignity and his usual reserve {{in the sweet}} perplexity of his love, and asked his little sister to {{teach him how to}} put the {{question}} which a single word can answer. The arrival of his happy cousins had scattered all his wise plans and brave resolutions to wait still longer. The Christmas play had given him courage to hope, and the oration today had filled him with tender pride; but the sight of those blooming brides and beaming grooms was too much for him, and he panted to secure his Alice without an hour's delay. Daisy was his confidante in all things but this; a brotherly feeling of sympathy had kept him from telling her his hopes, because her own were forbidden. His mother was rather jealous of any girl he admired; but knowing that she liked Alice, he loved on and enjoyed his secret alone, meaning <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her all about it.|$|E

McKenna claimed that Price's kicks were so hard, even from as far as 60 metres away, that after marking them, he would have red marks on his chest for days.|$|R

Even when a division did not flatly refuse to fight, no orders were obeyed without preliminary discussion by the divisional committee, and if when the latter decided to obey orders it was usually too late to be of any use.|$|R
