Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around {{the world and into your}} home, the <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> your life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for morally sustainable leadership, i. e., leadership with an awareness of both light and dark sides contained {{in the role of}} the leader, as symbolized by the archetype of the king. A narrative enquiry aiming at the study of fictive stories authored by management theorists and practitioners from different contexts, interweaving collective individual elements, brings to light how issues of leadership goodness are related to each other and to other themes. The stories are presented as archetypical tales, that is, <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> profound aspects of culture and the psyche. They reveal what happens when people are asked to imagine a good manager, and how this results in tragic ironic representations, rather than tales of straightforward goodness. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to learn about the {{cultural}} adaptation experiences of immigrants to rural Newfoundland and what, if any, changes the communities themselves have made. I am particularly interested in what role communication plays in these change processes. To investigate this topic I conducted interviews and focus groups with both immigrants and native-born Newfoundlanders in rural areas and then analyzed the resulting data with a rigorous thematic analysis. 	To accomplish this purpose, I recruited and interviewed eight immigrants and 10 native-born Newfoundlanders in rural areas of the province. Then I conducted three focus groups with each of the two populations. In speaking to these 55 participants, I explored the substance and nature of their cultural adaptation and the communication that is helping and hindering it. The results reveal multiple dimensions that characterize the experience of immigrants to rural Newfoundland: struggle and loss; attributions of difference; interaction and connection; and responsibility to change. 	In addition, participants reported tangible ways in which communication can help or hinder immigrant adaptation or community building, which resulted in six communicative approach themes: “leaving be,” “differentiating,” “acknowledging,” “opening,” “resisting,” and “bridging. ” These approaches vary in what I call their mindful engagement with difference, and represent the power and potential of communication to both reflect and build who a community is and what it wants to be. 	Finally, results from this study point to the subtle ways immigration is affecting rural Newfoundland. Local people are getting more exposure to different cultures, immigrants are forming small ethnic groups in some communities, and locals are taking steps to address the needs of newcomers to their towns. In addition, results suggest that other non-immigration related changes in rural Newfoundland also influence the immigrant experience. 	This investigation contributes to current scholarship by offering an in-depth look into the rarely studied area of rural immigration. It also offers specific communicative approaches that reflect and construct immigrant adaptation experience and community building. In addition, this qualitative work supplements significant quantitative research by adding rich, contextualized <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> on issues of loss, culture, identity, and change.

40|$|This project {{represents}} {{the intersection of}} two of the biggest influences in my life story thus far: my Christian faith, and my older brother’s life and death. In the ten years since his motorcycle accident, writing {{has been one of the}} biggest ways for me to process my grief. By transferring my memories of the two of us from early childhood to young adulthood onto paper, I mark them as both important and permanent, rather than letting them fade with time. The first section tells about my background in writing and studying memoir. Sections two and three consist of my analysis of two spiritual memoirs that revolve around the death of a loved one. I examined Stations of the Heart: Parting with a Son by Richard Lischer, and Touching the Edge: A Mother’s Spiritual Path from Loss to Life, by Margaret Wurtele. Piece by piece I reflected on each author’s use of rhetorical tools and liturgical elements to shape a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> the reader’s heart and spirit. In section four, I discuss how I use my findings to build my own work. The fifth section is my personal spiritual memoir. I constructed my story following the order of worship commonly found in the Presbyterian Church (U. S. A.), including elements such as confession, scripture and song. The story highlights my faith journey in the shadow of my brother’s death as I strive to paint a picture of an admirable young man who lived a full life in twenty short years, and to honor him and memorialize his life for those he left behind...|$|R

5000|$|... "The Bridal Party" [...] is Fitzgerald's first <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> on the {{dramatic}} {{effects of such}} a devastating event as the stock market crash. Though other themes are evident throughout the story, such as the effects of wealth on society, and excessive parties set in the roaring twenties, the relationship between Mr. Curly and his ex, Caroline can easily {{be compared to the}} stock market crash. The news of her engagement delivers a sudden grim reality to Michael, much like the Great Depression itself. It is assumed that Michael and his ex-girlfriend had a great relationship before their separation, but the reader finds that he [...] "lost her slowly, tragically, uselessly, because he had no money." [...] This must have been how stock traders on Wall Street felt as they watched the value of stocks decline and tried to sell them in a panic on Black Thursday, October 24, 1929. When he discovers that she is going to marry another, richer, man he pessimistically thought, [...] "I will never be happy at all any more." [...] It is obvious that he is overreacting to horrible news and {{did not know what to}} think about the situation. Even Michael's view of Caroline's appearance as [...] "strained and tired—shadows under her eyes" [...] is reminiscent of Dorothea Lange's documentary photographs from the Great Depression. Her subjects, like those seen in Migrant Mother, are abandoned and desperate with little hope in their faces. Caroline later says that she feels sorry for the way they were, but she was over him, and he should move on as well. His depression was intensified by feelings of inadequacy, due to a lack of money. Seeing his ex with another man only made his misery worse. His situation is similar to that of Americans during that time because neither had experienced such widespread economic failure.|$|R

[...] Indeed, Sullivan's scripts detailed locations, the number of actors, costumes, and even the blocking of the shoot. [...] Norman pointed to the following excerpt from the Hell's Hinges script {{as an example of the}} directorial detail contained in Sullivan's work:"SCENE L: Close-Up on Bar in Western SaloonA group of good western types of the earlier period are drinking at the bar and talking idly -- much good fellowship prevails and every man feels at ease with his neighbor -- one of them glances off the picture and the smile fades from his face to be replaced by the strained look of worry -- the others notice the change and follow his gaze -- their face reflect his own emotions -- be sure to get over a good contrast between the easy good nature that had prevailed and the unnatural, strained silence that follows -- as they look, cut."Once Sullivan's scripts were completed, Thomas Ince would stamp them [...] "Produce exactly as written," [...] leaving little to the discretion of the directors and cameramen.
