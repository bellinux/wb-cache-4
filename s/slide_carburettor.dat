50|$|The {{beauty of}} the SU lies in its {{simplicity}} and lack of multiple jets and ease of adjustment. Adjustment is accomplished by altering the starting position of the jet relative to the needle on a fine screw (26TPI for most pre-HIF versions). At first sight, the principle appears to bear a similarity {{to that of the}} <b>slide</b> <b>carburettor,</b> which was previously used on many motorcycles. The <b>slide</b> <b>carburettor</b> has the same piston and main needle as an SU carburettor, however the piston/needle position is directly actuated by a physical connection to the throttle cable rather than indirectly by venturi airflow as with an SU carburettor. This piston actuation difference is the significant distinction between a slide and an SU carburettor. The piston in a <b>slide</b> <b>carburettor</b> is controlled by the operator's demands rather than the demands of the engine. This means that the metering of the fuel can be inaccurate unless the vehicle is travelling at a constant speed at a constant throttle setting - conditions rarely encountered except on motorways. This inaccuracy results in fuel waste, particularly as the carburettor must be set slightly rich to avoid a lean condition (which can cause engine damage). For this reason Japanese motorcycle manufacturers ceased to fit slide carbs and substituted constant-depression carbs, which are essentially miniature SUs. It is also possible - indeed, easy - to retrofit an SU carburettor to a bike that was originally manufactured with a <b>slide</b> <b>carburettor,</b> and obtain improved fuel economy and more tractable low-speed behaviour.|$|E
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle <b>slide</b> <b>carburettor.</b> Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E
50|$|The main {{carburettor}} types {{commonly associated}} with Amal are <b>slide</b> <b>carburettors</b> for motorcycles. These were historically distinguishable as two types: the Monobloc with integral, offset float chamber and Concentric, a later development with repositioned float chamber directly under the body and air-slide.|$|R
50|$|The RS250 was {{designed}} by Aprilia to resemble their GP250 bike to celebrate their success in the championship. The Aprilia RS250 {{is powered by a}} modified Suzuki RGV250 (VJ22) engine which is prepared by Aprilia, changes include a revised ECU, Aprilia-designed expansion chambers, barrels and airbox. The twin 34 mm flat <b>slide</b> Mikuni <b>carburettors</b> are retained from the RGV.|$|R
5000|$|The Triumph Thunderbird 900 is a British {{motorcycle}} {{that was}} manufactured between 1995 and 2004 by Triumph Motorcycles at the Hinckley factory. Launched in 1995, the Triumph Thunderbird 900 was styled {{to create the}} impression of an air-cooled triple combustion chamber although the radiator up front shows it is clearly a liquid-cooled machine. Fed by three 36 mm flat <b>slide</b> <b>carburettors,</b> the engine was lively and could cope easily with all riding styles. The swinging arm was upgraded to an oval section in 1996; in 1997 chromed plastic radiator end covers and grill were provided as standard along with chromed engine cases. In 1998 a 'king and queen' seat was added as an option, Several variants were produced, namely the Triumph Legend TT, Triumph Adventurer 900 and the Triumph Thunderbird 900 [...] "classic" [...] and then the Triumph Thunderbird Sport, which produced , had a second front disc added, and a six-speed gearbox. Engines are the same 885cc triples. The Thunderbird was produced until 2003 and the Thunderbird Sport until 2004.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{featured}} Heron heads, {{which were}} milled flat and the combustion chamber is recessed in the piston crown, aiding combustion and returning excellent fuel economy. A fuel consumption test by Motorcycling Monthly at Britain's Motor Industry Research Association in 1976 returned {{a performance of}} 65 mpgimp while a 3Â½ bike carried rider and pillion passenger. The engine also incorporated one piece forged steel crankshaft, ball main bearings (first series motors), plain big end bearings (second series motors), and the conrods run on a common pin, desaxe, and offsetting the rear cylinder to the front by 50 mm. Front and rear barrels and heads are interchangeable. VBH Dell'Orto (25 mm VHB 25 BS) square <b>slide</b> <b>carburettors</b> were fitted to the 350, with air fed via air-box with two filters. Bore and stroke was 62 x 57 mm, respectively. The camshaft was driven by a small toothed belt, and was a revolutionary advance. They also included an electronic capacitor discharge ignition system designed by Ducati Elettronica. Early models had kick-start only but later ones also included a starter motor using three centrifugal friction shoes engaging the alternator rotor cover. The CDI ignition was powered by a coil in the alternator and using the kick-start a bike could be started and ridden with a flat battery.|$|R
