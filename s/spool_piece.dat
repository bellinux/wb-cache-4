40|$|AbstractMaterial {{properties}} of Zr 2. 5 wt% Nb pressure tube change during reactor operation {{due to the}} surrounding environmental conditions. Measurement of mechanical {{properties of}} the pressure tubes is important for assessing their fitness for service. As it is required to remove a pressure tube from service to prepare specimens for doing the property measurement in laboratory, any in-situ technique has great significance. Considering this, an In-situ Property Measurement System (IProMS) based on cyclic ball indentation technique has been designed and developed in house. For qualification of IProMS a number of experimental trials have been carried out.

40|$|During {{the first}} three LHC {{synchronization}} tests on August 10, August 24, and September 7, 2008, linear and higher-order polarity checks were performed with beam 1 in Sector 23 and beam 2 in Sector 78. The main principle of these checks was to launch free betatron oscillations and use the difference trajectory measurements with respect to inverted polarities of circuits under investigation. In the case of zero nominal strength for a circuit, a finite value was introduced. The magnet circuits subjected to these tests were the QT and QTL trim quadrupoles, the MQS skew quadrupoles, the SF and SD arc sextupole circuits, the MCS b 3 <b>spool</b> <b>pieces,</b> the OD and OF Landau octupoles, and the MSS skew sextupoles. For some of these circuits sensitivity was enhanced by introducing large momentum offsets. To detect and remove improve spurious contributions from initially off-center orbits, four sets of trajectories were recorded, namely with and without oscillation, and with two magnet strength settings, respectively. We report on the measurements and their results. In particular we demonstrate that low-intensity single-pass measurements are sensitive enough to detect the sign and the amplitude of b 3 <b>spool</b> <b>pieces,</b> lattice sextupoles, skew sextuples, and Landau octupoles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{radiological}} engineering services for the design of special contamination containments. These containments were to be used during the replacement of leaking and damaged gaskets on the glove boxes in Technical Area- 55 (TA- 55). The damaged gaskets involved 18 windows and 5 interconnecting <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> in fuel processing glove boxes. The work scope included the design and manufacture of special contamination containment enclosures (containments), the preparation of procedures and tool lists to support gasket replacement while using the containments, and the training of appropriate TA- 55 personnel in the proper installation, operation and removal of the containments. It was originally anticipated that two basic containment designs would be required, one for the windows and one for <b>spool</b> <b>pieces.</b> Upon examination of the glove boxes it was evident that the individual space envelopes and interferences associated with each glove box would require uniquely designed containments for effective gasket replacement. This resulted in 13 individual containment designs that accommodated the interferences and allowed gasket replacement within the containment. Successful use of the containments for glove box gasket replacement was a significant accomplishment. The operation has proven that a properly managed containment program can enhance routine maintenance of the glove boxes while preventing a contamination release. The ability to perform these operations in containments reduces costs by preventing a contaminant release and eliminating the associated cleanup expenses, reduced radioactive waste and fuel processing down time...|$|R

GEOMETRY OF THE DIPOLE The theoretical geometry of the dipole is shown in figure 1, and a table of some of the important parameters are given in table 1. The (x,y) plane is the plane of the accelerator. The two theoretical beam-trajectories (the two bent curves in figure 1) consist of an arc of a circle with the angle Θ and the radius ρ and of straight lines between magnets. The 3 dimensional measurements of the centre of the two cold bore tubes are fitted to the two theoretical curves.

Parametric tests to map the ignition delay characteristics of Jet-A fuel were conducted at pressures of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 atm, inlet air temperatures up to 900 K and fuel-air equivalence ratios of 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7, and 1. 0. Residence times in the range of 1 to 50 msec were obtained by interchanging <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> to create six different mixer/vaporizer lengths (6, 23, 53, 84, 99, and 130 cm) and by testing at two different airflow rates (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg/sec).

40|$|For {{a second}} year in a row dynamic {{aperture}} experiments have been performed at the LHC. These studies have been carried out by two teams following alternative techniques: On Beam 1 a novel approach has been tested which heats the beam until the emittance becomes large, and derives the dynamic aperture from beam losses assuming an inverse logarithm model for the time-dependence of the intensity. On Beam 2, the traditional approach of sampling the dynamic aperture with large amplitude kicks has been pursued [1]. In 2011, considerable progress was made and impressive results have been reported.

The presence of combustor emissions in the duct is proposed as the primary mechanism producing the attenuation and dispersion of combustion noise propagating in an operating liquid fuel combustion system. First, a complex mathematical model for calculating attenuation and dispersion taking into account mass transfer, heat transfer, and viscosity effects due to the presence of liquid fuel droplets or solid soot particles is discussed. Next, a simpler single parameter model for calculating pressure auto-spectra and cross-spectra which takes into account dispersion and attenuation due to heat transfer between solid soot particles and air is developed.

40|$|The LHC magnet axes are {{measured}} from {{both ends of}} the magnet. These two redundant measurements are combined to get a reliable measurement result and to compensate calibration errors. When the two measurements are put together, we observe a "saw tooth" effect {{due to the fact that}} the two measurements are, in general, not identical. It can be seen that this effect is larger than expected from the accuracy of the measurements which motivated the study. Effects of temperature gradients in the cold bore tube of the magnet during measurements have been observed [6] and we show that this effect is the most probable explanation for our observations of the geometry measurements in the vertical plane. The aim of this work is to present an algorithmic approach to filter this effect and improve the measurement results. The effect is relatively small but for some magnets the displacement is up to - 0. 3 mm. The magnet positioning is controlled to 0. 1 mm.

40|$|Operation of the Tevatron {{at lower}} temperatures, {{for the purpose}} of {{allowing}} higher energies, has resulted in a renewed interest in thermal modeling of the magnet strings. Static heat load and AC loses in the superconducting coils are initially transported through subcooled liquid helium. Heat exchange between the subcooled liquid and a counter flowing two-phase stream transfers the load to the latent heat. Stratification of the two-phase helium stream has resulted in considerably less heat exchange compared to the original design. <b>Spool</b> <b>pieces</b> have virtually no heat transfer to the two-phase resulting in a ''warm'' dipole just downstream. A model of the magnet string thermal behavior has been developed. The model has been used to identify temperature profiles within magnet strings. The temperature profiles are being used in conjunction with initial magnet quench performance data to predict the location of quench limiting magnets within the Tevatron. During thermal cycles of magnet strings, the model is being used to ''shuffle'' magnets within the magnet string in order to better match the magnets quench performance with its actual predicted temperature. The motivation for this analysis is to raise the operating energy of the Tevatron using a minimal number of magnets from the spares pool...|$|R
