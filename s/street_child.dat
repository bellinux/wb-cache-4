40|$|Africa {{currently}} has {{tens of millions}} of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> roaming its city streets, {{making it one of the}} leading regions in the world for children who have made the streets their home. Because of the exponential increase in <b>street</b> <b>children</b> over the past decade, the topic of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> has gained uncharted momentum in the world of academia. Until recently, academics have perpetuated the myth of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> as passive helpless beings. However, after fourteen months of observation and research with <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in Abidjan, C?te d’Ivoire, I have found them to be far from passive. They are resilient and active participants in their culture, using their environment to forge an autonomous society of their own. <b>Street</b> <b>children,</b> usually ranging from six to eighteen years of age, traverse urban spaces creating a culture of their own constructed of social hierarchies, a unique language, music and dance, games, and occupations. In this dissertation, I use music to construct an ethnography that acknowledges and focuses on the streetism (<b>street</b> culture) of <b>children</b> in Abidjan, C?te d’Ivoire. This work focuses on the role of music in the lives of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in Abidjan, C?te d’Ivoire, which will hopefully alter the presumption of helplessness often assumed for children. This perspective offers a vantage that articulates the resilience of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> communities and their agency as individuals. Although the situation is undesirable, I believe <b>street</b> <b>children</b> have forged a lifestyle more suitable than what exists in their homes. However, it is only after immersion in their communities, observing them, and asking questions, that we can determine the culturally specific needs of <b>street</b> <b>children.</b> Therefore, through the aforementioned methods, I attempt to answer the following questions using the motifs of resilience, identity, memory, and community: What is the function and role of music in the lives of <b>street</b> <b>children?</b> Without a home and family, as conceived in the Euro-American context, how do <b>street</b> <b>children</b> identify themselves? What might music and performance tell us about the lives of <b>street</b> <b>children?</b> Do <b>street</b> <b>children</b> need to be saved? And, what do <b>street</b> <b>children</b> communities tell us about Ivorian identity and nationalism...|$|R

50|$|<b>Street</b> <b>children</b> in Latin America {{generally}} {{fall into}} two categories: home-based and street-based. Children “on the streets” are home-based; they work on the street during the day but have homes and families that they return to at night. Children “of the street” are street-based; they spend all of their time {{on the streets and}} do not have homes or contact with their families. In Latin America, <b>street</b> <b>children</b> are commonplace, everyday presences. They are street vendors, street workers, and street entertainers, as well as beggars and thieves. Although <b>street</b> <b>children</b> may occasionally prostitute themselves, child prostitutes and victims of human trafficking are not generally considered <b>street</b> <b>children.</b> There is no clear consensus on how many <b>street</b> <b>children</b> exist in Latin America, mainly because of the difficulties in identifying and defining <b>street</b> <b>children.</b> Some studies claim that as many as 45% of children in Latin America are <b>street</b> <b>children,</b> 75-90% of whom are home-based.

40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} <b>street</b> <b>children</b> {{are victims of}} {{socioeconomic}} development policy. As {{a consequence of the}} <b>street</b> life experience, <b>children</b> are labeled as <b>street</b> <b>children</b> by society and their way of their life is different from ordinary children, thus pushing them to become marginalized people. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the <b>Street</b> <b>Children</b> phenomenon, and especially to study the relationship between their life history and personal networks on the street. The focus is to explain why <b>street</b> <b>children</b> are pushed into becoming marginal people. To do this, I conducted personal interviews with two <b>street</b> <b>children</b> and seven people related to them in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The main findings were: (1) The life histories of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> show that their lives are related to a special group, especially in non-kin relationships. (2) The core of their networks consists of friends who are fellow <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in the close zone who can help them to survive on the street; these close zone people are non-kin. (3) <b>Street</b> <b>children</b> survive by themselves and know that their lives are different from others, so they need space for activities and want to isolate themselves from others to protect their lives. They lose the loose zone network which provides support such as new opportunities and information to raise their socio-economic status. (4) <b>Street</b> <b>children</b> have weak status in society because the <b>street</b> <b>children</b> network domains are constricted, and most network agents do not support them to re-enter mainstream society, but rather, push them to become marginal people. From these results, it is suggested that the government and third sector parties (including NGOs) should focus more on <b>street</b> <b>children</b> support networks to solve the <b>street</b> <b>children</b> problem...|$|R
