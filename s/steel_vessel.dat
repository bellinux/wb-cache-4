5|$|Crusader {{was built}} by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest {{all-welded}} <b>steel</b> <b>vessel</b> to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her final price of Â£124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E

25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a <b>steel</b> <b>vessel</b> that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.|$|E

2500|$|Grand Trunk's river ferry {{service on}} the Detroit River {{connecting}} Detroit and Windsor, Ontario was also inherited from its 1882 purchase of the Great Western Railway. [...] Great Western's ferry service began after its rails reached Windsor in 1853. Because Great Western's track gauge of [...] {{was different from the}} standard American gauge of [...] it had to transfer its cargo off railcars and onto the ships. By the 1860s Great Western made its railway dual gauge by adding a third rail to it tracks to accommodate rail cars of both gauges. Its first side-wheel steam ferry the Great Western arrived in 1866 and {{at the time it was}} launched was the largest <b>steel</b> <b>vessel</b> on the Great Lakes. [...] The Wabash Railroad contracted with Grand Trunk in 1897 to use its ferry service to connect Wabash's own route from Detroit through Southwest Ontario to Buffalo, New York. Wabash started its own service after 1910 when it acquired Michigan Central's ferries when that railroad opened the Detroit River Tunnel. Eventually GTW's parent CN took over sole responsibility for ferry operations on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. The Detroit River ferry operation ceased running in 1975 when GTW was granted trackage rights to use Penn Central's [...] Detroit River Tunnel to connect with CN in Windsor. The start of construction of the Renaissance Center in Detroit in 1973 necessitated the removal of GTW's Detroit ferry slip docks.|$|E
