5|$|During the Battle of Dunkirk, many Allied {{ships were}} lost to Ju 87 attacks as the British Operation Dynamo sought to {{evacuate}} British and French armies from the pocket. The French destroyer Adroit was sunk on 21 May 1940, {{followed by the}} paddle steamer Crested Eagle on 28 May. The French Channel-steamer Côte d'Arzur (3,047) followed. The Ju 87s operated to maximum effectiveness when the weather allowed. RAF fighter units were held back and Allied air cover was patchy at best. On 29 May the Royal Navy destroyer H.M.S.Grenade was severely damaged by a JU 87 attack within Dunkirk's harbour, and subsequently sank. The French destroyer Mistral was crippled by bomb damage the same day. Jaguar and Verity were badly damaged while the trawlers Calvi and Polly Johnson (363 and 290 tons) disintegrated under bombardment. The merchant ship Fenella (2,376 tons) was sunk having taken on 600 soldiers. The attacks brought the evacuation to a halt for a time. The rail ships Lorina and Normannia (1,564 and 1,567 tons) were sunk also. By 29 May, the Allies had lost 31 vessels sunk and 11 damaged. On 1 June the Ju 87s sank the <b>Skipjack</b> (815 tons) while the destroyer Keith was sunk and Basilisk was crippled before being scuttled by Whitehall. Whitehall was later badly damaged and along with Ivanhoe, staggered back to Dover. Havant, commissioned for just three weeks, was sunk and in the evening the French destroyer Foudroyant sank after a mass-attack. Further victories against shipping were claimed before nightfall on 1 June. The steamer Pavon was lost while carrying 1,500 Dutch soldiers {{most of whom were}} killed. The oil tanker Niger was also destroyed. A flotilla of French minesweepers were also lost—Denis Papin (264 tons), the Le Moussaillon (380 tons) and Venus (264 tons).|$|E

25|$|Following repairs, <b>Skipjack</b> {{participated in}} {{performance}} tests on new torpedoes {{in cold water}} off the Pribilof Islands until 17 April and then headed for the Mare Island Navy Yard and overhaul. After returning to Pearl Harbor, <b>Skipjack</b> got underway for her tenth and final war patrol, conducted in the Kuril Islands area. During this patrol, she damaged an enemy auxiliary and attacked a Japanese destroyer without success. On 11 December, she returned to Midway Island and then continued on to Ulithi. She then sailed to Pearl Harbor for refit; and got underway on 1 June 1945 for New London, Connecticut, and duty training submarine school students. <b>Skipjack</b> was later sunk as a target vessel in the second atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 and was later raised and towed to Mare Island. On 11 August 1948, she was again sunk as a target {{off the coast of}} California by aircraft rockets. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 September 1948.|$|E

25|$|On 9 December, <b>Skipjack</b> (under {{the command}} of Charles L. Freeman) {{departed}} Manila on her first war patrol, with all unfinished repair work completed by her crew {{en route to the}} patrol area off the east coast of Samar. The submarine conducted two torpedo attacks during this patrol. On 25 December, in the first attack of its kind by a U.S. submarine, <b>Skipjack</b> attacked an enemy aircraft carrier and a destroyer. She followed prewar doctrine and fired three torpedoes on sonar bearings from a depth of , without success. On 3 January 1942, three torpedoes were fired at an enemy submarine, resulting in two explosions, but a sinking could not be confirmed. She refueled at Balikpapan, Borneo, on 4 January and arrived at Port Darwin, Australia, for refit on 14 January.|$|E
25|$|Following {{participation}} in performance tests for the Mark 14 torpedo, <b>Skipjack</b> sailed for her fourth war patrol on 18 July 1942, conducted along the northwest coast of Timor which she reconnoitered and photographed.

25|$|Strictly {{vegetarian}} food is rare since even vegetable {{dishes are}} flavored with the ubiquitous dashi stock, usually made with katsuobushi (dried <b>skipjack</b> tuna flakes), {{and are therefore}} pescetarian more often than carnivorous.

25|$|The {{plentiful}} oyster harvests led to {{the development}} of the <b>skipjack,</b> the state boat of Maryland, which is the only remaining working boat type in the United States still under sail power. Other characteristic Bay-area workboats include sail-powered boats such as the log canoe, the pungy, the bugeye, and the motorized Chesapeake Bay deadrise, the state boat of Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital of}} the Maldives, Malé {{is known for its}} busy fish markets. Fish is an {{integral}} part of the Maldivian diet and it is a common sight to see office workers in formal white shirts and ties on bicycles after work taking <b>skipjack</b> home to eat. Trolleys packed full of fresh tuna or <b>skipjack</b> are carted around in door to door sales. Tuna however is the most important fish, and in recent years in the Maldives the industry has become more efficient, using tuna waste and residue to be processed into fishmeal, an animal food supplement, further contributing to the economy. The tuna industry in the Maldives has been greatly helped by The State Trading Organisation which rebuilt the efficient tuna cannery plant on the island of Felivaru. The canning process typically takes four days, and the plant has the benefits of modern technology and even a laboratory for research and quality control.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all {{canned tuna}} in the UK is {{labelled}} as dolphin-safe {{because the market}} is almost exclusively <b>skipjack</b> tuna. It is thus not implicated in the dolphin by-catch problem associated with the yellowﬁn tuna of the Eastern Tropical Paciﬁc consumed in the USA. The concerns being addressed in the UK {{are different from those}} in the USA: they are preventative to ensure that tuna sold does not become unsafe for dolphins, rather than rectifying an existing environmental problem.|$|E

25|$|In some areas, a scallop dredge is used. This is a toothed bar {{attached}} to a chain bag. The dredge is towed through an oyster bed by a boat, picking up the oysters in its path. While dredges collect oysters more quickly, they heavily damage the beds, and their use is highly restricted. Until 1965, Maryland limited dredging to sailboats, and even since then motor boats can be used only on certain days of the week. These regulations prompted the development of specialized sailboats (the bugeye and later the <b>skipjack)</b> for dredging.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} contributed to {{increasing}} catches of fish include {{an increasing number of}} mechanised and motorised boats, installation of fish aggregating devices which improve the efficiency of fishing activities, and improvements in infrastructure for collecting and handling the fish catch. Of the pelagic species, <b>skipjack</b> tuna has been almost exclusively exploited. The pelagic fisheries may have considerable expansion potential, especially further from the coast, targeting species such as yellowfin. Demersal and reef species can also be exploited at higher levels. At present, development is limited by limited local facilities for storing and transporting fish.|$|E
25|$|With 36% of its {{area covered}} by forest, Tokyo has {{extensive}} growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, {{especially in the}} mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases {{in the price of}} timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Currently, most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijōjima. <b>Skipjack</b> tuna, nori, and aji are among the ocean products.|$|E

25|$|Another {{instance}} of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended {{to be part of}} the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called <b>Skipjack)</b> was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement, for example in wiretaps.|$|E
25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and <b>skipjack.</b> The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E
25|$|Keppel {{served on}} HMS Sultan in the British Mediterranean Fleet until 1878 and was then {{transferred}} as midshipman to HMS Black Prince, the world's second ship {{with an iron}} hull. He was aboard on HMS Wolverine in Sydney {{in the next year}} and was with HMS Inconstant in Asia until 1882. With the outbreak of the Mahdist War, he was moved to HMS Duke of Wellington, the Commander-in-Chief's flagship in Portsmouth, then to HMS Iris, one of the first all steel ships, until 1884. Subsequently, Keppel was promoted sub-lieutenant of HMS Invincible. He served further on HMS Hibernia and became lieutenant on HMS Alexandria in 1885. A year later, Keppel was appointed equerry and flag lieutenant to Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until 1893 and was then transferred to HMS Pearl. He was with HMY Royal George in Portsmouth until 1895, became afterwards commander and sailed with HMS <b>Skipjack</b> to Gibraltar and with the torpedo gunboat HMS Harrier to Crete in 1897.|$|E
