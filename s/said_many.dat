5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he <b>said</b> <b>many</b> Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee <b>said,</b> <b>many</b> young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|In his own 2003 thesis, Lieutenant Colonel Victor J. Bond {{said the}} 2nd Ranger Company's {{performance}} in Korea had been exemplary, {{in spite of}} racial discrimination against it. The troops, who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company, quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers. Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea, noting the company did not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also <b>said</b> <b>many</b> of the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, August 21, a US patrol of two platoons of {{infantry}} and M26 Pershing tanks {{went up the}} road toward the North Korean positions. White flags had appeared {{in front of the}} American line, and civilians in the area <b>said</b> <b>many</b> North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about , engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with thermite grenades. The patrol also found a 37mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Zakuani was a right-footed {{player who}} {{preferred}} {{being on the}} left of the field. He played on the left wing in a 4–4–2 formation with Arsenal; later he was a forward in college before converting to a winger professionally. Zakuani said he played with a style he learned at Arsenal's youth academy and that he tried to emulate the style of former winger Robert Pirès. Zakuani often sought advice from former Arsenal star Fredrik Ljungberg when they played together in Seattle. Zakuani was a quick, agile player who liked to take defenders one-on-one. While coaching him at Akron, Porter <b>said</b> <b>many</b> of Zakuani's goals came after long runs that beat multiple players.|$|E

25|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode had several laugh-out-loud moments, that he {{appreciated}} the Eye of Gulga Grymna story arc and liked the twist that Kröd's prudishness actually {{proved to be}} an asset in battle.

The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not {{completely}} aware of what other sketches would {{be included in the}} film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear). Penotti <b>said</b> <b>many</b> of the actors did not ask many questions about what else {{was going on in the}} film.|$|E

While there are some ALS ambulances in Italy, they are typically not found outside larger centers, and in many cases, where they do exist, they are frequently required to have the 'emergency' physician present to perform ICU skills, in a manner very similar to the other neighbouring countries.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} had passed and Tewodros had not {{received}} a reply, he imprisoned Cameron, together with all the British subjects in Ethiopia and various other Europeans, {{in an attempt to}} get the queen's attention. His prisoners included a missionary named Mr. Stern, who had previously published a book in Europe describing Tewodros as a barbaric, cruel, unstable usurper. When Tewodros saw this book, he became violently angry, pulled a gun on Stern, and had to be restrained from killing the missionary. Tewodros also received reports from abroad that foreign papers had quoted these European residents of Ethiopia as having <b>said</b> <b>many</b> negative things about him and his reign.|$|E

Māori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples said the extra funding would increase Māori language content and programme quality, and would ensure interviews with dead elders would be not be lost. The funding was specifically allocated to increasing community engagement with iwi stations, increasing Māori language hours and expanding {{the number of people}} the network reached. Network chairman Willie Jackson <b>said</b> <b>many</b> iwi stations were struggling, and welcomed and desperately needed the extra funding.|$|E

25|$|The arch, {{which was}} {{constructed}} between 312 and 315 AD, was dedicated by the Senate to commemorate ten years (decennalia) of Constantine's reign (306–337) and his {{victory over the}} then reigning emperor Maxentius (306–312) at the Battle of Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312, as described on its attic inscription, and officially opened on 25 July 315. Not only did the Roman senate give the arch for Constantine's victory, they also were celebratingdecennia,a series of games that happens every decade for the romans. In this occasion they also <b>said</b> <b>many</b> prayers. However, Constantine had actually entered Rome on 29 October 312, amidst great rejoicing, and the Senate then commissioned the monument.

25|$|Following the {{operations}} {{to end the}} Amirli siege, pro-government militias and volunteer fighters as well as Iraqi security forces raided Sunni villages and neighborhoods around Amirli in Salah al-Din and Kirkuk provinces. Many were villages that ISIS had passed through {{and in some cases}} used as bases for their attack on Amirli. During the raids, militiamen, volunteer fighters and Iraqi security forces looted possessions of civilians who fled fighting during the onslaught on Amirli; burned homes and businesses of the villages' Sunni residents; and used explosives and heavy equipment to destroy individual buildings or entire villages. Human Rights Watch documented the abduction of 11 men {{in the course of the}} government’s operation, but local residents <b>said</b> <b>many</b> other men of fighting age had gone missing.|$|E
25|$|Ramjet engines {{differ in}} many ways from {{traditional}} gas turbine engines, {{but most of the}} same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors). That <b>said,</b> <b>many</b> ramjet combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the combustor in the ramjet used by the RIM-8 Talos missile, which used a can-type combustor.|$|E
