60|$|Another silence, Miss Lucretia being utterly {{unable to}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> space.|$|E
60|$|Philip did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. He {{was trying}} to collect himself.|$|E
60|$|She did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, {{and when}} she spoke it was hesitatingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No more don't I. No more don't Bunce. He's {{one of them}} as 'd <b>say</b> a'most <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{plate of}} soup {{and a glass of}} wine. That's what Bunce says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} they’d ha’ done it," [...] said Mr. Burge frankly. [...] "I’ve ’ad all sorts trying to convert me; crying {{over me and}} praying over me. I {{remember}} the first dear good man that called me a lorst lamb. He didn’t <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month." ...|$|R
60|$|Jeff {{run off to}} get the water, though, {{just like}} he hadn't been <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> spiteful, <b>for</b> he's <b>a</b> raal good-hearted fellow, after all, once you get at the {{foundation}} of him.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ponsonby didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments. When {{she spoke}} some strange and curious note {{had come into}} her voice, as if a chord, long unswept and silent, had been {{suddenly}} thrilled by a passing hand.|$|E
60|$|Hilbrook did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. He broke {{a bit of}} {{fragrant}} spray {{from the}} flowering currant--which guarded the doorway on {{his side of the}} steps; Ewbert sat next the Spanish willow--and softly twisted the stem between his thumb and finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right!" [...] The {{secretary}} {{was very}} much relieved. [...] "There's no occasion to be, I can tell you, sir," [...] he whispered earnestly. [...] "Anything but that! If I didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit, it ain't because there isn't plenty to talk about. Ay, more than enough." ...|$|E
60|$|He did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while; he {{had taken}} her hand, which she no longer withdrew from him, for there was sweet {{pleasure}} in feeling his strong fingers close tremblingly over hers. He pressed his lips upon her hand, upon the soft palm and delicate wrist, his burning kisses bearing witness to the tumultuous passion, which his reverence for her was holding in check.|$|R
6000|$|Nobody's {{crazy in}} this institution. They're just feeble in their minds. Let {{me tell you}} {{something}} funny. There's about a dozen high-grade girls that set the tables in the big dining room. Sometimes when they're done ahead of time, they all sit down in chairs in a circle and talk. I sneak up to the door and listen, and I nearly die to keep from laughing. Do {{you want to know what}} they talk? It's like this. They don't say <b>a</b> word <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. And then one says, [...] "Thank God I'm not feeble-minded." [...] And all the rest nod their heads and look pleased. And then nobody <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time. After which the next girl in the circle says, [...] "Thank God I'm not feeble-minded," [...] and they nod their heads all over again. And it goes on around the circle, and they never <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> else. Now they're real feebs, ain't they? I leave it to you. I'm not that kind of a feeb, thank God.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, Wilfrid, {{your mother}} was anxious about you. She did not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> she is <b>a</b> plucky woman, and not given to {{complaining}} or grumbling, still I {{could see she was}} anxious, so I arranged with these natives to be ready to start three hours before daybreak, so as to get here just as the sun was rising." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{shook hands}} in silence; Paul {{did not wish}} to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. His brother's {{appearance}} had choked him. It was one o'clock, but he was still in his dressing-gown; with sunken, pale cheeks, save for one bright spot, and with faint, dark rims underneath his eyes. There were a pile of blue papers and some ominous-looking envelopes on the table before him, and Paul could not help noticing the intense pallor of the hand which rested upon them.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day or two beyond {{the fact that you}} are obliged to go home suddenly. I shall only say Clinton, but it will naturally be supposed that I mean both of you. If it gets out that you have gone alone, which it may do, although I shall give strict orders to the contrary, I shall of course mention that we fear that your brother got his head hurt in that football match, and that he has taken up some strange ideas and has gone off. But it is hardly likely that the matter will leak out in any way until you return, or I hear from you. I think you can make yourself quite easy on that score." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{week later}} an {{altogether}} unexpected event took place. When Mr. and Mrs. Withers were at breakfast a letter arrived from Mr. Littleton, now solicitor to the Miss Penfolds. Upon opening it {{it was found}} to contain an offer upon {{the part of the}} Miss Penfolds to settle the sum of a hundred a year for life upon Mabel, upon the condition only that the allowance would be stopped upon her marriage, unless that marriage received the approval, in writing, of the Miss Penfolds. The letter was addressed to Mr. Withers, and after reading it through he passed it to his wife without a word. She was too surprised to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, especially as Mabel was in the room, and she laid the letter beside her until breakfast was over and Mabel had gone out.|$|E
60|$|I {{own that}} my {{heart began to}} fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> I had <b>a</b> greater fear that if I {{appeared}} as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax, with means {{to get into the}} house.|$|R
60|$|Even Rinkitink, merry hearted as he was, {{found it}} hard to laugh {{in the face of this}} mighty disaster. Even the goat, {{contrary}} to its usual habit, refrained from <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> disagreeable. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> the poor boy whose home was now a wilderness, the tears came often to his eyes as he marked the ruin of his dearly loved island.|$|R
500|$|However, {{the speech}} was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> {{publicly}} <b>for</b> over <b>a</b> year afterward, {{partly because of the}} November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy and partly to not appear strident. Though more skeptical about it than most senators, McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, {{which turned out to be}} an essentially unbounded authorization for President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in the war. McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack; subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator J. William Fulbright's urging to stand behind Johnson politically. Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war; Wayne Morse, one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of [...] "very interesting, but very belated". This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyhow, {{now that}} he had turned up again and told me who he was, I began to remember. We had been kids together, don't you know. (What's this? Salmon? Oh, right ho.) So I buzzed about and did the jovial host, you know; gave him a drink and a toofer, and all that sort of thing; and talked about the dear old days and what not. And so forth, if you follow me. Then he brought the {{conversation}} round to Jill. Of course he knew Jill at the same time when he knew me, down in Worcestershire, you see. We were all pretty pally in those days, if you see what I mean. Well, this man Mason, it seems, had heard somewhere about Jill losing her money, and he wanted to know if it was true. I said absolutely. Hadn't heard any details, but Ronny had told me, and Ronny had had it from some one who had stable information and all that sort of thing. 'Dashed shame, isn't it?' I said. 'She's gone to America, you know.' 'I didn't know,' he said. 'I understood {{she was going to be}} married quite soon.' Well, of course, I told him that that was off. He didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit, then he said 'Off?' I said 'Off.' 'Did she break it off?' asked the chappie. 'Well, no,' I said. 'As a matter of fact Derek broke it off.' He said 'Oh!' (What? Oh yes, a bit of pheasant will be fine.) Where was I? Oh, yes. He said 'Oh!' Now, before this, I ought to tell you, this chappie Mason had asked me to come out and have a bit of lunch. I had told him I was lunching with Derek, and he said 'Right ho,' or words to that effect, 'Bring him along.' Derek had been out for a stroll, you see, and we were waiting for him to come in. Well, just at this point or juncture, if you know what I mean, in he came, and I said' Oh, what ho!' and introduced Wally Mason. 'Oh, do you know Underhill?' I said, or something like that. You know the sort of thing. And then...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The tongue,' saith James, 'is {{an unruly}} evil, full of deadly poison'; 'it setteth on fire {{the course of}} nature, and it is set on fire of hell' (James 2). The tongue, how much {{mischief}} will it stir {{up in a very}} little time! How many blows and wounds doth it cause! How many times doth it, as James saith, curse man! How oft is the tongue made the conveyer of that hellish poison that is in the heart, both to the dishonour of God, the hurt of its neighbours, and the utter ruin of its own soul! And do you think the Lord will sit still, as I may say, and let thy tongue run as it lists, and yet never bring you to an account for the same? No, stay. The Lord will not always keep silence, but will reprove thee, and set thy sins in order before thine eyes, O sinner. Yea, and thy tongue, together with the rest of thy members, shall be tormented for sinning. And I say, I am very confident, that though this be made light of now, yet the time is coming when many poor souls will rue the day that ever they did speak with a tongue. O, will one say, that I should so disregard my tongue! O that I, when I said so and so, had before bitten off my tongue! That I had been born without a tongue! my tongue, my tongue, a little water to cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame; even in that flame that my tongue, together with the rest of my members, by sinning, have brought me to. Poor souls now will let their tongues <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little profit, for two-pence or three-pence gain. But, O what a grief will this be at that day when they, together with their tongue, must smart for that which they by their tongues have done while they were in this world. Then, you that love your souls, look to your tongues, lest you bind yourselves down so fast to hell with the sins of your tongues, that you {{will never be able to}} get loose again to all eternity. 'For by thy words thou shalt be condemned,' if thou have not a care of thy tongue. For 'I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment' (Matt 12:36).|$|E
5000|$|When Pantaleo {{approached}} Garner {{from behind}} and attempted to handcuff him, Garner swatted his arms away, saying [...] "Don't touch me, please." [...] Pantaleo then put Garner in a chokehold—which is prohibited by NYPD regulations—from behind. Pantaleo then pulled Garner backward {{in an attempt to}} bring him to the ground; in the process, Pantaleo and Garner slammed into a glass window, which did not break. As Garner was being brought to the ground, other uniformed officers surrounded him, and Garner went to his knees and forearms and did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds. At that point, three uniformed officers and the two plainclothes officers had surrounded him. After 15 seconds, the video showed Pantaleo had removed his arm from around Garner's neck; Pantaleo then used his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk. Garner is heard saying [...] "I can't breathe" [...] eleven times while lying facedown on the sidewalk. The arrest was supervised by a female African-American NYPD sergeant, Kizzy Adoni, who did not intercede. Adoni was quoted in the original police report as stating, [...] "The perpetrator's condition did not seem serious and he did not appear to get worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> {{time they}} played for position, with the {{intentions}} of Mr. Magnet showing more and more starkly through the moves of the game. At last Theodore was lured down a side street by the sight of a huge dummy fish dangling outside a tackle and bait shop, and Mr. Magnet and Marjorie, already with a dreadful feeling of complicity, made a movement so rapid it seemed to her almost <b>a</b> bolt <b>for</b> the church tower. Whatever Mr. Magnet desired to say, and whatever elasticity his mind had once possessed with regard to it, {{there can be no doubt}} that it had now become so rigid as to be sayable only in that one precise position, and in the exact order he had determined upon. But when at last they got to that high serenity, Mr. Magnet was far too hot and far too much out of breath to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> at all <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time except an almost explosive gust or so of approbation of the scenery. [...] "Shor' breath!" [...] he said, [...] "win'ey stairs always--that 'fect on me--buful sceny--Suwy--like it always." ...|$|R

6000|$|She did not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> {{she could}} think of nothing to say, but that she had looked for seals on the reef, but had not seen any, and this would have been too shamelessly leading. That left the word to him, and he asked timidly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|All the {{delicate}} hues of the peach blossom {{went out of}} Cicely's face. That everlasting person had come up again, and now he called her Dora, and it was glorious to have her back! She {{did not have to}} <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> Ralph went rapidly on.|$|R

60|$|Licinia {{would have}} protested for {{she loved to}} deck her darling out in all the finery that, to her mind, {{rendered}} the Augusta more beautiful than a goddess, {{but there was no}} time to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> even now the Cæsar's voice was heard at the further end of the atrium.|$|R

60|$|Dorothy did not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> she {{was puzzled}} {{to know which}} of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, {{it did not matter}} so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.|$|R
60|$|Bradley {{had given}} up trying to {{understand}} when Cargill was joking and when he was in earnest. He knew this was either merciless sarcasm or the most pig-headed bigotry.
