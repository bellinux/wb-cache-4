50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal active substance is allowed onto the list of approved active substances, its specifications become a reference source of that active substance (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that active substance appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of active substances) or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference active substance, then a technical equivalence between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile. This is to check if the level of hazard posed to health and environment by the active substance from the secondary source is comparable to the initial assessed active substance.|$|E
40|$|New {{computational}} {{procedures are}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} exhaust brake <b>specific</b> mass <b>emissions</b> of each pollutant species in internal combustion (IC) engines. The procedures start from the chemical reaction of fuel with combustion air and, {{based on the measured}} exhaust raw emissions THC, CH 4, NOx, CO, O 2, CO 2, calculate the volume fractions of the compounds in the exhaust gases, including those that are not usually measured, such as water, nitrogen and hydrogen. The molecular mass of the exhaust gases is then evaluated and the brake <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> can be obtained if the exhaust flow rate and the engine power output are measured. The algorithm can also be applied to the evaluation of air/fuel ratio from measured raw volume emissions of IC engines. The new procedures take the effects of various fuel and combustion air compositions into account, with particular reference to different natural gas blends {{as well as to the}} presence of water vapor, CO 2, Ar and He in the combustion air. In the paper, the algorithms are applied to the evaluation of air-fuel ratio and brake <b>specific</b> mass <b>emissions</b> in an automotive bi-fuel Spark Ignition (SI) engine with multipoint sequential port-fuel injection. The experimental tests were carried out in a wide range of steady-state operating conditions under both gasoline and compressed natural gas operations. The <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> calculated from the new procedures are compared to those evaluated by applying Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) recommended practices and the air-fuel ratio results are compared to those obtained either from directly measured air and fuel mass flow rates or from Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor data. The sensitivity of the procedure results to the main engine working parameters, the influence of environmental conditions (in particular the effect of air humidity on NOx formation) and the experimental uncertainties are also determined...|$|R

30|$|Our model {{confirms}} earlier {{findings by}} the authors [25] that EU-based network carriers {{will be affected by}} a competitive disadvantage compared to their non-EU-based counterparts: Table  5 shows that the percentage of allowances allocated for free compared to the allowances required for the airlines’ operations remains at a significantly lower level for EU-based network carriers than for non-EU carriers.

30|$|Fourth, a more {{detailed}} analysis of selected airline groups reveals that resulting from the EU-ETS, European network carriers {{will be affected by}} a competitive disadvantage compared to non-EU airlines.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel on the combustion, unregulated gaseous emissions and particulate emissions of a diesel engine. Experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine fueled with diesel, B 20 (20 % biodiesel on volume basis), B 50, B 75 and biodiesel, under the Japanese 13 -mode test cycle. Biodiesel increases the in-cylinder pressure, shortens the ignition delay and combustion duration, and lowers the maximum heat release rate. An increase of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is also observed when using biodiesel. For brake thermal efficiency (BTE), no significant changes are found {{in most of the}} tested modes. Biodiesel increases the weighted brake <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1, 3 -butadiene, propene, ethene, benzene, but reduces the weighted brake <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> of toluene and xylene. No significant changes are observed for the ozone formation potential of these unregulated gaseous emissions among the tested fuels. Biodiesel reduces the weighted particle mass concentration (PMC) and the weighted geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles, however, significant reductions in the weighted total number concentration (TNC) are only observed when using B 75 or biodiesel. Overall, the influence of biodiesel on the investigated emissions is proportional to the biodiesel content in the tested fuels.
