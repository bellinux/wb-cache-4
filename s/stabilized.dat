5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely <b>stabilized.</b> The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly <b>stabilized,</b> it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cables on the modal and dynamic response characteristics of the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge is studied based on a calibrated three-dimensional finite element model. A hybrid-element cable system is adopted in the model {{in which all the}} eight longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cables are modeled by multi-element cable system taking into account the sag and tension effect (geometric stiffness) while other cables are modeled by single-element system. The dynamic characteristics of the bridge are then evaluated for the cases with all eight longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cables, with only fewer longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cables, and without any longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cable respectively. It is found that the longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cables greatly influence the global dynamic characteristics of the bridge: (l) The natural frequency of the first global mode of the bridge increases from 0. 141 Hz to 0. 163 Hz after installing the eight longitudinal <b>stabilizing</b> cables; (2) The <b>stabilizing</b> cables result in some global modes with strong modal interaction among the deck, lowers and cables; (3) The <b>stabilizing</b> cables participate significantly in modal motion of certain global modes, leading to the change of the modal participation factors in dynamic response evaluation...|$|R

The basic idea to obtain the parametrization of all modified repetitive controllers for non-minimum phase systems is very simple. If the repetitive controller <b>stabilizes</b> the plant, then the repetitive controller must {{be included in the}} class of all <b>stabilizing</b> controllers for the plant. The parametrization of all <b>stabilizing</b> controllers for the plant, which is not necessarily repetitive controllers, are obtained by Youla et al. and Vidyasagar. The parametrization of all <b>stabilizing</b> controllers includes a free parameter, which is stable. That is, <b>stabilizing</b> repetitive controllers for non-minimum phase systems can be designed using the free parameter in the parametrization by Youla et al. and Vidyasagar. Using this idea, we obtain the parametrization of all <b>stabilizing</b> modified repetitive controllers for non-minimum phase systems. Next, a numerical example is illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed parametrization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} a new property of computing systems called weak stabilization. Although this property is strictly weaker than the well-known property of stabilization, weak stabilization {{is superior to}} stabilization in several respects. In particular, adding delays to a system preserves the system property of weak stabilization, but does not necessarily preserve its stabilization property. Because most implementations are bound to add arbitrary delays to the systems being implemented, weakly <b>stabilizing</b> systems are much easier to implement than <b>stabilizing</b> systems. We also prove the following important result. A weakly <b>stabilizing</b> system that has {{a finite number of}} states is in fact <b>stabilizing</b> assuming that the system execution is strongly fair. Finally, we discuss an interesting method for composing several weakly <b>stabilizing</b> systems into a single weakly <b>stabilizing</b> system. ...|$|R
