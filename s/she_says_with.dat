500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> a smile to give her a little time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maidens talk ever thus," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "but when the favoured lover presses his suit, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> a sigh, her stars had decreed otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{with this}} Miss Hetty {{chose to be}} as angry {{as if it had}} been quite a cruel rebuke. [...] "I hate dancing--there--I own it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> a toss of her head.|$|E
6000|$|Not till all {{the rest}} had been discussed, did <b>she</b> <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> dropped eyelids, and a little blush, 'Is Mr. Gilbert Kendal quite strong?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>says</b> it <b>with</b> {{a kind of}} scorn--though not of Rosa--and sits brooding, looking dreamily at her.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{down at the}} baby, Angel confesses he can't {{pretend to}} be who he's not. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>she's</b> disgusted <b>with</b> him. He takes the baby and jumps through a window.|$|R
6000|$|DOLPHIN. So I should suppose. (Silence. A {{spasm of}} anguish crosses DOLPHIN'S face; then he reassumes the old Thinker's mask. AMY {{looks at him}} for a little longer, then, unable to {{suppress}} her growing curiosity, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> a sudden burst of childish confidence:) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You!' <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> a {{smile that}} {{reminded}} me of lemon sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Elle ravvole de fous, cher bedid anche!" [...] says Madame Bernstein, {{mimicking}} the Countess's German accent. The Baroness is delighted with her boy's success. [...] "You carry off {{the hearts of}} all the old women, doesn't he, Maria?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> a sneer at her niece, who quivers under the stab.|$|E
6000|$|He {{made out}} that the woman was asking him for his name--"Meester--? Meester--?" [...] <b>she</b> kept <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> a note of interrogation.|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling, you {{are always}} kind, and always right! But why couldn't <b>she</b> <b>say</b> good-bye (<b>with</b> the others) downstairs? Do you {{understand}} this curious woman?" ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not make}} any answer to the doctor--she could not. Besides, what could <b>she</b> <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> Patty's big blue eyes, bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face, looking at her so wistfully? <b>She</b> dared not <b>say</b> it was impossible. But Aunt Emma had no such scruples. With a great clatter and racket, that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements.|$|R
6000|$|Theo {{gives her}} husband a kiss. [...] "My dear, I {{wish they had}} tried," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> a sigh. [...] "I was afraid lest--lest Hetty should have led him, you see; and I think she hath the better head. But, from reading this, {{it appears that the}} new lady has taken command of poor Harry," [...] and she hands me the letter:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] {{replied the}} vicar. [...] "She {{says that she}} would think shame to take money from friends {{as long as she}} can work, because every penny that she would thus get would be so much less to go to the {{helpless}} poor; of whom, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> much truth, there are enough and to spare. And I quite agree with her as regards her principle; but it does not apply fully to her, for she cannot work so as to procure a sufficient livelihood without injury to her health." ...|$|E
60|$|The girl invites {{him to come}} to her hut in {{the forest}} and verify what <b>she</b> <b>says.</b> <b>With</b> a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads. She rises. The crowd gathers round--all are hushed to silence. THE KING, as one entranced, puts aside all who would in any way interfere. The girl precedes him, going from the Pagoda towards the night. When she reaches the great staircase, she beckons, Oriental fashion, with {{downward}} hand. The scene should, in grouping and colour, make for rare beauty.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>says</b> her {{relationship}} <b>with</b> {{her family is}} close, particularly her connection with her sister and her mother.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, Lourene Altieri has {{revealed}} {{the names of}} and channeled information {{from some of the}} other prominent beings who <b>she</b> <b>says</b> travel <b>with</b> Commander Sananda, Pallas Athena, Ashtar, and Vrillon on the saucers of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet. These include :- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. Ask for the {{youngest}} child {{when you go}} to Mrs. Gallilee's. We call her Zo. Put your finger on her spine--here, just below the neck. Press on the place--so. And, when <b>she</b> wriggles, <b>say,</b> <b>With</b> the big doctor's love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'YOU said!' {{returned}} Mr Codlin. 'Did I {{always say}} that that 'ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see? Did I always say I loved her, and doated on her? Pretty creetur, I think I hear her now. [...] "Codlin's my friend," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> a tear of gratitude a trickling down her little eye; [...] "Codlin's my friend," [...] she says--"not Short. Short's very well," [...] she says; [...] "I've no quarrel with Short; he means kind, I dare say; but Codlin," [...] she says, [...] "has the feelings for my money, though he mayn't look it."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{have you}} left poor Harry nothing, dear Marchioness?" [...] asks Lady Castlewood (she hath {{told me the}} story {{completely}} since with her quiet arch way; the most charming any woman ever had: and I set down the narrative here at length, so as to have done with it). [...] "And have you left poor Harry nothing?" [...] asks my dear lady: [...] "for you know, Henry," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> her sweet smile, [...] "I used always to pity Esau--and I think I am on his side--though papa {{tried very hard to}} convince me the other way." ...|$|E
60|$|Pietro {{is already}} married, yet he behaves {{as if he}} were not. He has been {{carrying}} on with a loose woman, the wife of the citron-coloured barber, the Siciliano. Then he seats himself on the women's side of the theatre, behind a young person from Bogliaco, who also has no reputation, and makes her talk to him. He leans forward, resting his arms on the seat before him, stretching his slender, cat-like, flexible loins. The padrona of the hotel hates him--'ein frecher Kerl,' <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> contempt, and she looks away. Her eyes hate to see him.|$|E
5000|$|Xander {{references}} {{the famous}} quote by George Mallory when arguing with Anya about her sleeping <b>with</b> Spike. When <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> slept <b>with</b> him [...] "because he was there," [...] Xander replies, [...] "What is he, Mount Everest?" [...] The original quote was when Mallory was {{asked why he}} wanted to climb Mount Everest. He replied, [...] "Because it's there." ...|$|R
50|$|The guiltive {{is a term}} {{introduced}} by John Haiman for the speaker attitude whereby the speaker overtly presents him- or herself as generous or indifferent but actually means {{the opposite of what}} he or <b>she</b> is <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> the intention of making the addressee feel guilty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not favourably enough, she {{mentioned}} to me, to wish ever {{to see her}} again. She told me you had taken a final leave of her. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> you've done <b>with</b> her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very true. If in my {{knowledge}} of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl (especially, remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney Wold) from the taint of my impending shame, I act upon a resolution I have taken. Nothing in the world, {{and no one in}} the world, could shake it or could move me." [...] This <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> great deliberation and distinctness and with no more outward passion than himself. As for him, he methodically discusses his matter of business as if she were any insensible instrument used in business.|$|E
6000|$|... "For you I have {{no doubt}} it is. I {{observed}} you in your class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her voice; I fall {{into a sort of}} dream. Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|I offer obligingly {{to bring}} {{one of them}} to her, and now she looks at me suspiciously. ‘You surely believe I like yours best,’ <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> instant anxiety, and I soothe her by assurances, and retire advising her to read on, just to see if she can find out how he misleads the public. ‘Oh, I may {{take a look at it}} again by-and-by,’ she says indifferently, but {{nevertheless}} the probability is that as the door shuts the book opens, as if by some mechanical contrivance. I remember how she read ‘Treasure Island,’ holding it close to the ribs of the fire (because she could not spare a moment to rise and light the gas), and how, when bed-time came, and we coaxed, remonstrated, scolded, she said quite fiercely, clinging to the book, ‘I dinna lay my head on a pillow this night till I see how that laddie got out of the barrel.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{introductory}} dialogue between Antigone and Ismene, Ismene tries to dissuade her sister from her resolution to bury their brother. Antigone's [...] "pursuit" [...] is, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> concerned <b>with</b> that against which nothing can avail. Antigone, in other words, takes the impossible as her point of departure. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> herself that <b>she</b> wishes to suffer or bear the uncanny. In this she {{is removed from}} all human possibilities, and is the supreme uncanny.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't go,' <b>she</b> <b>says</b> to me, <b>with</b> old Paloma nodding {{agreement}} with her. 'I'll {{show you where}} my brother got the nugget, if you don't go.' 'Too late,' said I. And I told her why.|$|R
5000|$|... "Raman Mundair is a poet with {{an irresistible}} voice - polyphonic, audacious, engaged. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> the unsayable <b>with</b> disarming eloquence and panache. Not only the ink {{on these pages}} is 'luminous'; the ideas also are."Niyi Osundare ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne Maria gives {{a minute}} {{account of the}} ride {{of the royal family}} to meet Charles on his {{approach}} to Compiegne, and of the interview with him, on her part, which attended it. She dressed herself in the morning, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> great care, and had her hair curled, which she seldom did except on very special occasions. When she entered the carriage to go out to meet the king, the queen regent, observing her appearance, said archly, [...] "How easy it is to tell when young ladies expect to meet their lovers." [...] Anne Maria says that she had a great mind to tell her, in reply, that it was easy, for those who had {{had a great deal of}} experience in preparing to meet lovers themselves. She did not, however, say this, and the forbearance seems to show that there was, after all, the latent element of discretion and respect for superiors in her character, though it showed itself so seldom in action.|$|E
6000|$|If the gracious reader has had {{losses in}} life, losses {{not so bad}} as to cause {{absolute}} want, or inflict upon him or her the bodily injury of starvation, let him confess that the evils of this poverty {{are by no means}} so great as his timorous fancy depicted. Say your money has been invested in West Diddlesex bonds, or other luckless speculations--the news of the smash comes; you pay your outlying bills with the balance at the banker's; you assemble your family and make them a fine speech; the wife of your bosom goes round and embraces the sons and daughters seriatim; nestling in your own waistcoat finally, in possession of which, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> (<b>with</b> tender tears and fond quotations from Holy Writ, God bless her!), and of the darlings round about, lies all her worldly treasure: the weeping servants are dismissed, their wages paid in full, and with a present of prayer- and hymn-books from their mistress; your elegant house in Harley Street is to let, and you subside into lodgings in Pentonville, or Kensington, or Brompton. How unlike the mansion where you paid taxes and distributed elegant hospitality for so many years! ...|$|E
6000|$|She accuses me {{of being}} the cause of our disaster! <b>She</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> {{apparent}} sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that the forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts. I said I was innocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts. She said the Serpent informed her that [...] "chestnut" [...] was a figurative term meaning an aged and mouldy joke. I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes to pass the weary time, {{and some of them}} could have been of that sort, though I had honestly supposed that they were new when I made them. She asked me if I had made one just {{at the time of the}} catastrophe. I was obliged to admit that I had made one to myself, though not aloud. It was this. I was thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, [...] "How wonderful it is to see that vast body of water tumble down there!" [...] Then in an instant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it fly, saying, [...] "It would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up there!"--and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature broke loose in war and death, and I had to flee for my life. [...] "There," [...] she said, with triumph, [...] "that is just it; the Serpent mentioned that very jest, and called it the First Chestnut, and said it was coeval with the creation." [...] Alas, I am indeed to blame. Would that I were not witty; oh, would that I had never had that radiant thought! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her with a bewildered {{expression}} as if he did not really understand what <b>she</b> was <b>saying.</b> <b>With</b> a considerable effort he collected himself, stood up, and said, [...] "Now I think I have told you what I feel, and I will only add that I can wait as long as ever you wish." ...|$|R
50|$|From Canada, Agell's {{family moved}} back to Sweden, briefly, then to Hong Kong when she was eleven. She {{graduated}} from the Hong Kong International School, a Lutheran mission school that, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> was affiliated <b>with</b> an open-minded ecumenical church.|$|R
40|$|Jenny F. Mbaye {{recently}} completed her PhD at LSE, {{and is now}} a postdoctoral research fellow at the African Centre for Cities of the University of Cape Town. Jenny’s research interests focus on the phenomena of cultural entrepreneurship and music economy in Africa; in this post, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that <b>with</b> the right kind of support from governments, the arts could help boost economic growth within African countries...|$|R
