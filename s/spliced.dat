40|$|Regulation of {{alternative}} <b>splicing</b> {{is controlled by}} pre-mRNA sequences (cis-elements) and trans-acting protein factors that bind them. The combinatorial interactions of multiple protein factors with the cis-elements surrounding a given alternative <b>splicing</b> event lead to an integrated <b>splicing</b> decision. The mechanism of multifactorial <b>splicing</b> regulation is poorly understood. Using a splicing-sensitive DNA microarray, we assayed 352 Caenorhabditis elegans alternative cassette exons for changes in embryonic <b>splicing</b> patterns between wild-type and 12 different strains carrying mutations in a <b>splicing</b> factor. We identified many alternative <b>splicing</b> events that are regulated by multiple <b>splicing</b> factors.

40|$|While 9 % {{of human}} {{pathogenic}} variants have an established effect on pre-mRNA <b>splicing,</b> it is suspected that an additional 20 % of otherwise classified variants also affect <b>splicing.</b> Aberrant <b>splicing</b> includes disruption of <b>splice</b> sites or regulatory elements, or creation or strengthening of cryptic <b>splice</b> sites. For {{the majority of}} variants, it is poorly understood to what extent and how these may affect <b>splicing.</b> We have identified cryptic <b>splicing</b> in an unbiased manner.

5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors.

VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 or just the alternatively <b>spliced</b> exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E

5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be <b>spliced</b> in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences.

Currently, most efficient methods use expressed sequence tags or microar- 10 ray analysis for large-scale detection of alternative <b>splicing.</b> However, it is difficult to detect all alternative <b>splice</b> events with them because of their inherent limitations. Previous computational methods for alternative <b>splicing</b> prediction could only predict 15 particular kinds of alternative <b>splice</b> events.

5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively <b>spliced</b> exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E

For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been <b>spliced</b> into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Alternative <b>splicing</b> {{is a key}} {{molecular}} {{mechanism for}} increasing the functional diversity of the eukaryotic proteomes. A large body of experimental data implicates aberrant <b>splicing</b> in various human diseases, including cancer. Both mutations in cis-acting <b>splicing</b> elements and alterations in the expression and/or activity of <b>splicing</b> regulatory factors drastically affect the <b>splicing</b> profile of many cancer-associated genes. In addition, the <b>splicing</b> profile of several cancerassociated genes is altered in particular types of cancer arguing for a direct role of specific <b>splicing</b> isoforms in tumor progression. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying aberrant <b>splicing</b> in cancer may prove crucial to understand how <b>splicing</b> machinery is controlled and integrated with other cellular processes, in particular transcription and signaling pathways. Moreover, the characterization of <b>splicing</b> deregulation in cancer {{will lead to a}} better comprehension of malignant transformation.

40|$|Regulation of <b>splicing</b> in eukaryotes occurs {{through the}} coordinated action of {{multiple}} <b>splicing</b> factors. Exons and introns contain numerous putative binding sites for <b>splicing</b> regulatory proteins. Regulation of <b>splicing</b> is presumably {{achieved by the}} combinatorial output of the binding of <b>splicing</b> factors to the corresponding binding sites. Although putative regulatory sites often overlap, no extensive study has examined whether overlapping regulatory sequences provide yet another dimension to <b>splicing</b> regulation. Here we analyzed experimentally-identified <b>splicing</b> regulatory sequences using a computational method based on the natural distribution of nucleotides and <b>splicing</b> regulatory sequences. We uncovered positive and negative interplay between overlapping regulatory sequences. Examination of these overlapping motifs revealed a unique spatial distribution, especially near <b>splice</b> donor sites of exons with weak <b>splice</b> donor sites. The positively selected overlapping <b>splicing</b> regulatory motifs were highly conserved among different species, implying functionality. Overall, {{these results suggest that}} overlap of two <b>splicing</b> regulatory binding sites is an evolutionary conserved widespread mechanism of <b>splicing</b> regulation. Finally, over-abundant motif overlaps were experimentally tested in a reporting minigene revealing that overlaps may facilitate a mode of <b>splicing</b> that did not occur in the presence of only one of the two regulatory sequences that comprise it...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alternative <b>splicing</b> {{increases}} protein diversity by generating multiple transcript isoforms from {{a single}} gene through different combinations of exons or through different selections of <b>splice</b> sites. It {{has been reported that}} RNA secondary structures are involved in alternative <b>splicing.</b> Here we perform a genomic study of RNA secondary structures around <b>splice</b> sites in humans (Homo sapiens), mice (Mus musculus), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) to further investigate this phenomenon. Results We observe that GC content around <b>splice</b> sites is closely associated with the <b>splice</b> site usage in multiple species. RNA secondary structure is the possible explanation, because the structural stability difference among alternative <b>splice</b> sites, constitutive <b>splice</b> sites, and skipped <b>splice</b> sites {{can be explained by the}} GC content difference. Alternative <b>splice</b> sites tend to be GC-enriched and exhibit more stable RNA secondary structures in all of the considered species. In humans and mice, <b>splice</b> sites of first exons and long exons tend to be GC-enriched and hence form more stable structures, indicating the special role of RNA secondary structures in promoter proximal <b>splicing</b> events and the <b>splicing</b> of long exons. In addition, GC-enriched exon-intron junctions tend to be overrepresented in tissue-specific alternative <b>splice</b> sites, indicating the functional consequence of the GC effect. Compared with regions far from <b>splice</b> sites and decoy <b>splice</b> sites, real <b>splice</b> sites are GC-enriched. We also found that the GC-content effect is much stronger than the nucleotide-order effect to form stable secondary structures. Conclusion All of these results indicate that GC content is related to <b>splice</b> site usage and it may mediate the <b>splicing</b> process through RNA secondary structures. </p...|$|R
