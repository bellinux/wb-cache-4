25|$|The People's Republic of China {{is by far}} {{the largest}} {{producer}} of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year. For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year. Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of abandoned mined land, which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence</b> (6–12 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no air pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.|$|E

30|$|Shendong {{mining area}} {{is located in}} the {{transition}} zone of the Loess Plateau and the Mu Us Sand land, where the ecological environment is fragile. It is covered by hilly sand and loose soil, and the developments of the vertical joints are rich. In the area, water flowing fractures generated by mining come through the overlying bedrock, and even reach the surface in some areas, resulting in damage to overlying aquifers. The most obvious impact is that there are many ground fissures and a large amount of <b>surface</b> <b>subsidences</b> (Cai and Sui 2008; Kang 2008; Miao et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|Withdrawal {{of large}} volumes of oil from the poorly {{consolidated}} sediments resulted in compaction of the oil reservoirs, and resultant sinking of the overlying land <b>surface.</b> <b>Subsidence</b> became apparent in 1940, and exceeded 20 feet at the center. Water injection to maintain pressure in the oil reservoirs began in 1953, which eventually stopped further subsidence.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} there is {{sufficient}} heat, fuel and oxygen to allow spontaneous combustion and underground fires to smolder for some considerable time as occurred at a natural reserve in Spain. Such fires can cause <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence</b> presenting an unpredictable physical hazard and as well as environmental changes or damage to the local environment and the ecosystem it supports.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} several mines, which were {{successfully}} mined with little to no measurable <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence</b> including mines under lakes, oceans, important water catchments and environmentally sensitive areas. Subsidence is minimised by increasing the block's adjacent chain pillar widths, decreasing extracted block widths and heights, and by giving consideration to the depth of cover as well as competency and thickness of overlying strata.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>surface</b> max <b>subsidence</b> coefficient and influence factors with grey correlation analysis method, based on coal existent condition and survey data of mining design and the surface rock displacement in the 15 typical coal mining places of Yu-Shen-Fu mining area. The analysis results showed that comprehensive pullman's thickness of overburden strata, disturbance coefficient, mining thickness ratio and etc. are the key influence factors to the mining <b>subsidence.</b> Taking the <b>surface</b> max <b>subsidence</b> coefficient as the strain value and the above key influence factors as independent, a gradual regression analysis method was applied to set up a regressive equation.

40|$|Understanding the law {{of mining}} <b>surface</b> dynamic <b>subsidence</b> plays an {{important}} role in protecting the villages and other infrastructures against subsidence damage and disturbance. Unfortunately, the existed methods are mostly based on a few sparse leveling measurements, the accuracy and reliability of which are degraded when the feature points of the leveling measurements are lost in the processing of subsidence evolution. This paper presents a method to analysing {{the law of}} mining <b>surface</b> dynamic <b>subsidence</b> by fusing interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and leveling measurements. By comparing the fitted results obtained by fusing InSAR/leveling and those only by independent leveling, it is shown that the InSAR/levelling fusion not only can make up the deficiency when the leveling measurements lost the feature points of dynamic subsidence, but also can improve the accuracy and reliability of results...|$|R
50|$|The 1969 Bohai {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} July 18, 1969, at 13:24 local time. The epicenter {{was located in}} the Bohai Sea, {{off the coast of}} Shandong Province, China. The magnitude of this earthquake is MS 7.4. Areas of maximal intensity were mainly distributed around the estuary of the Yellow River. Ground cracks and sand boils were reported. The earthquake could be felt in Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu. 10 people were reported dead. This earthquake caused ground <b>surface</b> <b>subsidences</b> of about 15.1 cm ~ 15.8 cm in the Yellow River Delta region. The mechanism of this earthquake was of dextral strike-slip faulting. Although it was located near the Tancheng-Lujiang fault zone (郯庐断裂带), some researchers think that this earthquake was dominated by the seaward extending part of the Huanghekou-Liaocheng seismotectonic zone (黄河口-聊城地震构造带).|$|R
50|$|A {{regional}} strike slip {{fault is}} referred to as a principle displacement zone (PDZ). Connecting the tips of step over faults to the opposite fault are bounding basin sidewall faults. Recent sandbox models have shown that the geometry and evolution of pull-apart basins varies greatly in pure-strike slip situations versus transtensional settings. Transtensional settings are believed to generate greater <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence</b> than pure-strike slip alone.|$|E
50|$|On July 13, 1899, {{the first}} Dodson breaker burned down, and on March 5, 1900, work {{began on the}} second breaker. In 1914, Plymouth Borough {{obtained}} an injunction preventing the Plymouth Coal Co. from mining, owing to <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence,</b> {{and for most of}} that year the mine was idle. In January 1915, the Kingston Coal Co., which operated the adjacent Gaylord Colliery, announced it would buy the Dodson mine.|$|E
50|$|Ground <b>surface</b> <b>{{subsidence}}</b> started around 1920 on Bartlett mountain. By 2001, the subsidence {{area covered}} about 100 acres on Bartlett mountain. Around the open-pit, caved ground combined with winter avalanches and high vertical pit walls make the West {{side of the}} mountain even more susceptible to collapse. Also, the cracks through the rocks created by shifting blocks allow ground water to infiltrate into the working tunnels. This ground water increased the potential for acid rock drainage from the mine.|$|E

50|$|In mining, {{the term}} roof fall {{is used to}} refer to many types of collapses, ranging from the fall of a single flake of shale to collapses that form sink holes that reach to the surface. However, roof falls in mining are not all accidental. In {{longwall}} mining and retreat mining, miners systematically remove all support from under large areas of the mine roof, allowing it to settle just beyond the work area. The goal in such mining methods is not to prevent roof fall and the ensuing <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence,</b> but rather to control it.|$|E

Production over a recent 7-year stretch averaged 877,000 tonnes per year. Overall coalfield resoures within the mining lease area estimated at 5 billion tonnes of coal.|$|E
5000|$|Risks of injury: Among {{the most}} common types of job-related {{injuries}} for waste pickers are back and hand injuries caused by lifting heavy objects with little equipment. In a study of 48 waste pickers in Santo André, Brazil, almost all workers reported pain in the back, legs, shoulder, arms, and hands. Waste pickers who work in open dumps are exposed to large amounts of toxic fumes, and face other severe threats including being run over by trucks and caught in <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence,</b> trash slides, and fires. On 10 July 2000, several hundred waste pickers were killed by a trash slide from a huge garbage mountain after monsoon rains at an open dump in Payatas, Philippines.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{environmental}} effects of power production from geopressured reservoirs reveals two important problems that cannot be adequately evaluated at this time: <b>surfaces</b> <b>subsidence</b> and the possible inducement of earthquakes, which could result from the efficient production of power over the lifetime of a reservoir. These effects {{must be considered in}} any environmental impact statement and must be monitored over the entire lifetime of a production facility. A particular reservoir in northwest Cameron County, Texas, was used as a model.

5000|$|Several {{types of}} sub-surface mining, and {{specifically}} methods which intentionally cause the extracted void to collapse (such as pillar extraction, longwall mining and any metalliferous mining method which uses [...] "caving" [...] such as [...] "block caving" [...] or [...] "sub-level caving") {{will result in}} <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Mining-induced subsidence is relatively predictable in its magnitude, manifestation and extent, except where a sudden pillar or near-surface underground tunnel collapse occurs (usually very old workings). Mining-induced subsidence is nearly always very localized to the surface above the mined area, plus a margin around the outside. The vertical magnitude of the subsidence itself typically does not cause problems, except {{in the case of}} drainage (including natural drainage)-rather, it is the associated surface compressive and tensile strains, curvature, tilts and horizontal displacement that are the cause of the worst damage to the natural environment, buildings and infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|ESG's first {{permanent}} {{seismic system}} installation {{took place at}} the Retsof Salt Mine in the Genesee Valley near Retsof, New York. In 1994, the Retsof Salt Mine was the largest salt mine in North America, and the second largest in the world. Mining activities had caused the collapse of a 500 by 500 foot piece of the mine ceiling at a depth of 1,200 feet below the surface. The collapse of the shale ceiling rock compromised the caprock layer separating the mine from overlying ground water, and the mine began to flood. The failure caused a magnitude 3.6 earthquake that was felt on the surface, as well as release of natural gases, declining aquifer levels and <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence.</b> [...] An ESG seismic system was installed using boreholes and surface-based sensors to evaluate the integrity of the mine as it flooded and track the sinkhole generated at the surface.|$|E

40|$|The central Ebro Basin {{comprises}} thick evaporite materials whose high solubility produces typically karstic landforms. The sinkhole morphology {{developed in}} the overlying alluvium has been studied using gravimetry and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) on stream terraces, {{as well as an}}alyzing the evolution of sinkhole morphologies observed in aerial photographs taken in 1928, 1957, and 1985. The sinkhole morphologies give some idea of possible subsurface processes as well as an indication of the final mechanisms involve in sinkhole development. On stream terraces and cover pediments the most commonly encountered dolines are bowl-shaped in their morphology with both diffuse and scarped edges. In contrast, dolines {{developed in the}} gypsiferous silt infilled valleys have a funnel and well-shaped morphology. The diffuse-edged bowl-shaped dolines are developed through the progressive subsidence of the alluvial cover, due to washing down of alluvial particles through small voids and cracks into deeper subsurface caves, resulting in a decrease alluvial density. Future compaction of the alluvial cover will produce <b>surface</b> <b>subsidences.</b> This type of dolines are associated with negative gravity anomalies. In contrast, the scarped-edge dolines are formed by the sudden collapse of a cavity roof. The cavities and cracks formed in the gypsum karst may migrate to the surface through the alluvial deposits by piping, and they may subsequently collapse. In this instance, the cavities can be detected by both gravity and GPR anomalies where the voids are not deeper than 4 – 5 m from the surface. These processes forming sinkholes can be enhanced by man-induced changes in the groundwater hydrologic regime by both inflows, due to irrigation, ditch losses, or pipe leakages, and by outflows from pumping activities.

25|$|The extreme {{heat and}} {{pressure}} of an {{underground nuclear explosion}} causes changes in the surrounding rock. The rock closest {{to the location of}} the test is vaporised, forming a cavity. Farther away, there are zones of crushed, cracked, and irreversibly strained rock. Following the explosion, the rock above the cavity may collapse, forming a rubble chimney. If this chimney reaches the <b>surface,</b> a bowl-shaped <b>subsidence</b> crater may form.|$|R
5000|$|A third {{practical}} {{concern is}} the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence</b> and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase [...] uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases {{the height of the}} water table in the Arctic.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, the Retsof Salt Mine was {{the largest}} salt mine in North America, and the second largest in the world. Three hundred people worked within the 6000 acre of {{excavated}} space, 1000 ft below ground, extracting salt from a natural deposit for use as road salt, table salt, and in industry. In March 1994, however, the ceiling {{in one of the}} large underground chambers collapsed, {{the first of a series}} of effects caused by groundwater entering the salt deposit, which had been dry for all of the 110 previous years of mining at the site. Over the next 21 months, the mine cavities collapsed and filled with water. Mining operations scrambled to work the accessible areas before the spreading flood, until operations were suspended when the mine was fully filled with water, in 1995. The effect of filling all this space lowered the aquifer, leaving many drinking water wells dry, and led to <b>surface</b> <b>subsidence,</b> even sinkholes 200 ft wide, damaging structures and highways. 8 ft or 9 ft of additional subsidence is expected to take place over the next century.|$|E

25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water {{pressure in the}} sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground <b>surface</b> as <b>subsidence.</b> Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.|$|R
30|$|For certain post-mining {{land uses}} such as airports, {{shopping}} centers, and industrial parks, compaction of surface materials is necessary. Support {{features such as}} runways, roadways, and parking areas require that both subsurface and surface materials be compacted. Compaction of fill materials can prevent excessive downward movements of the land <b>surface</b> due to <b>subsidence</b> and settlement. Excessive downward movement of land surfaces supporting structures will distort structures, rendering them unusable or requiring expensive repair.|$|R
