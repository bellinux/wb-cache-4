40|$|The nonprotein thiol {{glutathione}} (GSH) and {{the rate}} and extent of repair of DNA strand breaks were investigated as two possible determinants {{of the size of}} the shoulder of the X-ray survival curve in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Both cell survival and DNA single strand break repair were measured at comparable radiation doses (using clonogenic and alkaline elution assays respectively) following treatment of CHO cells with agents which deplete GSH levels and/or reduce the shoulder of the radiation survival curve. CHO cells were treated with diethylmaleate (DEM) at doses which reduce GSH levels from 10 % to less than 1 % of control values. GSH depletion produced dose-modifying radiosensitization of hypoxic but not aerobic cells, reducing the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) from 2. 6 to 1. 7, with no change in the survival curve shoulder, nor in the rate of repair of DNA strand breaks. Since mitotic CHO cells exhibited a reduced shoulder compared to asynchronous cells with no difference in the Do of the survival curve, they provided an opportunity to test the possible association of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>size</b> with the repair rate of DNA breaks. Both mitotic and asynchronous cells had the same initial number of strand breaks for a given radiation dose, but mitotic cells had a half-life for repair of those breaks which was significantly longer.

40|$|Inactivation in {{sunlight}} of fecal coliforms (FC) and enterococci (Ent) from sewage and meatworks effluents {{was measured in}} 300 -liter effluent-seawater mixtures (2 % vol/vol) held in open-topped chambers. Dark inactivation rates (kDs) were measured (from log-linear survival curves) in enclosed chambers and 6 -liter pots. The kD for FC was 2 to 4 times that for Ent, and inactivation was generally slower at lower temperatures. Sunlight inactivation was {{described in terms of}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>size</b> (n) and the slope (k) of the log-linear portion of the survival curve as a function of global solar insolation and UV-B fluence. The n values tended to be larger for Ent than for FC, and the k values for FC were around twice those for Ent in both effluent-seawater mixtures. The combined sunlight data showed a general inactivation rate (k) ranking in effluent-seawater mixtures of meatworks FC > sewage FC > meatworks Ent > sewage Ent. Describing 90 % inactivation in terms of insolation (S 90) gave far less seasonal variation than T 90 (time-dependent) values. However, there were significant differences in inactivation rates between experiments, indicating the contribution to inactivation of factors other than insolation. Inactivation rates under different long-pass optical filters decreased with the increase in the spectral cutoff wavelength (lambda 50) of the filters and indicated little contribution by UV-B to total inactivation. Most inactivation appeared to be caused by two main regions of the solar spectrum [...] between 318 and 340 nm in the UV region and > 400 nm in the visible region...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{presence}} of epidermal growth factor (EGF) after irradiation enhanced the radiosensitivity of CaSki cells. To examine the role of EGF receptor density and related growth response in EGF associated radiosensitisation, four human squamous carcinoma cell lines were used. The total number of EGF receptors for HN 5, A 431, CaSki, and SiHa cells is 5. 2 x 10 (6), 1. 6 x 10 (6), 7. 9 x 10 (5) and 1. 1 x 10 (5) respectively, and the dissociation constant (Kd) for low affinity EGF receptors is 11. 8, 3. 8, 1. 7 and 0. 8 nM respectively. The Kd for high affinity receptors differs slightly among the four cell lines, 0. 09 to 0. 21 nM. EGF inhibited the growth of A 431, CaSki, and HN 5 cells, but stimulated the growth of SiHa cells. Due to the presence of 10 ng ml- 1 EGF after irradiation, radiosensitivity enhancement associated with reduced <b>shoulder</b> <b>size</b> of the survival curve was observed. The extent of sensitisation was similar for A 431, CaSki, and HN 5 cells, with no effect on SiHa cells. At this concentration, EGF present during the clonogenic assay period after irradiation also reduced the plating efficiency (PE) of the monolayer cultures of A 431, CaSki, and HN 5 cells, but increased that of SiHa cells. The radiation response of mouse 3 T 3 cells (less than 5, 000 receptors) was not sensitised by EGF. A similar level of radiosensitivity enhancement by EGF was observed for parental and conditioned A 431 cultures. The conditioned cells were grown in 50 ng ml- 1 EGF for 10 weeks and did not demonstrate growth inhibition and PE reduction by treatment with EGF. The EGF receptor numbers and binding affinity of these cells were the same as for the parental cells. The results from the conditioned cells support the hypothesis that EGF related radiosensitisation is EGF receptor density dependent...|$|E

40|$|Loss {{of support}} {{as a result}} of voids {{underneath}} concrete slabs can initiate and propagate slab cracking in jointed plain concrete pavements. This paper investigates the hypothesis that foundation voiding occurs because of localized plastic deformation of the depressurized foundation {{as a result of}} slab curling and repeated application of traffic loads. Plane strain and three-dimensional (3 D) nonlinear finite-element models of the subgrade foundation are presented. The analysis shows that voids underneath concrete slabs usually occur along the edge of slabs adjacent to the <b>shoulder.</b> The <b>sizes</b> of voids are primarily determined by foundation properties (cohesion stress and internal friction angle), slab properties, axle loads, and temperature gradients.

40|$|Abstract Background The risk of {{developing}} lymphoma is greatly increased in HIV infection. Musculoskeletal manifestations of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are common and are sometimes the initial presentation of the disease. Muscle, bone, and joints are involved by septic arthritis, myopathies and neoplasms. HIV-related neoplastic processes that affect the musculoskeletal system include Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the latter being mainly localized at lower extremities, spine and skull. Case presentation The Authors report {{a case of a}} 34 year-old lady. In December 2003 the patient noted a painless mass on her right <b>shoulder</b> whose <b>size</b> increased progressively. In March 2004 she was diagnosed HIV positive and contemporary got pregnant. The patient decided to continue her pregnancy and to not undergo any diagnostic procedure and treatment. At the end of August she underwent a surgical ablation of the lesion that revealed a lesion of 7 cm × 7 cm × 3, 3 cm. The histology showed B-cells expressing CD 20, PAX- 5, CD 10, BCL- 6 and MUM- 1 with 70 % Ki 67 positive nuclei. The lesion was also negative for EBV infection and showed a monoclonal rearrangement of IgH chain and a polyclonal pattern for TCR gamma and beta. A final diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was made. The patient underwent postoperative chemotherapy. At four-years follow up the patient is symptom free and no local nor systemic recurrence of pathology has been noted on MRI control. HIV infection is still under control. Conclusion In this report, we present a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma localized in the soft tissue of the shoulder in a HIV infected patient.

Anterior translation of the humeral head was stress induced under 30 -N traction, in maximum external rotation at 0 ° and at 90 ° abduction: respectively, adduction and external rotation (ADER), and abduction and external rotation (ABER). Under radiological control, displacement of the center of the humeral head was compared with the glenoid surface at the 3, 4 and 5 o’clock (medial, antero-inferior and inferior) positions for the 2 bone-block positionings.

Data for heritability were collected from 455 offsprings belonged to 15 sires. Weight and body size are two parameters used to estimate the heritability and breeding value, the heritability was analyzed between weaning and yearling age and breeding value was only calculated for weaning age. The data were analyzed by using paternal half-sib correlation method. The heritability between bulls and offspring was varied in weaning age, ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 97, and yearling age was showed high heritability in all parameters, ranged from 0. 56 to 0. 64. The heritability of weaning weight was 0. 50 ± 0. 19, weaning body <b>size</b> (<b>shoulder</b> height, body length and heart girth) was 0. 97 ± 0. 31; 0. 24 ± 0. 13; 0. 44 ± 0. 19, yearling weight was 0. 56 ± 0. 08 and yearling body size was 0. 58 ± 0. 08; 0. 64 ± 0. 09 and 0. 56 ± 0. 08 respectively.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether the combination of these therapies would induce synergistic effects to treat lymphedema-related complications and to analyze a possible physiological mechanism involved in the observed effects. Methods: A total of 55 patients diagnosed with mastectomy-induced lymphedema were recruited and randomized into three experimental groups: PNF group (n = 17), MLD group (n = 20), and PNF + MLD group (n = 18). They were subjected to designated rehabilitation program three times a week for 16 weeks. ROM (flexion of the <b>shoulder</b> joint), edema <b>size,</b> arterial blood flow velocity, and degree of pain and depression were measured every 4 weeks over experimental period. Results: Lymphedema volume, VAS pain scale, and Beck depression scale were decreased in PNF and MLD groups for 16 weeks in a time-dependent manner. In combination, a greater reduction of these variables was observed over 16 weeks compared to each PNF and MLD. While axillary arterial blood circulation rate in the affected extremity was increased in both PNF and PNF + MLD groups over 16 weeks, this value was not increased in MLD group throughout the experimental period. A greater reduction of scales of VAS pain and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was observed in PNF + MLD group after the 16 week-treatment, as compared to each PNF and MLD group. Pearson's coefficients test demonstrated that there are significant correlation of depression against pain (r = 0. 616, p < 0. 01), ROM (r = − 0. 478, p < 0. 01), and lymphedema size (r = 0. 492, p < 0. 01). Conclusion: The combination of MLD and PNF induces potent synergistic effects on edema volume, shoulder range of motion (ROM), pain, and depression in patients with lymphedema. In addition, an increased rate of axillary arterial blood flow in PNF-treated patients provide a potential physiological mechanism by which local arterial pulsation in the affected extremity plays a positive role in the treatment of lymphedema. Therefore, it is suggested to incorporate an element of PNF into traditional MLD method to facilitate treatment process for patients with lymphedema...|$|R
40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. The suit was designed for maximum mobility at 8. 3 psid, reduced mass, and to have high fidelity life support interfaces. As Z- 2 will be man-tested at full vacuum in NASA JSC's Chamber B, it was manufactured as Class II, making it the most flight-like planetary walking suit produced to date. The Z- 2 suit architecture is an evolution of previous EVA suits, namely the ISS EMU, Mark III, Rear Entry I-Suit and Z- 1 spacesuits. The suit is a hybrid hard and soft multi-bearing, rear entry spacesuit. The hard upper torso (HUT) is an all-composite structure and includes a 2 -bearing rolling convolute <b>shoulder</b> with Vernier <b>sizing</b> mechanism, removable suit port interface plate (SIP), elliptical hemispherical helmet and self-don/doff shoulder harness. The hatch is a hybrid aluminum and composite construction with Apollo style gas connectors, custom water pass-thru, removable hatch cage and interfaces to primary and auxiliary life support feed water bags. The suit includes Z- 1 style lower arms with cam brackets for Vernier sizing and government furnished equipment (GFE) Phase VI gloves. The lower torso includes a telescopic waist sizing system, waist bearing, rolling convolute waist joint, hard brief, 2 bearing soft hip thigh, Z- 1 style legs with ISS EMU style cam brackets for sizing, and conformal walking boots with ankle bearings. The Z- 2 Requirements Verification Plan includes the verification of more than 200 individual requirements. The verification methods include test, analysis, inspection, demonstration or a combination of methods. Examples of unmanned requirements include suit leakage, proof pressure testing, operational life, mass, isometric man-loads, sizing adjustment ranges, internal and external interfaces such as in-suit drink bag, partial pressure relief valve, purge valve, donning stand and ISS Body Restraint Tether (BRT). Examples of manned requirements include verification of anthropometric range, suit self-don/doff, secondary suit exit method, donning stand self-ingress/egress and manned mobility covering eight functional tasks. The eight functional tasks include kneeling with object pick-up, standing toe touch, cross-body reach, walking, reach to the SIP and helmet visor. This paper will provide an overview of the Z- 2 design. Z- 2 requirements verification testing was performed with NASA at the ILC Houston test facility. This paper will also discuss pre-delivery manned and unmanned test results as well as analysis performed in support of requirements verification...|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The {{shell is}} large for the genus. It is {{composed}} of eight very angular whorls, which form a sharp pointed, regularly tapered, turreted spire. The protoconch is very small, regularly coiled, consisting of {{two and a half}} shining, light yellow whorls in striking contrast to the dull, rough surface peculiar {{to the rest of the}} shell. The first one and a half whorls are perfectly smooth, while the last one is crossed by minute, transverse riblets. The suture is marked by a conspicuous, rounded, undulating cingulus (= coloredbands or spiral ornamentation) or thread on the preceding whorl. The sculpture consists of prominent, straight, angular, alternating ribs (nine on the body whorl), forming a conspicuous node at the angle, extending from suture to suture. These, with their deeply concave interspaces, are crossed by unequal, conspicuous, well-rounded, granulated cinguli and microscopic threads. The first cingulus, defining the shoulder of the whorls, is double with the upper half slightly the larger, the sutural one is the next in size, while between these there are two still finer ones. These are unequally distant from each other, the first and second being much closer together than the others, and the intervening surfaces are covered by unequal, microscopic threads. Above the angle of the whorls the threads alone occur and number about nine. This inequality in the spiral sculpture makes the edges of the transverse ribs very rough and jagged. On the body whorl there are about thirteen cinguli below the <b>shoulder,</b> unequal in <b>size</b> and unequally separated, those on the siphonal canal larger and closer together than those just above it, while the fourth one below the angle is so prominent as to make a slight angle in the outline of the whorl. Below this angle the transverse ribs curve in toward the columella following the outline of the outer lip, and extend to the end of the siphonal canal, the curvature being most noticeable in a dorsal view. Very fine striae intersect the cinguli and the threads in the direction of the lines of growth, rendering them granular and give the appearance to the shell, when dry, of being covered with a fine, gray dust. The aperture is long, narrowly ovate, with a moderately long, rather narrow siphonal canal. The outer lip is not thickened, and shows a comparatively thin edge and a broad, moderately deep sinus extending from the suture to the angle. The columella is slightly curved. The inner lip is marked by a narrow stripe of conspicuous red enamel. The color of the shell is light yellow-brown. The interior of the aperture is of the same conspicuous red color as the inner lip. In young specimens this coloring is wanting.|$|R
