500|$|Responding to the criticism, {{one of the}} film's producers, Elie Samaha, complained: [...] " [...] {{critics were}} waiting for us to… chop our heads off. Everybody hated Scientology for <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> didn't know people were so prejudiced." [...] Ebert noted, however, that the film [...] "contains no {{evidence}} of Scientology, or any other system of thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{it looks}} like it," [...] he assented meditatively. [...] "They do seem to hang back for <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>Is</b> that <b>reason</b> prudence, or downright fear, or perhaps the leisurely method of certitude?" ...|$|R

6000|$|And last, how to [...] "act": for <b>some</b> mysterious <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{never asked}} any {{theatrical}} celebrity, male or female, {{how to do}} that? ...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} the eighth most-watched {{program of the}} week along with NBC's Sunday Night Football, with 11.4 million viewers, it {{received}} a 17 share in the ratings. Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was thrilled to see more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was glad that he wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> like Taub. Maybe because he's not pretty like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E
500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want {{to leave me alone}} for <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E
6000|$|Lane {{brought his}} hand down on the table, and, for <b>some</b> unexplainable <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> {{actually}} believed him as he said: [...] "Gaspard's Trail was burnt by accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was bitterly {{opposed to}} secret societies, for <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> which <b>I</b> never fully understood, {{and the only}} fury I ever knew him to express was {{directed}} against these [...] "dens of iniquity." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} this, I must offer my countrymen and fellow-citizens <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> why <b>I</b> {{think they ought}} to be more than ordinarily careful, at this juncture, upon whom they bestow their votes.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{was shocked}} and sad", Thomas {{recalled}} in the Chicago Tribune. [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} guys I played against get drafted, and I knew they couldn't do what I could do. But I've had people all my life saying you can't do this, you can't do that. It scars you. No matter how well I've done. People have misunderstood me for <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> was always one of the most competitive kids around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sermons {{were long}} and harrowing. [...] In vivid language, the preacher painted Heaven and Hell, with {{considerably}} more emphasis on Hell than upon Heaven. [...] I mentally pictured the Devil as a monstrous red animal with horns and a long tail, who carried a four-pronged pitchfork. [...] For <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> believed {{he lived in the}} ground and could appear at will. [...] The church had no organ or piano, so we sang without instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Havins {{prepared}} for the birth scenes beforehand as well. [...] "I got books and spoke to my mom," [...] she said. [...] "Everyone that had a child I was picking their brain, {{and there were some}} really great things online that helped." [...] Havins stated, [...] "And for <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> have always watched Maternity Ward on TLC and just to see it firsthand was great. I wanted it to be no makeup, no lip gloss...I wanted to make it [...] real." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said, [...] "I {{could only}} {{think that there}} was robbery, and that you, for <b>some</b> {{sufficient}} <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> am sure, were aiding. I could not think anything else, could I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now for <b>some</b> occult <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> shrank {{from asking}} {{the name of}} this [...] "one who had gone down to the Darkness," [...] {{although}} I was sure that she was waiting for the question. So I merely remarked, without showing surprise-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, please! I {{see that}} you know. For <b>some</b> mysterious <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> am {{travelling}} almost alone, and under another name which I do not like at all. You are very fond of my cousin, Isobel, are you not, Mr. Greatson?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Mezger said, [...] "For <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> had a {{tremendous}} amount of energy for that 15 minutes, but I started to kind of wilt near the end. Then they called it a draw and I'm like, [...] "What?" [...] Everyone blames Ken for being unprofessional. Really, Ken was protecting his fighter. We had an agreement. Sakuraba said, [...] "I wanted to go another round, thinking {{it would be possible to}} salvage the match, but when it was decided to extend the fight, Ken Shamrock was making scary faces. Later I heard that Mezger's contract was only for a one-round fight. I thought, [...] "Ah, then it couldn't be helped." [...] But Shamrock didn't have to get so angry like that. Seeing Mezger getting scolded by him, I felt sorry for (Mezger)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Campese {{was dropped}} from the Australian team for their first Bledisloe Cup Test match against New Zealand in Auckland. Following an injury to Australian fullback Matthew Burke in the first Bledisloe Cup Test of 1995 in Auckland, the Australian {{selectors}} picked Rod Kafer to take Burke's place in the Australian team. Kafer then suffered a broken leg during a training session. Campese was then recalled to a training session with the Wallabies, with the information that if Matthew Burke proved his fitness, he would not play in the second Bledisloe Cup Test. Burke recovered from his injury {{to play in the}} second Bledisloe Cup Test. However, another injury to Australian centre Daniel Herbert led to Campese's selection on the bench in the second Bledisloe Cup Test of 1995. In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese wrote that [...] "for <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> was meant to play that weekend against the All Blacks." ...|$|E

60|$|I cannot omit {{to mention}} here a {{proposal}} {{made a few}} years ago to the late Lord Treasurer Godolphin for re-peopling this forest, which for <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> can be more particular in than any man now left alive, because I had the honour to draw up the scheme and argue it before that noble lord and some others who were principally concerned at that time in bringing over--or, rather, providing for when they were come over--the poor inhabitants of the Palatinate, a thing in itself commendable, but, as it was managed, made scandalous to England and miserable to those poor people.|$|R
6000|$|For <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>I</b> {{could never}} discover, the dominie had {{all his life}} refused to teach his {{scholars}} geography. The Inspector and many others asked him why there was no geography class, and his invariable answer was to point to his pupils collectively, and reply in an impressive whisper-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] Shorty affirmed. [...] "It {{was just}} what I was {{stopping}} to think about. I knew there was <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> ought to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I put it {{a little}} strongly," [...] he replied. [...] "You seemed to take an {{interest}} in him, for <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> suppose it's because you like new types." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} girl, [...] "it {{would not be}} strange, of course; but for <b>some</b> inexplicable <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{have one of those}} foolish {{feminine}} presentiments that all is not right with Mr. Caldwell. It is the strangest feeling--it is as though I knew that he was not on board the ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what's {{in the air}} always HAS--hasn't it?--to {{come down}} to the earth. And Maggie," [...] Mrs. Assingham continued, [...] "is a very curious little person. Since I was 'in,' this afternoon, for seeing more than I had ever done--well, I felt THAT too, for <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> as <b>I</b> hadn't yet felt it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} my {{reminding}} you, Mr. Jacks, that I am a busy man {{and that this}} is a busy morning. You had <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> presume, for wishing to see me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Implicitly," [...] {{returned}} English Jim. [...] "You {{must have}} had <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> cannot guess for what you did. That sounds like presumption, doesn't it? But you can count upon my silence, madam." ...|$|E
60|$|She wore nothing {{over her}} evening dress save a lace scarf, which she {{untwisted}} as we ascended the stairs. For <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> fancied {{that she was}} not very well pleased with me. Her greeting was certainly cool.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to {{be quite}} {{mistress}} of myself," [...] she explained; [...] "your face, for <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> which <b>I</b> really don't know, irritates me.

6000|$|... "Yes! He refused. He {{said that}} he must stay here, for <b>some</b> mysterious <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> begged him {{to tell me what}} that reason was, and he was silent. It was the end.
