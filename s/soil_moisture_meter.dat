At present, it is the only alcove site in the park that has been fully documented by park service archaeologists. In the past, preservation at Mesa Verde has focused on the minimal remedial stabilization of the prehistoric masonry structures. A comprehensive study of broad deterioration patterns across the alcovate sites in the park and the possible causes of these patterns has never been performed. Identifying common sources of deterioration site-wide has the potential to lead to a comprehensive maintenance plan that could slow deterioration through preventive as well as remedial actions, thereby protecting the resources and decreasing the amount of emergency rehabilitation work needed. Implementation of a monitoring program {{is the first step in}} this process, as it allows us to identify patterns and establish causality, leading eventually to non-invasive preventive and protective measures.

The soil respiration for the 1 t ha- 1 and 5 t haâ�»Â¹) biochar treatments were significantly different in this study. The maximum rate of soil respiration produced from 5 t haâ�»Â¹) of biochar amendment was approximately 9. 45 t COâ‚‚ haâ�»Â¹) yrâ�»Â¹. Soil temperature was positively correlated with soil respiration. Increased soil temperature enhanced the soil respiration especially above 30 Â°C. The soil moisture showed an inverse relationship with soil respiration. Rainfall event and distribution affected the results of soil temperature and moisture and hence soil respiration. Higher rainfall increased the soil moisture content but also reduced soil respiration significantly.

The relation between <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and emissivity predicted by different dielectric models are used to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> The estimated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is compared with limited ground truth <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> taken synchronously with flight measurements. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and topographic maps are presented for quick-look observation of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> against agricultural fields...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of spatial variability of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> conditions on runoff response is widely acknowledged in hillslope hydrology. Using a distributed hydrologic model, this paper aims at investigating {{the effects of}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> spatial variability on runoff in various field conditions and at finding {{the structure of the}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> pattern that approaches the measured <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> pattern in terms of field scale runoff. High spatial resolution <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was surveyed in ten different field campaigns using a proximal ground penetrating radar (GPR) mounted on a mobile platform. Based on these <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements, seven scenarios of spatial structures of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were used and linked with a field scale distributed hydrological model to simulate field scale runoff. Accounting for spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> resulted in general in higher predicted field scale runoff as compared to the case where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was kept constant. The ranges of possible hydrographs were delineated by extreme scenarios where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was directly and inversely modelled according to the topographic wetness index (TWI). These behaviours could be explained by the sizes and locations of runoff contributing areas, knowing that runoff was generated by infiltration excess over a certain <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> threshold. The most efficient scenario for modelling the within field spatial structure of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> appeared to be when <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is directly arranged according to the TWI, especially when measured <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and TWI were correlated. The novelty of this work is to benefit from a large set of high-resolution <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements allowing to model effectively the within field distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{and its impact on the}} field scale hydrograph. These observations contributed to the current knowledge of the impact of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> spatial variability on field scale runoff...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{influences}} {{the occurrence of}} convective precipitation. Therefore an accurate knowledge of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> might be useful for an improved prediction of convective cells. But still the model uncertainty overshadows the impact of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in realistic cases even in 1  km resolution and therefore convection resolving models. Only drastic <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> changes can exhibit the model uncertainties but the systematic behaviour is still complex and depends strongly {{on the strength of}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> change. Here we performed seven experiments with modified <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using an ensemble approach for each experiment. Only a 50  % <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> enhancement and a complete dried soil impact precipitation patterns considerably in structure, amplitude and location in certain analysis areas. Both, the enhanced and reduced <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> result in a reduced precipitation rate. Replacing the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> by a realistic field from different days {{influences the}} precipitation insignificantly. We point out the need for uncertainty estimations in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> studies...|$|R
40|$|Root-zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is an {{important}} control over the partition of land surface energy and moisture, and the assimilation of remotely sensed near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{has been shown to}} improve model profile <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> [1]. To date, efforts to assimilate remotely sensed near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at large scales have focused on <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and the active Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT; together with its predecessor on the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS. The assimilation of passive and active microwave <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations has not yet been directly compared, and so this study compares the impact of assimilating ASCAT and AMSR-E <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data, both separately and together. Since the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retrieval skill from active and passive microwave data is thought to differ according to surface characteristics [2], the impact of each assimilation on the model <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> skill is assessed according to land cover type, by comparison to in situ <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations...|$|R
40|$|Satellite-derived <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{provides}} more spatially and temporally extensive data than in situ observations. However, satellites can only measure {{water in the}} top few centimeters of the soil. Root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is more important, particularly in vegetated regions. Therefore estimates of root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> must be inferred from near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retrievals. The accuracy of this inference is contingent {{on the relationship between}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in the near-surface and the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at greater depths. This study uses cross correlation analysis to quantify the association between near-surface and root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using in situ data from the United States Great Plains. Our analysis demonstrates that there is generally a strong relationship between near-surface (5 – 10 cm) and root zone (25 – 60 cm) <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> An exponential decay filter is used to estimate root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from the <b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from SMOS surface retrievals is compared to in situ <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations in the United States Great Plains. The SMOS-based root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> had a mean R 2 of 0. 57 and a mean Nash–Sutcliffe score of 0. 61 based on 33 stations in Oklahoma. In Nebraska, the SMOS-based root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> had a mean R 2 of 0. 24 and a mean Nash–Sutcliffe score of 0. 22 based on 22 stations. Although the performance of the exponential filter method varies over space and time, we conclude that it is a useful approach for estimating root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> from SMOS surface retrievals...|$|R

This paper evaluates {{the feasibility of}} using the assimilated ESA <b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission L-band passive microwave data for operational US cropland <b>soil</b> surface <b>moisture</b> monitoring. The assimilated SMOS <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data are first categorized to match with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) survey based weekly <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observation data, which are ordinal. The categorized assimilated SMOS <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data are compared with NASSs survey-based weekly <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data for consistency and robustness using visual assessment and rank correlation. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} assimilated SMOS <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data highly co-vary with NASS field observations across a large geographic area. Therefore, SMOS data have great potential for US operational cropland <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> monitoring...|$|R

It has been observed that AMSR-E derived <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in arid region (desert area) over estimates by 4 %. About 2 % underestimation of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was obtained at another test site with agriculture practices. By comparing estimated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and rainfall data, we found that estimated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> varies well with rainfall for uniform bare fields. The heavy rainfall events in several parts of India that lead to flooding were clearly seen through <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> maps of 4 years. Drought situation in 2002 was also observed through <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> maps. The <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retrieval accuracy depends on inhomogeneity in a resolution cell. © IEE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is {{critical}} parameters in climatic and hydrological modeling and vegetation growth. Ground-based point measurement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is liable but expensive and impractical for watershed measurement. Remote sensing measurement has provided thriving perspective for spatial and instantaneous measurement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Microwave measurement is effective and successful for surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> but {{influenced by the}} vegetation and land roughness, and can’t detect the root zone or below-root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Vegetation growth is heavily dependent on the water availability in arid and semi-arid areas, and the vegetation index from satellites may respond to the change of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and reflect the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> to some degree. This study analyzed the profile <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> characteristics in three different climate and vegetation sites from Feb 2000 through Apr 2004, compared the collocated and coincided <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and MODIS NDVI, and estimated the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using NDVI by least square regression model. Results showed that the root and below-root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in semi-arid climate has strong correlation with simultaneous NDVI and can be estimated using NDVI during growing season; the root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in humid climate also has moderate correlation with simultaneous NDVI during growing season; below-root <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in humid climate has weak correlation with NDVI and can’t be effectively estimated using NDVI; <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> has weak correlation with NDVI and can’t be effectively estimated using NDVI during non-growing season (Oct-March) ...|$|R
30|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} knowledge of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{is important to}} effectively model the surface runoff from a river catchment. The moving average and kriging methods were employed to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at spatial scale {{in a part of}} Solani River catchment. Observed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data at 49 sample locations points were used to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> spatial scale, whereas the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data at 20 locations were used to validate the results by computing RMSE between the observed and estimated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using the two methods.|$|R
40|$|The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) {{provides}} intermediate-scale (~ 700 m diameter circle, 35 ha) area-average <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements. A CRNP, whose footprint {{covers the}} entire T. W. Daniel Experimental Forest instrumented site, {{was installed in}} August 2011 {{as part of the}} COsmic-ray <b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> Observing System (COSMOS). Independent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements reveal CRNP is more sensitive to near surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> (0 - 10 cm) than deeper layers. The CRNP response to summer-time <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was compared with the TWDEF <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurement network containing 108 time-domain transmission (TDT) water content sensors. We also employed the Hydrus- 1 D model to numerically simulate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> including the top 10 cm of the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> profile. Comparison of these two estimates with CRNP revealed that the spatially averaged point measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were less well correlated with cosmic-ray neutron counts during rainfall events that wetted the near-surface, not reaching the sensors at 10 cm. Simulations of near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using Hydrus- 1 D showed improved correlation with CRNP response to precipitation events that trigger increased surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> The sensitivity to near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> makes CRNP a powerful indicator of soil surface water status and could potentially be used to interpret soil water fluxes at this intermediate scale...|$|R
40|$|Hillslopes are {{fundamental}} landscape units, yet represent a difficult scale for measurements {{as they are}} well-beyond our traditional point-scale techniques. Here we present an assessment of electromagnetic induction (EM) as a potential rapid and non-invasive method to map <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> patterns at the hillslope scale. We test the new multi-frequency GEM- 300 for spatially distributed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements at the well-instrumented Panola hillslope. EM-based apparent conductivity measurements were linearly related to <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measured with the Aqua-pro capacitance sensor below a threshold conductivity and represented the temporal patterns in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> well. During spring rainfall events that wetted only the surface soil layers the apparent conductivity measurements explained the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> dynamics at depth better than the surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> dynamics. All four EM frequencies (7. 290, 9. 090, 11. 250, and 14. 010 kHz) were highly correlated and linearly {{related to each other}} and could be used to predict <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> This limited our ability to use the four different EM frequencies to obtain a <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> profile with depth. The apparent conductivity patterns represented the observed spatial <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> patterns well when the individually fitted relationships between measured <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and apparent conductivity were used for each measurement point. However, when the same (master) relationship was used for all measurement locations, the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> patterns were smoothed and did not resemble the observed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> patterns very well. In addition the range in calculated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> values was reduced compared to observed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Part of the smoothing was likely due to the much larger measurement area of the GEM- 300 compared to the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements...|$|R
