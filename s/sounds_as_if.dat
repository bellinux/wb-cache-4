25|$|Extendable Ears {{are long}} flesh-coloured strings, {{one end of}} which is {{inserted}} into a user's ear and the other end placed further away towards a conversation or sound. Much like a listening device, the user {{will be able to}} hear the <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were much closer to the source. They were first introduced by Fred and George Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when they used the ears to listen to the Order's meetings, until one was destroyed (and eaten) by Crookshanks.|$|E
25|$|Zanfona (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, {{with three}} melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older {{examples}} had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually {{tuned to the}} key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the bordonciño in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the bordón in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the bordonciño (this string was sometimes known as the human voice, because it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> someone is humming the melody an octave lower).|$|E
500|$|Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{gave the}} album {{one out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "the cheapest-sounding record in recent memory; it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was {{recorded}} in less time that it takes to play." [...] He did note Hung's improvement as a vocalist, saying that [...] "he sings with more confidence and at least vaguely sings something resembling the melody." [...] The New York Daily News called the album a cult classic.|$|E

They mime along to a {{prerecorded}} music, effects and narration track that may <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was lifted from a movie, or may <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been overly dramatized for effect.|$|R

500|$|While {{other members}} went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading factual books {{regarding}} serial killers, including Gordon Burn's Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West. Araya was seeking inspiration, and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself {{to sound like}} a gimmick. Araya sang the lyrics more [...] "over-the-top" [...] than done on previous albums, as King's writing style is more [...] "aggro." [...] This resulted in Kerrang! reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album's lyrics as [...] "so packed with foul and abusive language that it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> D-12 and the Sopranos family were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon." ...|$|E
500|$|The Christmas Sessions {{has been}} {{described}} as a rock and pop rock album; influences from country and jazz were also noted. [...] "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" [...] {{has been described}} as being a stadium rock song incorporating musical elements similar to rock bands U2 and Coldplay; [...] "I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day", a power ballad, was also described as being similar to U2 in sound. [...] "Gloria" [...] is a reinterpretation of [...] "Angels We Have Heard on High", modifying the melody of the song's chorus. [...] "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" [...] utilizes a [...] "multilayered arrangement... that <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were tailored for a Super Bowl halftime show". The song, along with [...] "Little Drummer Boy", begins with a rock-oriented opening before transitioning into a power ballad form.|$|E
500|$|Kemp {{describes}} Tippett's central {{problem in}} composing A Child of Our Time as [...] integrating {{the language of}} the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett was, in Kemp's view, entirely successful in this respect; [...] "O by and by", he says, <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it could almost have been composed by Tippett. To assist the process of integration the composer had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the Hall Johnson Choir, which provided him with [...] a three-part model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals: [...] chorus, soloists, chorus. [...] Tippett's instructions in the score specify that [...] "the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly 'swung'".|$|E

500|$|More recent {{critical}} {{attention to}} [...] "The Homosexuals" [...] {{has also been}} mixed, trending to the negative. In one corner, anchor Mike Wallace is praised for debunking negative stereotypes about gay men. In the other, Wallace's commentary is condemned as [...] "a string of gross generalizations and negative stereotypes [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was scripted by Rev. Jerry Falwell." [...] In noting that approximately 20% of television viewers in the United States saw the program, LGBT activist Wayne Besen labels the broadcast [...] "the single most destructive hour of antigay propaganda in our nation's history." [...] He says that [...] " [...] not only had a devastating effect on public opinion but also was a nuclear bomb dropped on the psyches {{of gay and lesbian}} Americans, who, prior to this show, had never been represented as a group on national television." ...|$|E
500|$|The first parody {{recorded}} for Even Worse was [...] "I Think I'm a Clone Now". The song, a spoof of [...] "I Think We're Alone Now" [...] as covered by Tiffany, {{is the story}} of a man who details his life as a clone of himself. The second parody recorded was [...] "Alimony", a parody of [...] "Mony Mony" [...] as covered by Billy Idol. The song is a diatribe about the narrator's ex-wife, who takes everything he owns for alimony payments. Although the song <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were recorded live—complete with clapping, screaming, and yelling—the track was entirely recorded in the studio. [...] This is the first instance of Yankovic covering two songs originally made famous by the same artist on one album, as both [...] "Mony Mony" [...] and [...] "I Think We're Alone Now" [...] were songs first performed by Tommy James and the Shondells.|$|E
500|$|A remix {{version for}} the song, [...] "Jackie's In Love In The Club Mix", done by DJ Jackie Christie, was made {{available}} {{as one of}} the exclusive tracks of the American and European maxi-single release of the song. She maintained Madonna's vocals and the gospel choir appearance, commenting that [...] "I was asked to remix 'Nothing Fails' [...] I wanted it to be a mainfloor mix with a big choir breakdown so you felt the magic of the Madonna and the choir, like church." [...] Peter Rauhofer's remix of the song was added along with the remixes of the follow-up single, [...] "Love Profusion". Another version, the [...] "Jason Nevins Mix", was included on Madonna's 2003 remix album Remixed & Revisited. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic commented that on this remix, Madonna <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she is {{out of step with the}} music of 2003.|$|E

500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear has turned to aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he's singing through clenched teeth, spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, shit, and from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga". [...] "Scream" [...] incorporates elements of pop, R, hip-hop, funk and rock.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Nimrod {{three and a}} half stars out of five, calling it an [...] "invigorating, if occasionally frustrating listen", and although he praised Armstrong's [...] "gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies", he noted that [...] "the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed." [...] Greg Kot of Rolling Stone enjoyed the album's melodic nature as well as the [...] "measure of sincerity" [...] present in Armstrong's vocals. [...] Kot appreciated the return of the band's [...] "juvenile sense of humor" [...] that he felt was lacking on Insomniac, and praised the musical diversity on the record, remarking, [...] "This music {{is a long way from}} Green Day's apprenticeship at the Gilman Street punk clubs, in Berkeley, Calif. But now that the band has seen the world, it's only fitting that Green Day should finally make an album that <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it has." ...|$|E
500|$|The World of Strawberry Shortcake was {{reviewed}} twice by the School Library Journal. [...] In the December 1983 issue, Margaret Bush {{said that the}} [...] "Story, characters, dialogue and bits of stage business are busy, bright, contrived, and will appeal of young children." [...] She added, however, that [...] "Some of the lyrics and dialogue are not easily understoodit <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> adult voices may be attempting to simulate the voices of small children." [...] In August 2007, Kirsten Martindale gave the DVD set a positive review. She wrote that [...] "Fans [...] will be thoroughly engaged by these two episodes", and recommended it [...] "For nostalgic moms and their young daughters." [...] She however singled out the audio and video quality: [...] "or those who haven't experienced the charm and simplicity of older cartoons, this may be annoying, but the nostalgic effect of the original presentation is relaxed and welcome." [...] In 1987, Kathleen Pulcini of The Video Directory called it [...] "Delightful fun for children." ...|$|E

500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic editor Andre Barnes {{views the}} mixtape's music as {{distinct}} from East Coast hip hop, calling it [...] "sonically out of place, recasting the feel of East Coast hip-hop into a quintessential, albeit progressive southern aesthetic with its country funk and cosmic, syrupy backdrops." [...] Jon Caramanica calls Live. Love. ASAP [...] "placeless and universal, an album that <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it has ingested the last 20 years of hip-hop’s travels and would be comfortable anywhere." [...] Caramanica notes characteristics of various hip hop scenes other than that of New York's scene, including [...] "chewy, slowed-down homages to Houston" [...] and [...] "nods to New Orleans and Atlanta and the Bay Area and everywhere else hip-hop is made." [...] Alvin Aqua Blanco of HipHopDX writes that the music's grooves [...] "generally stay on the DJ Screw side of the BPMs". Consequence of Sound editor Mike Madden notes its musical dynamic as [...] "Southern flavors crossbreed with plenty of cloudy ambient-rap moments" [...] and views that the cadences of the beats consequently [...] "dictate" [...] ASAP Rocky's rapping style.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Lindgren of The New York Times {{stated that}} the [...] "record <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were made to slip quietly into the marketplace, connect with the {{faithful}} and leave everyone else alone", and that [...] "there's no catchy single, and not even the slightest echo of anything else happening in pop music now." [...] He added that the [...] "band's grooves still sound taut, emotive and world-class." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Guardian gave the album two out of five stars. In the review he stated that [...] "Riot Act isn't one thing or the other: tracks such as [...] "Ghost" [...] or [...] "Get Right" [...] gesture towards hard rock without really putting the hammer down, while a more reflective piece like [...] "All or None" [...] doesn't exploit its own possibilities." [...] Sweeting observed, [...] "On full, Pearl Jam sound like Stillwater, Cameron Crowe's fictional 1970s second-raters from his film Almost Famous." [...] Kyle Reiter of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness", and stated that it [...] " [...] them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory." ...|$|E

500|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{wrote that}} the album [...] "feels more like a band record than {{anything}} [...] done in decades". He praises Clarke's choice in bandmates, calling them [...] "prodigies in their own right" [...] but does not praise the whole album. He called [...] "Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu's Report" [...] a [...] "clumsy, failed attempt at summing up the music's history to date" [...] and that [...] "Bass Folk Song No. 6" [...] does not [...] "work [...] well" [...] {{as some of the}} other tracks but [...] "these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording". Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there [...] "are no radical departures" [...] on this album and it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Clarke is [...] "taking a victory lap here, revisiting past triumphs" [...] but that he [...] "still pull sounds out of his assortment of electric, acoustic and Alembic basses like nobody else, and [...] still slapping, plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary, fusion jazz, rock, funk and whatever else he puts his mind to".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{felt that}} the {{presence}} of a [...] "strong hook and a strong sense of fun" [...] was missing from the compilation, except for the song [...] "Your Honesty", which he declared as the best track despite feeling its beats to be a little outdated. He compared the work of the remixers as [...] "as subtle as a jackhammer, whether it's on the metallic-flaked [...] "American Life" [...] by Headcleanr or the '90s-retro Nevins mix of [...] "Nothing Fails". On all these mixes, Madonna <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she's {{out of step with the}} music of 2003". Erlewine also compared Spears' vocals with that of Madonna's during her early days and Aguilera's with that of Cher's. Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone commented that the release [...] "improves upon American Lifes standout single [...] "Love Profusion", but the rest botches an opportunity to revive interest on its parent album". Fabian from Daily Breeze commented that Remixed & Revisited [...] "is an amusing collection of novelties." [...] Sarah Crompton from Boston Herald proclaimed the album to be [...] "more fun than her full-length 2003 offering American Life." [...] The Malay Mail said that the remixes from the album are for [...] "true blue Madonna fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Written {{in the key}} of E major, [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] paces at a {{moderate}} tempo of 104 beats per minute. The song features instrumentation from a [...] "happy" [...] xylophone and a [...] "rubbery" [...] bass guitar. An editor of the Corvallis Gazette-Times described its melody as [...] "cheery" [...] and [...] "propulsive", while Sean Adams from Drowned in Sound called it [...] "infectious". Although its main genre is pop rock, Adams and Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian denoted the song as delving into pop, more than the band's previous material. The former also compared it to the works of Incubus, while Nicholson stated, [...] " [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Alexander O'Neal has just discovered Refused's back catalogue". Theon Weber of Spin labeled it as [...] "bouncy" [...] while denoting it as a new wave song. Writing for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski described the song as a mixture of rhythm and blues and pop; Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone characterized it as [...] "soul-powered". Cameron Adams from News.com.au {{described it as a}} funk rock song, while Scott Heisel from Alternative Press classified it as a [...] "blast of new jack swing". Barbara Schultz at Common Sense Media categorized it as a [...] "funky alt-rock arrangement".|$|E
