50|$|Thorndike's law {{of effect}} refutes {{the ideas of the}} book Animal Intelligence written by Romanes, stating that anecdotal {{evidence}} is weak and is typically not useful. The book stated that animals, like humans, think things through when dealing with a new environment or situation. Instead, Thorndike hypothesized that animals, to understand their physical environment, must physically interact with it using trial and error, until a successful result is obtained. This is illustrated in his cat experiment, in which a cat is placed in a <b>shuttlebox</b> and eventually learns, by interacting with the environment of the box, how to escape.|$|E
50|$|Experiments {{have been}} done in which rats were exposed to soman to test if {{behavioral}} effects could be seen at low doses without generating overt symptoms. Exposure of the rats to soman in a dose of less than 3 percent of the LD50 caused alterations of the behavior. The active avoidance of the exposed rats was less than the avoidance of non-exposed rats (two-way <b>shuttlebox</b> experiment). Also the motor coordination (hurdle-stepping task), open field behavior and active as well as passive avoidance behavior were affected. One can conclude that rats that are exposed to soman performed with less success in tasks that require motor activity as well as the function of higher structures of the central nervous system (CNS) on the same time. In this, soman has a predominantly central effect.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{zebrafish}} {{in behavioral}} neuroscience is rapidly growing. Zebrafish {{can be assessed}} for alterations in multiple behavioral endpoints, creating opportunities to use this powerful model to identify chemicals that alter behavioral phenotypes. To evaluate the utility of zebrafish for neurotoxicity research, we designed custom instrumentation to evaluate numerous embryonic and adult zebrafish behaviors. PRAT or Photomotor Response Analysis Tool was {{used to analyze the}} embryonic photomotor response (EPR) behavior in embryonic zebrafish (24 hours post fertilization). <b>Shuttleboxes</b> were used to evaluate learning and active avoidance conditioning and a zebrafish Visual Imaging System (zVIS) was used to measure fear responses. Social behavior was observed using Viewpoint tracking software. Startle responses were also analyzed using taps and Noldus Ethiovision XT tracking software. EPR results showed differential movement activities throughout development of larval zebrafish. Highest movement peaks were seen in 35 - 37 hours post fertilization fish. Using these custom analysis tools, we also evaluated the impact of Vitamin E deficiency and developmental Benzo[a]pyrene exposure on complex adult behaviors. Generational effects of BaP exposure were also tested. Zebrafish were fed defined-diets that either had sufficient or deficient levels of Vitamin E. The vitamin E deficient zebrafish had a ~ 30 % decrease in learning rate relative to the fish with sufficient levels of Vitamin E. Startle response data showed that vitamin E deficient fish do not get desensitized to tap stimulus. Three exposure groups and generations were reared and spawned for the BaP study (0. 1 % DMSO controls, 1. 25 ppm BaP, 2. 5 ppm BaP). The zVIS system consists of an array of 8 tanks with only single side views of video projections on LCD monitors. This allows individual fish to visualize either a group of swimming zebrafish or single predator fish. For the socialization assay zebrafish were tracked using Viewpoint tracking software. Distances apart from each other were measured and analyzed in BaP exposed fish. For the predator test, zebrafish were expected {{to move away from the}} screen. The proximity of the zebrafish is tracked relative to the LCD screen projections. The preliminary results from BaP exposed zebrafish and 0. 1 % DMSO controls showed the percent of time spent away from the screen during the predator test or fear response assay was in the high 70 % range for all fish. The 2. 5 ppm BaP fish had on average the highest percentage (65 % vs 50 %) time spent away from the screen. Although it is uncertain as of now if there are any generational effects because further analysis is needed. Preliminary shoaling data shows that shoaling speed may be affected by DMSO exposure. The use of DMSO controls may not be optimal for this study. Disassociation is seen in both 1. 25 ppm BaP and 2. 5 ppm BaP exposure groups in the F 2 generation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that custom behavioral systems are able to measure complex behavioral phenotypes and suggests that there are enormous opportunities for translation neurotoxicity research using zebrafish...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} etiracetam, a {{structural}} analogue or piracetam, were investigated in rats on Y-maze discrimination acquisition, on open field behavior, on one-trial passive avoidance learning and on <b>shuttlebox</b> acquisition and extinction. The {{results indicate that}} this drug significantly enhances acquisition and may improve retention without having any detectable effects on spontaneous behavior, not even in very high doses (500 mg/kg IP). Sensitivity to footshock, measured as 'flinch' thresholds, was not altered by etiracetam in doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg IP. For a <b>shuttlebox</b> task the effective dose-range lies between 20 - 30 mg/kg IP, provided pretreatment during 4 days is given. Without pretreatment, i. e. when the drug is only administered during the relatively fast acquisition in the <b>shuttlebox,</b> {{it was found that}} acquisition was not enhanced, but extinction of the acquired behavior was significantly inhibited.

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{investigated}} the behavior of hypertensive-prone and nonhypertensive-prone rat strains to see {{whether there are differences}} in behavioral reactivity to environmental stimulation. Of primary interest was general activity, because investigators have assumed it to be an index of reactivity to environmental stimulation and to be correlated with the elevation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Therefore, general activity was assessed in SHRs and WKYs as a function of walking and rearing in an open field (Experiments 1 and 2) and crossings in a <b>shuttlebox</b> test (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Activity was assessed under a constant level of environmental stimulation in the open field (Experi-ment 1) and <b>shuttlebox</b> (Experiment 3) or under varying degrees of stimulation in the open field (Experiment 2) and <b>shuttlebox</b> (Experiments 4 and 5). In the open field and the <b>shuttlebox,</b> SHR activity was above WKY activity when the degree of environmental stimulation was constant. Howev-er, when stimulation was manipulated, the SHR activity level was similar for all intensity levels, while the WKYactivity was inversely related to stimulus intensity. These results suggest that while the SHRs may generally be more active than WKYs, WKYs display a greater behavioral reactivity to environ-mental stimulation than SHRs.

40|$|Dogs given inescapable shock in a Pavlovian harness later seem to "give up" and passively accept {{traumatic}} shock in <b>shuttlebox</b> escape/avoidance training. A theoretical {{analysis of}} this phenomenon was presented. As predicted by this analysis, the failure to escape was alleviated by repeatedly compelling the dog to make the response which terminated shock. This maladaptive passive behavior {{in the face of}} trauma may be related to maladaptive passive behavior in humans. The importance of instrumental control over aversive events in the cause, prevention, and treatment of such behaviors was discussed. This paper discusses a procedure that produces a striking behavior abnormality in dogs, outlines an analysis which predicts a method for eliminating the abnormality, and presents data which support the prediction. When a normal, nai've dog receives escape/avoidance training in a <b>shuttlebox,</b> the following behavior typically occurs: At the onset of electric shock, the dog runs frantically about, defecating, urinating, and howling, until it scrambles over the barrier and so escapes from shock. On the next trial, the dog, running and howling, crosses the barrier more quickly, and so on until efficient avoidance emerges. See Solomon and Wynne (1953) for a detailed description. Overmier and Seligman (1967) have reported the behavior of dogs which had received inescapable shock while strapped in a Pavlovian harness 24 hr. before <b>shuttlebox</b> training. Typically, such a dog reacts initially to shock in the <b>shuttlebox</b> {{in the same manner as}} the naive dog.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the development of novel stimulus-response associations by the mother during the periparturient period is attributable to a general facilitation of learning produced by the hormonal milieu during that period, learning ability under various reproductive conditions was assessed in two tasks unrelated to the periparturitional situation. The two tasks, selected because they equalized the various groups for motivation and performance variables, were acquisition of a water-maze escape (including two reversals), and acquisition and retention of an unsignalled <b>shuttlebox</b> shock avoidance. The groups tested in the water maze were a midpregnant group, an immediately prepartum group, and an immediately postpartum group. In the <b>shuttlebox,</b> the same conditions (different rats) were compared, together with a nonpregnant estrus condition, and a nonpregnant diestrus condition.

Experiment II studied spontaneous recovery using the traditional measure, number of trials required to extinguish the response, in comparison with the number of trials required to re-extinguish it. The effect for extinction in experiment II was significant, as all subjects were resistant toward initial extinction; the delay effect did not reach a conventional significance level.

40|$|Prior to <b>shuttlebox</b> {{avoidance}} training rats {{were exposed}} to 30 trials of a punishment situation in which shock was contingent on activity level. The period during which contingencies were effective on each pretraining trial was divided into two halves.

Recent data implicate neuroplasticity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as critical to behavioral immunization. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed {{to a series of}} controllable tailshocks and one week later to uncontrollable tailshocks, followed 24 h later by social exploration and <b>shuttlebox</b> escape tests. To test the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in behavioral immunization, either D-AP 5 or the MEK inhibitor U 0126 was injected to the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) mPFC prior to controllable stress exposure. Phosphorylated ERK and P 70 S 6 K, regulators of transcription and translation, were quantified by Western blot or immunohistochemistry after controllable or uncontrollable tailshocks. Prior controllable stress prevented the social exploration and <b>shuttlebox</b> performance deficits caused by the later uncontrollable stressor, and this effect was blocked by injections of D-AP 5 into mPFC. A significant increase in phosphorylated ERK 1 and ERK 2, but not P 70 S 6 K, occurred within the PL and IL in rats exposed to controllable stress, but not to uncontrollable stress. However, U 0126 only prevented behavioral immunization when injected to the PL.

Some time ago, I was doing research in my lab on the phenomenon of 2 ̆ 2 learned helplessness. 2 ̆ 2 This research usually involved using the traditional triadic experimental design in which separate groups of rats initially received one of three conditions in a wheel-turn box: escapable shock, yoked-inescapable shock, or no shock. On the next day, these groups were tested in another room to determine how well they could learn an escape response from shock in a <b>shuttlebox</b> that required 5 trials of single crossing followed by 25 trials of two crossings. In some of these studies, but certainly not in all of them, I found the 2 ̆ 2 learned helplessness effect 2 ̆ 2 (LHE) in which the previously yoked group of rats did not learn to escape in the <b>shuttlebox</b> in contrast to good escape learning shown by the escape and the no-shock groups. The question that concerned me, as well as others, was why were the results from such studies so equivocal in terms of demonstrating the LHE? Upon further investigation, I consistently noted that when the odors of previously tested rats were present (often inadvertently) in the <b>shuttlebox,</b> there was a greater chance of demonstrating the LHE. From these exploratory studies, I hypothesized that the odors emitted from previously shocked rats (i. e., con specifics) probably {{played a significant role in}} determining the magnitude to which the LHE might be found.

40|$|Temperature {{preference}} and limits were determined for locally captured, juvenile lionfish at four different acclimation temperatures (13 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C and 32 °C). Temperature preferences were evaluated using an automated <b>shuttlebox</b> system that presents temperature stimuli in a subject-driven fashion. The <b>shuttlebox</b> system circulates two temperatures of water within a dumbbell-shaped tank, maintaining {{a difference of}} 3 °C between sides. Movement of the subject to the “warm” tank increased temperature stimulus; movements to the “cold” side decreased temperature stimuli in both tanks (maintaining the 3 °C differential).

Thermal tolerance polygons will provide a visual representation to the lower and upper thermal avoidance temperatures of the invasive lionfish, delineating the preferred thermal range of the species. A species’ thermal {{preference and}} tolerance are important mechanistic drivers affecting behavior and geographic distribution and thus are relevant to fisheries management. Thermal preference data could assist lionfish population management in pinpointing abundance hotspots, allowing removal efforts to be more efficient. Thermal tolerance describes the range in which lionfish can survive, and how this range changes with acclimation temperature. Due to increasing ocean temperatures, the current range of the invasive lionfish could expand geographically into higher latitudes, similar to expectations for native tropical fishes, with unknown implications for ecosystem processes...|$|E

The present study was designed to test two competing theories of learned helplessness. Conditioned attention theory states that learned helplessness is one form of latent inhibition, which is an interference effect resulting from preexposure to a stimulus which is not reliably paired with a second event (E(, 2)). According to this theory, the presence of a reliable E(, 2) during preexposure will reduce the learned helplessness effect. On the other hand, expectancy/attribution theory states that prior experience with uncontrollable outcomes leads to expectancies of future uncontrollability and concomitant performance decrements. Attributions regarding the cause of uncontrollability are said to influence the generality, severity, and chronicity of learned helplessness effects. Six groups of female undergraduates were formed by the 2 x 3 factorial combination of E(, 2) condition (E(, 2) present vs. E(, 2) absent) and perceived control condition (high control vs. low control vs. no control). High-control subjects received preexposure to escapable tones with control instructions. Low-control subjects received preexposure to inescapable tones with control instructions. No-control subjects were preexposed to inescapable tones with noncontrol instructions. A seventh group received no preexposure treatment and served as a baseline comparison group. All subjects were tested on a shuttlebox-escape task and an anagram task. Self-report measures assessed depressed mood prior to the experiment, and assessed depressed mood and attributional style after the experimental manipulations. A learned helplessness effect was obtained on the <b>shuttlebox</b> task, but not on the anagram task. With no effects for E(, 2) condition, the results failed to support the hypothesis that learned helplessness is a form of latent inhibition. Rather, expectancy/attribution theory was supported by the finding that low- and no-control subjects displayed impaired performance on the <b>shuttlebox</b> task. Expectancy/attribution theory was also supported by the finding that depressed mood was related to an increased tendency to attribute failure to ability, and a decreased tendency to attribute success to ability and effort...|$|E

40|$|The {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio) {{promises to}} meet the growing needs of gerontological and neurobehavioral research by possessing highly conserved anatomy and physiology with all other vertebrates, while having low maintenance costs and requiring only simple care. The neurological and physiological bases of learning, memory formation, and memory retention have been studied {{in a variety of}} model organisms, such as the rat, mouse, sheep, and several teleost fishes, the notable example being the zebrafish. Unfortunately, most of these animals are poorly suited to senescence research due to costs, care requirements, or long life spans. My research expands upon our rapidly growing understanding of zebrafish neurobiology, learning processes, sensory modalities, and memory retention. Two pairs of distinct aversive conditioning experiments using classic <b>shuttlebox</b> designs compared the effects of sensory modality and conditioned-unconditioned stimulus (CS-US) intervals, the time delay between application of conditioned sensory stimulus and delivery of the stressful unconditioned stimulus in the event of failure to avoid it, upon memory formation and retention. These studies yielded a general spectrum of results against which future conditioning studies may be compared. Both visual and olfactory stimuli were tested, as were 10 second and 15 second CS-US intervals. Successes were scored when the fish crossed the <b>shuttlebox</b> hurtle within the CS-US interval, thereby avoiding the negative unconditioned stimulus. After a three-month delay, ten additional trials were conducted to compare the long-term memory retention resulting from each protocol. When testing a 15 s CS-US interval, olfactory conditioning was significantly more likely (39 %) to produce a successful outcome (memory formation) than visual conditioning. Grouped results reveal that the second pair of experiments, each with a 10 s CS-US interval, yielded significantly more successful memory formation than a 15 s CS-US interval. A significant difference was found when comparing the results of any two experiments, except between the results of the visual and olfactory 10 s interval experiments). Only the olfactory experiment using a 15 s CS-US interval yielded memory retention results significantly higher than the mean of memory retention results from the four experiments. These findings offer inconclusive evidence supporting olfaction’s strong role in memory formation and retention in zebrafish. The results expand our understanding {{of the relationship between the}} olfactory and visual senses and memory in the zebrafish and indicate the olfactory sense’s key role in vertebrate neurobiology, warranting further research into the effects of aging on the olfactory-memory modality...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{assessed the}} relative aversiveness of different duration preshock (PS) signals (5 and 20 sec) and different duration stimuli identifying shock-free periods. In Exp I, the responding of 15 of 18 female Sprague-Dawley rats was maintained when it produced changes from a predictable-shock condition with a 5 -sec PS signal to an identical schedule with a 20 -sec PS signal; responding was not maintained when it produced the opposite changes. These results occurred with intershock intervals of both 120 and 240 sec. Exp II assessed whether changing to the 20 -sec schedule was maintained by {{properties of the}} PS signals identifying the shock periods or by properties of the stimuli identifying the shock-free periods. Four similar rats were given training with the 2 signaled schedules in an operant chamber and then later given off-baseline preference tests in a <b>shuttlebox.</b> When given a choice between PS signals, Ss chose the 5 -sec over the 20 -sec signals. However, when given a choice between stimuli identifying shock-free periods, Ss chose the stimulus identifying the shorter shock-free periods (i. e., the one previously correlated with the 20 -sec signals). Findings are discussed within the R. A. Rescorla and A. R. Wagner (1972) model of stimulus compounds and {{within the context of}} safety as a contrast phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Anxiety-related {{behaviours}} {{were evaluated}} across various tests in a 800 F 2 -intercross of the Roman high- and low-avoidance inbred rats. These tests either evoke unlearned (open field [OF]; plus-maze [PM]; hole-board [HB]; spontaneous activity [A]; and acoustic startle reflex [ASR]) or learned (classical fear conditioning [CFC]; and <b>shuttlebox</b> avoidance conditioning [SAC]), anxious/fearful responses. Using factor analysis (oblique rotation), we obtained a six-fold solution with 14 variables derived from all tests. These six factors represented SAC, CFC, PM anxiety, PM and OF activity, ASR anxiety, plus a mixed whole of anxious and activity variables (from OF and A), respectively. In {{searching for a}} smaller number of meaningful factors, we applied a three-factor solution that coherently corresponded with differentiated facets of fearfulness, rather than with the tests. Results showed that (1) measures of SAC and CFC strongly loaded onto Factor 1, labelled as "Learned Fear"; (2) a blend of almost all variables loaded onto Factor 2, called "Emotional Reactivity"; and (3) open arm behaviour in the PM loaded onto Factor 3, called "Fear of Heights. " After discussing limitations of this apparently consistent behavioural map of anxiety, we advance some connections between those factors with quantitative trait loci candidates (genetic markers) as detected in the same sample [14]. 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|The habitat {{requirements}} of juvenile Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) were assessed in the Williston watershed, British Columbia, where {{the population is}} currently red-listed (critically imperiled). Temperature preferences of juvenile Arctic grayling was assessed behaviorally using a <b>shuttlebox</b> system, and an information theoretic approach analysis of logistic regression models {{was used to evaluate}} the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of juvenile Arctic grayling throughout the Williston watershed. Temperature preference of juvenile Arctic grayling did not vary between the two tributaries in the watershed (p = 0. 77) and the average preferred temperature was 16. 84 ± 0. 66 °C (n = 28). Comparisons of the preferred temperature to ambient water temperatures suggested that juvenile Arctic grayling will avoid areas where maximum water temperature is above the preferred temperature. There was a positive association between juvenile Arctic grayling occurrence and stream order (SO) and stream order multiplied by distance from the Williston reservoir (SDRxSO), as well as a negative association with the mean daily water temperature variance (varT) and average water temperature (aveT). Overall these findings suggest that large river systems are important juvenile Arctic grayling habitat and management decision should be made to ensure protection of this habitat throughout the range of this species.

40|$|Few {{studies in}} the area of psychodietetics have {{concentrated}} upon the relationship between a single dietary nutrient and behavior. However, some vitamins {{have been shown to be}} particularly important to central nervous system activity. Among these is Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Two experiments were done to determine the effects of ascorbic acid deficient diets on a learning task in which guinea pigs were subjects. Learning was defined as acquisition and extinction of shock-escape and shock-avoidance behavior. In Experiment I, twelve adult guinea pigs were fed diets containing two different deficient amounts of ascorbic acid for six weeks. They were then run on shock-escape, shock-avoidance and extinction schedules. No significant differences in behavior among the dietary groups were shown by statistical analysis, either in acquisition or extinction. In Experiment II, three adult guinea pigs were fed the same ascorbic acid-deficient diets as in Experiment I for six weeks after a baseline performance on a <b>shuttlebox</b> shock avoidance schedule was obtained. Performance after dietary treatment among or across subjects was not observably different from the performance prior to treatment. Serum and adrenal protein analysis confirmed that the dietary treatment had lowered the total ascorbic acid content of the serum and adrenals, but behavior did not show a corresponding or consistent change. These results indicate that ascorbic acid deficient diets fed to adult guinea pigs did not result in a change in behavior as observed on shock-escape, shock-avoidance, or extinction schedules...|$|E
40|$|In postcrash {{aircraft}} fires, only a {{few minutes}} are often available for egress. To assess the potential of combustion gases to impair human escape, a signalled avoidance task was developed for use with the juvenile baboon. After a 5 -minute exposure, the animal was required to select and depress the correct lever to open an escape door and exit into the adjacent compartment of a shut-tlebox. With CO, the EC 50 for escape failure was 6850 ppm. Acrolein (l 2 to 2780 ppm) neither prevented escape nor affected escape times, despite irritant effects at all concentrations. Similar results were obtained with HCl (190 to 17, 200 ppm) in that, all animals successfully performed the escape task, even at concentrations that produced severe post-exposure effects and lethality. With a comparable <b>shuttlebox</b> and escape paradigm for rats, the EC 50 of CO was 6780 ppm. Fi ve-mi nute exposures to HCl (11, 800 to 76, 730 ppm) did not prevent escape but severe post-exposure respi ratory effects and lethal ity occurred at 15, 000 ppm and higher. In both species, HCl did not affect escape time but the number of intertrial responses was significantly related to concentration. The results indicate that the rat and the baboon have a comparable tolerance to CO and irri-tant gases and that laboratory test methods of incapacitation of rodents may be useful in evaluating the potential of combustion gas atmospheres containing CO and irritant gases to prevent human escape...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} sex {{differences}} in a large sample (about 400 for each sex) of F 2 -generation rats, derived from inbred Roman high- and low-avoidance strains differing in fearfulness and brain functioning, was investigated. We obtained measures from responses to a battery of novel/threatening tests [open field (OF), plus maze (PM), hole board (HB), activity (A), and acoustic startle reflex (ASR) ] as well as learned fear paradigms [classical fear conditioning (CFC) and <b>shuttlebox</b> avoidance conditioning (SAC) ]. The results showed that almost all behaviors assessed fit with a pattern of unidirectional sex effects characterized by male rats as being more fearful than females: males defecated more than females in the OF, PM, HB, ASR, and CFC; ambulated less in the OF, PM, A, and SAC; showed more self-grooming in PM and HB; explored the open arms of the PM and the holes of the HB less; displayed enhanced ASR; and showed poorer performance in the SAC task. We applied two factor analyses to each sex showing that, in general, they shared a common three-factor structure: a Learned Fear Factor comprising SAC and CFC responding, a Fear of Heights/Open Spaces Factor with the highest loadings for open arm behavior in the PM, and an Emotional Reactivity Factor, mainly grouping defecations, ambulation, and self-grooming. These {{results indicate that the}} essential components of fearful behavior are similar for both sexes in an inbred but genetically heterogeneous population...|$|E
