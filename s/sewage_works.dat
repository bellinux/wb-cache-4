5|$|At this time, one of De Morgan's 1902 tablets was removed. Commemorating four {{workers who}} had died in an {{accident}} at the East Ham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Works</b> in 1895, Watts had mistakenly listed the incident as having taken place at the West Ham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Works</b> in 1885. The DeMorgan tablet was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton tablet giving the correct location and date. As the Doulton tablets were in such a different style to DeMorgan's, the replacement tablet was installed in the second row next to the three new tablets to police officers, rather than in the space left by the original.|$|E
5|$|All 24 tablets of {{the fourth}} row, {{designed}} and manufactured by Royal Doulton, were added as a single batch in August 1908. A single Royal Doulton tablet to PC Alfred Smith was added in June 1919, followed in October 1930 by similar Royal Doulton tablets to three further police officers, and a replacement tablet with the correct details of the East Ham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Works</b> incident of 1895. A single tablet made by Fred Passenger in the original DeMorgan style, honouring schoolboy Herbert Maconoghu, was added in April 1931 {{to fill the gap}} in the centre row left by the removal of the original, incorrect tablet to the victims of the East Ham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Works</b> incident.

5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 <b>sewage</b> <b>works</b> for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Great Depression, {{employment}} within the Rhondda Valleys continued to fall. This in turn led to a decline in public and social services, as people struggled to pay rates and rents. One of the outcomes of a lack of funds was a fall in health provisions, which in Rhondda lead to a lack of medical and nursing staff, a failure to provide adequate <b>sewage</b> <b>works</b> and a rise in deaths from tuberculosis. By 1932 the long-term unemployment figure in the Rhondda was recorded at 63%, and in Ferndale the unemployment figure for adult males rose as high as 72.85%.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Sheffield City Council {{negotiated}} with Yorkshire Water and leased an unused {{part of the}} former <b>sewage</b> <b>works</b> for 99 years, at an annual rent of one peppercorn, to enable it to be reclaimed {{and turned into a}} nature reserve. In order to manage the project, a consortium was formed, with representation from Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wildlife Trust, South Yorkshire Forest and Yorkshire Water. It now provides habitat for migrating birds, for which it is an area of European significance. The Wildlife Trust run an active programme of school education visits. In 2005 the City Council exercised an option to increase the size of the reserve by taking over additional land from Yorkshire Water.|$|E

40|$|Natural and {{synthetic}} steroidal estrogens (estrone, 17 β-estradiol and 17 α-ethinylestradiol) are endocrine disrupters, that are discharged consistently from the <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> into surface waters, thereby causing endocrine disrupting effects to aquatic organisms at trace concentrations (nanogram per litre). Several {{years of research}} have been focused on their fate, behaviour and removal in the environment but primarily in the <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> which acts as a sink for these compounds.

5|$|The tablets are {{arranged}} on the second, {{third and fourth}} of the five rows, with 24 tablets to William De Morgan's original design in the third, central, row, the 24 tablets added in 1908 directly below in the fourth row, and more recent additions above the original tiles in the second row. The first and fifth of the five rows remain empty. The first four tablets, designed and manufactured by DeMorgan and installed in 1900, were each made from two large custom-made tiles. Nine further De Morgan tablets, installed in 1902, were made using standard tiles to reduce costs, and were the last tiles whose installation was overseen by Watts. Eleven further DeMorgan tablets, along with T. H. Wren's memorial to Watts, were added in 1905, completing the central row of tablets. All 24 tablets of the 4th row, designed and manufactured by Royal Doulton, were added as a single batch in August 1908. A single Royal Doulton tablet to PC Alfred Smith was added in June 1919, followed in October 1930 by similar Royal Doulton tablets to three further police officers, and a replacement tablet with the correct details of the East Ham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Works</b> incident of 1895.

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive {{properties for}} merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 <b>sewage</b> <b>works</b> for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E
5|$|Morleys Hall lies {{on part of}} {{the lands}} donated to Cockersand Abbey by Hugh Tyldesley in 1210. It was owned by the Morleys until 1431, then {{subsequently}} by the Leylands. In 1540 it was described as being largely built of timber on stone foundations and surrounded by a moat. It was rebuilt in 1804, but parts of the old hall survive. Edward Tyldesley of Wardley Hall married Anne Leyland and inherited Morleys in 1564. Their granddaughter, Elizabeth Tyldesley, became abbess of the Convent of Poor Clares at Gravelines in the Spanish Netherlands. Sir Thomas Tyldesley was {{the most famous of}} this line of the family, having been a Cavalier commander and supporter of Charles II, King of England during the English Civil War. He died in the Battle of Wigan Lane and is buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Leigh. The hall passed through the Legh and Wilkinson families until it was sold to Tyldesley Urban District Council and the land used for a <b>sewage</b> <b>works.</b> The hall is a private residence.|$|E

40|$|Pollutants as {{endocrine}} disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are {{of worldwide}} concern, {{due to their}} {{detrimental effects on the}} physiology and behaviour of wildlife. One major source of EDCs is <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> which serve as foraging grounds for many bird species. However, the risks of consuming EDCs to wild birds at these sites have been largely overlooked. We have previously quantified contamination levels of invertebrates from within filter beds of <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> and the intake rates of these invertebrates by wild European starlings feeding at these sites. Our work to date has shown that environmentally-relevant EDC exposure results in reduced immunocompetence, increased song behaviour and neural development in adult starlings. In the present study, we hypothesized that nestling starlings exposed to similar EDC levels from contaminated prey, from parental feeding at <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works,</b> would show altered growth and physiology. Our findings show that EDC exposure results in reduced growth and immunocompetence in nestling birds. However, there was no effect on corticosterone or haematocrit levels. As growth rates and immunocompetence are likely to be related to survival rates, we suggest that these exposure levels are likely to adversely affect recruitment into the adult population. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the potential transfer of EDCs between semi-aquatic or aquatic organisms and terrestrial organisms up the food chain at sites of <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works,</b> broadening the scope of potential routes of exposure. Our findings suggest that birds foraging in these sites are at risk of physiological manipulation from EDCs and reduced body condition as a result. We advocate further work to evaluate the potential for EDCs from <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> to bioaccumulate and modulate the condition of wild organisms feeding on contaminated prey. Our results suggest that changes in management practices of <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> are required. We support measures to reduce EDC levels in <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works</b> and that these sites should be designed to exclude or deter wildlife from foraging on contaminated prey. The management implications of such policy – oriented steps will ensure the health of wildlife foraging at <b>sewage</b> treatment <b>works...</b>|$|R

5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Works</b> accident had left an unsightly gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, but Mary Watts persuaded him to produce a single panel in the style of DeMorgan to fit into the empty space. Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|The River Lea was {{a smaller}} {{boundary}} than the Thames, {{but it was}} a significant one. The building of the Royal Docks consisting of the Royal Victoria Dock (1855), able to berth vessels of up to 8000tons; Royal Albert Dock (1880), up to 12,000tons; and King George V Dock (1921), up to 30,000tons, on the estuary marshes, extended the continuous development of London across the Lea into Essex for the first time. The railways gave access to a passenger terminal at Gallions Reach and new suburbs created in West Ham, which quickly became a major manufacturing town, with 30,000 houses built between 1871 and 1901. Soon afterwards, East Ham was built up to serve the new Gas Light and Coke Company and Bazalgette's grand <b>sewage</b> <b>works</b> at Beckton.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, {{although}} it will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory, flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When not breeding, they may also hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes, flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300may form where food is abundant, such as agricultural areas, wetlands and <b>sewage</b> <b>works.</b> The pale crag martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface, although {{at least some of}} its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes. Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry, rocky areas in which the pale crag martin nests, so there is little competition for food.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of the Leigh Poor Law Union {{comprising}} an area covering the whole of the ancient parish of Leigh and part of Winwick, established on 26 January 1837. A workhouse in Tyldesley was replaced by Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh in the 1850s. Tyldesley was constituted a civil parish in 1866. In 1863 the Local Government Act 1858 was adopted and the township was governed by a local board of health. The first Tyldesley Local Board was formed after elections on 24 October 1863. Among those elected were mill owners, Caleb Wright and Oliver Burton, and colliery owners, William Ramsden and George Green, a mixture of Tories and Liberals. The Local Board took over the gas works in 1865, built the first swimming baths and opened Tyldesley Cemetery in 1876 and built <b>sewage</b> <b>works</b> at Morleys Hall in Astley in 1884. The local board offices were in Lower Elliot Street, where it had a fire station and depot. Under the Public Health Act 1875 the local board gained additional powers as an urban sanitary district and under the Local Government Act 1894 Tyldesley-with-Shakerley became an urban district with an elected council. Tyldesley Town Hall, originally the township's Liberal Club, opened in 1881, and was taken over by Tyldesley Urban District Council as its headquarters in 1924. Tyldesley UDC opened Tyldesley Park in 1902, the Carnegie Library officially opened in 1909, and after World War I council housing was built at Sale Lane and Mosley Common and after World War II in Shakerley.|$|E

25|$|Biogas from {{sewage sludge}} {{treatment}} is sometimes {{used to run}} a gas engine to produce electrical power, {{some or all of}} which can be used to run the <b>sewage</b> <b>works.</b> Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester.
