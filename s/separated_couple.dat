25|$|Marital rape is not a {{criminal}} offence within Indian legal framework, except during the period of judicial separation of the partners. The marital rape exception has restricted application when the wife has been living separately from the husband, under or without a decree of judicial separation. In such cases, again the husband can be prosecuted but, if convicted, the minimum punishment is imprisonment {{for two years and}} imposition of fine (Section 376B, IPC). This clause was enacted in the year 1983, a watershed in the history of rape law reform in India, when major changes were brought in the law of rape {{for the first time since}} its enactment by the colonial state in 1860. The parliamentary committee that gave final shape to the 1983 amendments was reluctant to treat non-consensual sex between a <b>separated</b> <b>couple</b> as amounting to rape, on the ground that a rape charge might mar the chances of reconciliation between a <b>separated</b> <b>couple</b> and make divorce inevitable. Hence, the minimum sentence stipulated for this category of rape was set much lower than that in general.|$|E

40|$|Research {{and theory}} {{indicate}} that satisfaction {{is a key}} determinant of commitment. Because some marriages are defined by a traditional ideology that anchors commitment in a value system rather than inherent rewards of the relationship, the association between satisfaction and commitment was expected to vary by couple type. Participants completed self-report measures of relational ideology, autonomy, communication, sat-isfaction, and several types of commitment. Results indicated that <b>separate</b> <b>couples</b> reported the lowest marital satisfaction and personal commitment of all the <b>couple</b> types. <b>Separate</b> <b>couples</b> also reported the lowest dedication commitment of all the couple types, whereas traditional couples reported the highest. The opposite pattern emerged for constraint commitment; <b>separate</b> <b>couples</b> reported the highest and tradi-tional couples reported the lowest. Finally, actor–partner interdependence models revealed strong and positive associations between satisfaction and commitment for <b>separate</b> <b>couples,</b> {{as well as for}} wives in independent couples, but no such association among traditional couples...|$|R

5000|$|During colonial times, {{there was}} no freedom of religion. All Portuguese {{settlers}} and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Roman Catholic faith and forced to pay taxes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but Roman Catholicism was kept as the official religion. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priests and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in [...] "freguesias" [...] (parishes). There was also some hindrances {{to the construction of}} temples and cemeteries that belonged to the Catholic Church. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a <b>separated</b> <b>couple</b> observed a different religion.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{qualitative}} study of 31 grandparents, this article highlights how separation {{in the middle}} generation can result in an erosion of trust and quality of paternal grandparent-grandchild relationships. Despite these changes, grandparents endeavour to support and remain involved {{in the lives of}} their grandchildren by inter alia compensating for a perceived lack of their sons? parenting skills, affirming their grandchild?s position in the paternal kin network and acting as a mediator between the <b>separated</b> <b>couple</b> to ensure continued contact with grandchildren. The findings suggest that the actions of paternal grandparents can potentially have important future implications not only for the grandparent-grandchild relationship, but also the relationship trajectories of their adult son and child in the post-separation family...|$|E

40|$|Evidence of {{assortative mating}} {{according}} to personality {{was reported in}} a previous SOEP-based study (Rammstedt & Schupp, 2008). Based on population representative data of almost 7, 000 couples, high levels of congruence between spouses were found, which increased with marriage duration. Almost 5, 000 of these couples were tracked {{over a five-year period}} with personality assessed {{at the beginning and end}} of this time, which allowed us to investigate the relationship between personality congruence and marriage duration longitudinally. Using this data, we investigated (a) whether personality congruence is predictive for partnership longevity and whether congruence therefore differs between subsequently stable and instable couples, (b) if stable couples become more congruent, and (c) if <b>separated</b> <b>couples</b> become less congruent with regard to their personality over time. The results provide initial evidence of personality congruence as a predictor for partnership longevity: the more congruent couples are in the personality domain of Openness, the more stable their partnership. In addition, we found no indications of an increase in personality congruence over time within the stable couples; within the <b>separated</b> <b>couples,</b> however, a strong decrease in congruence was detectable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the negative post-divorce {{effects on the}} <b>separated</b> <b>couples</b> in Hanif Kureishi’s short story Midnight All Day. In so doing, it focuses upon two negative aspects related to the post-divorce phases. First, it looks closely at how Kureishi’s fictional male character Ian feels frustrated, unhappy and fragmented {{in the wake of}} his divorce from his wife Jane, even though he finds at once a new lover Marina. Secondly, the paper also discusses another disturbing negative aspect of Ian’s life after the break-up with Jane – the negative aspect linked to his parental responsibility towards his daughter. The paper debates that Ian’s the situation is actually almost all the <b>separated</b> <b>couples</b> and their children in the contemporary world.
