It published the first three books of Tintin and the first two of Quick & Flupke before folding and passing the rights in 1934 to Casterman, which was better suited {{to cope with the}} international success of Tintin (which by then also appeared in France and Switzerland). Both the newspaper comics and the album publications were in black and white, although the covers to the supplement, which were also often made by Hergé, used a <b>supporting</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E
40|$|Client: National Liaison Employment Committee, Ministry of Defence. This {{project was}} {{completed}} {{as a freelance}} contract on behalf of graphic design company Basten Greenhill Andrews. Lingwood had {{a key role in}} the designing and branding of SaBRE – the campaign for supporting Britain’s reservists and employers. This important project for the Ministry of Defence in 2002 included the naming and development of the visual identity to replace NELC (The National Employer Liaison Committee). Lingwood’s role in this project was the design and day-to-day running of the creative aspects of the work, with John McCarron (Creative Director) and Alison Kerr (Account Manager). The new identity focuses on the ‘power of two’, that is, the potential of an organisation that facilitates an effective dialog between reservist employers and the armed forces. By creating a logo and visual language that communicates the benefits of transferable skills acquired through reservist training, Lingwood was able to help identify the core activity and focus of the organisation. The intelligent and powerful logo together with clever supporting photography and visual language create a relevant visual style for the organisation that communicates quality, authority and impact. The scope of the project required the design and production of all aspects of a new visual identity: the new name, logo, typography, <b>supporting</b> <b>colour</b> palette, stationery design, photography guidelines, literature layout and PowerPoint guidelines. These were documented in printed and on-screen guidelines. The completion of the SaBRE branding project involved a rigorous and detailed understanding of all aspects of SaBRE’s unique business and resulted in a new brand that has played a major part in the success of this important and significant ongoing national campaign...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{negative}} result. It {{is well known}} that the colours in a scene do not depend only on the surface properties of the objects present but also on the illumination conditions and the capturing device's characteristics. Indeed, this dependence is so strong that computer vision techniques based on colour, such as object recognition [18] fail unless this relationship is accounted for. Much effort has been put into finding colour normalization techniques and colour invariants (features that do not change with changing illuminant), and many different approaches {{have been reported in the}} literature. All of these techniques, however, rely on the linearity property of the imaging process and hence on calibrated images. In this paper we set out to evaluate current state- of-the-art normalization and invariant methods on an uncalibrated image database [3]. The results of this experiment show that none of the existing techniques performs well enough to <b>support</b> <b>colour</b> based object recognition, and so suggest the need for new, improved algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) becomes {{possible}} and necessary as computer graphics, machine learning, knowledgebase and database technologies mature. SHMM aims to be a web oriented image library {{with an automatic}} image addition and classification mechanism to support sample image based similarity search, and semantic description search as well as allowing the registered users to add image to the database. As a sample CBIR system, SHMMhas its feature extraction layer, which <b>supports</b> <b>colour</b> and texture feature extraction that generates a 16 -dimensional vector value. Based on this vector, a 16 -dimensional SR tree is constructed. Using the nearest neighbor search technology on the SR tree, similarity search is supported. With backend database support, semantic description search, {{which is based on}} the keyword of the semantic meaning of image, is also implemented in SHMM. When a new image is added to the system, SHMM will automatically scan its feature, suggest the semantic description based on the similarity search result in the library, and wait for the user's response. Image contributor can accept the system's suggestion or inform system administrator via email to create new semantic description category in the system. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Because the colours in {{an image}} convey {{a lot of}} information, almost all image {{database}} systems <b>support</b> <b>colour</b> content queries. Unfortunately colour based queries do not always return the images that were sought even {{although there is a}} good colour match. Such failures are easily explained. We as human observers do not see raw image colours but rather make an interpretation of the colours in an image. Our interpretation allows us to decouple the intrinsic colour of the objects and surfaces, captured in an image, from the colour of the illumination. An indoor picture with a yellowish colour cast is interpreted as just that, we do not think that all the objects in the scene are more yellow than they usually are. In contrast, image database systems generally make no such comparable interpretation. In this paper we set forth an experimental study that attempts to quantify the nature and magnitude of the illumination colour problem. We are interested in measuring how image colours depend on illumination and how this dependency might be removed. Our work based on a small, but accurately calibrated, image database comprising 11 colourful objects imaged under 4 typical household lights. Because illumination colour impacts so dramatically on image colours, querying this dataset by colour-content delivers very poor indexing. To improve indexing performance, the illumination bias in images needs to be removed. This i...|$|R
40|$|Human {{colour vision}} {{originates}} in the cone photoreceptors, whose spatial density {{peaks in the}} fovea and declines rapidly into the periphery. For this reason, one expects to find a large representation of the cone-rich fovea in those cortical locations that <b>support</b> <b>colour</b> perception. Human occipital cortex contains several distinct foveal representations including at least two that extend onto the ventral surface: a region thought to be critical for colour vision. To learn more about these ventral signals, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to identify visual field maps and colour responsivity on the ventral surface. We found a visual map of the complete contralateral hemifield in a 4 cm(2) region adjacent to ventral V 3; the foveal representation of this map is confluent with that of areas V 1 / 2 / 3. Additionally, a distinct foveal representation is present on the ventral surface situated 3 - 5 cm anterior from the confluent V 1 / 2 / 3 foveal representations. This organization is not consistent with the definition of area V 8, which assumes the presence of a quarter field representation adjacent to V 3 v. Comparisons of responses to luminance-matched coloured and achromatic patterns show increased activity to the coloured stimuli beginning in area V 1 and extending through the new hemifield representation and further anterior in the ventral occipital lobe...|$|R
