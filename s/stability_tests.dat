25|$|LED {{lighting}} systems {{are sensitive to}} heat. Due to the negative influences of heat on the stability of photometric performance and the light transmitting components, the importance of thermal design, <b>stability</b> <b>tests,</b> usage of low-UV-type LED modules and UV-resistance tests of internal materials has increased dramatically. For this reason, LED signal lamps must remain compliant with the intensity requirements for the functions they produce after one minute and after thirty minutes of continuous operation. In addition, UN Regulation 112 contains a set of tests for LED modules, including colour rendering, UV radiation, and temperature <b>stability</b> <b>tests.</b> According to UN Regulations 112 and 123, mechanical, electromechanical or other devices for headlamps must withstand endurance tests and function failure tests.|$|E

Three CHANTs capsized during June 1944 and it was decided to use the Gooseberrys until <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> had been carried out. CHANT 23 was disabled by a shell in her engine room but continued to refuel other ships. CHANT 26 was driven ashore on a large wave and ended up in a field having passed through a hedge. After discharging her cargo she was dragged back to the beach, refloated and towed back to the UK.|$|E

On 1 May, Vittorio Veneto was sent to La Spezia for final fitting-out work, escorted by the destroyers [...] and [...] On 6 May, she was loaded with shells for her main battery; the loading work for the main and secondary guns lasted until 20 May.

The following month, Italy joined the war against Britain and France, though it wasn't until 2 August that Vittorio Veneto and Littorio were formally declared operational.|$|E

500|$|She {{returned}} to Britain for a refit in 1922, during which new long-base rangefinders were installed on [...] "X" [...] turret. This {{was followed by}} another stint in the Mediterranean Fleet that lasted until 1926. During this period, she {{took part in a}} demonstration in Smyrna against Turkish demands that foreign warships leave the port. She was thereafter transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served until 1930. In May 1926, <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted with the ship; these provided the basis for a 1927 proposal from the Director of Naval Construction to add anti-torpedo bulges to the four Iron Duke-class ships. The proposal was sent to the Board for review, but concerns over the further value of the ships, which were due to be replaced in 193132 {{under the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, and the cost of the reconstruction led the Board to cancel it. From July to September 1927, she had a refit in Devonport. She served as the squadron flagship from June 1929 until January 1931, when she was relieved by Marlborough.|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} all {{injuries}} of the upper limb and 7 % of all injuries in skiing affect the ulnar collateral ligaments of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint (skier's thumb). In some patients the collateral ligaments are displaced proximally over the adductor aponeurosis, resulting in a so-called Stener lesion. In these cases surgical treatment is indicated. We hypothesized that a Stener lesion could be provoked by clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> in patients with a skiers thumb and performed a cadaveric study on 10 Thiel fixated cadaver hands. For clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing,</b> the thumb was manually deviated in radial direction in both 30 degrees flexion and extension of the MP-joint. It was performed with maximum strength by two hand surgeons after sequential detachment of the ulnar collateral ligaments. After every sequence, it was assessed if the clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> had caused a Stener lesion. All of the 10 cadavers showed identical results while <b>testing</b> the clinical <b>stability.</b> A decreased stability was only found after cutting both parts of the ulnar collateral ligaments. A Stener lesion could not be provoked {{in any of the}} cadavers at any time by clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing.</b> Summarizing our findings we conclude that a proper performed clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> of the thumb MP joint is a safe maneuver, which does not lead to a Stener lesion in patients with skier's thumb...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{summarise}} and critically review the existing published literature {{with regard to}} clinical considerations as well as <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> studies of Ifosfamide and Mesna.

Summary: Ifosfamide and Mesna are currently given to patients for 14 days continuous home-based infusion for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. No previous work has evaluated their stability for more than 7 days under real-life conditions so the current regimen involves patients visiting hospital twice during the 14 -day treatment. This may create extra disruption to patients’ life style as well as increasing the workload for cancer services. Conclusion: There is a need to conduct <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> experiments for Ifosfamide and Mesna taking into consideration all of the highlighted factors to mimic standard clinical practice...|$|R
