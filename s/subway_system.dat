5|$|During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has {{control of}} the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b> Cuomo claimed that since the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> was owned by New York City and leased to the MTA, the city had {{to pay more for}} its capital needs. However, de Blasio argued that his large $2.5 billion {{contribution}} was enough.|$|E
5|$|Riders pay {{a single}} fare {{to enter the}} <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> and may {{transfer}} between trains {{at no extra cost}} until they exit via station turnstiles; the fare is a flat rate regardless of how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their MetroCard upon entering the <b>subway</b> <b>system,</b> but not a second time upon leaving.|$|E
50|$|In 1863 the London Underground was created. In 1890, {{it first}} started using {{electric}} traction and deep-level tunnels. Soon afterwards, Budapest {{and many other}} cities started using <b>subway</b> <b>systems.</b> By 1940, nineteen <b>subway</b> <b>systems</b> were in use.|$|R
50|$|There are no rail or <b>subway</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since 1974, {{a number}} of cities in South Korea have also {{developed}} modern and extensive <b>subway</b> <b>systems,</b> the first lines by converting from existing heavy railway lines. The largest, Seoul, has twelve lines over approximately 314 km of track. Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Daejeon and Gwangju also have <b>subway</b> <b>systems.</b> Seoul & Incheon are connected by metro.|$|R
5|$|In 2017, the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> {{was officially}} {{put in a}} state of {{emergency}} after a series of derailments, track fires, and overcrowding incidents.|$|E
5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b> Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{stations}} in the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b> In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 179th Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b> Later in the 1980s, the station was renovated and modernized; {{as part of the}} renovation, the IND-style purple tile band was removed from the station walls, and a design with intertwining blue and orange stripes was added. During a further upgrade that occurred by about 2000, elevators were installed in the station to make it ADA-accessible. The elevators were opened around 2005. Starting in August 2007, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along Hillside Avenue above the station, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} Mott Avenue station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} <b>subway</b> <b>system,</b> {{despite the fact that}} the station had become part of the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> just two decades earlier. From 2009 to 2012, a $117 million renovation took place on the station, replacing the 1950s design of the station house with metallic facades and a dome enclosure, and upgrading several features including staircases and employee areas. Elevators from the station house to the platforms were added, as were yellow tactile warning strips on the platform edges, making the station ADA-accessible. A glass artwork titled Respite was installed as part of the MTA's Arts for Transit program. The renovated station was unveiled on May 11, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the {{original}} New York City Subway line in 1904, and throughout the subway's history, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b> The first major expansion of the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> was the Dual Contracts, a set of agreements between the City of New York and the IRT and the BRT. The system was expanded into the outer reaches of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, and it provided for the construction of important lines in Manhattan. This one expansion of the system provided for a majority of today's system.|$|E
5|$|At an April 14, 2008, news conference, Governor David Paterson {{announced}} that the MTA will power {{a substantial portion of}} the station using tidal energy generated by turbines located in the East River, which are part of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy Project. This is part of a larger MTA initiative to use sustainable energy resources within the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{when the}} New York City Subway {{was at an}} all-time low, {{following}} the general trend of a decrease in ridership, the amount of passengers using the Union Turnpike station decreased by 2,700,000 passengers. As part of the MTA's 1975–1981 transit program, station lighting at Kew Gardens was improved. In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the <b>subway</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} several {{proposals}} for connecting the SIR with the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> (including the incomplete Staten Island Tunnel and a possible line along the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), as it uses B Division-sized cars and loading gauge, but various economic, political, and engineering difficulties have prevented this from happening.|$|E

5|$|Service on the <b>subway</b> <b>system</b> is {{occasionally}} {{disrupted by}} flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail {{to be shut}} off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 {{million gallons of water}} when it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
5|$|The New York City <b>Subway</b> <b>system</b> is {{infested with}} rats. Rats are {{sometimes}} seen on platforms, and are commonly seen foraging through garbage thrown onto the tracks.

Subway stations notorious for rat infestation include Chambers Street, Jay Street–MetroTech, West Fourth Street, Spring Street and 145th Street.|$|E
