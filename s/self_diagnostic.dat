50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various other vehicle systems e.g. traction control and carry out self monitoring duties and <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the limp home mode functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed signal function for engine RPMs counter as a backup signal.|$|E

At this or later stages it is common to require a large amount of research or mathematical modeling into what is and is not feasible to achieve. [...] The results of this research may be fed back into earlier stages of the design process, for example if it turns out one of the blocks cannot be designed within the parameters set for it, {{it may be necessary to}} alter other blocks instead. At this point it is also common to start considering both how to demonstrate that the design does meet the specifications, and how it is to be tested ( [...] which can include <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tools [...] ).Finally the individual circuit components are chosen to carry out each function in the overall design, at this stage the physical layout and electrical connections of each component are also decided, this layout commonly taking the form of artwork for the production of a printed circuit board or Integrated circuit. This stage is typically extremely time consuming because of the vast array of choices available. A practical constraint on the design at this stage is that of standardization, while a certain value of component may be calculated for use in some location in a circuit, if that value cannot be purchased from a supplier, then the problem has still not been solved. To avoid this a certain amount of 'catalog engineering' can be applied to solve the more mundane tasks within an overall design.|$|E

This dissertation explores a technique for a Mixed Analog Digital BIST (MADBIST) on a mixed-signal Integrated Circuit (IC). Specifically, on-chip tests for the Analog-to-Digital Converter and Digital-to-Analog Converter on the mixed-signal IC are developed. (The digital portion of the IC can be tested using digital BIST techniques).

A precision analog test stimulus is efficiently generated on-chip using digital circuitry. The test stimulus itself is encoded within a Pulse-Density-Modulated bit stream. A narrow-band digital filter is employed to extract the measurement results. Experimental results from a test chip and a prototype circuit board are provided.

In childhood and adolescence, anxiety disorders are among the most frequently assigned psychiatric diagnoses (Bernstein & Borchardt, 1991). Based on <b>self</b> reports (<b>Diagnostic</b> Interview Schedule for Children: DISC; Shaffer et al., 1993) the prevalence of anxiety disorders in Dutch adolescents (aged 13 - 18 years) is approximately 10. 5 percent (Verhulst et al., 1997).

40|$|In the {{district}} heating industry, heat meters, consisting {{among other things}} of a flow meter, are used for billing purpose. The district heating industry desires accurate and low cost flow measurements. There are mainly two reasons. An under estimation of the flow rate leads {{to a loss of}} income for {{the district}} heating industry. Further, the total cost for measuring, including the cost for the heat meter, the reading and the maintenance, represents a relatively large part of the total energy cost. Therefore a project concerning measurement quality assurance in district heating systems is in progress at Luleå University of Technology. As a part of this project the possibility of <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> techniques for flow meters is investigated. It is well known that installation effects greatly impair the flow measurement involved in heat metering. Thus this thesis focus on self diagnostics of different installation effects. The basic assumption is that the flow meter noise level is correlated to turbulence intensity. Since the turbulence intensity is effected by installation effects, the noise level can be used to detect conditions for which the flow meter shows erroneous results. In district heating applications the use of ultrasonic flow meters {{are becoming more and more}} frequent. The <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> approach has therefore been investigated for a small size prototype ultrasonic flow meter. Single and double elbow pipe bends and pipe diameter reductions mounted in front of the meter and pulsating flow give rise to small but reproducible errors. The magnitude of the maximum errors were in the range of 2 to 4 % of flow rate. At low flow rates with pulsating flow the errors were larger. Also small commercial ultrasonic flow meters were investigated. These commercial meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The results demonstrate that both temperature changes and installation effects introduce errors in the flow measurements. By studying the noise level of the signal from the prototype ultrasonic flow meter it is clear that all installation effects tested caused a clear increase in the flow signal noise level. It is clear that no tested disturbance causing measurement errors, larger than 1 % of the flow rate, will pass undetected. Neither will normal conditions with a varying flow rate or single measurement outliers cause false alarms. It is anticipated that this increase in the future can be detected on-line by the flow meter itself giving it a <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> capability. Godkänd; 2001; 20061115 (haneit) </p...|$|E

The implications of the observed energy level modulations for dynamical processes, particularly the primary electron transfer event, are addressed. ^ The ubiquitous electronic character of the photosynthetic reaction center is clarified through spectrally-resolved pump-probe anisotropy, a technique that facilitates deconvolution of the spectral forms contributing to the transient pump probe signals in the near IR spectral region. The excitonic structure of the photosynthetic reaction center (Rb. sphaeroides) is characterized and coherent mechanisms for optical excitation transfer are clearly demonstrated. ^ The coherent anisotropy response of multi-state electronic systems is shown to be a powerful probe of electronic characteristics. For isolated BChl dimers, a joint distribution of excitonic states is established that gives detailed information about the sources of spectral inhomogeneity. In aggregated ring complexes, coherent anisotropy responses provide conclusive proof of delocalized excitations, and are capable of fully describing the excitonic structure of antenna complexes. ^ Collectively, the results of this thesis emphasize the importance of delocalized electronic structure as a determinant factor in the dynamics of photosynthesis. ...|$|R

SETTING: Three nationwide studies (GENEPSO, EMBRACE, HEBON) in France, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, PARTICIPANTS: 1993 female carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations recruited in 2006 - 09. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of breast cancer estimated with a weighted Cox proportional hazards model with a time dependent individually estimated cumulative breast dose, based on nominal estimates of organ dose and frequency of <b>self</b> reported <b>diagnostic</b> procedures. To correct for potential survival bias, the analysis excluded carriers who were diagnosed more than five years before completion of the study questionnaire. RESULTS: In carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations any exposure to diagnostic radiation before the age of 30 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio 1. 90, 95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 3. 00), with a dose-response pattern. The risks by quarter of estimated cumulative dose /= 0. 0020 - 0. 0065 Gy, >/= 0. 0066 - 0. 0173 Gy, and >/= 0. 0174 Gy were 1. 63 (0. 96 to 2. 77), 1. 78 (0. 88 to 3. 58), 1. 75 (0. 72 to 4. 25), and 3. 84 (1. 67 to 8. 79), respectively. Analyses on the different types of diagnostic procedures showed a pattern of increasing risk with increasing number of radiographs before age 20 and before age 30 compared with no exposure. A history of mammography before age 30 was also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio 1. 43, 0. 85 to 2. 40). Sensitivity analysis showed that this finding was not caused by confounding by indication of family history. CONCLUSION: In this large European study among carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations, exposure to diagnostic radiation before age 30 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer at dose levels considerably lower than those at which increases have been found in other cohorts exposed to radiation. The results of this study support the use of non-ionising radiation imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging) as the main tool for surveillance in young women with BRCA 1 / 2 mutations...|$|R

One of the challenges in implementing an on-demand access protocol into the Space Network, {{is the fact that}} a low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite's communications will be subject to a doppler shift which is outside the capability of the NASA ground station to lock onto. In a prearranged system, the satellite's doppler is known a priori, and the ground station is able to lock onto the satellite's signal. This paper describes the development of a high speed analog to digital interface into a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). This system will be used for identifying the doppler shift of a LEO satellite through the Space Network, and aiding the ground station equipment in locking onto the signal. Although this interface is specific to one application, it {{can be used as a}} basis for interfacing other devices with a DSP...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{implementation of}} <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic,</b> power management protocols and hardware design {{to enhance the}} hardware flexibility and sensing accuracy of sensor node. We have come withsolutions for various design challenges faced on gas sensor. The embedded intelligent protocols over comes the problems of heater voltage dependency on gas sensors. Here we deal with sensors which arecapable of detecting different part per million (ppm) of gases. The main aim {{of the work is}} to implement various intelligent protocols like auto error detection and correction, smart sensor triggering, sensor handover etc. We have designed hardware by which base station can remotely configure the operating modes of the node by sending various command signals wirelessly. Base station can come to know about health status of the sensor node by sending various enquiry signals. The two-way wireless communication is achieved by a pair of amplitude shift keying (ASK) transceiver; data is encoded before transmission and decoded after reception which provides high security to the data. The build in self-test and power management protocols make the node highly intelligent which enhance the life time of the node. All the signals are digitized and processed by a centralized programmable interface controller (PIC) based embedded platform and finally store in computer via serial port...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> {{system for}} {{maintenance}} of {{traffic light system}} is developed. The quality of light produced by the light emitting element of traffic light system at remote site is monitored via graphical user interface (GUI). The remote system’s status report obtained from the GUI helps the maintenance operator(s) to change or repair the traffic light head at appropriate time. The remote site consists of a prototype T-Junction traffic light, controlled by an intelligent processor (microcontroller) which also monitors and diagnoses fault(s) {{in the system and}} alerts the central server via GSM modem interfaced to it. The microcontroller emulates the attention (AT) command of the modem and uses it to send fault alert in form of short message service (SMS) to the host server. The server has GSM receiver interface to it through a smart level converter (max 232). The tools used {{in the development of the}} prototype T-junction traffic light include proteus Virtual Simulation Module Software Development Kit (VSMSDK) used to develop the GUI and the host server, macro integrated development environment(MIDE) used to edit and assembly the software program. Wellon programmer was used to transfer the assembled program to the microcontroller chip. The results showed that proteus professional, though primarily a virtual development tool can also be used for real time development of a prototyp...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the risk of}} breast cancer associated with diagnostic radiation in carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations. Retrospective cohort study (GENE-RAD-RISK). Three nationwide studies (GENEPSO, EMBRACE, HEBON) in France, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, 1993 female carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations recruited in 2006 - 09. Risk of breast cancer estimated with a weighted Cox proportional hazards model with a time dependent individually estimated cumulative breast dose, based on nominal estimates of organ dose and frequency of <b>self</b> reported <b>diagnostic</b> procedures. To correct for potential survival bias, the analysis excluded carriers who were diagnosed more than five years before completion of the study questionnaire. In carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations any exposure to diagnostic radiation before the age of 30 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio 1. 90, 95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 3. 00), with a dose-response pattern. The risks by quarter of estimated cumulative dose < 0. 0020 Gy, ≥ 0. 0020 - 0. 0065 Gy, ≥ 0. 0066 - 0. 0173 Gy, and ≥ 0. 0174 Gy were 1. 63 (0. 96 to 2. 77), 1. 78 (0. 88 to 3. 58), 1. 75 (0. 72 to 4. 25), and 3. 84 (1. 67 to 8. 79), respectively. Analyses on the different types of diagnostic procedures showed a pattern of increasing risk with increasing number of radiographs before age 20 and before age 30 compared with no exposure. A history of mammography before age 30 was also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio 1. 43, 0. 85 to 2. 40). Sensitivity analysis showed that this finding was not caused by confounding by indication of family history. In this large European study among carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations, exposure to diagnostic radiation before age 30 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer at dose levels considerably lower than those at which increases have been found in other cohorts exposed to radiation. The results of this study support the use of non-ionising radiation imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging) as the main tool for surveillance in young women with BRCA 1 / 2 mutation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT To {{understand}} {{just one}} life, {{you have to}} swallow the world. (Rushdie, 2006, pg. 121) Mental {{health care in the}} Western world is situated firmly within a biomedical paradigm. Disorder is assumed, and symptoms are viewed as dis-abling deviations from normal. A disease-based model of care informs the treatment options that are most available and accessible. I argue that bio-medical care separates the person from her/his experiences, the self from the individual. I advocate for the addition of a non-biomedical approach to health education that enables a connection between the individual and her/his experiences; one that does not replace the <b>self</b> with a <b>diagnostic</b> profile. The creation of a meaningful understanding of that referred to as an illness experience, is recommended as essential to the process of moving away from illness and disability and towards wellness and ability. I ask two overarching questions: 1) How might the exploration of a personal narrative of the self facilitate the process of constructing a meaningful understanding of experience in one who has been diagnosed with what they are told is mental illness? 2) How might this process enable the individual to move beyond a state of compromised emotional wellbeing and perceived dis-ability to a state of overall wellness and perceived ability? Three separate but interrelated articles are included in this dissertation. My theoretical study examines the interrelatedness of meaningful learning, constructivism and Bakhtinian dialogism. I propose a theoretical framework for use in individualized approaches to meaning making for those who experience what they are told is mental illness. Critical autobiographical narrative, the methodology supporting this research, is used to facilitate a wide variety of vicarious experiences. Dialogue, self-analysis, and self-reflexivity are recommended as key to the creation of autobiographical research that is effective and evocative. My findings include an autobiographical account of the experience of being given electroshock, and a multi-voiced dialogue that includes two characters from Mary Shelley’s literary classic, ‘Frankenstein’. A self-reflective dialogue is woven throughout this section. Photographic images serve as metaphors to support dialogic musings. This research aims to evoke thoughts and feelings, and to contribute new conversation to the ongoing dialogue {{on the nature of the}} narrative self in those who experience compromised emotional wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) {{approach}} to implement a preliminary architecture for force-feedback control in steer-by-wire (SBW) applications. A brushless motor is used as force feedback actuator. The determination of the position of the rotor {{plays a key role in}} the control algorithm. To obtain a reliable rotor position a hybrid redundancy has been implemented. The position signals of the encoder integrated on the motor are computed in three different ways: using a 8 -bit microcontroller, a 16 -bit microcontroller, and, last, using a FPGA. A virtual hardware platform operates as voter. The position estimated by the voter is used by the 16 -bit platform to generate the PWM signals needed to control the motor. The voter executes a simple <b>self</b> <b>diagnostic</b> process, too and in case of failure in more than one module performs a reconfigurations of the system and the position estimated by a fourth back-up module is used by the 16 -bit microcontroller to implement the motor control algorithm. In particular, the results of Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments show as using a redundant architecture like the one proposed in this paper, it is possible to control the motor in order to recreate on a steering wheel (directly connected to the motor) a drive feeling like the one produced by a traditional steering system also in case of failure in one, or more than one module, of the system...|$|E
