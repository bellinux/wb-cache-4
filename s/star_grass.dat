Saw palmetto extract from Serenoa repens, while one of the most commonly used, is no better than placebo in both symptom relief and decreasing prostate size. Other herbal medicines include beta-sitosterol from Hypoxis rooperi (African <b>star</b> <b>grass)</b> and pygeum (extracted from the bark of Prunus africana), while there is less substantial support for the efficacy of pumpkin seed (Cucurbita pepo) and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) root.

5000|$|The {{first story}} arc, [...] "The Head That Wouldn't Die!", {{introduces}} the Power Persons Five (PP5), and their nemesis John L. Sullivan and King Tiger Eating a Cheeseburger. In {{order to prevent}} astronauts from launching homemade rockets into space, NASA, under the directorship of Sir Hippothesis (a human-hippopotamus hybrid), has established the superhero group the Power Persons Five: led by Dr. Professor, a humanoid rhinoceros, with team members Star Fighter, his wife Starrior, The Impossible, The Anti-Mugger, and Craymok. Sometimes they save the world. In a fight against John L. Sullivan, who plans to conquer the world with an army of fighting bears, Star Fighter's head is permanently disfigured, and Sullivan is killed by The Impossible. The damage to Star Fighter's head strains his and Starrior's marriage, so they attend group couples-counseling with Montel. There, Starrior meets and later begins an affair with Texas Tom, a cowboy haunted by the ghostly cow head Blue Grass. At a seedy motel, Blue Grass and Star Fighter confront Starrior and Texas Tom. Tom shoots Star Fighter's disfigured head, which bursts, leaking gore. Later, Star Fighter cuts off the remains {{of his head and}} replaces it with Blue Grass, transforming into <b>Star</b> <b>Grass,</b> the cosmic ghost. Meanwhile, the fighting bears use magic to resurrect John L. Sullivan as a sentient zombie, and Sullivan attacks and wrests control of PP5 Headquarters. Starrior enlists Texas Tom's help to save her teammates. They recruit Gnarled Winslow (an ex-Chicago cop), Reed Spacer, and Crazy Train to aid in the attack. <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> returns to Headquarters and kills Sullivan with a single nuclear punch. Then <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> gives the bears star rings and drafts them into NASA to get revenge on Starrior. When Starrior, Texas Tom, Crazy Train, Gnarled Winslow, and Reed Spacer show up, <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> and his star bears fight them. Crazy Train accidentally kills herself. The battle is interrupted by an irate Sir Hippothesis. In the aftermath, The Anti-Mugger (irradiated by <b>Star</b> <b>Grass)</b> quits the PP5, Sir Hippothesis fires <b>Star</b> <b>Grass,</b> and <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> sues NASA. In a recess from the ensuing trial, it is revealed that The Anti-Mugger has a new, mutated third arm, and Starrior is pregnant with Star Grass' daughter. Everyone is attacked by John L. Sullivan, whose mustache survived the explosion and transformed an astronaut into Super Sullivan, a giant monster with wings and a unicorn horn. After <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> saves Starrior from Super Sullivan and Gnarled Winslow destroys Sullivan and his mustache, the married couple reconciles, Sir Hippothesis makes <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> PP5 team leader, and <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> fires Dr. Professor and hires Gnarled Winslow. During all of this, astronaut farmers have been launching into space unchecked. One of their ships collides with that of Admiral Tiger Eating a Cheeseburger, only son of King Tiger Eating a Cheeseburger, absolute ruler of Planet Crabulon. The King is told of his son's death.|$|E

The resulting disfigurement strains Star Fighter's marriage with Starrior. When Starrior starts an affair with Texas Tom, whom she met in Montel's couples-counseling group, Star Fighter teams up with Blue Grass, the floating ghost of a cow's head (who haunts Texas Tom), to confront the lovers. Star Fighter's head sack is destroyed during the encounter, so he cuts off the remaining skin and replaces it with Blue Grass. Together, they become <b>Star</b> <b>Grass,</b> the cosmic ghost. <b>Star</b> <b>Grass</b> is crass, selfish, and violent.

40|$|O experimento foi realizado com o objetivo de determinar a composição química, a digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da matéria seca (DIVMS), da matéria orgânica (DIVMO), da parede celular (DIVPC), a produção de matéria seca verde total (PMSVT), vigor da rebrota (VR) e relação colmo/lâmina foliar (C/L) de cinco {{cultivar}}es do gênero Cynodon (Tifton 44, Tifton 85, “Coast-cross”, Estrela Porto Rico e Estrela Roxa), em 4 cortes a cada 35 dias no verão (PV) e 2 cortes a cada 70 dias no inverno (PI) com e sem N (0 e 400 kg/ha/ano). Na avaliação da composição química, a PB não diferiu (P ≤ 0, 05) entre as gramíneas, porém diferiu (P ≤ 0, 05) quanto ao nível de nitrogênio e ao corte. A concentração da FDA e FDN apresentou diferença estatística (P ≤ 0, 05) entre as gramíneas, nível de adubação e cortes realizados. As gramíneas apresentaram diferenças estatísticas entre si (P ≤ 0, 05) para a DIVMS, DIVMO e DIVPC. A Tifton 44 apresentou digestibilidade maior para todos os parâmetros, enquanto que a cultivar Estrela Porto Rico apresentou DIVPC menor em relação às demais, e as outras não diferiram entre si. A PMSVT diferiu (P Chemical composition, in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDDM), organic matter (IVDOM) and cell wall (IVDCW), green dry matter production (GDMP), plant re-growth (PR) and stem/leaf ratio (S/L) of five cultivars {{of the genus}} Cynodon at two levels of N fertilization (0 and 400 kg/ha) {{in the summer and}} spring are provided. CP did not differ (P > 0. 05) from other grasses in chemical composition. However differences (P ≤ 0. 05) occurred due to nitrogen level and cut intervals.

Tifton 44 showed the highest digestibility for all parameters, while Estrela Porto Rico the lowest digestibility for IVDCW. Other grasses did not differ from each other. There were no differences (P > 0. 05) among the fertilized cultivars for GDMP. Under no fertilization GDMP of Tifton 85 cultivar was higher than that of Tifton 44 and coast cross cultivars.
