40|$|A habitat {{specific}} {{survey of}} the epifauna and fish fauna of <b>sandbanks</b> off the Welsh coastline was undertaken in 2001. Of these, three <b>sandbanks</b> were considered to represent extensions of shallow nearshore soft-sediment communities, while a further six <b>sandbanks</b> {{were considered to be}} distinct sandbanks; seabed features clearly defined in comparison with surrounding sediments. Multivariate community analyses revealed that the distinct <b>sandbanks</b> had both fish and epifaunal assemblages that were distinct from those <b>sandbanks</b> considered to be extensions of nearshore sediments. The distinct <b>sandbanks</b> were typified by low species diversity and shared indicator species such as the weever fish Echiichthys vipera, the shrimp Philocheras trispinosus and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Differences occurred in species composition among the distinct <b>sandbanks,</b> in particular, southern <b>sandbanks</b> were typified by sand sole Solea lascaris and small-eyed ray Raja microocellata. The <b>sandbanks</b> considered as extensions of nearshore sediments shared many similarities with the Pleuronectes platessa–Limanda limanda assemblage, identified by Ellis et al. (Estuar. Coastal Shelf Sci. 51 (2000) 299), which is widespread in the Irish Sea. <b>Sandbanks,</b> as a habitat definition under the EU habitats directive, are likely to incorporate a number of physically and biologically distinct habitats of which two have been described in the present study...|$|R

5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a <b>sandbank</b> outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} saw {{was a part of}} Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea was rough, and one of the ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a <b>sandbank,</b> by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{examined}} {{the influence of}} hydrological seasonality on spatiotemporal variation of algal biomass and shrimp abundance on <b>sandbanks</b> of the Cinaruco River in southwestern Venezuela. Seasonal variations of abiotic and biotic variables in the Cinaruco were driven by the hydrological regime. During the highwater periods, river sites in the main channel and lagoon sites were similar in water physicochemical variables and algal biomass. In contrast, physicochemical variables and algal biomass differed between river and lagoon sites during the low-water period. The absence of flow in lagoons and consistently low algal biomass on river <b>sandbanks</b> {{were the most important}} features of the spatial variability between main-channel and lagoon <b>sandbanks</b> during low-water phases. Benthic algal biomass was highly uniform at small spatial scales and significantly heterogeneous at large spatial scales. In the second major part of this dissertation, I found a relatively species-rich shrimp assemblage with seven species inhabiting the <b>sandbanks</b> of the Cinaruco. I also observed clear patterns of temporal and spatial variation in shrimp abundance on the Cinaruco <b>sandbanks.</b> Abundance of shrimp on the <b>sandbanks</b> presented remarkable diel variation, showing almost exclusive use of this habitat at nights. Seasonally, shrimp were more abundant during rising- and falling-water periods, when rapid changes of environmental conditions occur. Shrimp abundance was high on those <b>sandbanks</b> with absence of troughs and presence of submerged vegetation. These environmental features presumably promote colonization/establishment and survival/persistence of shrimp in the <b>sandbanks.</b> In a patch-dynamic view of communities, a mobility control model seems to apply to shrimp of the <b>sandbanks</b> in the Cinaruco during the period of rapid changes in hydrology and habitat structure. During low-water periods, when habitat structure of <b>sandbanks</b> is relatively constant, low shrimp abundance appears to be heavily controlled by high fish predation. The annual flood regime of the Cinaruco, which drives the concentrations of dissolved materials, affects material interchanges between aquatic and terrestrial systems, and modifies aquatic habitat structural complexity, is responsible for creating strong patterns of seasonal and spatial variation in benthic algal crops and shrimp abundance on the <b>sandbanks</b> of this large floodplain river...|$|R

5|$|The British {{flotilla}} arrived off {{the independent}} town of Ras al-Khaimah on 11 November, discovering Minerva and {{a fleet of}} dhows in the harbour. The pirate fleet initially sailed out to attack the British but retreated once {{the size of the}} expeditionary force became clear. Minerva failed to make the return to port successfully and was wrecked on a <b>sandbank,</b> the crew setting fire to their ship to prevent her seizure by boats launched from Chiffone. Onshore, the Al Qasimi and their Bedouin allies (whose numbers are unknown, but were significantly less than 20,000) formed a series of emplaced defences around the town that were protected from offshore bombardment by sandbanks which blocked the approach of Wainwright's heavier warships. On 12 November, Wainwright deployed his smaller ships close inshore to bombard the town and provide cover for his troop dispositions offshore.|$|E

She was part of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the mouth of the Danube. In the closing stages of the war, she was the last monitor to withdraw towards Budapest, but was captured by the Serbs when she grounded on a <b>sandbank</b> downstream from Belgrade. After the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Sava. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the <b>sandbank</b> grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and internal}} structure of sand shoals and <b>sandbanks</b> around a coastal headland (Portland Bill, southern UK) are {{described on the}} basis of sidescan sonar and high-resolution seismic data sets. Morphological and architectural evidence, combined with the spatial distribution and nature of the bedrock surface, indicates that the evolution of these deposits, especially the <b>sandbanks,</b> may not only be hydrodynamically controlled but also morphologically controlled. The internal structure of the sand shoals reveals a simple pattern of clinoforms dipping {{in the same direction as}} their steeper profile. In contrast, the internal structure of the <b>sandbanks</b> reveals that their lower seismic units consist of a sedimentary core interpreted as the remains of a lowstand deposit or an early stage of the bank development under different prevailing hydrodynamic conditions. The present morphology of the <b>sandbanks</b> is represented by upper seismic units characterized by large-scale sandwave foresets dipping at 6 - 8 °. The nature and morphology of the bedrock surface may also influence the development of <b>sandbanks</b> in some cases. For example, to the west of Portland Bill, the morphology of the bedrock surface (basal reflector) restricts the development of the Portland Bank. This information may explain the asymmetric evolution of <b>sandbanks</b> around Portland Bill...|$|R
5|$|There is a {{submerged}} forest {{beneath the}} eastern part of the Doom Bar, off Daymer Bay. It is believed to be part of the wooded plain that existed off the current Cornwall coast before it was overcome by sand dunes and beach sand during the last significant rise in sea-level, which ended around 4,000 years ago. Exposed as they are to the Atlantic Ocean, the sands of the area have always been prone to sudden shifts: several houses were said to have been buried one night during a powerful storm. According to tradition one such shift led to the formation of the Doom Bar during the reign of Henry VIII (1509–1547), causing a decline in the prosperity of Padstow. Today, the <b>sandbank</b> covers approximately , linking the beaches near Harbour Cove by sand flats, although the actual size and shape varies.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and bowsprit collapsed {{under the pressure of}} the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a <b>sandbank</b> close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E
5|$|Meermins crew, now led by Krause's {{assistant}} Olof Leij, {{managed to}} communicate with the militia on shore by means of messages in bottles, and persuaded them to light the signal fires for which the Malagasy still on board were waiting. On seeing the fires, the Malagasy cut the ship's anchor cable and allowed the ship to drift towards the shore, after which she ran aground on an offshore <b>sandbank.</b> The Malagasy could then see the militia on the shore preparing to come to the ship's assistance, and realised that their situation was hopeless; they surrendered and were once again shackled. Captain Muller, ship's mate Daniel Carel Gulik and Krause's assistant Olof Leij were tried in the Dutch East India Company's Council of Justice; all three were fired from the Company, while Muller and Gulik were also stripped of their rank and wages. The slaves were not tried, but the two surviving leaders of the mutiny, named in Dutch East India Company records as Massavana and Koesaaij, were sent to Robben Island for observation, where Massavana died three years later; Koesaaij survived there for another 20years. In 2004 an ongoing search was begun for Meermins remains.|$|E

5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the <b>sandbank</b> several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|News reached Dinapore on 27 July that mutinying sepoys had {{attacked}} Arrah. General Lloyd was still unwilling {{to send troops}} to pursue the mutineers until he was persuaded {{to do so by}} pressure from magistrates, who were personal friends of the besieged party, and Tayler in his role as the Commissioner of Patna. A party of 200 from the 37th Regiment of Foot, 50 from the Bengal Military Police Battalion and 15 loyal Sikhs from regiments that had mutinied, were sent, aboard the river steamer Horungotta, to rescue the town's civil servants. News arrived in Dinapore the following day that the steamer was aground on a <b>sandbank,</b> and Lloyd ordered the party recalled. Under pressure from local government officials, he changed his mind and agreed to send, using the river steamer Bombay, a large force of the 10th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant Colonel William Fenwick to join up with the party on the first steamer and head to Arrah. Bombay already had a large complement of civilian passengers and attempts to have the passengers removed met with confusion and arguments with the captain of the steamer, causing a delay of around four hours. As a result, only a reduced force of about 150 (including seven civilian volunteers) was able to embark. Fenwick, unwilling to carry out the mission with only 150 men, delegated its command to Captain Charles Dunbar (who worked in the paymaster's bureau) and Bombay departed on 29 July at around 9:30am. The two steamers met up, and the combined force of about 415 then headed towards Arrah.|$|E
