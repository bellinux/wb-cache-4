60|$|It was Mr. Botcher himself {{who almost}} {{closed the door}} on the gentleman's <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> and took Mr. Crewe's arm confidingly.|$|R
5000|$|It {{abandons}} the 700's [...] "duckbill" [...] nose {{in favor}} of a <b>sharper</b> <b>nose.</b> The livery is white, with a red stripe.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A S-5M rocket. It has a <b>sharper</b> <b>nose</b> {{than the}} {{original}} S-5 rocket and the fins do not fold back as far.|$|R
60|$|It was a master. A short, wiry {{little man}} with a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and a general resemblance, both in manner and appearance, to an excitable bullfinch.|$|R
60|$|This done, {{with the}} aid of a heavy piece of wood he pressed the cub's head down and wound a thong tightly round the <b>sharp</b> <b>nose.</b> Then he tied the front legs.|$|R
40|$|Values of total-drag {{coefficient}} {{were measured}} for two fin-stabilized, blunt-nose bodies of revolution in free flight at Mach numbers from 0. 8 to 1. 5. The blunt-nose configurationswere designed by rounding off the <b>sharp</b> <b>noses</b> of two previously tested configurations,having nose fineness ratios of about ~, to radii equal to about ~ 4 the maximum body radii. By comparing the measured values of drag coefficient based on frontal {{area for the}} blunt- and pointed-nose models, it is found that, within the accuracy and range of the present tests, rounding off the <b>sharp</b> <b>noses</b> produced no ticrease in the total drag of either configuration...|$|R
50|$|Outwardly, {{however, the}} Model 45 {{retained}} the traditional Learjet appearance, with its semi-swept wing, T-tail, <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> and wrap-around windshield - while using engines and avionics {{similar to those}} in the Model 60.|$|R
6000|$|She was. Almost {{at once a}} queer, long, <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> was poked out of {{the little}} hole she had made, and a squeaky voice asked fretfully, [...] "Do I have to come way out?" ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{cartridges}} in Bergmann pistols were grooveless, {{with the}} bullets having a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> to avoid jams. Later pistols, however, have mechanical extractors and cartridges with grooved flanges. The M96 had an internal box-magazine holding five cartridges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go on a {{foraging}} expedition {{while the}} lamp holds out to burn, {{for the old}} lantern is almost gone and then we are done for. Come on, Bob; your <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> will smell out food if there is any." ...|$|R
60|$|It all {{happened}} just as Peter had expected. While seeming {{to be paying}} no attention to anything but to Sammy Jay, {{he kept his eyes}} on that low place in the old wall, and presently he saw Reddy's <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> as Reddy peeped over {{to make sure that he}} was still there. The instant that <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> dropped out of sight, Peter made ready to run for his life. A second later, Reddy leaped over the wall, and Peter was off as hard as he could go, with Reddy almost at his heels. Sammy Jay, who had been so busy calling Peter names that he hadn't seen Reddy at all, forgot all about his quarrel with Peter.|$|R
50|$|Gerini {{represents}} {{the school of}} Giotto di Bondone, {{in the tradition of}} Andrea di Orcagna and of Taddeo Gaddi. As is typical for Gothic depictions, Gerini's figures have large chins, sloping foreheads, and <b>sharp</b> <b>noses</b> whilst their bodies are squat and frontally displaced.|$|R
60|$|At length, after a pause, Mr. Marais, {{pointing}} to myself, {{a small and}} stubbly-haired youth with a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> asked my father whether he would like me to be instructed in the French tongue. The answer was that nothing would please him better.|$|R
500|$|The Ferrari P4/5 can {{accelerate}} from 0-100kilometresperhour (0-62mph) in 3.0seconds (0.14seconds {{quicker than}} the Enzo). It has {{a top speed}} of [...] The car has a frontal area of [...] and the <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and smooth curves mean it has a drag coefficient of only 0.34.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime {{the young}} man had closed the museum door and was {{crossing}} the hall. He was a wiry-haired, severe-looking young man, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and eyes that gleamed through rimless spectacles--none other, in fact than Lord Emsworth's private secretary, the Efficient Baxter. Ashe hailed him: ...|$|R
60|$|Ann Veronica {{sat down}} in the other arm-chair and darned badly for a minute or so. Then she looked at her aunt, and traced with a curious eye the careful {{arrangement}} of her hair, her <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> the little drooping lines of mouth and chin and cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whew!' whistled Mervyn. 'Juliana hadn't her <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> nor her <b>sharp</b> tongue {{when first}} she came out. Acton was {{quartered}} at Elverslope, and got smitten. She flirted {{with him all}} the winter; but I fancy she didn't give you much trouble {{when he came to}} the point, eh, sir?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Eben, {{sitting at}} the other end of the small tea-table that was drawn up against the window, was a thin little woman, with a very <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and light, faded blue eyes. She looked like a woman whose {{opinions}} were always very decided and warranted to wear.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the King waved his paw toward the boy, {{and at once}} the pretty curls and fresh round face and big blue eyes were gone, while in their place a fox's head {{appeared}} upon Button-Bright's shoulders--a hairy head with a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> pointed ears, and keen little eyes.|$|R
50|$|Y-8CB: ECM variant, {{characterized}} by a <b>sharp</b> pointed <b>nose</b> cone.|$|R
50|$|Waveriders {{generally}} have <b>sharp</b> <b>noses</b> and <b>sharp</b> leading edges on their wings. The underside shock-surface remains attached to this. Air flowing {{in through the}} shock surface is trapped between the shock and the fuselage, and can only escape {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. With sharp edges, all the lift is retained.|$|R
50|$|Working {{differently}} from the idealized portraits Titian and Palma the Elder had made widespread in Venice, Lotto used a more realistic approach: this is shown is details such as the asymmetric face, the weighty chin, and the <b>sharp</b> <b>nose.</b> In this he followed the local tradition of painters such as Paolo Cavazzola.|$|R
60|$|It {{was funny}} {{to see the}} boy reach up to feel of his <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and wide mouth, and wail afresh with grief. He wagged his ears in a comical manner and tears were in his little black eyes. But Dorothy couldn't laugh at her friend just yet, because she felt so sorry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was so {{surprised}} by the news," [...] said Mr. Vanstone, [...] "and so staggered {{by the sight of}} old Clare's <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> in my house, that I didn't much notice. Now you remind me of it--yes. I don't think Frank took kindly to his own good luck; not kindly at all." ...|$|R
50|$|The Ferrari P4/5 can {{accelerate}} from 0-100 kilometres {{per hour}} (0-62 mph) in 3.0 seconds (0.14 seconds quicker than the Enzo). It has {{a top speed of}} 233 mi/h km/h. The car has a frontal area of 1.906 m2 and the <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and smooth curves mean it has a drag coefficient of only 0.34.|$|R
60|$|The Queen was immensely {{astonished}} {{when the}} Mouse began to speak, {{and still more}} so when she saw its little <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> turn to a beautiful face, and its paws to hands and feet; then it suddenly grew tall, and the Queen recognised the Fairy who had come with the wicked King to visit her.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Porter's rules {{concerning}} visitors, though stringent as regarded Mamie, {{were capable}} of being relaxed when she herself was the person to relax them. She had a visitor with her now--a long, severe-looking lady with a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> surmounted by spectacles, who, taking in the white tiles, the thermometer, the cot, and the brass knobs in a single comprehensive glance, observed: [...] "Admirable!" ...|$|R
50|$|Five chassis were {{produced}} and driven by Al Unser Jr. and Paul Tracy. The Ilmor produced 850 bhp Mercedes-Benz IC108D engine {{served as the}} powerplant driving through an Xtrac gearbox within a Penske housing. Aerodynamic changes from the previous years car included revised sidepod inlets and a longer, <b>sharper</b> <b>nose.</b> The Delco Gen V electronics package was carried over from 1996 and remained a Penske only system.|$|R
40|$|Tests to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of a}} conical windshield on the drag of a bluff body at supersonic speeds were performed for the following configurations: a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> fuselage with stabilizing fins,a blunt nose fuselage with a hemispherical shape, and a blunt nose fuselage with a conical point. Results of the drag coeeficient are described at Mach 1. 0 and the greatest Mach number of 1. 37...|$|R
6000|$|The {{last words}} were uttered in a low, soft tone. Phil Maylands glanced in his friend's face, and was {{directed}} by his eyes to a corner near the front door, where, from behind the shelter of an over-stuffed pelican of the wilderness, two intensely bright little eyes were seen glistening. The gradual advance of a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> revealed {{the fact that their}} owner was a rat! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} do," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "I {{want some}} of your friends and neighbors {{to get a good}} look at you, and they certainly can't do that with only that <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> of yours to be seen. Now scramble out here. No one will hurt you. I will keep you only a few minutes. Then you can go back to your everlasting digging. Out with you, now!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 1793 a {{residency}} permit {{was issued}} to “Citizen Nicolas Henry Racine Monville” at Neuilly-sur-Seine. The entry describes him as “5 feet 6 inches tall, with chestnut hair and eyebrows, blue eyes, a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> a small mouth, a round chin, a bare forehead and an oval face.”. Living {{with him at}} Neuilly was a young actress [...] "le petite Sarah", a fact noted in his trial notes [...]|$|R
60|$|A {{school of}} feeding {{bonefish}} came toward us. I counted eleven tails {{out of the}} water. They were around my bait. Now or never, I thought, waiting frantically! But they went on feeding--passed over my line--and came so near the boat that I could plainly see the gray shadow shapes, the long, <b>sharp</b> <b>noses,</b> the dark, staring eyes. I reeled in to find my bait gone, as usual. It was exasperating.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{designed}} by John Barnard, {{and it was the}} first Ferrari he was responsible for designing. It sported a <b>sharp</b> <b>nose,</b> with a narrow monocoque and bulging side-pods designed to house the radiators with maximum aerodynamic efficiency. It originally had two small air intakes either side of the driver, but from the fourth race of the season in Mexico a more conventional large air intake above and behind the driver was specified.|$|R
50|$|The art has {{a variety}} of line qualities and textures, and more detail than in Gods' Man. Ward availed himself of a larger variety of {{engraving}} tools, such as the multiple-tint tool for making groups of parallel lines, and rounded engraving tools for organic textures. The large cast of characters is distinguished by visual details in faces and clothing, such as the main character's <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> and receding hairline and his wife's checked dress.|$|R
50|$|She's a walker, {{not only}} capable of {{shifting}} into coyote shape at will but also {{possessed of a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> for scenting other creatures {{and an ability to}} sense magic when it is at work. So when a teenage werewolf approaches Mercy asking for work, she knows what he is immediately. She also knows it would be more prudent to refuse him, but he looks so desperate that she hires him anyway.|$|R
