This concept of communication involving satellites provides for a new tier of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> in combat and noncombat environments, dating {{as far back as the}} Persian Gulf War. This tool altered the command and control element by improving the knowledge and certainty that this capability provided. Recent studies and experiments have demonstrated the applicability of these military systems to civil service as well. <b>Space</b> based <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> provide capabilities such as continuous over-the-horizon communications and position reporting of friendly assets. These capabilities have been available since the Persian Gulf War. System limitations include a lack of real-time image, terrain masking, and security. Until recently, the devices used for Friendly Force Tracking have been devices that rely on National Technical Means. However, the recent trend is to use commercially available technology to enable tracking of both friendly and enemy forces. This technology ranges from the use of GPS equipped cell phones to satellites in LEO such as Iridium and GlobalStar. Terrestar is a new company specializing in space technology and wireless communication devices. Additionally, TerreStar wireless communication devices are designed to use both cellular and satellite networks. This feature provides a redundant tracking method not otherwise available. This study includes an investigation into Terrestar tracking devices used to locate and monitor the position and movement of friendly forces. Outstanding Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEven though {{success or failure}} depends on it, <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> in emergency operations centers is often poorly prioritized. These centers depend on <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> to manage information, coordinate resources, and support executive-level decision making. Having limited or poor <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> forces emergency responders to act without all the information needed to make good decisions, leading to poor coordination and ineffective response. In order to identify opportunities for improving <b>situational</b> <b>awareness,</b> this thesis used a qualitative case study approach to examine the level of importance <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> plays in the emergency operations center during disasters, and to identify both good and poor practices. Examining four case studies through an organizational-change analytic framework revealed that <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is a system of interconnected elements that include task, structure, people, and technology. This thesis concludes that <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> in the emergency operations center can be improved by employing an emergency operations center <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> organizational model. Investments must be made in improving all elements of the organization. The research determined that the intelligence process is an ideal model for defining how <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> can be established, maintained, and shared.

Literature by scientists from different countries and in different scientific fields is utilised to strengthen the validity. Empirical finds from two Norwegian headquarters are presented and the paper describes the conditions for collective sensemaking in both. The paper introduces the theoretical states individual <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> and shared <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> and claim that the collective sensemaking process is the bridge which makes shared <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> possible. It is stated that collective sensemaking is a vulnerable process which is dependent upon favourable conditions in several domains simultaneously. The paper questions the trends that focus development on making huge amounts of information available to all those participating in military operations. It is suggested that self synchronisation and ad hoc organising according to Network Centric Warfare are concepts that must be seen {{in view of the fact}} that shared <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is achieved over time between individuals that know each other well and have developed special linguistic characteristics. It is acknowledged that communication and the systems which make it possible are crucial to any organisation. The importance of information management to provide essential and precise information and prevent information overload is pointed out. The paper hope to create broader knowledge on shared <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> and how this condition is created in Norwegian headquarters. This knowledge will hopefully provide the foundation for development of systems and routines that will provide good shared <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> with a high degree of confidence in Norwegian headquarters...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} operate safely civil {{aviation}} is increasingly reliant on {{the collection and}} provision of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> This <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is fed to the pilot who uses it {{to know what is}} going on around them and minimise the risk of a dangerous situation occurring. Since their inception military commanders have long used unmanned aerial systems to provide <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> (namely imagery) of remote areas. This <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information is transmit- ted back to them over military data-links so they can use it to make decisions, coordinate forces and plan strategies. However times are changing, or to be more specific the number and variety of decision-makers on the ground, who require <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information generated on airborne platforms, are increasing. The September 11 th 2001 attacks using hijacked aircraft has meant that security is now playing a greater role in aviation alongside safety. Multiple decision-makers on the ground from political heads to air defence commanders now also want access to <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information on the aircraft. Which means that in addition to the flow of safety related <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information to the pilot there will need to be a whole new flow of security information from the aircraft to decision-makers on the ground. The same style of shift is occurring in the military UAS community as a result of implementing the twin doctrines of network centric operations and power to the edge. This means providing a greater amount of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> to lower level decision-makers (soldiers in the field). Which means that instead of providing just one feed to a commander, the unmanned aerial system now has to supply imagery to multiple receivers all of whom could have different <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> needs. This thesis addresses those points and proposes using on-board processing systems for both platform types to create <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information streams capable of simultaneously meeting the requirements of multiple decision-makers. This is accomplished with the use of fuzzy inference systems to turn raw sensor information into pieces of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> that can be acted upon by decision-makers. These systems look for anomalous activity in passenger behaviour, which could indicate a security situation is occurring. It also proposes a method that allows decision-makers to tailor an imagery system to their needs rather than forcing decision- makers to use a one-size fits-all type of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> provision system. The results of this thesis show that using historical patterns of behaviour and scenario generation airborne systems can be built to meet the new needs of multiple decision-makers on the ground. Techniques such as fuzzy inference systems can be tailored to perform the collection and processing of data into <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information allowing it to be communicated over existing bandwidth limited connections. Therefore the overall hypothesis of this thesis is that there are evolving <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> needs that existing systems cannot meet and that through onboard <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> collec- tion and processing systems, ground-based decision-makers can obtain the <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> information they need even over the existing bandwidth limited communications channels.

However, current research has not proven beneficial in determining the factors that underpin <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> This study examined <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> among licensed captains and pilots of the inland towing industry. Twenty towboat captains, who operate on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) from New Orleans, LA to Houston, TX and who represented 16 towing vessel companies, were interviewed and participated in an integrated survey that explored fatigue, communication, dangerous drugs and alcohol, social stress, and mental workload. These factors were believed to have a direct influence on <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> among towing vessel captains. These factors were compared and resulted in the identification of mental workload as the predominant factor affecting <b>situational</b> <b>awareness.</b> Upon further examination of mental workload, it was found that loss of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is likely to occur when a towing vessel captain is distracted by a cell phone conversation with their company or steers his or her tow in the vicinity of recreational vessels. In addition, the results also indicated complacency potential, a function of attitude toward automation and perception of mental workload. It was concluded that outreach and education to recreational boaters, establishing procedures for business conversations, navigation simulators, drills, and strategic thinking could be effective counter-measures against the loss of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> induced by mental workload. Further research that measures the impact of those distractions or examines the effectiveness of such counter-measures in reducing the potential for loss of <b>situational</b> <b>awareness</b> is neede...|$|R
