25|$|In July 2013, Irish Water {{was legally}} {{established}} {{and began a}} national metering programme. The company was expected to initially install meters for approximately 1.05million households. Domestic water charges were scheduled to commence in October 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015, with bills paid for usage in arrears. Irish Water would hence become the national water services authority, assuming all responsibilities for water services from local authorities - except for those relating to certain rural water services and inspections of wastewater treatment systems. Ireland's 34 local authorities were to continue to provide some drinking and waste water services on behalf of Irish Water through a <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

It looks at the typical components of a service-level agreement, and identifies three common approaches that are used to satisfy <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> in IP networks.

While most providers currently offer a static insurance approach towards supporting <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements,</b> the schemes that can lead to more dynamic approaches are identified.

There {{is a lack of}} empirical studies the relationship among <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> (the quality parameters of service agreed between customer and provider) and the required IT parts to deliver IT services. In the ITIL framework, the <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> process is fully described, albeit without a formal representation. Enterprise Architecture frameworks provide a mean for formal description of IT and business parts of organizations and their interrelationships, however without reference to <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements.</b> In this research, we intend to derive a formal specification of <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> by integrating IT Services Management within an Enterprise Architecture framework.

40|$|As Grids and service-oriented {{architectures}} {{have evolved}} to a common infrastructure for providing and consuming services in research and commercial environments, mechanisms are needed {{to agree on the}} objectives and the quality of such service provision. There is a clear trend to use electronic contracts between service consumers and one or more service providers, in order to achieve the necessary reliability and commitment from all parties. <b>Service</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Agreements</b> (SLAs) are the means to model and manage such contracts in a unified way. Grids and Service-Oriented Architectures for <b>Service</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Agreements,</b> the thirteenth volume of the CoreGRID series, contains current research and up-to date solutions from research and business communities presented at the IEEE Grid 2009 Workshop on <b>Service</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Agreements</b> in Grids, and the <b>Service</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Agreements</b> in Grids Dagstuhl Seminar 2009. The contributions in this volume cover Grid environments, but also generic models for SLA management that are applicable to service-oriented systems in general, like market-economic strategies, negotiation models, or monitoring infrastructures.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Within the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD), <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> are a widely used tool for acquiring enterprise-level information technology (IT) resources. In order to contain, if not reduce, {{the total cost}} of ownership of IT resources to the enterprise, the DoD has undertaken outsourcing its IT needs to Cloud service providers. In this thesis, we explore how <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> are specified for non-Cloud-based services, followed by determining how to tailor those practices to specifying <b>service</b> <b>level</b> <b>agreements</b> for Cloud-based <b>service</b> provision, with a focus on end-to-end management of the service-provisioning.
