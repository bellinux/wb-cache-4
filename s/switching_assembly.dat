Here we {{address the question of}} how coherent dynamically <b>switching</b> <b>assemblies</b> appear in large networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons in-teracting deterministically. We show by numerical simulations of large asymmet-ric inhibitory networks with fixed external excitatory drive that if the network has intermediate to sparse connectivity, the individual cells are in the vicinity of a bi-furcation between a quiescent and firing state and the network inhibition varies slowly on the spiking timescale, then cells form assemblies whose members show strong positive correlation, while members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation. We show that cells and <b>assemblies</b> <b>switch</b> between firing and quiescent states with time durations consistent with a power-law.

The presented devices are optimized for pulsed discharge and fit very well for switching the short but high electrical power demand used for magnetic forming. Devices are available in different versions with silicon wafer diameters up to 120 mm and blocking voltages of over 6500 V. Because of the different application requirements a differentiation is made in device technology. Depending on the discharge circuit, devices for low, medium, or high di/dt can be selected and the difference in advantages and disadvantages between both technologies will be described. To minimize the inductance between switching device and freewheeling diode, ABB can integrate this diode monolithic on the switching wafer. These so called reverse conducting devices are very common for magnetic forming applications. Thyristor structures are commercially available up to 8500 V with 120 mm silicon wafers and GTO-like structures are available up to 4500 V with 91 mm silicon wafers. For higher voltages or higher currents a combination of devices in series and/or parallel connection is required. The presentation will also describe the evolution of complete discharge switching modules {{in the range of}} 10 kV / 50 kJ, a large discharge system of 21 kV / 200 kA, and a newly designed high current switch in the range of 15 kV / 3 MJ.

A low-loss <b>switch</b> <b>assembly</b> is utilized to immediately isolate the MMC following fault detection and the SRB suppresses the fault current by injecting a reverse dc voltage.

40|$|Cell {{regulatory}} circuits integrate diverse, {{and sometimes}} conflicting, environmental cues to generate appropriate, condition-dependent responses. Here, we elucidate the components and mechanisms driving a protein-directed RNA switch in the 3 'UTR of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A. We describe a novel HILDA (hypoxia-inducible hnRNP L-DRBP 76 -hnRNP A 2 /B 1) complex that coordinates a three-element RNA switch, enabling VEGFA mRNA translation during combined hypoxia and inflammation. In addition to binding the CA-rich element (CARE), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L regulates <b>switch</b> <b>assembly</b> and function. hnRNP L undergoes two previously unrecognized, condition-dependent posttranslational modifications: IFN-γ induces prolyl hydroxylation and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) -mediated proteasomal degradation, whereas hypoxia stimulates hnRNP L phosphorylation at Tyr(359), inducing binding to hnRNP A 2 /B 1, which stabilizes the protein. Also, phospho-hnRNP L recruits DRBP 76 (double-stranded RNA binding protein 76) to the 3 'UTR, where it binds an adjacent AU-rich stem-loop (AUSL) element, "flipping" the RNA switch by disrupting the GAIT (interferon-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) element, preventing GAIT complex binding, and driving robust VEGFA mRNA translation. The signal-dependent, HILDA complex coordinates {{the function of}} a trio of neighboring RNA elements, thereby regulating translation of VEGFA and potentially other mRNA targets. The VEGFA RNA switch might function to ensure appropriate angiogenesis and tissue oxygenation during conflicting signals from combined inflammation and hypoxia.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis outlines the design and development of the AC to AC matrix converter, using the Venturini method. The elimination of the intermediate DC link capacitor needed for the common converters used today, makes it an "all silicon" device to be used for motor drives. Consequently, there is a potential reduction in drive manufacturing cost, as well as improvement in the power-per-weight and power-per-volume ratios. Furthermore, the converter design makes it capable of bi-directional power flow, as well as sinusoidal currents and voltages in both input and output, with a reduction in the harmonics usually associated with converters. Therefore, this report discusses and analyzes all of the above characteristics, as well as the mathematical equations, describing this converter. Also, it includes some related issues, including the bi-directional <b>switch</b> <b>assembly,</b> input current filters, clamp circuits, and the four-step switching commutation strategy.
