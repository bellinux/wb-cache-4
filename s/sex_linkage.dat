40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{identifying}} the genomic loci linked to exercise participation in males and females. Cross-sectional exercise data of twins and siblings (18 - 50 years) were used from the Netherlands Twin Registry. The sample consisted of 1432 genotyped sibling pairs from 622 families (1120 sibling pairs were genotyped on all chromosomes). Exercise participation (no/yes, based on a cutoff criterion of four metabolic equivalents and 60 min weekly) was assessed by survey. Genotyping was based on 361 markers and an average marker density of 10. 6 cM. Identical by descent status was estimated for a 1 cM grid. A variance components-based sex-limited linkage scan was carried out for exercise participation. The heritability of exercise participation in males was 68. 5 % and in females 46. 3 %. The genetic overlap was estimated at 0. 32, indicating that partly different genes affect exercise in the two <b>sexes.</b> Suggestive <b>linkage</b> was found in all subjects on chromosome 19 p 13. 3 (LOD= 2. 18). Although <b>sex</b> differences in <b>linkage</b> effect were not significant, mainly females contributed to the suggestive linkage.

40|$|Abstract Background The Atlantic {{salmon is}} {{a species of}} {{commercial}} and ecological significance. Like other salmonids, the species displays residual tetrasomy and a large difference in recombination rate between <b>sexes.</b> <b>Linkage</b> maps with full genome coverage, containing both type I and type II markers, are needed for progress in genomics. Furthermore, {{it is important to}} estimate levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the species. In this study, we developed several hundred single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the Atlantic salmon, and constructed male and female linkage maps containing SNP and microsatellite markers. We also investigated further the distribution of male and female recombination events across the genome, and estimated levels of LD between pairs of markers. Results The male map had 29 linkage groups and was 390 cM long. The female map had 30 linkage groups as was 1983 cM long. In total, the maps contained 138 microsatellite markers and 304 SNPs located within genes, most of which were successfully annotated. The ratio of male to female recombination events was either close to zero or very large, indicating that there is little overlap between regions in which male and female crossovers occur. The female map is likely to have close to full genome coverage, while the majority of male linkage groups probably lack markers in telomeric regions where male recombination events occur. Levels of r 2 increased with decreasing inter-marker distance in a bimodal fashion; increasing slowly from ~ 60 cM, and more rapidly more from ~ 12 cM. Long-ranging LD may be consequence of recent admixture in the population, the population being a 'synthetic' breeding population with contributions from several distinct rivers. Levels of r 2 dropped to half its maximum value (above baseline) within 15 cM, and were higher than 0. 2 above baseline for unlinked markers ('useful LD') at inter-marker distances less than 5 cM. Conclusion The linkage map presented here is an important resource for genetic, comparative, and physical mapping of the Atlantic salmon. The female map is likely to have a map coverage that is not far from complete, whereas the male map length is likely to be significantly shorter than the true map, due to suboptimal marker coverage in the apparently small physical regions where male crossovers occur. 'Useful LD' was found at inter-marker distances less than 5 cM. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Y linkage, {{which can}} also be known as <b>sex</b> <b>linkage</b> or holandric inheritance, affects traits that are located on the Y chromosome.

However, the Y chromosome is no longer considered to be as barren as it once was; it is estimated to contain about 200 genes. The Y-chromosome is sex determining in some species but not others, so not all genes that play a role in sex determination are Y-linked. The Y-chromosome for the most part does not undergo genetic recombination; only small regions called the pseudoautosomal regions exhibit recombination.

It is known, however, that HDL-C levels are influenced in complex ways by factors related to age and sex. In this paper, we examined the {{evidence for a}}ge- and sex-specific linkage of HDL-C in a longitudinal sample of participants from the Framingham Heart Study. To determine if aging could influence our ability to detect linkage, we explored the evidence for linkage of HDL-C at three time points, t 1, t 2, and t 3, spaced approximately 8 years apart and corresponding respectively to visits 11, 15, and 20 for the original cohort and 1, 2, and 4 for the offspring and spouses. Additionally, {{to examine the effects}} of <b>sex</b> on <b>linkage</b> at each time point, we estimated the heritability and genetic correlation of HDL-C, performed linkage analysis of HDL-C, tested for genotype-by-sex interaction at a QTL, and performed linkage analysis of HDL-C in males and females separately.

Although the QTL could be detected in the combined sample of males and females at the first time point, the linkage was not significant at subsequent time points. </p...|$|R

In 1910 Thomas Hunt Morgan and Lilian Vaughan Morgan collected a single male white-eyed mutant from a population of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, which usually have dark brick red compound eyes. Upon crossing this male with wild-type female flies, {{they found that the}} offspring did not conform to the expectations of Mendelian inheritance. The first generation (the F1) produced 1,237 red-eyed offspring and three white-eyed flies, all males. The second generation (the F2) produced 2,459 red-eyed females, 1,011 red-eyed males, and 782 white-eyed males. Further experimental crosses led them to the conclusion that this mutation was somehow physically connected to the [...] "factor" [...] that determined sex in Drosophila. This led to the discovery of <b>sex</b> <b>linkage,</b> in which the gene for a trait is found on a sex chromosome. Morgan named this trait white, now abbreviated w.

The mutual influence of environmental and genetic factors hampers disentangling the complex sex determination mechanism in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).

Quantitative trait loci for temperature-dependent sex reversal similarly reside on linkage group 23. The anti-Müllerian hormone gene (amh), located in this genomic region, is important for sexual fate in higher vertebrates, and shows sexually dimorphic expression in Nile tilapia.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of sex determination and sex differentiation {{have been shown}} to differ among geographic populations of common frogs. Notably, the association between phenotypic <b>sex</b> and <b>linkage</b> group 2 (LG 2) {{has been found to be}} perfect in a northern Swedish population, but weak and variable among families in a southern one. By analyzing these populations with markers from other linkage groups, we bring two new insights: (1) the variance in phenotypic sex not accounted for by LG 2 in the southern population could not be assigned to genetic factors on other linkage groups, suggesting an epigenetic component to sex determination; (2) a second linkage group (LG 7) was found to co-segregate with sex and LG 2 in the northern population. Given the very short timeframe since post-glacial colonization (in the order of 1000 generations) and its seemingly localized distribution, this neo-sex chromosome system might be the youngest one described so far. It does not result from a fusion, but more likely from a reciprocal translocation between the original Y chromosome (LG 2) and an autosome (LG 7), causing their co-segregation during male meiosis. By generating a strict linkage between several important genes from the sex-determination cascade (Dmrt 1, Amh and Amhr 2), this neo-sex chromosome possibly contributes to the 'differentiated sex race' syndrome (strictly genetic sex determination and early gonadal development) that characterizes this northern population...|$|R

40|$|Sex is {{orchestrated by}} the mating-type locus (MAT) in fungi and by sex {{chromosomes}} in plants and animals. In fungi, two patterns of sexuality occur: bipolar with a single, typically biallelic sex determinant that promotes inbreeding, and tetrapolar with two unlinked, often multiallelic sex determinants that restrict inbreeding. Multiallelism in either bipolar or tetrapolar mating systems promotes outcrossing. Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic bipolar yeast with two unusually large MAT alleles (a/alpha) spanning > 100 kb, similar to 100 -fold larger {{than many other}} fungal MAT loci. Based on comparative genomic analysis, this unusual MAT locus is hypothesized to have evolved from an ancestral tetrapolar system. In this model, the unlinked homeodomain (HD) transcription factor and pheromone/ receptor tetrapolar loci acquired additional sex-related genes and then fused via chromosomal translocation, forming an intermediate transitional mating system (which we term tripolar), which then underwent recombination and gene conversion to fashion the extant bipolar MAT alleles. To experimentally validate this model, C. neoformans was engineered to have a tetrapolar mating system by relocating the MAT SXI 1 alpha and SXI 2 a HD genes to an unlinked genomic locale. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that this modified organism could complete a tetrapolar sexual cycle. Analysis of progeny generated from bipolar, tripolar, and tetrapolar crosses provides direct experimental evidence that the tripolar state confers decreased fertility and therefore may represent an unstable evolutionary intermediate. These findings illustrate how transitions between outcrossing and inbreeding preference occur by involving <b>sex</b> determinant <b>linkage</b> and collapse from multiallelic to biallelic sex determination, providing insights into both fungal sex evolution and early steps in sex chromosome evolution...|$|R

Phenotypic analysis was completed for alveolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, survival time, mast cells/mm 2 and cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to assess lung damage. Genome scans and linkage analysis were completed for two backcross cohorts (75 %C 3 H/HeJ- 25 %C 57 Bl/ 6 J or 25 %C 3 H/HeJ- 75 %C 57 BU 6 J) using each of the phenotypes measured. Putative susceptibility loci were identified for alveolitis on chromosomes 12 (LOD= 3. 35), 14 (LOD= 2. 22) and 19 (LOD= 1. 7) in the mostly C 3 H/HeJ backcross cohort and on chromosome 14 (LOD= 2. 7) in the mostly C 57 BI/ 6 J backcross cohort. Linkage using the pulmonary fibrosis scores provided supportive evidence for a quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 17 (LOD= 2) in the mostly C 57 BI/ 6 J background, and two unique putative linkage regions were localized on chromosome 2 (LOD= 2. 2) in the mostly C 3 H/HeJ cohort and 14 (LOD= 2) in the mostly C 57 BI/ 6 J cohort.

40|$|Speciation {{is intimately}} {{associated}} with the evolution of sex-and-reproduction-related traits, including those affecting hybrid incompatibility (postzygotic isolation) and species recognition (prezygotic isolation). Genes controlling such traits are not randomly distributed in the genome but are particularly abundant on the sex chromosomes. However, the evolutionary consequences of the <b>sex</b> <b>linkage</b> of genes involved in speciation have been little explored. Here, we present simulations of a continent-island diploid model that examines the effects of reduced recombination using both autosomal and sex-linked inheritance. We show first that linkage between genes affecting postzygotic and prezygotic isolation leads to a positive feedback loop in which both are strengthened. As species recognition evolves, genes causing hybrid incompatibility will hitchhike along with those improving premating isolation, leading to stronger hybrid incompatibility and thus increased pressure for further preference divergence. Second, we show that this loop effect is generally enhanced by <b>sex</b> <b>linkage,</b> because recombination is eliminated in the heterogametic sex, leading to tighter effective linkage between the two classes of genes and because natural selection is more efficient at sex-linked loci, as recessive alleles are not masked by dominance in the heterogametic sex.

40|$|MAJOR AND 5 S RIBOSOMAL SEQUENCES ARE LOCALIZED IN THE SAME CHROMOSOMAL REGION IN Conger conger (ANGUILLIFORMES, CONGRIDAE) Salvadori S., Cau A., Coluccia E., Cannas R., Foddis I. E., Deiana A. M., Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliari, Viale Poetto, 1 - 09126 Cagliari, Italy. e-mail: salvador@unica. it Eukaryotic organisms have a {{high number}} of ribosomal genes, {{organized}} in two different gene families: the major family encoding for 28 S, 18 S and 5. 8 S rRNA, localized in nucleolar organizer region (NOR), and the minor family encoding for 5 S rRNA; they represent important markers in karyological analysis. In this work we studied their localization and reciprocal relationships in the conger eel, Conger conger L. The major family has been studied by silver staining that evidences the active NORs, by CMA 3 that points out the CG richness of the region and by FISH that localizes directly 45 rDNA sequences. These techniques allowed to localize the NOR in only one pair, the smallest pair 19, throughout the entire short arm. The 5 S rRNA gene family has been localized by FISH on the short arm of the pair 19, where the NOR was localized, completely interspersed throughout the chromosome arm, suggesting a colocalization of the two gene families. In higher eukaryotes, included fishes, the two ribosomal gene families are commonly located in different chromosome pairs; Conger conger is the first Anguilliformes species showing the presence of the two ribosomal gene families in the same chromosomal region. Among fishes the major and the minor ribosomal gene families have been mapped in closely related loci in S. salar (1) and Oncorhynchus mikiss (2). 1) Morán P, Martínez JL, García-Vázquez E, Pendás AM (1996) <b>Sex</b> chromosome <b>linkage</b> of 5 S rDNA in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

40|$|This {{research}} was a descriptive {{study on the}} challenges of the HIV and AIDS pandemic in informal (slum) settlements, case studying the Hatcliffe Extension slum in Harare, Zimbabwe. With slums identified as areas of high risk and vulnerability with regards to HIV infection and spread due to high levels of poverty, information gaps existed as to the exact causative factors and transmission dynamics of the pandemic in such areas in the country. This particular study therefore sought to fill in these information gaps as well as to further go on and recommend on how to best address the pandemic in these highly vulnerable communities. More specifically, it sought to determine the factors increasing risk and vulnerability to HIV infection among the informal settlement dwellers, to establish <b>sex</b> networking <b>linkages</b> within and around the settlement as well as to establish the levels of care and support for People Living With HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) and OVC in the settlement. It also had as its other objectives to assess the slum dwellersâ€™ knowledge, attitude and practices with regards to HIV and AIDS, establish the factors inhibiting the effective response to HIV and AIDS in the informal settlement and finally to draw lessons and good practices with regards to responding to the HIV and AIDS pandemic in informal settlements. Data collection included review of project documents of the various development organizations operating in the area, participatory observations, focus group discussions(with grandparents caring for orphans, children heading households, adolescents and adults), key informant interviews with local leadership, government and non-governmental development programmes implementers, as well as in-depth interviews with People Living With HIV and AIDS and orphans. Adolescents and adults were interviewed in-depth in a KAPB survey to establish their knowledge, attitudes, practices and behaviours with regards to sexuality issues. The results clearly showed that poverty and unemployment were the main factors driving HIV infection and spread in the community as people particularly women, engaged in transactional sex as a survival strategy, as affirmed by 62 (60. 8...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} including allozyme analysis, restriction digest patterns and sequencing of mtDNA {{as well as}} mini- and micro-satellite allele frequencies indicate that Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from North America and Europe are genetically distinct. These observations are supported by karyotype analysis, which revealed that North American Atlantic salmon have 27 pairs of chromosomes whereas European salmon have 29 pairs. We set out to construct a linkage map for a North American Atlantic salmon family and to compare this map with the well developed map for European Atlantic salmon. Results: We used microsatellite markers, which had previously been mapped in the two Atlantic salmon SALMAP mapping families from the River Tay, Scotland, to carry out linkage analysis in an Atlantic salmon family (NB 1) whose parents were derived from the Saint John River stock in New Brunswick, Canada. As large differences in recombination rates between female and male Atlantic salmon have been noted, separate genetic maps were constructed for each <b>sex.</b> The female <b>linkage</b> map comprises 218 markers in 37 linkage groups while the male map has 226 markers in 28 linkage groups. We combined 280 markers from the female and male maps into 27 composite linkage groups, which correspond to the haploid number of chromosomes in Atlantic salmon from the Western Atlantic...|$|R
