2500|$|Mr. A.'s wife - Vera's mother - {{had died}} in 1967. In December 1969, when Vera was {{recovering}} from an illness, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> her mother's framed photograph on the piano and wished they could still talk. With pen in hand Vera found herself writing - with difficulty - on the writing pad in front of her, [...] "I love you Vera." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Kinnaird laughed {{softly as}} <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> her attire.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> {{the face}} of the {{approaching}} man. They maintain a bashful silence until he has passed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see I {{have come}} to the right house,' said <b>she,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> the lad, and smiling. 'But I was not sure till you opened the door.' ...|$|R
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> my entrance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him entreatingly; the sarcasm was too bitter, too unendurable.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him, a {{question}} in her eyes, then looked away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his worn {{clothing}} and soiled white necktie, and smiled.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> her high-necked {{gown and}} avoided Helen's anxious eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> him and waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|R
6000|$|The widow laughs heartily and really. She {{places a}} {{handkerchief}} over her mouth. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> her brother {{with a pair}} of eyes full of knowing mischief. [...] "Ah, dear James," [...] she says, [...] "you don't {{know what it is to}} have a mother's feelings." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> me {{swiftly and}} surely; {{and shook her}} head again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} Yale key which hung from her bracelet.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the porch}} against {{which a man}} was still leaning.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> {{him with}} a winsome smile, glad to hear his words.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} {{recognise}} it, for <b>at</b> length <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> him sharply.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> sidelong <b>at</b> me {{with that}} {{stealthy}} gravity that lay under all her lightness.|$|R
60|$|She {{was silent}} for several moments. Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him curiously.|$|E
60|$|Hilda {{burst into}} a fit of {{laughter}} as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the postscript.|$|E
60|$|The girl's {{face flushed}} suddenly, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Ingleby, who {{appeared}} embarrassed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> him shyly through wet lashes--as peeps the sun through April clouds.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> around <b>at</b> the horrified {{faces of}} her friends and burst into tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{scarcely}} <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him as <b>she</b> {{sent him}} away, yet Tavernake walked on air.|$|R
60|$|But as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the letter}} the colour fled from her cheek.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him {{swiftly and}} knew the {{question}} was but a venture.|$|E
60|$|Katharine {{nodded her}} head. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{him with an}} oddly furtive expression.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> him, {{her eyes}} {{abruptly}} and slightly moist, half with hurt, half with anger.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> him, startled. He was sitting, {{with his}} legs crossed, {{looking up at her}} intently.|$|R
60|$|She looked up. <b>She</b> shyly <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> her eager, {{handsome}} suitor. She gazed tenderly on her furrowed sire.|$|R
60|$|Ida {{was not in}} a very complaisant mood, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him coldly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> {{the old-fashioned}} clock which {{stood in the}} corner of the hall.|$|E
60|$|The {{nurse in}} white softly entered. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Gerald, {{then at the}} bed.|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, rises, {{and goes}} to the large mirror to wipe away her tears. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Richards, who does not move. She sits down in a seat nearer him than the chair she has left. After some faint murmurs and hesitations, she asks, [...] "Will you please tell me why you went out just now?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> questioningly <b>at</b> Mr. Fothergill, and Cecil {{introduced}} {{him in an}} informal sort of way and explained our visit.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated so {{long that}} <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> up <b>at</b> him and read all that he had wished to say in his face.|$|R
