2500|$|In 1928, James Ewing {{challenged}} the [...] "seed and soil" [...] theory and proposed that metastasis occurs purely by anatomic and mechanical routes. [...] This hypothesis has been recently utilized to suggest several hypotheses {{about the life}} cycle of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and to postulate that the patterns of spread could be better understood through a 'filter and flow' perspective. However, contemporary evidences indicate that the primary tumour may dictate organotropic metastases by inducing the formation of pre-metastatic niches at distant sites, where incoming metastatic cells may engraft and colonise. Specifically, exosome vesicles secreted by tumours have been shown to home to pre-metastatic sites, where they activate pro-metastatic processes such as angiogenesis and modify the immune contexture, so as to foster a favourable microenvironment for <b>secondary</b> <b>tumour</b> growth.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} primary and <b>secondary</b> intracranial <b>tumours</b> in the Lothian region of south east Scotland. METHODS [...] A population based study was performed. Patients from Lothian with incident intracranial tumours diagnosed in 1989 and 1990 (by CT or histology) were identified retrospectively using multiple sources. Differences in incidence by tumour type, age, sex, and socioeconomic status were examined. RESULTS [...] Four hundred and forty two patients with incident intracranial tumours were identified (228 primary <b>tumours</b> and 214 <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours).</b> The crude yearly incidences of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> were 15. 3 and 14. 3 per 100, 000 respectively. The commonest primary tumours were neuroepithelial tumours (53. 5 %), meningeal tumours (19. 5 %), and sellar tumours (16. 5 %). About 50 % of patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> had an underlying lung cancer. The incidence of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> increased markedly with age. Meningeal tumours were more common in women, and neuroepithelial tumours were more common in those who lived in more affluent areas. CONCLUSIONS [...] The incidence rates of primary and <b>secondary</b> intracranial <b>tumours</b> in Lothian were more than twice those previously reported in the United Kingdom. Intracranial tumours are a significant cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in the United Kingdom, and further research into their aetiology and treatment is urgently required...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between expression of receptors for oestrogen and progesterone (ER and PR) {{and disease progression}} in breast cancer was investigated by comparing immunocytochemical determinations of ER and PR in fine needle aspirates from primary and <b>secondary</b> breast <b>tumours.</b> Rates of receptor expression were significantly higher in primary than in secondary lesions: for ER 63. 3 % (n = 689) compared with 45. 3 % (n = 223), and for PR 53. 7 % (n = 443) compared with 33. 1 % (n = 121). The effect of menopausal status was examined by subdividing the patient cohort into those over or {{under the age of}} 50 years. In both instances, ER expression in <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> was relatively low; however, only postmenopausal patients had significantly lower rates of PR expression in <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours.</b> Consistent with this, an increase in the ER+PR– profile in <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> compared with primary cases from postmenopausal patients was seen, and in a multivariate analysis, a specific absence of PR expression in <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> was revealed. Comparison of ER and PR expression in simultaneously sampled primary tumours and lymph node metastases from the same patient showed that receptor expression was stable with progression to a metastatic site as results were concordant for ER in 92 % (n = 88) and PR in 93. 8 % of cases (n = 65). These results suggest that absence of PR expression in primary breast cancer is associated with disease progression and may be a marker of an aggressive tumour phenotype. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

40|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} have been {{described}} in various cancers including squamous tumours of the skin by their ability to reform <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Here, we used transplantation of limiting dilution of different populations of FACS-isolated tumour cells from four distinct mouse models of squamous skin tumours to investigate the frequency of tumour propagating cells (TPCs) {{at different stages of}} tumour progression. We found that benign papillomas, despite growing rapidly in vivo and being clonogenic in vitro, reformed <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> upon transplantation at very low frequency and only when tumour cells were co-transplanted together with tumour-associated fibroblasts or endothelial cells. In two models of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), TPCs increased with tumour invasiveness. Interestingly, the frequency of TPCs increased in CD 34 (HI) but not in CD 34 (LO) SCC cells with serial transplantations, while the two populations initially gave rise to <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> with the same frequency. Our results illustrate the progressive increase of squamous skin TPCs with tumour progression and invasiveness and reveal that serial transplantation may be required to define the long-term renewal potential of TPCs.

40|$|The use {{of local}} {{hyperthermia}} to treat {{cancer of the}} internal organs has been limited by the difficulty of controlling delivery of heat and limiting the effects to the tumour, but this can be overcome by using laser light transmitted through thin flexible fibres. Laser energy was delivered to tumours through fibres inserted percutaneously through needles directly into {{the centre of the}} tumour area. Ultrasound scanning was used to locate the tumour, position the fibres correctly within the tumour, and monitor the development of thermal necrosis in real time during laser exposure and through the subsequent period of healing. Five patients were treated (one with a tumour of the breast, one with a subcutaneous <b>secondary</b> <b>tumour,</b> one with a recurrent pancreatic tumour, and two with secondary tumours in the liver).

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} a {{challenge}} to determine breast cancer clonality accurately. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess methods using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue to differentiate new primary tumours from true recurrences that are associated with poorer prognoses and often require more aggressive treatment. METHODS: We investigated the novel method of analysing gene alterations of mitochondrial DNA D-loop region (GAMDDL) and compared it with the conventional method of analysing the X-chromosome-linked human androgen receptor (HUMARA). The FFPE sections of primary and secondary breast cancers, the non-neoplastic mammary gland, and lymph nodes were examined. RESULTS: Informative rates for HUMARA, GAMDDL, and combined analyses were 42. 1 %, 76. 9 %, and 89. 5 %, respectively. All of the 10 contralateral breast cancers were determined to be non-clonal. In contrast, 3 out of 8 (37. 5 %) of the ipsilateral <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours</b> shared a clonal origin with the primary tumour and were classified as true recurrences, whereas 4 out of 8 (50 %) were classified as new primary tumours.

40|$|Giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is {{a primary}} tumour of bone that may rarely, {{in the absence of}} {{malignant}} cytological features, produce metastatic lesions, most commonly in the lungs. Whether these lung nodules represent true neoplastic secondaries or implants derived from the primary tumour is not certain. In this study, we have analysed the morphological and immunophenotypic features of 19 conventional GCTBs and corresponding lung nodules for expression of macrophage, osteoclast, proliferation and tumour-associated markers. A striking morphological feature of all GCTBs that produced lung secondaries was the presence of large areas of haemorrhage and thrombus formation; mononuclear and multinucleated cells of GCTB were frequently found within these areas of haemorrhage and thrombus. A similar pattern of CD 14, CD 33, HLA-DR and CD 51 expression was seen in macrophages and giant cells in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours.</b> Smooth muscle actin expression was frequently noted in primary GCTBs that recurred and metastasised. No difference was seen in the expression of p 53, p 63, Ki- 67, cyclin D 1 or Bcl- 2 in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tumours.</b> Our findings suggest that most lung nodules associated with primary conventional GCTBs are implants derived from tumour emboli formed in areas of haemorrhage and thrombus formation within the primary tumour...|$|R
