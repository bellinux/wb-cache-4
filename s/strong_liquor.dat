Governor Patrick Gordon sent Chartier a reprimand, and traders continued to bring rum into Shawnee communities, including several traders who the Shawnees had requested be barred from their territory.|$|E
25|$|The Nivelle Offensive was a grave disappointment, demoralising the French {{troops and}} {{leading to the}} French Army Mutinies. The sense of failure {{extended}} to the Schneider tanks. Their losses had indeed been heavy: 76 of the 128 combat tanks engaged had been lost. Many of these had burnt: 57 in total, 31 with Groupement Bossut and 26 with Groupement Chaubès. Most had been set on fire by German artillery: twenty-three vehicles of Groupement Chaubès {{had been hit by}} indirect fire and fifteen of Groupement Bossut; this latter unit had fourteen tanks hit by direct fire. Investigations showed that most vehicles had carried additional fire-hazards: to compensate the limited range two fifty litre cans of petrol had been attached to the rear and some crews had even stowed a third one inside; sometimes explosive charges had been stowed outside; each tank had a bottle of ether to mix with the petrol to boost the engine and to enhance the fighting spirit three litres of <b>strong</b> <b>liquor</b> had been provided {{at the start of the}} battle. Also the personnel losses had been high: 180 of the 720 crew members, and 40% of the supporting infantry had become casualties. On a positive note, twenty broken-down tanks had been salvaged from the battlefield, all enemy infantry assaults had failed, and the spaced armour proved to be very resistant, beyond expectations, against small-arms fire and shell splinters. The main technical complaint was that visibility from within the vehicle was poor for the driver as well as the gunners. Tactical lessons drawn were that tanks should spread out more to avoid artillery fire and had to cooperate more closely with the infantry.|$|E

30|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that ethyl caproate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, and ethyl lactate are the four major volatile flavour components present in Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor,</b> with their relative proportions strongly influencing the aromatic quality and style of the spirit. Among these esters, ethyl caproate is the major component most important for the aroma and bouquet of the liquor. Normally, high ethyl caproate concentrations are associated with higher quality Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor,</b> whereas high ethyl lactate levels can make the liquor taste bitter, stuffy, and lacking in fragrance, thereby disrupting the typical character of Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor</b> (Bornstein and Barker 1991). Therefore, it is important to improve the production of caproic acid in the Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor</b> industry. In this study, the binary fermentation conditions of C. kluyveri H 588 and Methanogen were optimized, and these optimized conditions were scaled-up to use in a 1000 L pilot-scale fermenter. The resultant caproic acid broth was subjected to traditional pit-entry fermentation in an attempt {{to improve the quality of}} Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor.</b> Table  2 revealed that the maximum concentration of caproic acid (286.29 [*]±[*] 9.82  mg/ 100  mL) was obtained from the distillation of the experimental Zaopei; a concentration 142.78 % higher than that obtained from control pits.|$|R

2500|$|While {{strychnine}} {{has been}} suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves, in his book Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson, relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in <b>strong</b> <b>liquor.</b> Graves also claims that {{a significant amount of}} strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days. Johnson's contemporary David [...] "Honeyboy" [...] Edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine, since Johnson would have died much more rapidly, instead of suffering for three days.|$|E

30|$|Chinese liquor is a {{traditional}} alcoholic drink that is consumed widely in China and {{plays an important role}} in Chinese life and culture. Generally, it is typically classified into five categories based on its aroma: <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor,</b> light flavor liquor, sauce flavor liquor, sweet honey flavor liquor, and mixed flavor liquor (Li et al. 2013). Among these, <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor</b> is the most popular distilled liquor in China and it is characterized based on its aroma, mellow taste, and harmonious flavour. Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor</b> is traditionally fermented in a solid state system, in which pit mud serves as the base material for the resulting flavor. This mud is inhabited by various microorganisms, including bacteria that produce caproic acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, acetic acid, and methane. These microbes play vital roles in the production of aromatic compounds, and consequently give Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor</b> special characteristics that have been described by some as making it highly flavoured, sweet, and refreshing (Yan et al. 2015 a). Of these microorganisms, those bacteria which produce caproic acid are among the most important for the overall fermentation process, as caproic acid reacts with ethanol leading to the formation of ethyl caproate, which is the major aromatic component of Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor.</b> Therefore, there is great industrial interest in improving the quality of Chinese <b>strong</b> flavor <b>liquor</b> via increasing the production of ethyl caproate. Typically a high caproic acid content will promote increased ethyl caproate production, conversely, a low concentration of ethyl caproate was produced. Caproic acid producing bacteria can also generate butyric acid, valeric acid, and other trace elements, and as such their metabolism can greatly influence the quality of the final liquor.|$|R
