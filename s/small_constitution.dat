5|$|By 1946, all rightist {{parties had}} been outlawed, {{and a new}} pro-government Democratic Bloc was formed in 1947 which {{included}} only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the first parliamentary elections took place featuring primarily PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party, whose strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution. Results were adjusted by Stalin himself to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords. The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics. After the referendum dress rehearsal, the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, a NKVD colonel charged with the election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new Sejm, out of 444 seats, 27 were given to Mikołajczyk's party. Stanisław Mikołajczyk, who declared the results to be falsified and was threatened with arrest or worse, fled the country and other opposition leaders also left. Western governments did not act further and the Poles felt abandoned again. In the same year, the new Sejm created the <b>Small</b> <b>Constitution</b> of 1947. Over the next two years, the communists monopolized their political power in Poland.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} paper {{estimates the}} effects on well-being of two very important institutional symbols of 59 countries in 2007 : national flags and constitutions. The results indicate that well-being responds positively to investment in material things {{as well as the}} existence of flags. However, nationalwell-being is highly inelastic with respect to measures of constitutions and national flag colors. In fact, nations with fewer flag colors, infrequent constitutional changes, and <b>small</b> <b>constitutions</b> tend to have higher well-being than others. I resist comment on what this all means, but it would seem GDP per capita, despite its obvious limitations, is still the most important influence on national well-being. ...|$|R

25|$|In Europe, right-wing {{populism}} {{often takes}} the form of distrust of the European Union and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values. In the United States, the Tea Party movement states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the <b>Constitution,</b> <b>small</b> federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and balancing the budget.|$|R
40|$|ERAL 1, a {{homologue}} of Era {{protein in}} Escherichia coli, {{is a member}} of conserved GTP-binding proteins with RNA-binding activity. Depletion of prokaryotic Era inhibits cell division without affecting chromosome segregation. Previously, we isolated ERAL 1 protein as one of proteins which were associated with mitochondrial transcription factor A by using immunoprecipitation. In this study, we analysed the localization and function of ERAL 1 in mammalian cells. ERAL 1 was localized in mitochondrial matrix and associated with mitoribosomal proteins including the 12 S rRNA. siRNA knockdown of ERAL 1 decreased mitochondrial translation, caused redistribution of ribosomal small subunits and reduced 12 S rRNA. The knockdown of ERAL 1 in human HeLa cells elevated mitochondrial superoxide production and slightly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. The knockdown inhibited the growth of HeLa cells with an accumulation of apoptotic cells. These results suggest that ERAL 1 is localized in a small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, {{plays an important role in}} the <b>small</b> ribosomal <b>constitution,</b> and is also involved in cell viability...|$|R

50|$|Apportionment at {{the federal}} level of the United States {{government}} follows a complex scheme established by the U.S. Constitution. Seats in the House of Representatives (the lower legislative chamber) are distributed among the states and the districts within them by proportional representation according to population.

This plan came about {{as a result of the}} Connecticut Compromise reached during Constitutional Convention of 1787 between states of large and <b>small</b> populations.

50|$|The {{resulting}} parliament came to {{be known}} as the Legislative Sejm (Sejm Ustawodawczy). Among the first tasks of the Sejm was creation of the constitution, and the <b>Small</b> <b>Constitution</b> of 1919 was ratified ten days after the first session, on 20 February 1919.

50|$|The <b>Small</b> <b>Constitution</b> of 1919 {{outlined}} Poland's form of government, with a {{democratically elected}} Sejm, {{a prime minister}} and cabinet, and an executive branch. Despite outlining a parliamentary system, the <b>Small</b> <b>Constitution</b> vested many executive powers onto Piłsudski's position as Chief of State. The executive branch could select and organize cabinets (with the Sejm's consent), be responsible to the ministries for their duties, and require the countersignature of ministers for all official acts. By the early 1920s, rightist nationalists within parliament, particularly Roman Dmowski {{and other members of}} the Popular National Union party and the Endecja movement, advocated reforms to the republic's structure to stem the authority of the chief of state (and ultimately Piłsudski) while increasing parliamentary powers. The result was the Sejm's passage of the March Constitution of 1921. Modeled after the Third French Republic, the March Constitution entrusted decision-making exclusively within the lower-house Sejm. The newly created presidency, on the other hand, became a symbolic office devoid of any major authority, stripped of veto and wartime powers.|$|E

40|$|Body {{mass index}} and percent body fat are two {{parameters}} {{used to assess}} human body composition, which has several advantages for clinical practice, sport, growth, and normal population as well. There are many populations distributed in the wide Indonesian area that have various geographical characteristics. As evidence, plateau environments are inhabited by many populations whose physical and physiological traits are vary. This study was aimed to investigate body mass index (BMI) and predicted percent body fat (%BF) between Yogyakarta populations and Flores pygmy population in East Nusa Tenggara Province residing on a similar plateau environment. The present study was done on 105 people (51 males and 54 females) of Samigaluh Kulon Progo (Yogyakarta), 87 people (40 males and 47 females) of Gunung Kidul (Yogyakarta) and 75 pygmy people of Manggarai, Flores (East Nusa Tenggara). Height and weight were measured in all participants of this study. BMI was calculated from height and weight measurements and %BF was predicted based on BMI value using formula of Guricci et al (1998). Then, t-student test, linear regression, and chi square test were performed to analyze the data. The results indicated that Samigaluh and Gunung Kidul populations in Yogyakarta have considerably greater average of height and weight compare to Flores Pygmy population. However, differences in BMI and %BF were only significant between Flores Pygmy and Yogyakarta males population. Despite majority of both populations being under normal category, nutritional category based on BMI showed significant difference between Flores Pygmy and Yogyakarta population. In addition, more underweight individuals were also observed in Flores Pygmy. In conclusion, Yogyakarta population was considerably taller and heavier than Flores Pygmy population, however, in terms of %BF and BMI, they were nearly the same lean and body constitution. It is suggested that lower BMI and %BF represented by <b>small</b> body <b>constitution</b> and leanness in populations living on plateau in Yogyakarta and Flores are likely due to significant adaptation to their environment...|$|R
40|$|Constitutional review, {{the power}} of courts to strike down {{incompatible}} legislation and administrative action, is an innovation of the American constitutional order {{that has become a}} norm of democratic constitution-writing. Whereas before World War II, only a <b>small</b> handful of <b>constitutions</b> contained provisions for constitutional review, as of this writing, 158 out of 191 constitutional systems include some formal provision for constitutional review. 1 Some political systems, such as the United States, have developed vigorous constitutional review even without an explicit textual mandate. How did this institution, whose democratic foundations are so often questioned in its birthplace, become a norm of democratic constitution writing? The spread of constitutional review has both ideational and institutional underpinnings. Constitutional review is closely associated in the popular mind with what has been characterized as the most important idea of the twentieth century, the notion of human rights (Henkin 1990). But political scientists looking at constitutional review have emphasized its origin in a functional need for dispute resolution. This essay traces the spread of constitutional review and evaluates the various political explanations for the establishment, development and spread of the institution, emphasizing the mutually reinforcing roles of ideas and institutions. The essay also suggests lines for future inquiry in the burgeoning field of comparative constitutional studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} using fumed SiO 2, MCM- 41, and SBA- 15 as {{supports}} for Ru and Ni catalysts oil ammonia decomposition were investigated. It {{was found that}} the supported catalysts on these siliceous materials are more active than those supported on ordinary silica. In general, the supported Ru catalysts are more active than the Ni catalysts, and MCM- 41 is the best support material for Ru and Ni. Significant enhancement in activity was observed when the supported Ru catalysts were modified by KOH, but such effect was minimal in the cases of supported Ni catalysts. The results of N- 2 adsorption and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the Ni particles of Ni/MCM- 41 (TIE) prepared by template-ion exchange (TIE) method are largely located inside the pores of MCM- 41. Compared with the Ni/MCM- 41 (IMP) catalyst prepared by impregnation method, the Ni/MCM- 41 (TIE) catalyst exhibited appropriate Ni dispersion and weaker Ni/support interaction, and consequently higher catalytic activity. In terms of the remarkable changes in turnover frequency (TOF) with Ni dispersion oil different catalysts. it was demonstrated that NH 3 decomposition over Ni is significantly structure sensitive. Some unique metal clusters similar to B 5 active sites should be responsible for the catalytic activities. Preparation methodology has a substantial influence on metal dispersion. For the supported Ni catalysts prepared by the TIE method, the generated metal particles are very <b>small</b> and the <b>constitution</b> of unique active sites becomes unfavorable, which accounts for the apparently lower TOF values.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} the {{development}} of procedure in the House of Assembly of Newfoundland. It is not a history of government and many matters that would be included in such a history have been omitted. Procedure might be defined as {{an account of the}} internal working and operation of a parliament with the politics left out. Rules of procedure, however, do not operate in a vacuum, but develop to enable a legislature to do its work in an efficient and orderly manner. It was necessary, therefore, to give a short history of the General Assembly of Newfoundland in order that the reader might know something of the framework within which the procedure operates. This has been done in the first two chapters. [...] Chapters three to eleven deal with parliamentary Practice and Procedure and show the workings of The House of Assembly since 1833. While the author has depended for the background of this work on the British and Canadian authorities who have written for guidance of Speakers and Members of Parliament, he has endeavoured to show how The House of Assembly developed, applied and in some cases changed parliamentary practice to suit its own needs. This has made necessary the use of the topical rather than the chronological method of writing. The last chapter deals with the effect of Confederation on the Newfoundland Legislature, and brings the development of procedure down to the present day. [...] There was a wealth of material upon which to draw, but the writer found the Journals and Proceedings of the Assembly and the Legislative Council his most fruitful sources. The criterion for including any event was, did it happen in the House of Assembly, or was it directly connected with the House or its procedure. Nothing has been written on this subject in Newfoundland since 1855, when John Little, a St. John's lawyer, wrote a <b>small</b> book, The <b>Constitution</b> of Newfoundland, nor has any Provincial Parliament of Canada before been the subject of a work of this nature...|$|R
