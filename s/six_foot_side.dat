They were dug out of the solid ground. For about <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> the <b>sides</b> of the pit were perpendicular; in some it swelled out like a great vase with a broad shoulder, in others it became a square chamber of some size.|$|R
50|$|Kiln No. 2 {{was built}} {{adjacent}} to Kiln No. 1 and {{immediately to the}} north, similarly facing west towards the creek. It consisted of limestone laid in lime mortar probably produced by Kiln No. 1. It was larger, being oval in vertical section, nine <b>feet</b> in diameter <b>side</b> to <b>side</b> and nine <b>feet</b> ten inches in diameter front to rear. It was lined entirely with fireclay applied like plaster. This kiln sat farther forward than the other two, its front face extending seven feet beyond Kiln 1 and four feet beyond the front face of Kiln 3. A large Douglas fir, which according to tree ring dating sprouted after 1870, grew from the rubble between Kiln 1 and Kiln 2, severely damaging both kilns. Kiln No. 2 still has a well-preserved front arched entrance, measuring <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> from <b>side</b> to side at the base and two <b>feet</b> <b>six</b> inches wide {{at the entrance to}} the barrel, tapering inward.|$|R
5|$|The {{exhumation}} of Yagan's head eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> {{down the}} <b>side</b> of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally {{to the location}} of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|R
25|$|As {{illustrated}} above, {{the pitch}} is marked {{at each end}} with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four {{feet in front of}} the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (<b>six</b> <b>feet</b> either <b>side</b> of the wicket), it is in fact unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also in fact unlimited in length.|$|R
50|$|The cave-in {{problem was}} solved by {{the method of}} square set timbering invented by Philip Deidesheimer, a German mining {{engineer}} from San Francisco, who had been requested to survey the problem by {{the owners of the}} Ophir Mine. Previously, timber sets consisting of vertical members {{on either side of the}} diggings (ribs) capped by a third horizontal member to support the back (roof), creating a tunnel (drift). However, the Comstock ore bodies were not veins, but sporadic pockets too large for this method. Instead, as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> on a <b>side</b> (ribs), front (face) or top (back), all at the same time. Thus, the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice. Often these voids (stopes) would be re-filled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete. By this method of building up squares of framed timbers, an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth. Deidesheimer was appointed to the Ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea.|$|R

60|$|At {{the base}} {{of one of the}} mountains, and {{surrounded}} on all sides by dense groves, a series of vast terraces of stone rises, step by step, for a considerable distance up the hillside. These terraces cannot be less than one hundred yards in length and twenty in width. Their magnitude, however, is less striking than the immense size of the blocks composing them. Some of the stones, of an oblong shape, are from ten to fifteen feet in length, and five or <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> thick. Their <b>sides</b> are quite smooth, but though square, and of pretty regular formation, they bear no mark of the chisel. They are laid together without cement, and here and there show gaps between. The topmost terrace and the lower one are somewhat peculiar in their construction. They have both a quadrangular depression in the centre, leaving the rest of the terrace elevated several feet above it. In the intervals of the stones immense trees have taken root, and their broad boughs stretching far over, and interlacing together, support a canopy almost impenetrable to the sun. Overgrowing the greater part of them, and climbing from one to another, is a wilderness of vines, in whose sinewy embrace many of the stones lie half-hidden, while in some places a thick growth of bushes entirely covers them. There is a wild pathway which obliquely crosses two of these terraces; and so profound is the shade, so dense the vegetation, that a stranger to the place might pass along it without being aware of its existence.|$|R
