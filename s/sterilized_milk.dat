40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Stale flavor {{development}} has been recognized as a defect of stored dry milk powders for several years. Recently, stale flavor {{development has}} been found to occur upon storage of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk,</b> and is recognized as the principal limiting factor to commercial utilization of this process (Seibert, 1963). Some {{attempts have been made to}} identify the volatile flavor components of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> (Patel et al, 1963; Bingham, 1964). The flavor components responsible for the stale flavor defect as it occurs in <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> have not been identified, however. The purpose of this work was to identify the compounds responsible for the stale flavor defect of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk.</b> It was felt that this information was essential to an understanding of the staling phenomenon, which in turn might eventually lead to correction of the defect. Commercial samples of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> were obtained. Stale flavor development was hastened in some of the samples by storing them at 21 °C. Subjective flavor panel evaluation of stored and fresh samples revealed significant differences between the two. Gas chromatographic analysis of the volatile head space components by the procedure described by Morgan and Day (1965) revealed only minor differences between the fresh and stale samples. It was reasoned, therefore, that the compounds responsible for the stale flavor defect were primarily of a less volatile nature, A technique for isolating the higher-boiling flavor components was developed. This technique consisted of lyophilization of the sterile concentrated milk, uniform wetting of the lyophilized milk with water to 10...|$|R

The results of the separate clustering analyses of the PvuII and EcoRI ribopatterns and the REP-PCR patterns were largely consistent with each other and revealed the existence of two main clusters; there was one homogeneous group containing all (REP-PCR) or most (ribotyping) of the UHT isolates, and there was a second more diverse group comprising the farm isolates. A combined three-dimensional analysis of all data showed that three German UHT isolates did not belong to the compact group containing the majority of the UHT isolates. These results demonstrate that B. sporothermodurans is more heterogeneous than previously assumed and that most of the UHT isolates form a genetically distinct subgroup and are capable of producing highly heat-resistant spores.
