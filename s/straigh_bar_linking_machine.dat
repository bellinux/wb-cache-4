50|$|One of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} caused by stress corrosion cracking was {{the fall of the}} Silver Bridge, WV in 1967, when a single brittle crack formed by rusting grew to criticality.

The event escalated and the whole bridge disappeared in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers or passengers on the bridge at the time.|$|R

50|$|Situated in {{northwest}} Trinity Bay, it {{is separated from}} Newfoundland by Smith Sound on {{the north and the}} North West Arm of Random Sound on the south and west. It is not circumnavigable except by small boats, as Random Bar (a bar that runs from its northwest corner to Newfoundland) separates the two sounds. The Hefferton Causeway (now Provincial Route 231) was built in 1954 across Random <b>Bar,</b> <b>linking</b> the island with the nearby town of Clarenville.|$|R
