The two cosmic sources of radiation that could impact a mission outside the Earth’s magnetic field are solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Exposure to the types of ionizing radiation encountered during space travel may cause a number of health-related problems, but the primary concern is related to the increased risk of cancer induction in astronauts.

40|$|The primary {{components}} of radiation in interplanetary space are {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCR) and <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> (SCR). GCR originates from outside of our Solar System, while SCR consists of low energy solar wind particles that flow constantly from the Sun and the highly energetic solar particle events (SPEs) that originate from magnetically disturbed regions of the Sun, which sporadically emit bursts of energetic charged particles. Exposure to space radiation may place astronauts and aviation crews at significant risk for numerous biological effects resulting from exposure to radiation from a major SPE or combined SPE and GCR.

40|$|The solar {{energetic}} particle {{event on}} 20 January 2005 {{was one of the}} largest ground level events ever observed. Neutron monitor stations in the Antarctic recorded count rate increases of several thousand percent caused by secondary energetic particles, and it took more than 36 h to return to background level. Such huge increases in high energetic <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> on the ground are obviously accompanied by considerable changes in the radiation environment at aviation altitudes. Measurements of 28 neutron monitor stations were used in this work to numerically approximate the primary solar proton spectra during the first 12 h of the event by minimizing the differences between measurements and the results of Monte-Carlo calculated count rate increases. The primary spectrum of solar energetic protons was approximated by a power law in rigidity and a linear angular distribution. The incoming direction of the {{solar energetic particle}}s was determined and compared to the interplanetary magnetic field direction during the event. The effects on the radiation exposure at altitudes of about 12 km during that time were estimated to range from none at low latitudes up to almost 2 mSv/h for a very short time in the Antarctic region and about 0. 1 mSv/h at high latitudes on the Northern Hemisphere.

40|$|The Moon has {{virtually}} no atmosphere {{and only a}} very weak magnetosphere. Thus, the radiation descending upon the lunar surface is essentially the unmodified radiation field at 1 AU, and radiation-induced signatures {{of the history of}} the inner solar system are uniquely preserved in lunar surface rocks and regolith in the form of long-lived or stable nuclides. Such nuclides have been evaluated in lunar surface samples brought back during the Apollo era. For example, of particular scientific interest is the historical trend of <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> (SCR) flux. It has been shown that the SCR flux is recorded in lunar surface rocks and regolith and can be reconstructed by measuring selected nuclide concentrations at various depths in the lunar surface (e. g., Reedy 1998). Most importantly, analysis of lunar samples provides a unique opportunity to obtain pristine and independent data on SCR flux during the past several million years. The SCR differential flux (J) per unit of rigidity (R) is expressed as dJ/dR = k • e-R/Ro where R is the momentum of a particle per unit charge (Reedy and Arnold 1972). The spectral parameter Ro for protons from solar flares typically ranges from ~ 20 to ~ 200 MV for eventintegrated spectra observed over the last four decades (Reedy and Nishiizumi 1998, Nishiizumi et al. 2009). A wealth of information on the interaction of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and SCR with the lunar surface has been obtained from Apollo samples.

40|$|Life on Earth, {{throughout}} its almost 4 billion years history, {{has been shaped}} by inter-actions of the organisms with their environment. It has developed with an ever present radiation background. As a powerful mutagen it has contributed to biological evolu-tion, however, it is potentially destructive for individual cells and organisms [1]. Ra-diation response differs extremely for different organisms {{and there is not}} necessarily a correlation between species radiation resistance and levels of exposure in the natural environment [2]. In our solar system Earth is not the only planet, which had the capacity to provide the prerequisites for sustaining life. Mars and the Jupiter moon Europa are suggested to have had the capacity to support life, at least for a certain era. The detection of me-teorites on Earth that originate from Mars supports the theory of interplanetary transfer of life (see Chapter 4, Horneck et al.). Life on other planets or while it is transported through space environment encounters radiation conditions different from those on Earth. In order to understand the likelihood of the development and the chance of persis-tence of life on Earth or other planets, following questions have to be asked: 1. What is the "normal " radiation environment under which life flourishes on Earth? 2. What is the "worst case " radiation environment that life will encounter in space? 3. How does radiation interact with living matter and how does life actively modulate radiation effects? 17. 1 Space Radiation Environments From outer space regions, which are characterized by extreme conditions involving nuclear and atomic reactions (very high temperatures, low density and high-speed subatomic particles) electromagnetic radiation (X-rays and g-rays) is emitted which consist of soft X-rays, from about 1 to 10 nm of wavelength and of the more penetrat-ing hard X-rays from approximately 0. 01 to 1 nm. The space ionizing radiation envi-ronment of our galaxy [3 - 9] is dominated by energetic, highly penetrating ions and nuclei. These particles constitute the primary radiation hazard for life in space. In the interplanetary space the primary components of the radiation field (Figure 17. 1, Table 17. 1) are Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and <b>Solar</b> <b>Cosmic</b> <b>Radiation</b> (SCR) ...|$|E

40|$|People {{have been}} {{fascinating}} for {{space for a}} long time. We {{are now able to}} send space stations, probes and telescopes into space by means of the latest technology in order to provide answers to various questions – such as “where does life come from?” and “is there life on other planets?” (Kirschvink J. 2001). The foundations were laid by the set-up, power and prestige competition of rocket technology. The first milestones were the introduction of Sputnik 1 into an orbit (1957), the orbiting of Earth by Yuri A. Gagarin (1961) (see web link (1)) (Walter, 2017) and the first manned moon-landing 1996 (Walter, 2017). But manned flights into space also lead to complications. Apart from a planetary contamination to be prevented (Rummel 1989), not only the supply of the crew and cohabitation in a confined space is a problem. In 1967 a space contract was set up. It is true that neither terrestrial organisms reach and contaminate extraterrestrial objects such as planets and moons, nor that extraterrestrial forms of life reach the Earth (Ward 2005). Therefore special clean rooms were developed, nevertheless extremophiles, such as Acinetobacter radioresistens, were detected (McCoy, Derecho et al. 2012). It is further important to ensure the health of the astronauts as best as possible. No easy task in living together in a confined space, recycling of waste products, human excretions and the use or repeated handling of surfaces of equipment or training devices for muscle building (Ritsher 2005). In hospitals too, it is essential to ensure maximum health by sometimes observing hygiene regulations in order to prevent possible infections caused by potentially pathogenic microorganisms (Pierson 2007). It is also known that, resistances, especially as a response of the bacterium to antimicrobial agents, can develop over time (Schmieder and Edwards 2012). In outer space there are also external environmental influences which are very low present or complete absent on Earth. These include ionospheric plasma species, solar UV, X-ray, galactic and <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> as well as microgravity (Koontz 2003). In order to keep space stations as sterile as possible, these environmental influences have to be simulated as best as possible in laboratories on Earth, and on this basis, best-adapted methods for minimizing bacteria must be developed (Horneck, Klaus et al. 2010). There are different points of attack. Since a human being has about 2 kg of bacteria (or rather 90 % of the cells of non-animal origin) (Savage 1977) on and in a human body, and these are thereby in any case as “roommates” of an astronaut into the enclosed living space in the space (Checinska 2015), no intervention or reduction of the bacteria is possible at this point. Sterilization procedures with chemicals, plasma or blue light require an active introduction by the human hand (Yin, Dai et al. 2013). What would happen if, instead of or in addition, antimicrobial surfaces were „working“, instead of an active introduction of sterilization procedures, which intervened much earlier? Which material is particularly suitable and how do different microorganisms react to these materials? For these questions the ESA “no biofilm” project was developed. Aim of this project is to characterize biofilms in the ISS environment and evaluate the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm formation activity of well-known tailor-made copper and copper alloy surfaces of spaceflight-relevant and human-associated bacterial strains. Biofilm formation in particular should be prevented. It is clear from studies that biofilms, which grow on space stations like the Mir, behave differently, look differently and the virulence is often increased, compared to controls on Earth (Kim, Tengra et al. 2013) ...|$|E
40|$|Space is {{a special}} {{workplace}} {{not only because of}} microgravity and the dependency on life support systems, but also owing to a constant considerable exposure to a natural radiation source, the cosmic radiation. Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and <b>solar</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> (SCR) are the primary sources of the radiation field in space. Whereas the GCR component comprises all particles from protons to heavy ions with energies up to 10 ¹¹ GeV, the SCR component ejected in Solar Energetic Particle events (SPE) consists mostly of protons, with a small percentage of heavy ions with energies up to several GeV. In low Earth orbit, the exposure to GCR is ~ 100 - 250 x higher compared to sea level. This factor rises to ~ 770 x for travel in the interplanetary space according to recent measurements on a journey to Mars. On a six month mission to the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts accumulate radiation doses exceeding the terrestrial occupational annual limit of 20 mSv by far. Astronauts experience a chronic whole body exposure with single energetic particles (electrons, protons, α-particles and heavy ions) of GCR. Contrary to other workplaces, the exposure on ISS or in future, on exploratory missions, continues after end of the working hours. The main concerns resulting from this exposure are increased risks of cancer, cataract, neurodegenerative effects and infertility. The effective dose as a pre-requisite for the radiation risk assessment was determined from organ doses measured within a human antrophomorphic phantom (MATROSKHA) which was exposed four times on the ISS. The ratio of organ to skin dose determined in these experiments allows estimation of the effective dose based on personal dosimeters of the astronauts. In interplanetary missions, in addition to the chronic, in average low dose GCR exposure at low dose rate, an acute whole body exposure to a high radiation dose at a high dose rate can occur during a SPE with the risk of acute radiation sickness. While shielding (e. g. in a radiation shelter) is effective against SPE protons and high dose exposures can be prevented by alerts based on active dose monitoring and sun activity data from satellites, the chronic GCR exposure cannot be shielded completely during space travel. Currently, radiation protection for astronauts is based on risk management including reduction of exposure (limiting mission duration, shielding of sleeping quarters) and risk surveillance by radiation monitoring (area monitoring, personal dosimeters, SPE alert). Age, gender, genetic predispositions and health and immune status are factors determining individual sensitivity and might be considered for crew selection for interplanetary missions. Ameliorative actions, including prophylactic treatment in order to lower the risk for chronic diseases, are under research and can be summarized as general recommendations for a healthy lifestyle. The treatment of acute radiation sickness encompasses e. g. administration of colony stimulating factors and symptomatic medication (antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheic, anti-inflammatory drugs). Risk assessment for space radiation exposure is incomplete and many uncertainties concerning the biological effects of GCR remain. This is also reflected by the different exposure limits space agencies have set for their astronauts. To improve space radiation protection, active space radiation dosimeters, space weather prediction methods, and efficient shielding have to be developed and radiation measurements, including depth dose distribution in the human body, e. g. on the way to Moon and on the Moon surface are required. Mitigation of the effects of heavy ions {{is one of the most}} important challenges to be solved for the exploration of the solar system.
