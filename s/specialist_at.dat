5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed in another state or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning <b>specialist</b> <b>at</b> Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E

25|$|Ophthalmoscopy or fundus photography: Ophthalmoscopy is an {{examination}} of the retina in which the eye care professional: (1) looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or (2) wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} likelihood of accounting restatements is associated with Big 4 industry auditor <b>specialists,</b> measured <b>at</b> both the partner level and the audit firm level. We focus on a sample of listed firms in Taiwan, where audit reports must be audited and signed by the two signing auditors {{as well as by}} an audit firm. Extending previous studies, we classify industry specialists into three groups: (a) auditors that are industry <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> both the individual partner level (i. e., the lead signing auditors) and the firm level; (b) auditors that are industry <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> the individual partner level but not at the firm level; and (c) auditors that are industry <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> the firm level but not at the individual partner level. The results reveal that clients of signing auditor specialists, either alone or in conjunction with firm-level specialists, are less likely to make accounting restatements relative to those of other auditors. We find no evidence that firm-level auditor specialists alone are associated with a smaller likelihood of accounting restatements. However, a firm-level industry expert does matter where the lead auditor is an expert. The results suggest that differential likelihood of accounting restatements due to Big 4 industry expertise is primarily attributable to the signing partner specialists rather than to auditor <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> the firm level. We also find that differential restatement likelihood due to signing auditors' expertise is driven by the lead auditor's expertise, rather than by the concurring auditor's expertise...|$|R

He began by defending his student Giorge Pascu, the target of a number of attacks by Weigand. Broadening the scope of his polemic, he questioned Weigand's competence as a scholar of Romanian, as well as that of other contemporary linguists. He passionately underscored what he considered Weigand's shortcomings as a person, accusing him of lacking objectivity and even of intrigue, claiming he sent letters to magazines in order to stop publication of articles by professional rivals.|$|E
