The panel data permit separation of shifts in <b>salary</b> <b>schedules</b> from movement along given schedules, and thus the analysis is much more closely related to existing policy proposals. In analyses both of teacher mobility and of student performance, teacher salaries are shown to have a modest impact.

We also find evidence that average class sizes are as much as 10 - 12 % larger in schools with rigid wage structures.
