The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry <b>standing</b> <b>guard,</b> that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E
5|$|The first French {{units to}} come under attack were those {{officers}} accompanying the local gendarmerie or <b>standing</b> <b>guard.</b> The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated from {{one another in the}} citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines. He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that colonies of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula have hovering guards that can detect allospecific intruder bees with volatile odours or different body colour, but conspecific intruders were not detected. Here we show that T. angustula colony entrances are also defended by <b>guards</b> <b>standing</b> on the entrance tube. These <b>standing</b> <b>guards</b> made very few errors in recognition, accepting 100 % of the nestmates and rejecting 92 % of the conspecific non-nestmates presented to them at the nest entrance. In addition, 87 % of the nestmates contaminated with odours from the stingless bee Scaptotrigona bipunctata were rejected. <b>Standing</b> <b>guards</b> also reacted to volatile odours from the stingless bees S. bipunctata and Melipona rufiventris by switching to hovering. The defence reaction, i. e. {{the increase in the number}} of hovering guards, was not, however, comparable to the reaction previously reported to citral, the propaganda chemical used by the obligate robber bee Lestrimelitta limao when attacking other bee colonies...|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid having}} to walk across the Square when getting to the mosque, Shah Abbas had the {{architect}} build a tunnel spanning across the piazza, from the Ali Qapu Palace, to the mosque. When reaching {{the entrance of the}} mosque, one would have to walk through a passage that winds round and round, until one finally reaches the main building. Along this passage there were <b>standing</b> <b>guards,</b> and the obvious purpose of this design was for the women of the harem to be shielded as much as possible from anyone entering the building. At the main entrance of the mosque there were also <b>standing</b> <b>guards,</b> and the doors of the building were kept closed at all times.Today, these doors are open to visitors, and the passage traversing underneath the field is no longer in use.|$|R

5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose <b>standing</b> <b>guard</b> over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

40|$|Introduction – Insect {{societies}} {{are well known}} for cooperation. However, {{there is a high}} potential for conflict both over resources (intercolonial) and over reproduction (intracolonial). Here I present the key results of my thesis in these two areas. 1. – In our first study we show that T. angustula possesses two types of entrance <b>guards,</b> hovering and <b>standing</b> <b>guards,</b> and that they have different tasks. <b>Standing</b> <b>guards,</b> however, can switch to hovering if needed. 2. – Honey bee, A. m. mellifera, guards recognise allospecific intruders via “different odours” not “harmful intruder odours”. 3. – Following up on project 1 we demonstrated a relatively clear division of labour in guarding of T. angustula where guards either act as <b>standing</b> or hovering <b>guards.</b> This study also adds descriptive data on the natural history at the nest entrances of T. angustula. 4. – In our fourth project we found that worker policing in the honey bee (A. m. mellifera and A. m. carnica) has a low cost because few recognition errors are made, 9. 6 % and 4. 1 % of eggs in male and female cells were removed in error, and because these errors are easily rectified. 5. – Virgin queens of M. quadrifasciata were only elected in queenless colonies and generally only shortly after the removal of the resident queen. The virgin queens' behaviour did affect their survival or their life time, respectively. Finally, we described the election process of virgin queens by their colony. Conclusion – Mainly the finding of two different entrance guards in T. angustula generated a series of new questions. In addition, this thesis helped clarifying how social insects recognise each other, it provided the first study that did not measure the benefit but the cost of worker policing, and it shed some light on the bizarre behaviour of queen replacement and execution in Melipona.

25|$|The show falls {{somewhere between}} a cop show and a comedy show. Although superficially {{following}} the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American stereotypes, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show {{and much of the}} comedy is derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the breath of a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had been eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser <b>standing</b> <b>guard</b> motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} {{on the night}} of 5–6 April 1945, the Georgians rose up and gained control of nearly the entire island. Approximately four hundred German {{soldiers}} were killed in the initial uprising, almost all while sleeping in the quarters they shared with Georgians, who used knives and bayonets. Others were shot and killed while <b>standing</b> <b>guard</b> or walking the roads of the island in groups or individually that night and the following day. Members of the Dutch resistance participated and assisted the Georgians, however, the rebellion hinged on an expected Allied landing—which did not occur. The Georgians further failed to secure the naval batteries on the southern and northern coasts of the island; the crews of these artillery installations were the only Germans still alive on the island.|$|E
