5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the Normans arrived, Anglo-Saxon {{governmental}} {{systems were}} {{more sophisticated than}} their counterparts in Normandy. All of England was divided into administrative units called shires, with subdivisions; the royal court was the centre of government, and a justice system based on local and regional tribunals existed to secure the rights of free men. Shires were run by officials known as shire reeves or sheriffs. Most medieval governments were always on the move, holding court wherever the weather and food or other matters were best at the moment; England had a permanent treasury at Winchester before William's conquest. One major reason for the strength of the English monarchy was the wealth of the kingdom, built on the English <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> that included a land tax, or the geld. English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly. The English kings had also developed the system of issuing writs to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing charters. Writs were either instructions to an official or group of officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.|$|E

25|$|A state's {{tax system}} often {{reflects}} its communal {{values and the}} values of those in current political power. To create a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> a state must make choices regarding {{the distribution of the}} tax burden—who will pay taxes and how much they will pay—and how the taxes collected will be spent. In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.|$|E

40|$|The {{experience}} of formation <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> agriculture {{in foreign countries}} is systematized. The approaches to creation <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>taxation</b> are defined, among them the unitized and specialized approaches are allocated. The unitized approach {{is based on the}} use of standard list of taxes, within the limits of which can be applied tax credits for specific branches of the economy and for individual subjects of tax relations. Specialized approach includes the functioning of special regimes <b>of</b> the direct <b>taxation</b> for producers <b>of</b> agriculture. The peculiarities of functioning of income and property taxes in agriculture of foreign countries are generalized. It is defined that income taxation is main in the branch, and the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> land, which can be carried out as separately, and as a part <b>of</b> the property <b>taxation,</b> only complements the income taxation and performs the function of equalizing economic conditions. Studying of {{experience of}} construction and functioning <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> the direct <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> agrarian sector of the developed countries allowed to establish the general tendencies of transformation of tax mechanisms according to development of agriculture, and to determine the ways of reforming the national <b>system</b> <b>of</b> the direct <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> agriculture...|$|R

50|$|With the {{speakers}} {{of a variety}} of different German dialects also came new <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> While the Wendish tithe was a fixed tax depending on village size, the German tithe depended on the actual crop, leading to higher taxes being collected from settlers than from the Wends, even though settlers were at least in part exempted from taxes in the first years after the settlement was established. This was a major reason for local rulers' keenness to invite settlers.|$|R
40|$|In a group structure, {{individual}} companies comprising a {{group are}} effectively managed {{as a single}} 'economic unit'. The economic unit concept refers {{to a group of}} companies that are collectively integrated on a financial, an organisational or an economic basis by virtue of common control, so that they are working towards a common purpose or goal. The South African income tax dispensation currently makes no provision for group taxation. Each legal entity within a group is taxed as a separate taxpayer. This study aims to evaluate whether {{there is a need for}} a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> group <b>taxation</b> in South Africa. In order to do so, the definition of a group was considered, the different tax treatment of divisions as opposed to a group structure were investigated, the current income tax dispensation for inter-group transactions was analysed, and anomalies arising from that were highlighted. The recommendations of the Katz Commission in its Third Interim Report, which addressed the issue <b>of</b> group <b>taxation,</b> were also examined to determine whether the report supports the implementation <b>of</b> a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> group <b>taxation</b> in South Africa. The impact <b>of</b> a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> group <b>taxation</b> for meeting the requirements of the canons <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> as well as the implications for the fiscus and the taxpayer, were also examined. The analyses and the conclusions clearly show that the status quo with regard to the inherent tax anomalies arising from the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> intra-group transactions is unsustainable, and that a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> group <b>taxation</b> should be implemented in South Africa...|$|R
25|$|With {{these lessons}} in mind Alfred capitalised on the {{relatively}} peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington {{by focusing on}} an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with Charles the Bald {{and it is possible}} that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.|$|E
25|$|However, Switzerland did {{not want}} to be seen as an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here it should be noted that Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on administrative assistance and that the Federal Council rejects the automatic exchange of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland has charged a withholding tax on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in South Asia, {{political}} unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> as advised by the principles in the Arthashastra. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the European nation-state, wrote {{political}} sociologist Charles Tilly, is inextricably {{bound up with the}} history of warfare. To oversimplify Tilly 2 ̆ 7 s nuanced and complex arguments, the story goes something like this: as powerholders (originally bandits and local strongmen) sought to expand their power, they needed capital to pay for weapons, soldiers, and supplies. The need for capital and new recruits drove the creation <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>systems</b> and census mechanisms, and the need for more effective <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and recruitment necessitated better roads, better communications, and better record keeping. This in turn enabled the creation of larger and more technologically sophisticated armies...|$|R

In fact, key elements of the country-specific recommendations, such as the revision of cadastral values, have not been implemented. This happens because the Italian <b>system</b> <b>of</b> cadastral-based <b>taxation</b> is managed both by a Central Government’s Agency and by the municipal level of government, without intelligible apportionment of tasks and functions between the two levels.

As a consequence, the Italian <b>system</b> <b>of</b> cadastral-based <b>taxation</b> {{seems to be}} misguided. An Italian recent reform (art. 2, Law n. 23 / 2014) provides new perspectives in cadastral-based taxation, but it seems the above mentioned issue will remain, that of a cross-eyed, misguided system...|$|R
