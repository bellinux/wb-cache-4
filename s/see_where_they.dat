25|$|His father Waglula {{took him}} to what today is Sylvan Lake, South Dakota, where they both sat to do a hemblecha or vision quest. A red-tailed hawk led them to their {{respective}} spots in the hills; as the trees are tall in the Black Hills, they could not always <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were going. Crazy Horse sat between two humps {{at the top of}} a hill north and to the east of the lake. Waglula sat south of Black Elk Peak but north of his son.|$|E
25|$|After he {{attained}} arhatship, {{he began}} to think deeply of his parents, and wondered what happened to them. He used his clairvoyance to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were reborn and found his father in the heavenly realms i.e. {{the realm of the}} gods. However, his mother had been reborn in a lower realm, known as Avīci, or the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. His mother took on the form of a hungry ghost (preta)– so called because it could not eat due to its highly thin and fragile throat in which no food could pass through, yet it was always hungry because it had a fat belly. His mother had been greedy with the money he left her. He had instructed her to kindly host any Buddhist monks that ever came her way, but instead she withheld her kindness and her money. It was for this reason she was reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts.|$|E

500|$|Hoeft, who won 20games for the Tigers in 1956, had {{continually}} under-performed since, and {{was noted}} {{for being in}} the manager's [...] "doghouse"; however, TimesDaily sportswriter Hap Halbrooks commented, [...] "I can't <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> (Tigers) gained a thing in this transaction." [...] The Tigers had lost 15 of their first 17games of the season before the trade and decided that changes were needed. In addition to the Sisler trade they fired manager Bill Norman and replaced him with Jimmy Dykes. These moves initially proved effective, sparking a winning game streak, which began by defeating the Yankees in both games of a doubleheader on May3. Continuing their rebound, the Tigers faced the Red Sox next, winning two of three, and Sisler pitched a scoreless one-inning relief appearance against his former team on May6. Used exclusively in relief, Sisler pitched in 32games for the Tigers, winning one game against three losses and collected seven saves, which was seventh most in the AL, {{and he did not}} record an error.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory. Pittsburgh's Larry Foote responded, [...] "They {{deserved}} to do that, they whooped us, they deserve to celebrate and, hopefully, we'll see them again." [...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} and you <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics can come back to haunt teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark. The Titans won their next 5 games.|$|E
500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, Kings Dominion {{introduced}} its second launched roller coaster, and first LIM-launched roller coaster, [...] The Outer Limits has a [...] launch, four inversions, and an identical [...] "spaghetti bowl" [...] layout to Flight of Fear at Kings Island. Almost as notable as {{the launch of}} The Outer Limits {{was the fact that}} the entire ride was in semi-darkness; the riders could not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were going. Five years after The Outer Limits opened, Paramount Parks' licensing agreement to use theming from the television show after which the ride was named expired; the Outer Limits theming in the ride and its queue was removed, and the ride was renamed Flight of Fear.|$|E
2500|$|The 3-point {{shot was}} adopted nationally in the NCAA in 1986, midway through Knight's {{coaching}} career. Although he opposed the rule change throughout his life, it did complement his offense well by improving the spacing on the floor. He sardonically {{said at the}} time that he supported institution of the three point shot because if a team's offense was functioning efficiently enough to get a layup the team should be rewarded with three points for that basket. [...] Knight's offense also emphasized a two-count. Players in the post are expected to try to post in the paint for two seconds and if they don't receive the ball they go set a screen. Players with the ball are expected to hold the ball for two seconds to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are going to take it. Screens are supposed to be held for two seconds, as well.|$|E
50|$|Small non-operating {{sections}} of the railway track, buildings and rolling stock are still preserved as tourist-attractions in Saudi Arabia, including the Medina Terminus, restored in 2005 with railway tracks and locomotive shed.

60|$|When their {{meal was}} done, the {{beautiful}} women bore away the dishes, and black slaves appeared.

Afterwards they were rubbed with spicy-smelling oils, and having been wrapped in white robes, conducted back to their chamber, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> found beds spread for them. On these, being very weary, they lay down, when the strange, sweet music broke out afresh, and {{to the sound of}} it they fell asleep.|$|R
50|$|In summer 1973 Arthur Rosie {{left the}} island and died shortly afterwards. James and Violet Rosie (brother and sister) left in March 1974. James had Parkinsons Disease and died c. 1976 of a {{perforated}} stomach ulcer. Violet died c. 1984 in South Ronaldsay. They {{did not return to}} the island after they left it. Many of the houses, while in a state of dilapidation, are as they were left, with various possessions still to be <b>seen</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|These {{meals and}} {{meetings}} are an opportunity {{both for the}} prefrosh {{to get to know}} the feel of the different houses and for the upperclassmen to meet and rate the prefrosh so both can <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> might belong. [...] Many Houses also show house-made videos to the prefrosh, which yield the prefrosh additional information about the various personalities of the Houses. [...] At the end of this week, the frosh rate each of the 8 Houses on a scale of 1 to 20. Based on this, and the opinions of the Houses' existing members, the prefrosh are placed into a House which will be their home physically and socially for the next few years. The InterHouse Committee attempts to ensure a certain level of secrecy regarding the exact process, so that the confidentiality of both the freshmen, and those involved with their final housing assignments, is maintained. [...] Also, the selection process is constrained: [...] there are only a limited number of openings in each House, and it is impossible to simultaneously meet the preferences of all of the Freshmen and Houses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group that}} most {{characterized}} London streets were beggars and vagrants. The broad eighteenth-century definition for beggar embraced {{not just the}} poorest people having {{to live on the}} street, but virtually anyone who would stop you asking for money, work, or offering you a service such as: shoe cleaners, linkboys, milkmaids, chimney sweeps, etc. Begging was quite an art, the way you held your body, the sores you showed or not showed, the tone of the voice, your gender and age, the time of the year, the narrative strategies you decided to adopt, all these elements affected the way you begged and had to be consider carefully. Moreton regards beggars and vagrants as potential criminals in disguise and affirms that they [...] "should be suppressed, who lounge about all day, to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> can steal at night" [...] and that [...] "all shoe-cleaners, I mean boys and sturdy vagrants, be suppressed, [...] as for link-boys, alias thieves with lights". Shoeblacks are a peculiar example of a vagrant occupation. Established as an employment {{at the end of the}} seventeenth-century, shoe cleaning provided a perfect excuse for approaching passers-by without incurring a penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty {{stated that the}} episode was [...] "as strong as we've come to expect in recent weeks" [...] and called it [...] "undeniably fun to watch and {{has the ability to}} get a laugh out of you even if you're in the worst of moods". Moriarty praised the chemistry that was developing between the actors, and hoped that [...] "all of the characters will get more involved to really <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are all going". He hoped that the show [...] "ends on the high note it's been reaching towards rather than heading towards a decrescendo that hurts many a promising show" [...] and added that [...] "in the meantime, check out this episode for a good laugh, and wait patiently for the culmination of the first season". Overall, the installment was given a rating of 8, or [...] "great", tying it for the best rated episode of the show {{at the time of the}} review; it was rated as being equal to the preceding episode, [...] "Weekend Warriors".|$|E
