5|$|Eventually NSB felt {{confident}} that they had found a technical solution that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, and put into regular <b>service</b> <b>on</b> the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular <b>service</b> <b>on</b> the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into <b>service</b> <b>on</b> the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, {{in part because of}} the bad name the first series had given, and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed to haul a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed to haul eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence.

BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde <b>service</b> <b>on</b> the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody <b>service</b> <b>on</b> this route.|$|E
