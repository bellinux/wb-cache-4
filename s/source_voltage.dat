An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E
25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage <b>source,</b> <b>voltage</b> intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885.

25|$|DIBL and VT roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel {{formation}} {{is not entirely}} done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the channel length decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the threshold voltage (VT) {{a function of the}} length of the channel. This is called VT roll-off. VT also becomes function of drain to <b>source</b> <b>voltage</b> VDS. As we increase the VDS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS. The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the VT decreases with an increase in VDS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).|$|E
