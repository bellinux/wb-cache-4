25|$|The first {{published}} study {{in this area}} was an experiment in 1898 by Norman Triplett, on the phenomenon of <b>social</b> <b>facilitation.</b> During the 1930s, many Gestalt psychologists, most notably Kurt Lewin, fled to the United States from Nazi Germany.

25|$|Groups are {{important}} {{not only because they}} offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identity. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group. On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society. Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of <b>social</b> <b>facilitation</b> and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.|$|E

[...] Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare farm assurance schemes. [...] For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52kg/m2 and 58kg/m2 for males and females respectively. [...] In the UK, the RSPCA Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible stocking density to 25kg/m2 for turkeys reared indoors. [...] Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m2; 61kg/m2) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities. [...] Turkeys reared at 8 birds/m2 have a higher incidence of hip lesions and foot pad dermatitis than those reared at 6.5 or 5.0 birds/m2. [...] Insufficient space may lead to an increased risk for injuries such as broken wings caused by hitting the pen walls or other turkeys during aggressive encounters and can also lead to heat stress. The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated by the major influence of <b>social</b> <b>facilitation</b> on the behaviour of turkeys. If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Twenty {{percent of}} {{pregnant}} women in the UK are obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2), reflecting the growing public health challenge of obesity in the 21 st century. Obesity {{increases the risk of}} adverse outcomes during pregnancy and birth and has significant cost implications for maternity services. Gestational weight management strategies are a high priority; however the evidence for effective, feasible and acceptable weight control interventions is limited and inconclusive. This qualitative study explored the experiences and perceptions {{of pregnant women}} and midwives regarding existing support for weight management in pregnancy and their ideas for service development. Methods A purposive sample of 6 women and 7 midwives from Doncaster, UK, participated in two separate focus groups. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Results Two overarching themes were identified, 'Explanations for obesity and weight management' and 'Best care for pregnant women'. 'Explanations' included a lack of knowledge about weight, diet and exercise during pregnancy; self-talk messages which excused overeating; difficulties maintaining motivation for a healthy lifestyle; the importance of social support; stigmatisation; and sensitivity surrounding communication about obesity between midwives and their clients. 'Best care' suggested that weight management required care which was consistent and continuous, supportive and non-judgemental, and which created opportunities for interaction and mutual support between obese pregnant women. Conclusions Women need unambiguous advice regarding healthy lifestyles, diet and exercise in pregnancy to address a lack of knowledge and a tendency towards unhelpful self-talk messages. Midwives expressed difficulties in communicating with their clients about their weight, given awareness that obesity is a sensitive and potentially stigmatising issue. This indicates more could be done to educate and support them in their work with obese pregnant women. Motivation and social support were strong explanatory themes for obesity and weight management, suggesting that interventions should focus on motivational strategies and <b>social</b> support <b>facilitation.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The AEC, {{scheduled}} to be established in 2015, will promote skilled labor mobility among the ASEAN Member Countries. There is convincing evidence that the establishing the AEC (along with the skilled labor mobility provisions) could bring benefits to the ASEAN Members Countries. Yet some criticism on the AEC’s potential efficacy exists. However, a surprisingly few scholars have debated about the proficiency of the provisions. This article neither examines {{the costs and benefits}} of the AEC agreement nor provides conclusions on whether professions should or should not be included in the agreement. Rather, this article examines whether the skilled labor mobility provisions introduced by the AEC are pragmatic. The focus here will also center on indicating potential obstacles to skilled labor mobility. The main argument of this article is that the skilled labor movement provisions of the AEC will facilitate skilled workers who have already planned to seek employment and relocate to another country. Yet notwithstanding this facilitation, this article holds that the provisions do not provide many incentives to encourage mobility among other skilled workers who still reside in their home country. Thus, the labor mobility rate among the ASEAN Member Countries will not substantially increase because of these provisions. This is because the national legal systems, (which are not compatible with the mobility policies), discourage worker’s migration because of barriers such as lack of recognition of qualifications, insufficient information provided for workers, and the nature of <b>social</b> structure. <b>Facilitation</b> for the practical aspects of labor mobility is needed in order to successfully increase the effectiveness of the provisions. The theoretical approach utilized in this project is comparative methodology. This project utilizes a legal analysis as well as subsequent critical comparison to put forward solutions to increase the effectiveness of the labor mobility provisions...|$|R
