25|$|Dehn {{was born}} on her family's {{southern}} Russian estate, Revovka, a home of her ancestor General Mikhail Kutuzov, the victor of Napoleon during the 1812 invasion of Russia. Her parents were Ismail Selim Bek Smolsky and Catherine Horvat. Both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family {{had a long history}} in Russia, according to her memoirs. Her parents divorced when she was eleven and her mother later remarried. Her maternal grandmother helped to raise her.|$|E
25|$|Two further vessels {{joined the}} search, Manx Queen, which {{was en route}} from Barrow-in-Furness to Belfast, was {{subsequently}} joined by Duke of Clarences sister, Duke of York, which was making passage from Fleetwood to Belfast. The search lasted for three hours, following which all vessels went on their respective ways. Captain Shimmin, Kelly, and Turner were landed at Fleetwood and subsequently made {{their way back to}} the Isle of Man via Liverpool. As a consequence of the collision Duke of Clarence sustained slight damage to both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bows but was still able to resume her schedule the following night.|$|E
25|$|Another case {{described}} {{the onset of}} anterograde amnesia {{as a result of}} cell death in the fornix, another structure that carries information from the hippocampus to the structures of the limbic system and the diencephalon. The patient in this case did not show any disconnection syndrome, which is unexpected since the structures involved divide the brain hemispheres (both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brain were able to communicate). Instead, she showed signs of amnesia. The final diagnosis was made by MRI. This particular amnesic syndrome is difficult to diagnose and often is misdiagnosed by physicians as an acute psychiatric disorder.|$|E

25|$|According to DNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Asian/Indigenous, and 3% African. After a {{computer}} compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, {{tests showed that}} she is genetically related to cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage. Since women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother's mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Mayan from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Mayans on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family.|$|E
25|$|The largest gun was a minion cannon {{which was}} brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545 kg), and could shoot a 3.5 pound (1.6 kg) {{cannonball}} almost a mile (1,600 m). The Mayflower also had {{on board a}} saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360 kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90 kg) which shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85–140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the port and starboard <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gun deck: seven cannons for long range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls. Later at New Plymouth, Mayflower Master Jones unloaded four of the pieces to help fortify the colony against invaders, {{and would not have}} done so unless he was comfortable with the armament that he still had on board.|$|E
25|$|The epithet Lucina is {{particularly}} revealing since it reflects two interrelated {{aspects of the}} function of Juno: cyclical renewal {{of time in the}} waning and waxing of the moon and protection of delivery and birth (as she who brings to light the newborn as vigour, vital force). The ancient called her Covella in her function of helper in the labours of the new moon. The view that she was also a Moon goddess though is no longer accepted by scholars, as such a role belongs to Diana Lucifera: through her association with the moon she governed the feminine physiological functions, menstrual cycle and pregnancy: as a rule all lunar deities are deities of childbirth. These aspects of Juno mark the heavenly and worldly <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> function. She is thus associated to all beginnings and hers are the kalendae of every month: at Laurentum she was known as Kalendaris Iuno (Juno of the Kalends). At Rome on the Kalends of every month the pontifex minor invoked her, under the epithet Covella, when from the curia Calabra announced the date of the nonae. On the same day the regina sacrorum sacrificed to Juno a white sow or lamb in the Regia. She is closely associated with Janus, the god of passages and beginnings who after her is often named Iunonius.|$|E

500|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Duncan had a single 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine guns mounted on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. In 1936, the 12-pounder was replaced by two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns. Sometime after the Dunkirk evacuation, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the quadruple 0.5-inch machine guns were replaced by [...] Oerlikon AA guns.|$|E
