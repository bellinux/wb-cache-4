These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common.

5000|$|<b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are {{a diverse}} population, {{and have a}} wide range of {{intellectual}} and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations. They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts, and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are often categorized as [...] "internalizers" [...] (e.g., have poor self-esteem, or are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or mood disorder) or [...] "externalizers" [...] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with disruptive behavior disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are also at an increased risk for learning disabilities, school dropout, substance abuse, and juvenile delinquency.|$|E

40|$|School {{connectedness}} is {{the extent}} to which a student feels that adults and peers on their school campus care about their behavioral and academic success as well as their overall wellbeing. School connectedness is comprised of four factors: (a) bonding, (b) attachment, (c) engagement, and (d) climate. Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) may experience difficulty with developing high levels of school connectedness, which may lead to engagement in health-risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of school connectedness of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> and compare them to the levels of their general education peers. A school connectedness questionnaire was created for this study and participants were recruited from elementary, middle, and high schools in a large urban school district. A total of 136 students aged 8 to 18 completed the questionnaire. The results of the analysis of variance indicated that of the four factors of school connectedness, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> reported significantly lower levels of school bonding than did their general education peers. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> reported lower levels of school attachment and engagement, but these results were not significant. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> also reported higher levels of school climate than did their general education peers. The results indicate that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> experience school differently than their general education peers, especially in terms of school bonding.

Despite limited evidence to suggest patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> have more postoperative wound complications than the general population, we have noted reluctance among some surgeons to operate on these patients. We consequently designed this study to investigate postoperative wound healing in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Patients recruited from the Australian National Diagnostic Laboratory Database for EB and the Australasian EB Registry were posted the ‘Surgical Wound and Scar Healing in EB’ questionnaire which contains twenty-two questions about a patients experience of having surgery. Forty-six patients reported a total of 94 surgical procedures. The most frequent surgical procedure was the excision of a skin lesion, followed by musculoskeletal surgery, a caesarean section or an appendectomy. Five patients reported blistering at the surgical wound site after seven surgeries. Four patients reported four postoperative wound infections and one reported a postoperative wound dehiscence. Twenty patients had 34 postoperative wounds which they felt healed slower than someone without EB and 30 patients had 55 postoperative wounds which they felt healed {{at the same rate}} as someone without EB. After 67 surgeries, the postoperative scar was reported to heal flat and after 18 it was reported to heal as a keloid scar. It is unlikely that patients <b>with</b> localised <b>EB</b> simplex will develop blistering at postoperative wound site, but about a quarter of patients <b>with</b> generalised <b>EB</b> may develop blistering which is likely interfere with wound healing. Postoperative wound infections do not appear to occur any more frequently in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> than in patients within the general population and wound dehiscence is uncommon in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Postoperative wounds may heal at a similar or slower rate in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> compared to those within the general population and patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> may have a propensity to develop keloid scars.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if two factors, relational aggression (RA) and overt aggression (OA), emerge using the Children's Social Behavior Scale - Self Report (CSBS-S) with students with emotional/behavioral disorders (EBD) in a special school setting; to determine if <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> exhibit relation aggression (RA) or overt aggression (OA), as measured by the CSBS-S; and to determine if there was a relationship between these types of aggression and three variables: age, gender and IQ. The classroom teacher administered the CSBS-S to 130 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD,</b> ages seven to twenty years old, in their special school classrooms during the school day. Although RA and OA did not emerge as two distinct factors with this population, two new factors did emerge and were identified as verbal/physical aggression (VPA) and exclusion type aggression (EXA). VPA included all overt, physical and verbal behaviors and EXA included only behaviors in which a target child was excluded from the group. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> differentiated between all overt physical and verbal aggressive behaviors and exclusionary behaviors. A possible implication of these results is that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> do not differentiate between RA and OA and view all aggression, with the exception of exclusion, as a single type of aggression. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> did exhibit RA and OA. However the percentage differences between genders was not significant and the means and standard deviations of scores were similar, suggesting that in this setting, with these students, both boys and girls are similarly aggressive. IQ was a significant predictor for RA, OA, and VPA, while age was only a significant predictor for OA. The relationships between IQ and the four types of aggressions was negative which implied that as IQ increased, these three aggressions decreased. Although the CSBS-S was not a valid measure of RA and OA with <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>EBD,</b> two new variables were identified, VPA and EXA.

40|$|Background: Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) {{is a rare}} genetic condition, {{resulting}} in painful blistering of the skin. The two main specialised hospital services for those <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> are located in Dublin. Community services are provided nationally.

Many professionals find that this possesses a variety of challenges. Objectives: As one component of innovative participatory action research exploring {{the development of a}} support service strategy for people <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> in Ireland, this study aimed to investigate the experiences and perceptions of Irish community service providers, working <b>with</b> people <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Methods: Semi-structured interviews sought to identify nine community service providers’ aims, interests and motives for service involvement, establish positive and challenging aspects of the system, and inform future service development. Results: Following thematic analysis, four themes emerged: 1) Aspects of Time, 2) Tools for Preparation, 3) Emotional Impact on Professionals, 4) Importance of Relationships Conclusions: The participants acknowledge the importance of building relationships of trust with the patients, their families and other professionals. Community service providers may only work with one or two people <b>with</b> <b>EB,</b> however the physical and emotional support required for this group needs to be fully understood and recognised.
