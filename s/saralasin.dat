Before treatment, systolic blood pressure rose from 143 to 202 mm Hg (p < 0. 05). Tail vein infusions of <b>saralasin</b> 10 ̂ ig/kg/min in con-scious rats reduced systolic blood pressure from 202 to 121 mm Hg (p < 0. 05) at 8 weeks after clipping the renal artery and before treatment with captopril. Chronic treatment with captopril for 3 additional weeks lowered blood pressure to 173 mm Hg (p < 0. 05). When <b>saralasin</b> infusion was repeated during treatment with captopril, blood pressure fell from 173 to 159 mm Hg (p < 0. 05). Blood pressure rose to 197 mm Hg within 4 days after captopril was discontinued and <b>saralasin</b> infusion 3 weeks after captopril (15 weeks after clipping the renal artery) again resulted in a dramatic fall in blood pressure from 197 to 142 mm Hg (p < 0. 05).

The infusion of <b>saralasin</b> at 1, 2, 4 and 8 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1 resulted in an initial small pressor response, followed by a depressor effect. A significant inverse correlation was demonstrated between log 10 dose <b>saralasin</b> and the evoked change in diastolic blood pressure (r = - 0. 5891, P less than 0. 005). A small and inconsistent depressor effect was found in the control experiments; there was no evidence for an association between dose and response (r = + 0. 0411, P greater than 0. 85). These data were compared with those from a previously published study in which an identical infusion protocol for <b>saralasin</b> was used in ten chronically cannulated pregnant ewes.

Both <b>saralasin</b> and benazeprilat (n = 6 for each group) blunted the vasoconstrictor action of lower body negative pressure, suggesting that circulating Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity. In addition, since β-adrenoceptor stimulation can activate the production of vascular Ang II, the effect of <b>saralasin</b> and benazeprilat on lower body negative pressure application was evaluated {{in the presence of}} isoproterenol (0. 09 μg/ 100 mL forearm tissue per minute) and propranolol (10 μg/ 100 mL forearm tissue per minute). In two other groups of hypertensive patients, isoproterenol infusion increased the release of Aug II in the forearm vasculature (arteriovenous values measured by radioimmunoassay). Furthermore, isoproterenol potentiated lower body negative pressure-induced vasoconstriction. This facilitating effect was abolished by either <b>saralasin</b> or benazeprilat (n = 6 for each group).

40|$|SUMMARY Converting enzyme {{inhibitor}} (CEI) produced a greater fall {{in blood pressure}} (BP) than the competitive antagonist of angiotensin II, sarcosine-alanine angiotensin II (<b>saralasin),</b> when administered to salt-depleted rats; {{there was no difference}} in BP response in salt-loaded rats. Thus, two widely used methods of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system give discrepant effects. The renin-angiotensin system was blocked in anesthetized rats by an infusion of <b>saralasin,</b> and then a bolus injection of CEI was given. A further significant fall in blood pressure oc-curred in salt-depleted rats (- 45. 7 ± 6. 8 mm Hg; mean ± SE). There was only a small change in blood pressure of salt-loaded rats (- 11. 2 ± 3. 1 mm Hg) and no change in blood pressure of salt-depleted rats 1 hour after bilateral nephrectomy. <b>Saralasin</b> infusion after CEI did not influence BP. Bradykinin infusion potentiated the depressor ef-fect of CEI in bilaterally nephrectomized rats. Renin infusion restored the depressor response of nephrectomized rats to <b>saralasin,</b> but administration of CEI then caused no further fall in BP. BP of saralasin-infused rats with Gold-blatt two-kidney hypertension given CEI fell by 11. 1 ± 5. 4 mm Hg; after dietetic salt depletion, BP fell by 20. 5 ± 9. 9 mm Hg with CEI. Bilateral nephrectomy abolished this response to CEI. Hence, CEI has a significant vasodepressor action in addition to inhibition of angiotensin II production. Since it can be restored in nephrectomized animals by bradykinin infusion, the component of the vasodepressor action of CEI which cannot be blocked by <b>saralasin</b> may be identical with its bradykinin-potentiating action.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{renin-angiotensin system}} in the {{regulation}} of the systemic and coronary circulations during sodium depletion was studied in conscious normotensive dogs by i. v. administration of teprotide (0. 5 mg/kg), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and <b>saralasin</b> (0. 05 - 5 μg/kg per min), an angiotensin-receptor antagonist. Sodium depletion was produced by administering a low sodium diet and furosemide for 5 days. Administration of both teprotide and <b>saralasin</b> lowered systemic arterial blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. Simultaneously, cardiac output increased, but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, dP/dt, and dP/dt/P did not change significantly. Furthermore, both agents reduced diastolic coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow, but did not affect myocardial oxygen consumption, left ventricular work, or myocardial efficiency. These systemic and coronary vasodilator effects of teprotide and <b>saralasin,</b> however, were not observed in normal dogs on a regular sodium diet; in this group, the only effect noted was {{a slight increase in}} arterial pressure during <b>saralasin</b> infusion. Arterial plasma concentration of norepinephrine did not differ between normal and sodiumdepleted dogs, nor did it change significantly after teprotide administration. These results suggest that, during salt depletion, angiotensin II exerts an active vasoconstrictor action on the systemic and coronary vessels, but has no significant effects on myocardial contractility or energetics. It also appears likely that the increase in cardiac output observed in sodiumdepleted dogs after angiotensin inhibition was caused, at least in part, by the decrease in systemic arterial pressure...|$|E

Combined sodium depletion and antagonism of angiotensin II 'normalized' mean arterial pressure (less than or equal to 100 mmHg) in twenty-one of the thirty-two patients, while pressure remained between 106 and 147 mmHg in eleven 'poor' responders, so that pressor mechanisms other than sodium volume and angiotensin must be responsible for the remaining elevation of pressure in these patients. The study indicates that arterial pressure is not dependent on the immediate pressor effects of angiotensin II in sodium replete patients, and in sodium deplete subjects whose PRC remains low, while it is at least partly angiotensin II dependent during sodium volume depletion in the others.

40|$|Vasodilating {{antihypertensive}} drugs induce hypotension with reflex tachycardia, renin release, {{and fluid}} and electrolyte retention. Propranolol can impair this renin release. The studies described here {{were designed to}} determine the hemodynamic role of vasodilatory drug-induced renin release and inhibition thereof by propranolol in two animals models, the unanesthetized, normotensive and the unanesthetized, genetically hypertensive rat. In studies with normotensive rats, propranolol impaired renin release and tachycardia resulting from hydralazine and minoxidil and potentiated their hypotensive action. Two additional interventions against the renin-angiotensin system were used in evaluating the mechanism of this potentiation. One was removal of the renin source by nephrectomy, and the second was blockade of angiotensin's vasoconstrictor action using a selective angiotensin antagonist, <b>saralasin</b> (1 -Sar- 8 -Ala-angiotensin II (previously known as P 113)) [...] Both interventions potentiated vasocilatory drug hypotension, as did propranolol, but did not prevent reflex tachycardia. When combined with <b>saralasin</b> propranolol did not add to protentiation by this peptide. A similar pattern of blood pressure decrement and potentiation was seen in genetically hypertensive rats when propranolol or <b>saralasin</b> treatment preceded hydralazine. Propranolol was demonstrated to block hydralazine-induced increases in serum renin activity in genetically hypertensive rats. We conclude that hypotensive potentiation of vasocilating drugs by propranolol in these animal models is mediated {{to a large extent}} by impairment of renin release. Persistence of hypotensive tachycardia after nephrectomy and after <b>saralasin</b> in normotensive rats suggests the irrelevance of angiotensin's central nervous system stimulation to this cardiac effect.

The AII antagonist <b>saralasin</b> or the saline vehicle was infused into the aorta above the renal arteries of pigs under halothane-O 2 /N 2 O anaesthesia. Systemic and renal functional parameters were followed for 140 min and during stimulation of the reninangiotensin system by haemorrhage. Urinary kallikrein excretion, determined as kininogenase activity, was increased immediately upon both initiation and termination of the 2 h <b>saralasin</b> infusion into pigs not subjected to haemorrhage. Renal cortical blood flow (RCBF) was maintained, in both saline and saralasin-treated animals at blood pressures as low as 70 mm Hg, while glomerular filtration rate was dissociated during <b>saralasin</b> infusion. As long as RCBF was maintained, urinary kallikrein excretion rate was elevated during the progressive hypotension in both saline and saralasin-treated animals. These findings confirm a close relationship between the maintenance of RCBF and increased activity of the kallikrein-kinin system whether or not AII is antagonized, and indicate that during haemorrhage the kallikrein-kinin system is stimulated by a mechanism not involving AII...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY <b>Saralasin,</b> 10 fig/kg per min, {{caused an}} {{immediate}} rise {{in blood pressure}} in 52 of 57 (91. 2 %) hypertensive patients. The increase in diastolic pressure averaged 18. 8 ± 1. 83 mm Hg (mean ± SE) in normal renin patients on a normal salt intake. This immediate pressor response was absent in only five high renin patients and, conversely, was very large in three low renin patients. Direct arterial recordings are necessary to define the response accurately; it begins in 60 - 90 seconds, peaks in amplitude at 2. 05 ± 0. 38 minutes, and subsides over the next 5 minutes in normal renin and high renin patients. The blood pressure elevation is inversely related to background plasma renin activity (r = — 0. 66, P < 0. 001), and also is directly, but weakly, related to 24 -hour urinary sodium excretion (r = + 0. 29). Therefore, the amplitude of the elevation is predictably diminished by the rise in plasma renin consequent to prior sodium restriction, and also by preliminary receptor exposure to low dose nonpressor infusions of <b>saralasin</b> itself (0. 01 - 0. 1 /ig/kg per min). Phentolamine {{had no effect on}} the response in two patients. We propose that the immediate pressor response to <b>saralasin</b> is related directly to the preexisting degree of vacancy of angiotensin II vascular receptors and that the initial agonistic action of the drug may prove useful in defining the angiotensin II receptor status in hypertensive diseases.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{intracellular}} angiotensin II (Ang II) and related peptides on rat aortic contraction, whether this effect is pharmacologically distinguishable from that induced by extracellular stimulation, and determined the Ca 2 + source involved. Compounds were delivered into the cytoplasm of de-endothelized aorta rings using multilamellar liposomes. Contractions were normalized to the maximum obtained with phenylephrine (10 − 5 [*]M). Intracellular administration of Ang II (incorporation range: 0. 01 – 300 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1) resulted in a dose-dependent contraction, insensitive to extracellular administration (10 − 6 [*]M) of the AT 1 receptor antagonist CV 11947, the AT 2 receptor antagonist PD 123319, or the non-selective AT receptor antagonist and partial agonist <b>saralasin</b> ([Sar 1,Val 5,Ala 8]-Ang II (P< 0. 05). Intracellular administration of CV 11947 or PD 123319 right shifted the dose-response curve about 1000 fold or 20 fold, respectively. PD 123319 was only effective if less than 30 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 Ang II was incorporated. Contraction was partially desensitized to a second intracellular Ang II addition after 45 [*]min (P< 0. 05). Intracellular administration of Ang I and <b>saralasin</b> also induced contraction (P< 0. 05). Both responses were sensitive to intracellular CV 11947 (P< 0. 05), but insensitive to PD 123319. The response to Ang I was independent of intracellular captopril. Contraction induced by extracellular application of Ang II and of Ang I was abolished by extracellular pre-treatment with <b>saralasin</b> or CV 11947 (P< 0. 05), but not with PD 123319. Extracellular <b>saralasin</b> induced no contraction. Intracellular Ang II induced contraction was not affected by pre-treatment with heparin filled liposomes, but completely abolished in Ca 2 +-free external medium. These results support {{the existence of an}} intracellular binding site for Ang II in rat aorta. Intracellular stimulation induces contraction dependent on Ca 2 +-influx but not on Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 mediated release from intracellular Ca 2 +-stores. Intracellular Ang I and <b>saralasin</b> induce contraction, possibly via the same binding site. Pharmacological properties of this putative intracellular receptor are clearly different from extracellular stimulated AT 1 receptors or intracellular angiotensin receptors postulated in other tissue...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensins I, II, and III (AI, AII, AIII) and <b>Saralasin</b> (Sar 1 -Ala 8 -AII) {{were labeled}} with 125 I and {{separated}} from the nonlabeled forms on minicolumns (a Pasteur pipet) of chromatofocusing medium. At low ionic strength, 125 I-labeled angiotensins could be eluted with Polybuffer or a piperazine-histidine buffer at their approximate isoelectric points, while nonlabeled angiotensins remained adsorbed to the column and required 1 mol · liter- 1 NaCl for elution. The 125 I-labeled angiotensins prepared by this method were bound by antibodies (AI) and adrenal receptors (AII, <b>Saralasin)</b> to an extent similar to angiotensins prepared by DEAE-Sephadex A- 25 chromatography.

40|$|The {{response}} of the renin-angiotensin system to high and low sodium diets, to standing, and to <b>saralasin</b> infusion was assessed before and after surgical correction of aortic coarctation in a 27 -year-old man. The cardiovascular responses to tests of autonomic function were measured. The heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre and standing were abnormal before operation, and plasma renin levels were high and renin secretion responded poorly to changes in dietary sodium, to standing, and to <b>saralasin.</b> Renin responsiveness and cardiovascular reflexes returned to normal after operation. The {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that there is a high level of sympathetic efferent activity in coarctation of the aorta and that factors other than increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system may cause high blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of water}} intake {{were made on}} a {{population}} of trained conscious dogs of both sexes prepared with chronic third ventricle cannulae. 2. Injection of 100 ng angiotensin II into the third ventricle lead to a prompt stimulation of drinking, the mean water intake over a 5 min period being 503 +/- 89 ml. (n= 6) compared with controls. This dipsogenic effect of angiotensin II was abolished by prior central administration of 10 mug <b>saralasin</b> acetate or 100 ng atropine. 3. Injection of 1 mug carbachol into the third ventricle produced a small, variable increase in drinking. 4. Injection of 0 - 2 ml. 5 % NaCl into the third ventricle stimulated drinking, a response that was not affected by prior administration of 10 mug <b>saralasin</b> acetate or 100 ng atropine. 5. Following a 24 hr period of water deprivation {{there was an increase}} in plasma osmolality and plasma-renin activity. The drinking following this period of water deprivation was not affected by prior control administration of either 10 mug <b>saralasin</b> acetate or 100 ng atropine. 6.
