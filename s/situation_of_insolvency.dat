The Enterprise Act 2002 made reforms to the insolvency act and, from 15 September 2003, the altered procedures for administration were implemented. Most notably it abolished the Crown's preferential right to recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors. As such, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is now often not paid in full (between 2003 and 2010, outstanding unpaid taxes to the HMRC amounted to £30 million). This legality of the football creditors rule was challenged in 2004 in Inland Revenue Commissioners v The Wimbledon Football Club Ltd. However, {{it was found that}} [...] "full payment to football creditors (out of third party funds) ahead of preferential creditors did not infringe the provisions of section s4(4)(a) of the Act" [...] and [...] "differential treatment may be necessary to secure the continuation of the company's business and may be regarded as supportable".|$|E

40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{economic}} crises, financial fragility has regained prominence {{in both the}} {{theory and practice of}} macroeconomic policy. Consistent with macroeconomic paradigms prevalent at the time, the original architecture of the euro zone assumed that safeguards against inflation and excessive government deficits would suffice to guarantee macroeconomic stability. Recent events, in both Europe and the industrial world at large, challenge this assumption. After reviewing the roots of the euro crisis in financial‐market developments, this essay draws some conclusions for the reform of euro area institutions. The euro area is moving quickly to correct one flaw in the Maastricht treaty, the vesting of all financial supervisory functions with national authorities. However, the sheer size of bank balance sheets suggest that the euro area must also confront a financial/fiscal trilemma: countries in the euro zone can no longer enjoy all three of financial integration with other member states, financial stability, and fiscal independence, because the costs of banking rescues may now go beyond national fiscal capacities. Thus, plans to reform the euro zone architecture must combine centralized supervision with some centralized fiscal backstop to finance bank resolution in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>insolvency...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study aims {{to propose}} {{an early warning}} model for {{predicting}} financial distress events in Brazilian banking institutions. Initially, a set of economic-financial indicators is evaluated, suggested by the risk management literature for identifying <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>insolvency</b> and exclusively taking public information into account. For this, multivariate logistic regressions are performed, using as independent variables financial indicators involving capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, and liquidity. The empirical analysis {{was based on a}} sample of 142 financial institutions, including privately and publicly held and state-owned companies, using monthly data from 2006 to 2014, which resulted in panel data with 12, 136 observations. In the sample window there were nine cases of Brazilian Central Bank intervention or mergers and acquisitions motivated by financial distress. The results were evaluated based on the estimation of the in-sample parameters, out-of-sample tests, and the early warning model signs for a 12 -month forecast horizon. These obtained true positive rates of 81 %, 94 %, and 89 %, respectively. We conclude that typical balance-sheet indicators are relevant for the early warning signs of financial distress in Brazilian banks, which contributes to the literature on financial intermediary credit risk, especially from the perspective of bank supervisory agencies acting towards financial stability...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. This mini-dissertation is {{primarily}} concerned with finding {{a solution to the}} problem regarding the repudiation of an inheritance by an insolvent. It is argued in the Wessels v De Jager case that when an insolvent repudiates an inheritance with the sole purpose of keeping the inheritance from being absolved by his creditors, such repudiation constitutes an act <b>of</b> <b>insolvency.</b> It is trite law that certain acts <b>of</b> <b>insolvency</b> can be rescinded in terms of section 26 <b>of</b> the <b>Insolvency</b> Act. To this end extensive use has been made of cases regarding this issue. Wessels v De Jager is the main point of departure regarding this study as it is the most recent case to establish a precedent. The court in Wessels found that the repudiation by an insolvent did not constitute an act <b>of</b> <b>insolvency.</b> In view thereof, it is suggested that the court erred in its finding in that the court based its decision primarily on the stipulation alteri. The stipulation alteri is an inherent contractual phenomenon. It is suggested that repudiation by an insolvent should be regarded as an act <b>of</b> <b>insolvency.</b> The corresponding reason for this premise is that when even at delatio certain rights exist. These rights are contingent or vested rights. The definition of asset in section 2 <b>of</b> the <b>Insolvency</b> Act is inclusive of contingent interests. Section 8 <b>of</b> the <b>Insolvency</b> Act stipulates that when an insolvent alienates his assets in such a way as to prejudice his creditors, such alienation constitutes a deed <b>of</b> <b>insolvency.</b> It is therefore argued that the repudiation of an inheritance by an insolvent heir is a deed <b>of</b> <b>insolvency</b> in terms <b>of</b> section 8 <b>of</b> the <b>Insolvency</b> Act which can be set aside by the court.
