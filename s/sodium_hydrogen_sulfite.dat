50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH. The reaction has to take place under the exclusion of oxygen and under precise control of the stoichiometry of the reactants, the temperature, the pH and the throughput.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite</b> (S), used as antibrowning agent, on the {{phenolic}} profile of potato extracts was investigated. This extract {{was compared to}} one obtained {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (A). In the presence of A, two major compounds were obtained, 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (5 -CQA) and 4 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid. With S, their 2 '-sulfo-adducts were found instead, the structures of which were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Also, for minor caffeoyl derivatives and quercetin glycosides, the corresponding sulfo-adducts were observed. Feruloyl and sinapoyl derivatives were not chemically affected by the presence of S. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was thought to be responsible for the formation of the sulfo-adducts. This was confirmed by preparing 2 '-sulfo- 5 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid in a model system using 5 -CQA, <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfite,</b> and PPO. This sulfo-adduct exhibited a small bathochromic shift (¿max 329 nm) as compared to 5 -CQA (¿max 325 nm) and a strong hypochromic shift with an extinction coefficient of 9357 ± 395 M– 1 cm– 1 as compared to 18494 ± 196 M– 1 cm– 1, respectively.

40|$|Rice straw is one {{of organic}} {{material}} {{that can be used}} for sustainable production of bioenergy and biofuels such as biogas (about 50 - 75 % CH 4 and 25 - 50 % CO 2). Out of all bioconversion technologies for biogas production, anaerobic digestion (AD) is a most cost-effective bioconversion technology that has been implemented worldwide for commercial production of electricity, heat, and compressed natural gas (CNG) from organic materials. However, the utilization of rice straw for biogas production via anaerobic digestion has not been widely adopted because the complicated structure of the plant cell wall makes it resistant to microbial attack. Pretreatment of recalcitrant rice straw is essential to achieve high biogas yield in the AD process. A number of different pretreatment techniques involving using physical pretreatment (hydrothermal and freeze), chemical pretreatment (sodium carbonate – <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfite,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide, NMMO, alkaline, and dilute acid) and biological pretreatment (fungal pretreatment) also combined pretretment (microwave irradiation and chemical) approaches have been investigated, but there is no report that systematically compares the performance of these pretreatment methods for application on rice straw for biogas production.
