40|$|Excised <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> responded {{similarly}} {{to both the}} invasion of plant pathogenic fungi {{and the presence of}} bean tissue, bean pollen, and mouse tumor cells by synthesizing pisatin and by developing a characteristic yellow-green fluorescence.

40|$|Infection of {{immature}} <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> with Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (a non-pathogen of peas) or f. sp. pisi (a pea pathogen) {{resulted in}} induction of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase. Within 30 hours, {{activities of the}} two enzymes increased 9 -fold and 4 -fold, respectively. Chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase were also induced by autoclaved spores of the two F. solani strains and by the known elicitors of phytoalexins in <b>pea</b> <b>pods,</b> cadmium ions, actinomycin D, and chitosan. Furthermore, exogenously applied ethylene caused an increase of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase in uninfected pods. Fungal infection or treatment with elicitors strongly increased ethylene production by immature <b>pea</b> <b>pods.</b> Infected or elicitor-treated <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> were incubated with aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a specific inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. This lowered stress ethylene production to or {{below the level of}} uninfected controls; however, chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase were still strongly induced. It is concluded that ethylene and fungal infection or elicitors are separate, independent signals for the induction of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase...|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} conclusions can {{be drawn}} based on the investigation of Ni(II) removal by pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod.</b> The adsorbent prepared from the <b>pod</b> of pigeon <b>pea</b> {{appears to be a}} promising adsorbent for the removal of Ni(II) ions from aqueous solution. The study indicated that the pretreated adsorbent produced through chemical activation using NaOH is an effective material for the removal of Ni(II). The maximum removal of Ni(II) is obtained at an alkaline pH of 8.0. It is found from kinetic studies that the adsorption rate of Ni(II) is faster for the initial 20 min, after which it is saturated. The equilibrium time for Ni(II) adsorption on the pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod</b> is obtained at 45 min. Based on the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 19.23 mg g− 1 of adsorbent. Equilibrium studies reveal that the Langmuir model provides better solutions and correlation to the adsorption data when compared with the Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. This suggests that adsorption is limited to the monolayer. The kinetics of biosorption was well represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The data obtained from adsorption isotherms at different temperatures were used to calculate thermodynamic quantities such as ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°. In thermodynamic studies, the positive ΔH° value indicated the endothermic nature of the adsorption interaction, whereas the positive ΔS° value showed the increased randomness at the solid-solution interface during the adsorption process. The negative value of ΔG° indicated the feasibility and spontaneous nature of the adsorption of nickel(II) onto the pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod.</b> The <b>pod</b> of pigeon <b>pea</b> used to produce the adsorbent is a locally and abundantly available agricultural waste product. Hence, the adsorbent prepared from the pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>pod</b> would be an economically useful tool and alternative to the commercially available activated carbon in the treatment of effluent containing Ni(II) ions.|$|R

40|$|Chitinase and ß- 1, 3 -glucanase {{purified}} from <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> acted synergistically in {{the degradation}} of fungal cell walls. The antifungal potential of the two enzymes was studied directly by adding protein preparations to paper discs placed on agar plates containing germinated fungal spores. Protein extracts from <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> infected with Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, which contained high activities of chitinase and ß- 1, 3 -glucanase, inhibited growth of 15 out of 18 fungi tested. Protein extracts from uninfected <b>pea</b> <b>pods,</b> which contained low activities of chitinase and ß- 1, 3 -glucanase, did not inhibit fungal growth. Purified chitinase and ß- 1, 3 -glucanase, tested individually, did not inhibit growth {{of most of the}} test fungi. Only Trichoderma viride was inhibited by chitinase alone, and only Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi was inhibited by ß- 1, 3 -glucanase alone. However, combinations of purified chitinase and ß- 1, 3 -glucanase inhibited all fungi tested as effectively as crude protein extracts containing the same enzyme activities. The pea pathogen, Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, and the nonpathogen of peas, Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, were similarly strongly inhibited by chitinase and ß- 1, 3 -glucanase, indicating that the differential pathogenicity of the two fungi is not due to differential sensitivity to the pea enzymes. Inhibition of fungal growth was caused by the lysis of the hyphal tips...|$|R
40|$|Field {{plots of}} Tifton loamy sand {{were treated with}} phenamiphos for control of root-knot {{nematodes}} in a multiple-crop system of turnips, field corn, and <b>southern</b> <b>peas.</b> Preplant applications of phenamiphos protected roots of turnips and corn from damage by root-knot nematodes. Concentrations of phenamiphos at application in the 0 - 15 -cm soil layer were near 6 μg/g on turnips and near 4 μg/g on corn and <b>southern</b> <b>peas.</b> After 30 d, concentrations were approximately 1 μg phenamiphos/g of soil for all crops. Concentrations of 2. 0 - 3. 8 μg phenamiphos/g of soil for 9 -d duration appeared to be adequate for control of root-knot nematodes on field corn and <b>southern</b> <b>peas</b> in this multiple-crop system.
