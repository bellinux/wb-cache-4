40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to prove if different farming conditions like conventional and organical farming of rainbow trout may cause differences in quality which are detectable by physical methods such as colour measurement and differential scanning calorimetry. Colour measurement revealed remarkable differences in lightness. Smoked trouts originating from conventionally farmed fish were much lighter than those of organically farmed trouts. This difference in L* could already be found when colour measurements were taken on the raw material. However, during chilled storage differences were equalized. Redness and yellowness were not significantly influenced by farming and did not change remarkably during chill storage. Based on earlier investigations on changes in thermal stability caused by heating, DSC curves of <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> {{could be used to}} verify that the core temperature of smoked fish had reached at least 60 °C during hot smoking process. This temperature is demanded by the guidelines of the German Food Code. In the DSC curves only the actin peak was still visible. All other proteins were obviously denatured during the hot smoking. When DSC curves were taken from <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> after different durations of chilled storage it could be seen that the denaturation temperature of actin decreased almost linearly with progression of storage time...|$|E
40|$|In the {{circumstances}} of small processing facilities for smoked fish production, and a particularly good fishing season, there occurs the necessity for freezing the catch in order to process it and preserve it in this way, at times when the season is not so good. To this end, the goal of our research {{was to examine the}} effect of freezing fish on the selected parameters of cold <b>smoked,</b> vacuum-packed <b>trout</b> fillets. To conduct the experiment, two groups of trout were formed: the control one, out of fresh fish, and the experimental one, out of previously frozen fish. In the course of a three week period of smoked fish storage at the temperature of 4 oC the variation {{of the total number of}} bacteria, and the total number of lactobacilli were monitored. Also, at the end of processing, the content value of water and salt were determined, as well as the content value of salt in the water phase, and aw value (water activity). By testing the bacteriological status of two groups of products during the storage period, it was determined that the total number of both bacteria and lactobacilli was smaller in the samples produced from frozen fish. The average content value of water and NaCl, as well as the salt content value in the water phase, in the vacuum-packed, smoked fillets produced from frozen fish was statistically, considerably larger than the content value of water, salt, and salt content value in the water phase in the samples manufactured from fresh fish. Our research findings show that using the raw material that was previously frozen for producing smoked fish fillets is not only appropriate, but also recommended.

It was located in the Nordic House in Reykjavík, a modernist building designed by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, and was named for the herb dill, which {{plays a major role in}} Scandinavian cuisine. Gunnar Karl was one of the first proponents of New Nordic cuisine in Iceland; he gathered herbs and vegetables both in a kitchen garden and in a greenhouse, and although the restaurant is not vegetarian, focussed his dishes on them rather than on meat or fish, which he did not always include. He sourced barley from Eymundur Magnússon, a farmer who runs a company called Módir Jörð (Mother Earth) with his wife, and blue mussels from Simon Sturluson, a fisherman in Stykkishólmur who credits him with creating the restaurant market for them. The restaurant also makes extensive use of smoked and dried ingredients.

40|$|The {{presence}} of Listeria monocytogenes on {{the surfaces of}} equipment and worker’s hands during different production stages, {{as well as on}} fish skin and meat during processing and storage of cold-smoked trout, was investigated. Listeria monocytogenes was recovered from 10 (6. 06 %) of a total 165 cotton-swabbed samples collected from the surfaces of equipment and worker’s hands at two separate processing facilities. Of 105 samples collected from fish skin and meat during various production steps in both processing plants, 14 (13. 33 %) were confirmed culture-positive for L. monocytogenes, with recovery being most frequently in samples collected in the area before vacuum packaging. Recovery rates at two different Serbian processing plants did not differ (p< 0. 05), but suggested that different L. monocytogenes serotypes appeared to be resident within each processing plant and {{may have contributed to the}} final product contamination. From all <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> samples collected during 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of storage at 4 oC only two were culture-positive for L. monocytogenes serotype 1 / 2 a and both of these were collected on the 7 th day of storage. Conversely, 4, 3 and 1 sample(s) were contaminated with L. monocytogenes serotypes 1 / 2 a and 1 / 2 b after 7, 14 and 21 days storage at 10 oC.

Potassium sorbate (PS) and sodium lactate (SL) were used separately or in combinations at 3 % (w/v) in brine for pre-smoking or with spraying at post-smoking. Pre-smoking usage could reduce the total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB) values better than the post-smoking usage during storage. However, post-smoking application was more effective at preventing the moulds and yeasts (MY) growth. PS in brine at pre-smoking was most efficient, which could keep trout fillets for even four weeks at 6 ± 1 °C storage {{within the range of}} consumable limits.

40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{slaughter}} methods {{on the quality}} of fresh and <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> and fresh gilthead seabreamwere evaluated during storage at 2 ◦C. Electrically stunned trout had slower ATP depletion of raw muscleand lower lipid oxidation in smoked product during storage. Gilthead seabream immersed in an ice slurry(IS group) after the harvest showed a more regular ATP depletion than in fish exposed to CO 2. Nevertheless,in the case of the IS group, self-initiated behaviour, response to handling and breathing all ceased only after 15 – 20 min, whereas carbon dioxide-stunned fish appeared dead after 5 min. However, gilthead seabream grouphaving slower ATP depletion also showed lower lipid oxidation of muscle during storage. In both species thiscould be due to the rapid conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase induced by the rapidconsumption of ATP. Xanthine oxidase, in the presence of redox iron and reintroduced oxygen, can producehydrogen peroxide and, consequently, hydroxyl radicals. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The collaborators, a {{trout farming}} and {{processing}} company, experienced poor utilisation of non-retail grades of rainbow trout. New products {{were required to}} utilise this resource and realise the growth opportunities in the multiple retail market. Factors influencing the subsequent developments were: 1 {{the needs of a}} major customer in the retail sector, and 2 the availability of new processing and packaging technology. In response to retailer demand the modified atmosphere packaging technique was applied to chilled fresh trout and <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> products. These products utilise weight grades of fish which were previously sold unprofitably to the catering and wholesale markets. A third product was developed to utilise trout which were physically damaged during processing. A boneless skin­ less mince was mechanically reclaimed from this material. New product concepts were generated and tested, and <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> pate subsequently developed. This product can utilise trout of any weight or quality, and may therefore act as a buffer against the fluctuating grade denands of other portion-concept trout products. Other benefits to the company are the introduction of new processing methods, applicable to an extended range of fish products, and the provision of a new product development rationale. The importance of new retail products for the UK trout industry is shown. However, only operators with diversified processing and marketing functions can respond effectively to the present opportunities, and this influence is stratifying the structure of the industry. General implications for the food industry are considered. Increasing retailer power, the trend to fresh foods and the attention paid to quality can result in strict specifications for agricultural produce, which may exclude a proportion of the crop from premium markets. New products can be developed to utilise this material, so improving profitability. The action research approach is used to elicit precepts relating to the management of new product development; the formulation of clear objectives, accounting for the company's needs and capabilities, helps focus creative marketing and financial resources on central issues. The freedom and motivation of the product champion are shown to be instrumental in determining the outcome of product development, as are the technical and managerial inputs from external organisations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the chemical composition of fresh and cold smoked rainbow trout fillets (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farmed in the Adriatic sea by measuring water, fat, protein, salt and ash content, fatty acid profile with an emphasis on eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids. Physical characteristics were determined by pH and color measurements. Analysis was performed on homogenized fish muscles without skin and bones. Determination of moisture, ash, fat and protein was conducted according to AOAC (1995). Determination of fatty acid content of previously prepared methyl esters (HRN EN ISO 5509, 2004) was conducted by gas chromatography according to HRN EN ISO 5508 (1999). Results showed that fresh rainbow trout farmed in the Adriatic sea is an excellent protein source (21. 21 %) but has slightly lower fat (5. 21 %) and omega- 3 fatty acid content (12. 52 %) compared to the results of other studies. Fat and omega- 3 fatty acid content was not decreased by the process of cold smoking.

40|$|Cold <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a {{traditional}} product from the San Daniele del Friuli area (Italy), usually packaged under vacuum, and its shelf life is 60 days. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of two different packaging systems (Vacuum packaging-VP and Modified atmosphere packaging-MAP) on the microbial, physico-chemical and sensorial changes of sliced cold smoked rainbow trout during storage. MAP packaged sample showed lower microbial loads than VP packaged sample throughout storage. Microbial count of VP packaged sample exceeded the limit of 6 log CFU/g after 60 days of storage. The total volatile base-nitrogen (TVB-N) values increased over time in both treatments, reaching values close to the limit of 40 mg N/ 100 g after 45 days. Also TBARS values did not were up to 10 nmol/g in both VP and MAP. The shelf life of 60 days seems to be too long, particularly for the VP samples.

40|$|ISO 22000 {{is the new}} {{standard}} bound to replace HACCP on issues related to food safety. Although several companies, especially the big ones, have either implemented or are {{on the point of}} implementing ISO 22000, there are many others which are rather timid and/or reluctant to implement it. The main reason behind that is the lack of information and the fear that the {{new standard}} is too demanding in terms of bureaucratic work. This paper aims at making a comparative presentation of how the two systems can be applied to a small smoked salmon producing company thereby facilitating the emergence of the differences. The main difference is that in ISO 22000 systems like Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Hygiene Practice are prerequisites thus leading to lower number of CCPs. In this case study for example, the number of CCPs dropped from eight (8) in HACCP to four (4) in ISO 22000. Furthermore, the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis was applied to the <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> manufacturing process in an attempt to calculate quantitatively the Risk Priority Number (RPN) and to find out whether it can be effectively correlated to ISO 22000 and/or HACCP.

40|$|Fish allergy is {{associated}} with moderate to severe IgE-mediated reactions to the calcium binding parvalbumins present in fish muscle. Allergy to multiple fish species is caused by parvalbumin-specific cross-reactive IgE recognizing conserved epitopes. In this study, we aimed to produce cross-reactive {{single chain variable fragment}} (scFv) antibodies for the detection of parvalbumins in fish extracts and the identification of IgE epitopes. Parvalbumin-specific phage clones were isolated from the human ETH- 2 phage display library by three rounds of biopanning either against cod parvalbumin or by sequential biopanning against cod (Gad m 1), carp (Cyp c 1) and rainbow trout (Onc m 1) parvalbumins. While biopanning against Gad m 1 resulted in the selection of clones specific exclusively for Gad m 1, the second approach resulted in the selection of clones cross-reacting with all three parvalbumins. Two clones, scFv-gco 9 recognizing all three parvalbumins, and scFv-goo 8 recognizing only Gad m 1 were expressed in the E. coli non-suppressor strain HB 2151 and purified from the periplasm. scFv-gco 9 showed highly selective binding to parvalbumins in processed fish products such as breaded cod sticks, fried carp and <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> in Western blots. In addition, the scFv-gco 9 -AP produced as alkaline phosphatase fusion protein, allowed a single-step detection of the parvalbumins. In competitive ELISA, scFv-gco 9 was able to inhibit binding of IgE from fish allergic patients' sera to all three β-parvalbumins by up to 80 %, whereas inhibition by scFv-goo 8 was up to 20 %. 1 H/ 15 N HSQC NMR analysis of the rGad m 1 :scFv-gco 9 complex showed participation of amino acid residues conserved among these three parvalbumins explaining their cross-reactivity on a molecular level. In this study, we have demonstrated an approach for the selection of cross-reactive parvalbumin-specific antibodies {{that can be used for}} allergen detection and for mapping of conserved epitopes...|$|E
40|$|Smoked {{vacuum-packed}} trout fillets {{have won}} {{importance in the}} market {{over the last few}} years, especially because of the increasing production in aqua cultures. According to the fish regulations (Fischhygiene-Verordnung 1994) fish processing facturies have to establish the principles of the HACCP-system for this potentially hazardous product. Similar control-plans were laid down also for the food trade in the ordinance about food hygiene (Lebensmittelhygiene-Verordnung 1997). Here, the most important control point is the maintenance of the cold chain according to the declared temperature in order to control the multiplying of spoiling bacteria and pathogenous microorganisms. The aim of the thesis was to estimate the hazard of insufficient cold storage. First, this study determines the hygienic state of smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets that were taken from fish processing plants, wholesale trade and retail markets. Then, the storage temperatures in chilled cabinets of food handling establishments were controlled by long-term measurements. Afterwards, challenge tests were carried out in order to assess the influence of different temperature conditions on the product quality and shelf life. The hazard caused by growth of L. monocytogenes and toxin production of Cl. botlinum was discussed. The results are summarized as follows: 1.) The median for the total aerobic bacterial count of 28 samples taken in fish processing plants was log 3, 10 cfu/g. The market anlysis of 44 samples bought in wholesale trade and 76 samples bought in retail shops showed a median of log 6, 38 cfu/g (wholesale) and log 6, 80 cfu/g (retail) for the total count. The predominant spoilage bacteria belonged to the group of lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp., followed by coliform bacteria and yeasts. 2.) L. monocytogenes was isolated in 43 (31 %) smoked trouts from wholesale trade and retail markets. 42 % of the L. monocytogenes-positive samples showed levels between log 2 and log 4 L. monocytogenes/g, in 12 % of the samples levels of more than log 4 L. monocytogenes/g were detected. 3.) The long-term measurements of the storage temperature proved insufficient cooling in 9 of 12 chilled cabinets. On the one hand the storage temperature remained constant over the whole period of time but exceeded the declared temperature partly extreme. In other hand the <b>smoked</b> <b>trout</b> fillets were stored at extremely varying temperatures. The labeled storage temperature was mainly exceeded during the defrosting period. Furthermore, the long-term determination showed that neither spot checks of the storage temperature by single measurement nor integrated displays provide meaningful results, because the defrosting can not be recorded. 4.) A high total bacterial load (> log 6 cfu/g) was reached at 3, 5 °C after 3 weeks storing of commercially produced smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets. A comparable result was attained within 8 days when the samples were stored at 11 °C. In samples stored at 6 °C, interrupted by one-hour storage at 11 °C, the limit of log 5 cfu/g was exceeded between the fifth and eighth day of storage. The minimum shelf life at a constant temperature of 4 °C should be fixed upon 14 days. 5.) Within the usual labeled shelf life of more than 3 weeks L. monocytogenes and Cl. botulinum will grow to high levels or produce toxin in smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets, if temperature abuse occurs (f. e., storage temperature of 10 °C). Therefore, for this potentially hazardous product a maximum storage temperature of 4 °C has to be settled. This indicates also a contribution to consumer protection. Furthermore, it is concluded from {{the results of this study}} that the trade has to be more responsible for the control point "storage temperature". <br...|$|E
