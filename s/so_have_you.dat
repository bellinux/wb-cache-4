6000|$|... 'Hugh!' said Sim. 'You {{have done}} well to-day. You shall be rewarded. <b>So</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> Dennis.--There's no young woman YOU want to carry off, is there?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} must move at Lady-day?" [...] said Bell, {{who was in}} favour of instant action. [...] "If <b>so,</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> not better let Uncle Christopher know at once?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "One {{could have}} {{imagined}} that she had everything she could reasonably wish for. If I'm not transgressing, <b>so</b> <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> It's strange you should both harbor the same idea." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thou hast perfumed My Name, <b>so</b> I <b>have</b> perfumed <b>thee.</b> Thou hast exalted My Name, <b>so</b> I <b>have</b> exalted <b>thee.</b> Thou hast {{purified}} My Name, <b>so</b> I <b>have</b> purified <b>thee.</b> By My Majesty, I {{will surely}} perfume thy name {{in this world}} and the world to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you thought}} so! Really! Kind {{of you to}} think <b>so.</b> And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> just thought about those that are coming, or <b>have</b> <b>you</b> made sure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By St. Jago!" [...] one of {{the traders}} said, [...] "you are stout fighters, young men, and have won your fee well. Methought we should have lost our lives {{as well as our}} goods, and I doubt not we should <b>have</b> done <b>so</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> not ranged yourselves with us.

6000|$|But, my friends, {{there is}} an answer for these sad thoughts. There are brave words for you, and a noble message from God, which will cheer you when nothing else can cheer you. If your own people cannot know all that you go through, there is One who can and does; if your own wives and mothers cannot feel enough for you, there is One above who does, and He is the Lord Jesus Christ. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> hungered; <b>so</b> <b>has</b> He. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> been weary; <b>so</b> <b>has</b> He. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> felt cold and nakedness; <b>so</b> <b>has</b> He. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> been {{houseless}} and sleepless, <b>so</b> <b>has</b> He. While the foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had nests, He, the maker of them all, had not where to lay His head. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> felt the misery of loneliness and desolation; but never so much as did He, when not only every earthly friend forsook Him and fled, but He cried out in His very death pangs, [...] "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; I {{have had}} it before. Besides, I've often been as wet; <b>so</b> <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> Anyhow, the pain's going, and there's a thing I forgot to mention. I met Wilkinson this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sartain; {{that much}} I've {{heard from her}} own lips; and, for that matter, <b>so</b> <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> It seems her father doesn't misgive her discretion, though he does that of his eldest darter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are always}} <b>so</b> good! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> seen Charles? I was in hopes {{he would have}} come," [...] Lady Marney added in a {{somewhat}} mournful tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>so</b> sorry! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> {{brothers}} and sisters?" [...] asked Belle, {{hoping to find}} something pleasant to talk about; for she was a kind little soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} <b>have</b> kept me <b>so</b> long <b>had</b> <b>you</b> known what I come about," [...] {{he said with}} bitterness. [...] "Still, you are worth waiting for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{no other}} standard,' said De Stancy; 'and if my own is wrong, it is you who have made it <b>so.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> thought any more of what I said at Cologne?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I {{thank you}} {{with all my}} heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly <b>so.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> {{any reason to believe}} that Lucie loves you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come!" [...] said Maxwell. [...] "No, I haven't; {{and neither}} have you. What {{do you make}} mysteries for? I've been over the whole ground, and <b>so</b> <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> There are no scoops in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in theory; but in {{practice}} I think they often are. Oh, Dad! <b>you</b> look <b>so</b> tired. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> really made up your mind? Won't you feel lost?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Looks none <b>so</b> bad. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> {{a bit of}} chiffon for the neck? It's not bombs nor Kaisers nor Tipperary {{that men}} in the {{trenches}} think of, it's chiffon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gently, gently, Mr. Graham. Let {{us have a}} {{few more}} words before we accede to the {{necessity}} of anything <b>so</b> sudden. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> spoken to Madeline on this subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes; they've {{come back}} from the emerald valleys of Cashmere, and Alethea has {{actually}} sent me a primrose--just like an English one--that they found growing there. They did enjoy it <b>so.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> heard from Maurice?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sailors," [...] said Desmond reflectively, [...] "have some curious notions on {{the subject}} of making pets. <b>So</b> <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> for that matter, but, after all, that's not quite the question.
