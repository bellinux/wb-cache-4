5|$|In {{search of}} fuel, highway patrol officer-turned-survivalist Max Rockatansky {{journeys}} to the Plains of Silence. His voyage takes an unexpected turn when he runs {{into a group}} of War Boys led by <b>Scabrous</b> Scrotus (Travis Willingham), psychotic son of Immortan Joe (Fred Tatasciore) and ruler of Gastown. Scrotus and the War Boys run Max {{off the road and}} steal his clothes, supplies, weapons and car, leaving him to die in the desert. Max chases them and challenges Scrotus to a duel on the Land Mover. Scrotus sicks his dog on Max but fails and is brutally kicked off the moving Land Mover by him. He stabs Scrotus in the head with his own chainsaw but is no match for Scrotus, who kicks Max and his dog out of the Land Mover.|$|E
25|$|S. hispanicus is an annual, biennual or {{perennial}} {{of up to}} 1¾m {{high and}} it also has one, two or three spiny dentate leaflike bracts subtending each cluster of flowerheads and the yellow, orange or white florets also lack black hairs. The cypselas however are topped by two to five bristles of <b>scabrous</b> pappus hairs (and are encased by the paleae). In this species the spined wings along the stems are interrupted.|$|E
25|$|The flowerheads {{are seated}} {{at the end of}} the stem or in the limbs of the higher leaves, are {{arranged}} in a spike or a globose cluster and are subtended by two to more than five leaflike bracts. Each flowerhead is circled by an involucre that consists of many spine-tipped bracts in several rows, the outer papery and shorter than the inner ones, which are leaflike in consistency. These surround the common floral base (or receptacle), which is conical in shape and is set with ovate papery bracts called chaff or paleae. Inplanted are dorsally compressed cypselas, each enclosed by a palea, the outer rows higher than the inner ones. On top of the cypselas there may be two to five stiff <b>scabrous</b> bristles, which are equivalent to sepals (and are called pappus). Also, on top of the cypsela and within the pappus is a yellow, orange or white strap-like corolla which ends in five teeth, together comprising a ligulate floret.|$|E
500|$|It {{is set in}} an open post-apocalyptic wasteland {{consisting}} of deserts, canyons, and caves. Players control Max Rockatansky as he progresses through the wasteland to seek revenge on a gang of raiders, led by <b>Scabrous</b> Scrotus, who robbed him of his possessions, and along with his assistant Chumbucket, he aims to build the ultimate car: the Magnum Opus. Mad Max emphasizes vehicular combat, in which the player uses weapon and armor upgrades on their car to fight enemies, while on-foot combat combines professional wrestling attacks and boxing techniques. The game features extensive car and character customization, and soft boundaries, {{also known as the}} [...] "Big Nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|The lines by Pope, though {{referring}} to Theobald, {{the hero of}} The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;, Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting {{would be one of}} this fraternity of [...] "witlings" [...] who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the poet to have the <b>scabrous</b> anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of [...] Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's [...] "side" [...] in the battle between dunces and men of wit.|$|E
500|$|The <b>scabrous</b> lyrics—"God {{save the}} Queen/She ain't no human being/There is no future/In England's dreaming"—prompted {{widespread}} outcry. Several major chains refused to stock the single. It was banned {{not only by}} the BBC but also by every independent radio station, making it the [...] "most heavily censored record in British history". That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two thousand million years." [...] Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see how anyone could describe us as a political band. I don't even know the name of the Prime Minister." [...] The song, and its public impact, are now recognised as [...] "punk's crowning glory".|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost as Boletus chromapes. Cataloging the bolete fungi of New England, Frost published 22 new bolete species in that 1874 publication. Rolf Singer placed the species in Leccinum in 1947 {{due to the}} <b>scabrous</b> dots on the stipe, even though the spore print color was not typical of that genus. In 1968, [...] Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers thought that Tylopilus was a more appropriate fit as they believed the pinkish-brown spore print—characteristic of that genus—to be of greater taxonomic significance. Other genera to which it has been shuffled in its taxonomic history include Ceriomyces by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909, and Krombholzia by Rolf Singer in 1942; Ceriomyces and Krombholzia have since been subsumed into Boletus and Leccinum, respectively. Additional synonyms include Tylopilus cartagoensis, described by Wolfe & Bougher in 1993, and a later combination based on this name, Leccinum cartagoense.|$|E
500|$|Similar to the films, Max seldom speaks or expresses emotion; his {{thoughts}} are reflected by his actions. The team aimed at developing a complex character and personality for him. According to the game's director, Max is traumatized by past experiences (such as losing his family); this makes him [...] "insane", [...] "unstable", and [...] "mad". These qualities {{are reflected in}} the game's [...] "rage" [...] mode, in which Max inflicts additional damage on enemies. Chumbucket, Max's mechanic and companion, is obsessed with the Magnum Opus; according to the game's lead writer, he [...] "has a pseudo-religious/sexual relationship with engines". <b>Scabrous</b> Scrotus, the game's main antagonist, is a warlord designed as a [...] "bloodthirsty monster that only can find solace from his own pain through the suffering of others". Enemies' faces are painted and scarred; according to game director Frank Rooke, their appearance [...] "is kind of the approach of how this civilization merged into this kind of state".|$|E
500|$|Various {{authorities}} have treated the taxon {{as either a}} Boletus, Leccinum, or Tylopilus, depending on which morphological characteristics they deemed most significant. Rolf Singer initially considered the species most appropriately placed in Tylopilus {{on account of the}} reddish-brown spore print, a taxonomic opinion shared by Alexander H. Smith and Harry Thiers, who wrote [...] "Concerning whether or not the species should be placed in Leccinum, we can only say that the color of the stipe ornamentation is merely a reflection of the color of the stipe generally and that it does not change color in a characteristic pattern as it ages. For this reason we exclude it from Leccinum and agree with Singer that it is a Tylopilus." [...] Later however, Singer thought the somewhat <b>scabrous</b> ornamentation of the stipe justified a placement in Leccinum. René Pomerleau had previously (1959) placed the species in Leccinum, but this transfer was invalid, as no basionym was specified.|$|E
500|$|Feeley {{explains}} that Romantic poet John Keats's [...] "vision of enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with faeries" [...] informs the novel, as the passing {{reference to the}} [...] "cold hillside" [...] makes clear. The magic in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell {{has been described as}} [...] "wintry and sinister" [...] and [...] "a melancholy, macabre thing". There are [...] "flocks of black birds, a forest that grows up in the canals of Venice, a countryside of bleak moors that can only be entered through mirrors, a phantom bell that makes people think of everything they have ever lost, a midnight darkness that follows an accursed man everywhere he goes". The setting reflects this tone, as [...] "dark, fog, mist and wet give the book much of its creepy, northern atmosphere." [...] According to Nisi Shawl in her review for The Seattle Times, the illustrations reinforce this tenor: [...] "Shadows fill the illustrations by Portia Rosenberg, as apt as Edward Gorey's for Dickens' 'Bleak House'." [...] Author John Clute disagrees, arguing that they are [...] "astonishingly inappropriate" [...] to the tone of the novel. Noting that Clarke refers to important nineteenth-century illustrators George Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson, whose works are [...] "line-dominated, intricate, <b>scabrous,</b> cartoon-like, savage and funny", he is disappointed with the [...] "soft and wooden" [...] illustrations provided by Rosenberg.|$|E
2500|$|François Villon was {{a student}} and {{vagabond}} whose two poetic [...] "testaments" [...] or [...] "wills" [...] are celebrated for their portrayal of the urban and university environment of Paris and their <b>scabrous</b> wit, satire and verbal puns. The image of Villon as vagabond poet seems to have gained almost mythic status in the 16th century, and this figure would be championed by poetic rebels of the 19th century and 20th centuries (see Poète maudit).|$|E
2500|$|During his lifetime, Javoršek was {{considered}} a controversial and unique personality. His dubious relationship with the establishment, {{as well as his}} sometimes extremely acrimonious attacks on the contemporary literary circles, both Slovene and French, gained him the nickname The Lonely Rider. His last work, [...] "Memories of the Slovenes", published partly posthumously in three parts, created a controversy and shed a new light on the Slovene literary and cultural scene of the War and Postwar period. Among the several <b>scabrous</b> details described by Javoršek in the copious work, are the misdeeds of the influential thinker Dušan Pirjevec Ahac allegedly perpetrated during the war resistance, as well as the conduct of notable personalities such as the literary critic Josip Vidmar and the poet Edvard Kocbek, for whom Javoršek worked as a personal secretary. The work also includes details about the personal lives of Slovenian Communist leaders Edvard Kardelj and Boris Kidrič.|$|E
2500|$|Although Gould was {{apparently}} {{well known to}} his own and the next two generations of poets, his reputation was virtually erased in the nineteenth century. By the 1730s, when Alexander Pope began to reject the [...] "licentious" [...] Restoration poets and other [...] "Tory" [...] writers gradually distanced themselves from the Cavalier wits, Gould's works fell out of publication and public consciousness. [...] Because his satires are sexually frank and exceptionally vicious, he was wholly unacceptable to the Victorian era critics who attempted literary histories and {{were responsible for the}} twentieth century's canon formation in literature. [...] At the end of the twentiethth century, his name was revived as an example solely of [...] "subliterary misogyny" [...] by feminist literary critics such as Felicity Nussbaum, whose The Brink of All We Hate held out Gould's most <b>scabrous</b> satires (and almost exclusively Love Given O'er and the passage quoted above) as typical of an unpreserved tradition of misogyny. [...] There remains one biography of Gould (by Eugene Sloan) and no contemporary edition of his works.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{described}} dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, {{most of all}} those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to The A.V. Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or [...] "your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a <b>scabrous</b> comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock)." [...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs About Fucking was {{released}} {{shortly after the}} band's breakup {{and went on to}} become their most successful record, with an initial pressing of eight thousand copies. Mark Deming of Allmusic calls it [...] "a <b>scabrous</b> masterpiece", while his colleague Andy Kellman states that [...] "each [...] is incisive enough to render a razor as effective as a butter knife. In sum: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech. Ugly characters line up in the songs like early arrivals at a monster truck rally." [...] Critic Robert Christgau commented that [...] "Anybody who thinks rock and roll {{is alive and well in}} the infinite variety of its garage-boy permutations had better figure out how these Hitler Youth rejects could crush the competition and quit simultaneously. No matter what well-meaning rockers think of Steve Albini's supremacist lies, they lie themselves if they dismiss what he does with electric guitars—that Killdozer sound culminates if not finishes off whole generations of punk and metal." [...] Albini himself later considered the album's first side as Big Black's best output.|$|E

60|$|Because she {{had nothing}} else to do, Carol went. But she was uncomfortable in the {{presence}} of the amused stares which Mrs. Flickerbaugh's raiment drew.

60|$|Then, as his verse is <b>scabrous</b> and hobbling, and {{his words}} not {{everywhere}} well chosen (the purity of Latin being more corrupted {{than in the}} time of Juvenal, and consequently of Horace, who wrote when the language was in the height of its perfection), so his diction is hard, his figures are generally too bold and daring, and his tropes, particularly his metaphors, insufferably strained.|$|E

In addition to his particular offense against society he has disgraced you. If there are to be lenity and charity let them go to the criminal who has foreborne to involve you in his shame. It were a pretty state of affairs if an undetected scamp, fearing exposure, could make you a co-defendant by so easy a precaution as securing your acquaintance and regard. Don't throw the first stone, of course, but when convinced that your friend is a proper target, heave away with a right hearty good-will, and let the stone be of serviceable dimensions, <b>scabrous,</b> textured flintwise and delivered with a good aim.|$|E
60|$|Then the Colonel {{stretched}} {{his legs and}} began {{to talk of the}} war. James, rather tired of the subject, sought to change the conversation; but Colonel Clibborn was anxious to tell one who had been through it how the thing should have been conducted; so his guest, with a mixture of astonishment and indignation, resigned himself to listen to the most pitiful inanities. He marvelled that a man should have spent his life in the service, and yet apparently be ignorant of the very elements of warfare; but having already learnt to hold his tongue, he let the Colonel talk, and was presently rewarded by a break. Something reminded the gallant cavalryman of a hoary anecdote, and he gave James that dreary round of stories which have dragged their heavy feet for thirty years from garrison to garrison. Then, naturally, he proceeded to the account of his own youthful conquests. The Colonel had evidently been a devil with the ladies, for he knew all about the forgotten ballet-dancers of the seventies, and related with gusto a number of <b>scabrous</b> tales.|$|E
60|$|A few claims, with log cabins {{of recent}} settlers, {{once or twice}} the shack of a forest-ranger, a {{telephone}} in a box by the road or a rough R. F. D. box nailed to a pine trunk, these indicated that civilization still existed, but they were only melancholy blurs. She was in a cold enchantment. All of her was dead save the ability to keep on driving, forever, with no hope of the tedium ending. She was bewildered. She passed six times {{what seemed to be}} precisely the same forest clearing, always with the road on a tiny ridge {{to the left of the}} clearing, always with a darkness-stilled house at one end and always, in the pasture at the other end, a horse which neighed. She was in a panorama stage-scene; things moved steadily by her, there was a sound of the engine, and a sensation of steering, but she was forever in the same place, among the same pines, with the same scowling blackness between their bare clean trunks. Only the road ahead was clear: a one-way track, the foot-high earthy bank and the pine-roots beside it, two distinct ruts, and a roughening of strewn brown bark and pine-needles, which, in the beating light of the car's lamps, made the sandy road <b>scabrous</b> with little incessant shadows.|$|E
