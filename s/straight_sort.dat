[To Higgins, {{who takes}} refuge {{on the piano}} bench, a little {{overwhelmed}} by the proximity of his visitor; for Doolittle has a professional flavor of dust about him]. Well, the truth is, I've taken a sort of fancy to you, Governor; {{and if you want}} the girl, I'm not so set on having her back home again but what I might be open to an arrangement. Regarded in the light of a young woman, she's a fine handsome girl. As a daughter she's not worth her keep; and so I tell you straight. All I ask is my rights as a father; and you're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing; for I can see you're one of the <b>straight</b> <b>sort,</b> Governor. Well, what's a five pound note to you? And what's Eliza to me? [He returns to his chair and sits down judicially].|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{recursive}} merge sort algorithm and quantify the deviation of the output from the correct sorted order if {{the outcomes of}} one or more comparisons are in error. The disorder in the output sequence is quantified by four measures: the number of runs, the smallest number of integers that need to be removed to leave the sequence sorted, the number of inversions, and the smallest number of successive exchanges needed to sort the sequence. For input sequences whose length is large compared to the number of errors, a comparison is made between the robustness to errors of bubble <b>sort,</b> <b>straight</b> insertion <b>sort,</b> and recursive merge sort...|$|R

40|$|Sorting {{algorithms}} can {{be classified}} in many different ways. The way presented here is by expressing the algorithms as functional programs and to classify them by means of their recursion patterns. These patterns on their turn {{can be classified}} as the natural recursion patterns that destruct or construct a given data-type, the so called cata- and anamorphisms respectively. We show that {{the selection of the}} recursion pattern {{can be seen as the}} major design decision, in most cases leaving no more room for more decisions in the design of the sorting algorithm. It is also shown that the use of alternative data structures may lead to new sorting algorithms. This presentation also serves as a gentle, light-weight, introduction into the various morphisms. 1 Introduction In this paper we present several well known sorting algorithms, namely insertion <b>sort,</b> <b>straight</b> selection <b>sort,</b> bubble sort, quick sort, heap sort and merge sort (see e. g. [Knu 73, Wir 76]) in a non-standard way. We express [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{algorithm}} is described that allows log (n) processors to sort n records {{in just over}} 2 n write cycles, together with suitable hardware to support the algorithm. The {{algorithm is}} a parallel version of the <b>straight</b> merge <b>sort.</b> The passes of the merge sort are run overlapped, with each pass supported by a separate processor. The intermediate files of a serial merge sort are replaced by first-in firstout aueues. The processors and Queues may be implemented in conventional solid logic technology or in bubble technology. A hybrid technology is alsb appropriate. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to study the Hough transform method, as applied to the detection of tracks of underwater moving objects in Lofargrams. The subjects included are the Hough transformation, clustering study, and reconstruction. Two methods, LAS (Land Analysis System) cluster technique and Sorting, are used for cluster analysis. Encouraging results are obtained from the Sorting method. A further improvement of the Sorting is shown to yield better results in processing noisy track data. Experimental results dealing with noise free artificial data, noisy artificial data, and real noisy data are presented. The improved Sorting technique presented in the thesis has shown improvements compared to the <b>straight</b> forward <b>Sorting</b> when it is applied to spectral component tracking. Commander, R.

These {{different}} shapes contribute {{in some cases to}} better hook penetration, fly imitations or bait holding ability. Many hooks intended to hold dead or artificial baits have sliced shanks which create barbs for better baiting holding ability. Jig hooks are designed to have lead weight molded onto the hook shank.

In the thesis we describe and compare multiple sorting algorithms for external sorting based on their behavior, their advantages and disadvantages. The algorithms we compare are the <b>straight</b> multiway merge <b>sort,</b> balanced multiway merge sort, natural multiway merge sort, polyphase merge sort, cascade sort, distribution sort, funnel sort and two pre-sorting algorithms. The purpose of the thesis is to describe and present how the algorithms work in theory and in practice.

As he had become one of the senior midshipmen, his natural haughtiness made him disliked by the younger lads; while, among those of his own standing, he had not one sincere friend, for there was a general feeling, among them, that {{although}} Richard Horton was a pleasant companion, and a very agreeable fellow when he liked, he was not somehow <b>straight,</b> not the <b>sort</b> of fellow to be depended upon in all emergencies.|$|R
40|$|A {{perturbation}} technique {{can be used}} {{to simplify}} and sharpen A. C. Yao's theorems about the behavior of shellsort with increments (h; g; 1). In particular, when h = Θ(n 7 = 15) and g = Θ(h 1 = 5), the average running time is O(n 23 = 15). The proof involves interesting properties of the inversions in random permutations that have been h-sorted and g-sorted. Shellsort, also known as the "diminishing increment sort" [7, Algorithm 5. 2. 1 D], puts the elements of an array (X 0; : : :; X nΓ 1) into order by successively performing a <b>straight</b> insertion <b>sort</b> on larger and larger subarrays of equally spaced elements. The algorithm consists of t passes defined by increments (h tΓ 1; : : :; h 1; h 0), where h 0 = 1; the jth pass makes X k X l whenever l Γ k = h t. A. C. Yao [11] has analyzed the average behavior of shellsort in the general three-pass case when the increments are (h; g; 1). The most interesting part of his analysis dealt with the third [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show the}} {{importance}} of sequential sorting {{in the context of}} in memory parallel sorting of large data sets of 64 bit keys. First, we analyze several sequential strategies like <b>Straight</b> Insertion, Quick <b>sort,</b> Radix sort and CC-Radix sort. As a consequence of the analysis, we propose a new algorithm that we call Sequential Counting Split Radix sort, SCS-Radix sort. SCS-Radix sort is a combination of some of the algorithms analyzed and other new ideas. There are three important contributions in SCS-Radix sort. First, the work saved by detecting data skew dynamically. Second, the exploitation of the memory hierarchy done by the algorithm. Third, the execution time stability of SCS-Radix when sorting data sets with different characteristics. We evaluate the use of SCS-Radix sort {{in the context of a}} parallel sorting algorithm on an SGI Origin 2000. The parallel algorithm is from 1 : 2 to 45 times faster using SCS-Radix sort than using Radix sort or Quick sort. ...|$|R
