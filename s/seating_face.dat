DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An aspherical plano-convex cylindrical micro-lens is produced from an oblong blank, having an optically polished surface, by (a) holding the blank in a holder such that the optically polished surface is forced into contact with a <b>seating</b> <b>face</b> of the holder; and (b) machining the blank, firstly with a coarse grained flat diamond grinding tool {{and then with a}} fine grained flat diamond polishing tool, by moving the grinding faces of the tools parallel to the lens length axis. USE - For producing aspherical plano-convex cylindrical micro-lenses, especially of highly refractive glasses or semiconductor materials (preferably gallium phosphide), useful as collimator lenses for high power laser diodes. ADVANTAGE - The produced lens has high optical imaging quality and high heat resistance...|$|E
