40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{it has become clear}} that <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> many phenological processes, like <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> {{flowering}} and leaf unfolding in spring, have changed. The increase in temperature {{is believed to be the}} main cause. <b>The</b> earlier <b>start</b> <b>of</b> flowering will have consequences for <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollen <b>season,</b> and thus for <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hay fever <b>season.</b> Millions of people world-wide will therefore experience <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> climate change in their daily lives during spring and summer. In this paper we analyse the relation between climate parameters, especially temperature, and <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollen <b>season</b> in <b>the</b> western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands based on daily pollen counts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leiden University Medical Centre and temperature measurements from 1969 till 2000 by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bill. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between temperature and <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollen <b>season.</b> An advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollen <b>season</b> <b>of</b> 3 to 22 days has been observed. The potential future changes in <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollen <b>season</b> under climate change scenarios are also discussed.
