5|$|The Herne Hill Sorting <b>Sidings</b> {{closed on}} 1 August 1966 and the freight {{line to the}} east of the station was taken out of service. Nothing of the <b>sidings</b> remains: {{residential}} accommodation has been built along Shakespeare Road (on the western <b>sidings)</b> and commercial premises have been built along Milkwood Road (on the eastern <b>sidings).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Woodham’s {{began taking}} wagons and {{locomotives}} for scrap, and stored {{increasing numbers of}} wagons and locomotives on low-level <b>sidings</b> beside the oil terminal and on new <b>sidings</b> built on reclaimed land where the West Pond had been filled in.|$|E
5|$|Inglenook <b>Sidings</b> is {{an award-winning}} model railway train {{shunting}} puzzle created by Alan Wright for the Manchester Model Railway Society's 1978 show, {{based on the}} former Kilham <b>Sidings</b> on the Alnwick and Cornhill Railway. The aim of the puzzle {{is to create a}} train consisting of five of the eight wagons sitting in the <b>sidings,</b> in the order in which the wagons are randomly selected.|$|E
5|$|The line's depot is at Hammersmith, {{close to}} Hammersmith station, {{built by the}} Great Western Railway to be {{operated}} by the Metropolitan Railway when the joint railway was electrified in the early 20th century. <b>Sidings</b> at Barking and near High Street Kensington (Triangle <b>Sidings)</b> stable trains overnight. <b>Sidings</b> at Farringdon were used during the C stock era; due to the greater length of the new S stock trains, these {{are no longer in}} use.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, a track {{had been}} added to the east of the station and two <b>sidings</b> {{had been added}} to the west; one of the western <b>sidings</b> was a bay {{platform}} for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor. Interlocking signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 1948 C Class {{locomotive}} 1225 was wrongly despatched {{into the}} north <b>sidings</b> at Goudhurst and derailed.|$|E
5|$|The empty wagons {{would then}} be shunted to the sorting <b>sidings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{were in the}} heart of the North East coal field, which at the time of their opening had hundreds of collieries. Coal was delivered straight to the stations by rail. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was used for the South station, where 22railway <b>sidings</b> were built. Trains could only enter the <b>sidings</b> when travelling in a westerly direction.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the station was Butler Street Goods Station, with a large number of <b>sidings</b> and two warehouses.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three <b>sidings,</b> used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the <b>sidings.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway <b>sidings,</b> beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These <b>sidings</b> closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|At the {{far north}} end of {{platform}} 4 are {{the remains of the}} Ladywell <b>Sidings,</b> most of which was swept away by the ring road built in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{the gardens}} {{were used by}} the Manchester Regiment for drilling, and a munitions factory {{complete}} with railway <b>sidings</b> was built.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a railway}} linking the {{colliery}} {{to the main}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was constructed, and <b>sidings</b> laid in 1905 and 1907 which were reconstructed in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw the Down Relief line, {{the most}} {{southern}} {{of the four}} running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage <b>sidings</b> to the east with the West Depot carriage <b>sidings</b> to the west. At the same time, Parson Street Junction was reworked, requiring trains to first cross from the Down Main line to the Up Main line before {{they were able to}} access the Portishead Branch. The Down Relief line was removed altogether when West Depot closed sometime after the opening of a new depot at St Philips Marsh to service High Speed Trains.|$|E
5|$|Train {{services}} {{on the line}} are provided by Southeastern, and are mostly operated by Class 375 Electrostar, or occasionally Class 465/466 Networker units. The line still sees a freight service to and from British Gypsum's <b>sidings</b> at Mountfield.|$|E
5|$|Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre's steam trains {{run on the}} <b>sidings</b> {{which were}} {{disconnected}} from the network in 1967, the station still has a working railway line passing through it, used for occasional special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre. Regular freight trains are mainly landfill trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former brick pits at Calvert.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt third-rail system {{came into}} {{operation}} on both routes through Herne Hill, from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line {{and along the}} entire length of the City Branch. Electric trains ran every 20minutes on both routes during the day and were kept overnight at the sorting <b>sidings</b> north of the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} no signals or {{automatic}} points {{to control the}} switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the <b>sidings.</b> On the approach to a level crossing the fireman ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also manually operated the points.|$|E
5|$|The route took {{a mostly}} direct path from a {{junction}} immediately south of Hellingly Station, past Farm and Park House <b>Sidings,</b> stopping places to load and unload produce and supplies from outbuildings of the hospital. Much of the railway {{has been converted}} to footpath, {{and many of the}} buildings formerly served by the line are now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The war {{memorial}} is one {{of several}} buildings and structures in the centre of York related to the NER, including the company's headquarters and the city's original railway station. The site—chosen as being immediately adjacent to the company's head office—was originally a coal depot and carriage <b>sidings.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{was a short}} boom in 1923, {{after which}} GWR made heavy {{investments}} in adapting the hoists and tips in its docks and <b>sidings</b> to handle the 20-ton wagon, but the collieries were often unwilling to adopt the new size despite offers of rebates.|$|E
5|$|Train {{frequencies}} {{are primarily}} {{limited by the}} fact that most lines funnel into the Transbay Tube and San Francisco. While a small sections of track in Oakland, Colma, and Daly City are triple- and quadruple-tracked, there are few <b>sidings</b> which would allow limited-stop or express trains to pass others.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} electrifying the former LCDR {{suburban}} routes in 1924. Herne Hill station was extensively remodelled {{as part of}} these works: the eastern island platform was lengthened; the original island platform was demolished and replaced by one further west, allowing two tracks to be laid between the island platforms; the western <b>sidings</b> were removed; and the upper floor was closed to passengers.|$|E
5|$|A journey between Arnos Grove and Southgate {{typically}} takes {{slightly more}} than four minutes. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2-6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems occur on the line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven <b>sidings</b> to its south for stabling trains.|$|E
5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and <b>sidings</b> were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{services}} increased, {{and from}} 8 July 1929 a half-hourly service operated along the line: two trains per hour to Portishead, one to Ashton Gate {{and one to}} Bristol Temple Meads, equating to 21 trains per day on weekdays. On Sundays eight trains per day operated. There were eight staff assigned to the station in the 1930s, and in 1944 three carriage <b>sidings</b> were laid {{at the south end}} of the station.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as <b>sidings,</b> before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|By 1846, {{the station}} was already very busy, {{handling}} trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff. North of {{the station was}} a network of goods lines {{around the end of}} the Lancaster Canal. The coal yards and <b>sidings</b> here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} March {{or early}} in April 1916, the British {{presence}} in the Sinai was growing; 16 miles (26km) of track, including <b>sidings,</b> had been laid. Between 21 March and 11 April, the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed. In 1915, they had {{been used by the}} central group of about 6,000 or 7,000 Ottoman soldiers who moved across the Sinai Desert to attack the Suez Canal at Ismailia. Without these wells and cisterns, the central route could no longer be used by large forces.|$|E
5|$|From Kings Cross, {{the line}} {{proceeds}} west towards the Sydney Central Business District on a viaduct that passes over the suburb of Woolloomooloo and the Eastern Distributor. The line then passes into a tunnel underneath the Art Gallery of New South Wales to a station underneath Martin Place. Turning south, the line proceeds through Town Hall, Central and Redfern stations, before emerging behind the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. The line is double track throughout, with turnback <b>sidings</b> at Martin Place and Bondi Junction for citybound trains, and at Central for trains from Bondi Junction.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Liners House, the company's new {{headquarters}} in Salford Docks, was officially opened on 12 December 1969 by the High Commissioner for Canada. The design was advanced for its {{day and it}} remains basically unchanged today except for re-glazing. The unusual curved facade of the ten-storey building was designed to echo the bridge shape of the Manchester Miller. Later renamed Furness House, it {{was built on the}} former Manchester Ship Canal railway <b>sidings</b> between Nos. 8 and 9 Docks.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1898, J. Johnstone, {{a member}} of the Whiteinch Harriers running club, was killed while {{attempting}} to run across the line west of the station. A small lead memorial stood on the spot for many years. The freight line saw near-disaster on 28 December 1932, when seventeen wagons laden with coal ran away on a slight incline on the <b>sidings</b> operated by the Great Western Steam Laundry; they ran into other wagons, derailing nine and spilling coal over the line, seriously disrupting passenger traffic.|$|E
5|$|Robert Mark Realty {{bought the}} former station in 1986 and renovated it {{at a cost}} of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the {{architect}} who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor. The building's design follows a Shingle Style architecture and its <b>sidings</b> are both shingle and clapboard. There are bay windows on the east and west faces, and rafters are partly visible. The building served as a real estate office.|$|E
5|$|The British then {{established}} garrisons {{along their}} supply lines, which {{stretched across the}} Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances were regularly carried out to protect the advance of the railway and water pipeline, built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These supply lines were marked by railway stations and <b>sidings,</b> airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in tents and huts. At this time the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) had a ration strength of 156,000 soldiers, plus 13,000 Egyptian labourers.|$|E
5|$|The depot {{stored and}} {{dispatched}} every item that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines. The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange <b>sidings</b> and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
