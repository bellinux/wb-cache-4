5000|$|Project {{management}} is the planning, delegating, monitoring and controlling of {{all aspects of}} the project, and the motivation of those involved, to achieve the project objectives within the expected performance targets for time, cost, quality, scope benefits and risks. The monitoring and control phase of project management mirrors fairly closely <b>stage</b> <b>gate</b> decision making, although <b>stage</b> <b>gate</b> decision making addresses potential problems earlier in the project management cycle. Like the monitoring and control phase, the logic model employed in opportunity management observes and monitors the project performance on an ongoing basis. The logic model helps a firm to outline the sequence of events related to the project. In a nutshell, a logic model is a valuable tool that produces a basic program [...] "picture" [...] that shows how the organisation's program is intended to do work. If the project is determined to be unable to meet the criteria outlined in the opportunity management process, the project or opportunity managers will take measures to correct the problems and put the project back on track.|$|E
5000|$|The {{front end}} of {{innovation}} is quite distinct from {{the remainder of the}} innovation process. When the very best ideas are discovered they can be managed with a <b>stage</b> <b>gate</b> oriented project management system, where the work flow is defined. The {{front end of}} innovation is commonly referred to as [...] "fuzzy" [...] because it functions best when a collaborative system nurtures chaos, disruption and the serendipitous discovery of ideas. Most ideas submitted via an electronic suggestion box are limited to incremental innovation (doing things the way we always have but better). There is nothing wrong with incremental innovation, in fact the ideas leading to projects resulting from incremental innovation typically yield rapid revenue gains or cost savings. But most organizations are using collaborative idea management systems to get breakthrough or radical innovation (ideas that {{can be thought of as}} [...] "out of the box" [...] thinking").|$|E
5000|$|The final gate {{leads to}} a {{dedicated}} new product development project. Many professionals and academics consider that the general features of Fuzzy Front End (fuzziness, ambiguity, and uncertainty) {{make it difficult to}} see the FFE as a structured process, but rather as a set of interdependent activities ( [...] e.g. Kim and Wilemon, 2002). However, Husig et al., 2005 10 argue that front-end not need to be fuzzy, but can be handled in a structured manner. In fact Carbone [...] showed that when using the front end success factors in an integrated process, product success is increased. Peter Koen argues that in the FFE for incremental, platform and radical projects, three separate strategies and processes are typically involved. The traditional <b>Stage</b> <b>Gate</b> (TM) process was designed for incremental product development, namely for a single product. The FFE for developing a new platform must start out with a strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will lead to a family of products. Projects for breakthrough products start out with a similar strategic vision, but are associated with technologies which require new discoveries.|$|E

50|$|With {{the newly}} arrived reinforcement, the nationalists {{launched}} a counteroffensive {{headed by the}} 21st Division from Haizhou (海州), the 43rd Division from Heishan (黑山), and the 195th Division and 22nd Division from Xinmin, which resulted in retaking Fuxin, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun by October 22. Unbeknown to the nationalists, the communists set a trap by giving up more land to spread the nationalist thin. The primary objective of the communists was to annihilate the nationalist 21st Division and the 43rd Division. To draw the nationalist farther to the west, the communist 9th Column took Chaoyang on October 23 after wiping out the local nationalist garrison, a regiment of the 53rd Division and a detachment of the 3rd Cavalry Army. The nationalist 21st Division and the 43rd Division were therefore lured westward to reinforce the local nationalist garrison, and on October 29, 1947, both divisions were surrounded by the enemy four times of their size at regions bordered by Chaoyang Temple (Chaoyang Si, 朝阳寺)、Nine Pass <b>Stage</b> <b>Gate</b> (Jiu Guan Tai Men, 九关台门)、and Daiguan Bunker (Daiguan Bao, 代官堡). By November 2, the eight communist divisions succeeded in badly mauling the two nationalist divisions and on November 4, the nationalist local garrison of Yi County (Yi Xian, 义县), the 4th Security Regiment, abandoned the town and retreated, but was completely annihilated on the way.|$|E

40|$|During {{the early}} stages of a company's {{innovation}} process (e. g. orientation and generation of ideas), sustainability concerns are only taken into account in the form of strategic guidelines. In contrast, many different methods, tools for design and impact assessment support the decision makers {{at the end of the}} innovation process (e. g. in the phases of realization and product development). An approach for environmental impact estimation of product ideas based on the guiding barrier concept by Fichter and Paech (2003) is presented. The approach uses the <b>stage</b> <b>gate</b> methodology by Cooper (2001) and action strategies for the reduction of environmental impacts of a product by Brezet/van Hemel (1997, 139). These action strategies are attributed to the different phases of the <b>stage</b> <b>gate</b> process and are supported by practical questions. The approach thereby makes use of the widespread assumption that there is a high degree of influence on product properties and corresponding environmental impacts at the early phases of the innovation process. The estimation of the environmental impact in the early phases of the innovation process is based on information on substances, materials and processes. This information can be obtained in part from the internet as an external information source. Search strategies are described how such information retrieval can be facilitated. It is based on using search engines and publicly available internet databases on environmental impacts of substances, materials and processes...|$|E
