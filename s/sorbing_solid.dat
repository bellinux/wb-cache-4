Cholesterol derivatives such as cholic acid are substances that {{play an important role in}} the digestion of fat components by the organism. This work presents a study on the intercalation of cholate anions in calcined MgAl-CO(3) -HDL. Isotherm experiments were performed at three different temperatures to evaluate the capacity of anion removal by sorption in the calcined LDH. The plateau was reached in all conditions. Increasing temperature results in decreasing cholate sorption. Characteristic peaks of LDH regenerated with OH(-) anions were observed at lower cholate concentrations. A peak in 2 theta equals to 7. 5 degrees and peaks between 15 degrees and 20 degrees are observed. Those peaks are the same as the ones observed in the pure sodium cholate PXRD. At higher cholate concentrations the <b>sorbed</b> <b>solids</b> present PXRD related to an additional layered phase, which is related to intercalation of cholate anions with basal spacing equal to 34. 3 angstrom. Thus, the cholate anions are also intercalated with a bilayer molecular arrangement at equilibrium concentrations at the isotherms plateau. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|There is {{significant}} {{concern about the}} accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in soils because of both direct and indirect impacts on human and ecosystem health. Knowledge of the fate and distribution of such contamination can lead to an effective assessment of the hazards to soil biota {{and the need for}} protective or mitigation activities. This is a particular challenge due to the heterogeneity of the soil matrix and complexity of the processes that determine PTE availability to soil biota. While whole-cell bacterial biosensors have been proposed as tools in enabling greater confidence in addressing such biological and chemical interfaces their genuine value remains to be realised. The underpinning objective of this work was to link the response of microbial biosensors to detailed chemical analysis and to relate the dose response sensitivity to other biological measurements. To better understand the phenomena of PTE bioavailability, the study considered changes in toxicity within the context of ion competition in both freshly amended and historically impacted soils. The interaction of test bacteria with both free (soil pore water) and <b>sorbed</b> (<b>solid</b> phase) fractions of the target analytes (copper, nickel and zinc) has enabled a better estimation of bioavailability/toxicity of PTEs in soils. In comparison to other assays, the responses of the microbial sensor to Cu, Ni and Zn highlighted its relative sensitivity to PTE contamination. The use of luminescence marked microbial sensors complements the performance of rigorous analytical soil chemistry approaches. Their value in soil pollution should be considered a technique that should be interpreted alongside chemical analysis rather than an alternative as their performance in complex environmental matrixes is yet to be validated.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of ligand titrations with metal ions using complexing resins as <b>sorbing</b> <b>solids</b> is evaluated. The resins considered were the iminodiacetic resin Chelex 100, the carboxilic resin Amberlite CG 50, and the {{anion exchange resin}} AG 1 X 8, whose sorbing properties for aluminium(III) and copper(II) were known from previous investigations. Synthetical solutions containing known concentrations of ligands, EDTA and IDA were titrated separately with aluminium(III) and copper(II), by adding known concentration of titrant metal, and measuring the concentration of metal ion sorbed on the resin, c. The concentration of free metal ion was evaluated from c by the relationship: [M] = cV/K*w. K * is {{the ratio of the}} concentration of metal ion sorbed on the resin to the free metal ion in solution, and strongly depends on the conditions. In the case of the resins used in this investigation it can be calculated since the sorption equilibria of the metal ions are known. The total concentration of the ligands and the conditional stability constants are evaluated by a linearization procedure, previously proposed and widely used for ligand titrations, based on the hypothesis that onlya 1 to 1 metal to ligand complex is formed. Accurate results are always obtained if the titration is properly carried out, i. e. using the appropriate resin, and adding the required excess of titrant. Some criteria are suggested to evaluate the results obtained, which can be useful when solutions of unknown composition are titrated. For these evaluations the sorption equilibria of metal ions on the resin at the considered conditions must be exactly known.

30|$|Cr(III) is {{the primary}} form of Cr in water bodies and can be {{retained}} by many adsorbent. Adsorption of Cr(III) is enhanced as pH increases due to deprotonation of adsorbent surface. Adsorption of Cr(III) is usually enhanced, if the adsorbent has a high organic content as more sites are present for sorption to occur (Igwe and Abia 2006). Cr(VI) behaves like an anion. In general, sorption of Cr(VI) decreases with increasing pH while at low pH values, surfaces will be neutral or positively charged, leading to higher adsorption due opposite charge attraction. Furthermore, sorption of Cr(VI) decreases as the concentration of competing anions <b>sorbed</b> to <b>solid</b> surface increases and finally adsorption of Cr(VI) becomes negligible. Therefore, adsorption processes are used indirectly to remediate Cr(VI), i.e. Cr(VI) is first reduced to Cr(III) (Selvaraj et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of bioactive trace pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and ingredients of {{personal care products}} (PPCPs) in different environmental compartments (rivers, lakes, groundwaters, sediments, etc.) is an emerging issue {{due to the lack}} of existing information about the potential impact associated with their occurrence, fate and ecotoxicological effects. Due to the low PPCP concentrations reported in wastewaters (ppb or ppt) and their complex chemical structure, common technologies used in sewage and drinking water treatment plants may not be efficient enough to accomplish their complete removal. Information about physico-chemical characteristics such as acidity, lipophilicity, volatility and sorption potential is a useful tool to understand the different removal patterns observed. In order to perform an accurate overall mass balance along the different units of sewage treatment plants, it is necessary to gather information not only about the {{presence of}} micropollutants in the aqueous phase, but also on the fraction <b>sorbed</b> onto <b>solids.</b> Since only some PPCPs are very well eliminated by conventional sewage treatment configurations, new strategies such as modification of operating conditions (e. g. solids retention time) ...|$|R

Proceses currently used in watewater treatment plants (WWTP) are unefficient in removing these compounds from contaminated wastewaters.

A new sensitive method for detection of seven selected endocrine disruptors (4 -nonylphenol, bisphenol A, estriol, 17 β-estradiol, estrone, 17 α- ethynylestradiol, irgasan) was developed. The method is based on accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solid phased extraction. For final extract analysis, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used. The efficiency of this method was tested using artificially contaminated sludge and the method was used to analyse real samples from several WWTPs in Czech Republic. The effect of sludge age on detection of individual analytes was assessed as well. The concentrations of endocrine disruptors measured in the samples reached up to 1 µg/g. The results are comparable or higher then those reported in other works and they show the necessity of further research on endocrine disruptors in the environment...|$|R

In this Critical Review, we evaluated factors influencing observed removal efficiencies of three antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline) in pilot- and full-scale biological treatment systems. Factors assessed include (i) retransformation to parent pharmaceuticals from e. g., conjugated metabolites and analogues, (ii) solid retention time (SRT), (iii) fractions <b>sorbed</b> onto <b>solids,</b> and (iv) dynamics in influent and effluent loading. A recently developed methodology was used, relying on the comparison of removal efficiency predictions (obtained with the Activated Sludge Model for Xenobiotics (ASM-X)) with representative measured data from literature.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of geochemical processes in sediments and soils {{has been limited}} {{by a lack of}} simple procedures to measure the kinetics of transfer from solid phase to solution. Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT) is an in situ technique which can be used to measure porewater concentrations and remobilisation fluxes of trace-metals, in sediments and soils. The dynamics of the sediment/DGT system were investigated using two dimensional modelling to ensure the correct interpretation of DGT measured fluxes, investigate the kinetics of the resupply from metal sorbed to particles, and estimate the magnitude of the resupply from particles to porewater in volumetric terms. When porewater concentrations adjacent to the DGT device are maintained by fast resupply from a large reservoir of metal <b>sorbed</b> to the <b>solid</b> phase (the sustained case), DGT measurements can be interpreted directly as porewater concentrations. When there is significant resupply from the solid phase, DGT can be used to measure kinetic parameters. If porewater concentrations are measured independently by an alternative technique, DGT measurements can be expressed in terms of a ratio R of DGT estimated to actual porewater concentration (0 < R < 1). Our model predicts a relationship between R, the kinetics of the resupply process, and the available reservoir of sorbed metal (expressed as a Kd value). If, as found previously for Cd and Zn in sediments, R ≥ 0. 95, the response time (Tc) of the (de) sorption process must be ≤ 0. 8 s and Kd (the distribution coefficient between solid and dissolved metal) must be ≥ 1. 1 × 105 cm 3 g− 1. For any measured value of R, Tc can be estimated either precisely or within limits, depending on what is known about Kd. Published DGT measurements for Cu and Fe lead us to estimate response times for the sorption process of 30 mins and 19 mins. If Kd is known precisely, the apparent 1 st order rate constants for the sorption process can be determined. Multiple DGT deployments with varying diffusion layer thicknesses can be used to estimate porewater concentrations. The DGT device depletes the reservoir of available metal <b>sorbed</b> to the <b>solid</b> phase. This depletion decreases with distance from the device.

Because {{of the physical}} properties of dense nonaqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), current treatment technologies are generally incapable of completely removing contamination from the source area. Incomplete removal means that the residual DNAPL will persist as a long-term source of groundwater contamination. When DNALPs occur in the subsurface, they resist remediation, owing to low water volubility, high viscosity and interracial tension, and microbial recalcitrance. Because of their high density and polarity, they are usually found <b>sorbed</b> to aquifer <b>solids</b> or in pools on impermeable materials.

Several published works deal with the {{energy transfer}} between two lanthanide ions in co-doped matrices {{but it is the}} first time that transfer processes between two lanthanide ions <b>sorbed</b> on a <b>solid</b> surface is reported. The results show that the energy transfer between sorbed Tb 3 + and Eu 3 + ions on strontium titanate is a non-radiative process and follows a dipole-dipole type interaction.

A formalism based on the model of Inokuti-Hirayama is used and allows one to fit the non-exponential Tb 3 + fluorescence decay. It is thus possible to evaluate the critical radius (R 0) of the influence sphere of the sorbed Tb 3 + ions.

Isotherm equilibrium was modelled according to Langmuir equation: maximum capacity was found to be 6. 4 and 3. 6  mg g− 1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. The important Ca 2 + release observed when Cr(III) is sorbed indicates that ion exchange is the main mechanism involved at concentrations lower than 200  mg L− 1 while other mechanisms such as microprecipitation or coordination might take place for higher initial concentrations. In the case of Cr(VI), the sorption mechanism is based on the reduction to Cr(III) promoted by both protons and the functional groups on the GS surface; this reduction-formed Cr(III) is retained by the alginate gel matrix and by microprecipitation onto the surface of GS particles.

40|$|The {{dewatering}} of arsenic-containing residuals is {{a process}} that has received little study in the past. Arsenic that has been removed from water by sorption to ferric or aluminum hydroxides can accumulate in residuals to concentrations many times higher than in the source water. The first part of this study evaluates the effectiveness of lime conditioning as a method for immobilizing this arsenic. As the pH is increased with addition of caustic soda or soda ash, soluble arsenic concentration increases dramatically. However, as the pH is increased with lime, very little arsenic is released back into the water. On the basis of previous research this phenomenon might be attributed to the formation of a calcium arsenate solid. However, this study indicates {{it is more likely that}} the soluble calcium neutralizes the negative surface charge on the hydroxide solids at high pH and enhances arsenic sorption compared to when calcium was absent. In many cases arsenic-containing residuals are stored in lagoons and allowed to reside there for months or even years. Many parameters may affect the soluble arsenic concentration and speciation in these lagoons. The second portion of this study gives some baseline conditions for these lagoons, both with and without microbial activity and biological organic matter.

Calcium carbonate minerals are known to <b>sorb</b> and form <b>solid</b> solutions {{with a range of}} target elements, and are readily produced by the actions of common microorganisms on simple chemical precursors. The ability of a commonly used urea-degrading, calcium carbonate-precipitating bacterium, Sporosarcina pasteurii, to tolerate the presence of a model contaminant, strontium, was determined in aqueous solution, with reduction in growth only seen at concentrations of 10 mM. Its ability to remove strontium from solution via calcium carbonate precipitation was then determined, and here S. pasteurii was shown to be able to remove 99 % (+/- 1 %) strontium from solution at concentrations up to 30 mM. This suggests that biomineralisation of metallic elements may afford a protective mechanism for the bacteria through providing a means to reduce the overall concentrations to tolerable levels. Finally, we explored the effects of ground conditions on mineralisation and strontium sequestration in different sand fractions (fine, medium and coarse), in a series of batch experiments. Almost all (97 - 99 %) strontium present was removed from aqueous solution after three days, whereas no precipitation was observed in control samples over the same period.

In this study, the sorption interactions of tetracycline, fluoroquinolone and sulfonamide antibiotics to whole soils and manure were investigated.

Similar sorption behavior among compounds from each class was observed, suggesting that future experiments need only investigate a representative compound from which the sorption behavior of other compounds {{in the same class}} may be inferred. Sulfonamide compounds were an exception in that significant variation in sorption behavior was seen among compounds from this class. A critical review of literature regarding antibiotic sorption to organic matter showed that most antibiotic compounds sorb through cation exchange with secondary mechanisms being cation bridging and hydrogen bonding. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the acidity of organic matter is a better normalizing parameter than the amount of organic carbon for comparing sorption among antibiotic compounds. The relative importance of hydrogen bonding as a sorption mechanism must also be explored.

The results showed that under the optimum conditions removal efficiencies of over 97 % were achievable and the limit of detection of 0. 15 mg kg− 1 of sulfur was obtained. Finally, the spiked/recovery assays of commercial fuel samples using MSPE-ICP-OES led to recovery values in the range of 94 ± 5 % to 101 ± 3 %.

Analysis of daily mass flows in STP of Athens showed that, {{with the exception of}} 4 -n-NP, all other EDCs were significantly removed (> 85 %) during wastewater treatment. Regarding the fate of these compounds, a significant part ranging from 45 % (for TCS) to more than 70 % (for NP 1 EO, NP 2 EO and BPA) was transformed by abiotic or biotic mechanisms, while the rest was accumulated in sewage sludge or disposed to the environment via the effluents. Calculation of risk quotients showed the existence of possible threat due to the presence of certain EDCs in treated wastewater and sludge. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Many {{synthetic}} organic substances, including surfactants, {{tend to be}} <b>sorbed</b> on suspended <b>solids</b> and {{to accumulate}} finally on bottom sediments, where benthic communities may be exposed to them. Concentrations of Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonates (LAS) have been detected in estuarine and coastal sediments, presenting wide concentration ranges depending {{on the presence of}} treatment facilities, hydrodynamic conditions, organic matter content, etc. Senegal sole, Solea senegalensis, larvae (40 days posthatching; dph) were exposed to increasing concentrations of LAS spiked sediments, comprised between 0. 37 and 880. 78 mg LAS·kg- 1 during 30 days. The obtained results showed that survival of exposed larvae was not significantly affected at environmentally relevant concentrations, the LC 50 value being obtained after 30 days 876. 46 mg·kg- 1. However, the histological and histopathological analyses carried out in target organs revealed, that first alterations from the normal pattern were observed at concentrations of 222. 66 mg·kg- 1, presenting effects such as blood extravasation and hyperplasy of the lamellar epithelium in gills, increase of inter-myotomal spaces of the skeletal musculature and edematous separation of the skin from epidermis. At the highest exposure concentrations (755. 27 and 880. 78 mg LAS·kg- 1), shrinkage of hepatocytes, nuclear pycnosis and blood stagnation are observed in the liver, degeneration of pancreatic cells, reduction of hemocytopoietic tissue in the kidney and vacuolisation of intestinal enterocytes was observed at histological level, as well as severe separation of the epidermis from the underlying tissues. Simultaneously, a significant increase of the wet weight with exposure concentration was observed in the test organisms...|$|R
40|$|Strontium is {{significantly}} more mobile than other hazardous radioactive metals. Its partitioning between aqueous and solid phases {{is controlled by}} reactions that occur at the interface between natural waters and minerals. At a groundwater site in Hanford (200 -BP- 5), the aerial extent of the {sup 90 }Sr plume is 100 {{times larger than the}} aerial extent of the {sup 137 }Cs and the {sup 239 }Pu plumes. Similarly, contaminated, perched watertables at INEL have much higher aqueous concentrations of {sup 90 }Sr than {sup 137 }Cs, presumably because Cs is preferentially <b>sorbed</b> to <b>solids</b> (Duncan 1995). Under high physical flow conditions, such as those in the highly fractured rock at Hanford and INEL, {sup 90 }Sr present in plumes may spread off-site and cause contamination of aquifers or other water sources. Geochemical factors that may contribute to the overall mobility of Sr in natural waters are the solubilities of phases such as strontianite (SrCO{sub 3 }) and formation of strong complexes with sulfate and nitrate. Although {sup 90 }Sr is mobilized in natural waters in these examples, significant concentrations may also be present in solid phases. Sorption experiments using a wide variety of substrates at room temperature have shown that Sr is removed from solution under certain conditions. Additionally, strontianite (SrCO{sub 3 }) may precipitate at low Sr concentrations in the pH range of waters in contact with basaltic rocks, which varies between pH 8 and 10. Waters contain variable amounts of carbonate owing to atmospheric interactions; the partial pressure of CO{sub 2 } is about 10 x 3. 5 atm in air and commonly as high as 10 x 2. 5 atm in soils. The objective of this work is to determine the fundamental data needed to predict the behavior of strontium at temperature and time scales appropriate to thermal remediation. The authors approach combines macroscopic sorption/precipitation and desorption/dissolution kinetic experiments, which track changes in solution composition, with direct molecular characterization of strontium in the solid phase using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These experiments will be used to identify mechanistic geochemical reactions and their thermochemical properties that will be incorporated into geochemical computer codes. This report consists of two sections: (1) a description of the preliminary results of strontium sorption to kaolinite and goethite from pH 4 to 10 at 25, 50, and 80 C and atmospheric CO{sub 2 }(g); and (2) a review of the available thermodyanimc data in the is Fe-Sr-Na-NO{sub 3 }-CO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} TiO 2 {{particles}} on the yield of H 2 formation under water radiolysis is measured. Irradiations were performed using a 60 Co γ−ray source {{as well as}} with He ions particles (4 He 2 +) generated by a cyclotron with an external beam energy of 6 MeV. The resulting hydrogen as a stable product of radiolysis was measured by mass spectrometry. G(H 2) obtained for water radiolysis by He ions−irradiation in aerated and argon water are found to be 1. 91 × 10 − 7 and 1. 35 × 10 − 7 mol J− 1, respectively. In the presence of titanium oxide anatase−type dispersed in water, under He ions−irradiation, G(H 2) is found to increase slightly from 1. 04 × 10 − 7 to 1. 35 × 10 − 7 mol J− 1 by increasing the specific surface from 8 to 253 m 2 /g, respectively. Under γ-irradiation, G(H 2) is found to be 0. 41 × 10 − 7 mol J− 1 close to primary yield of hydrogen in presence of OH. Radical scavenger. In addition, radiolysis of water adsorbed in the titanium oxide with low water content, which corresponds to a few layers of water <b>sorbed</b> onto the <b>solid</b> surface gives a huge values of the G(H 2). For the same amount of water, with using the dose absorbed by TiO 2 particles, for He ions-irradiation, G(H 2) increases from 14. 5 × 10 − 7 to 35 × 10 − 7 mol J- 1 by increasing the surface area of TiO 2 nanoparticles from 4 to 52 m 2 /g, respectively. For γ−irradiation G(H 2) is found to be 5. 25 × 10 − 7 mol J- 1 for the sample with 8 m 2 /g specific surface area...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{quality is}} a {{critical}} aspect affecting utilization of this source for certain purposes. In the UAE, utilization of groundwater for domestic purposes is well practiced. While the quality of groundwater at some locations does not permit direct utilization of this source, groundwater, in many cases, is mixed with desalinated water at certain proportion before being disinfected and then distributed to customers. Groundwater of Liwa aquifer contains high level of Cr(VI). It is believed that this contaminant originates from natural sources, but ittle {{has been done to}} investigate the fate of this contaminant. Spreading of chromium to nearby aquifers may render the quality of these aquifers un-suitable for certain uses. Furthermore, groundwater in Liwa district may not be suitable for drinking purposes even when mixed with desalinated water. It was, therefore, necessary to understand the impact of different transport mechanisms including advection, dispersion, and soil interaction on the transport of Cr(VI) in groundwater at Liwa district. This is important for the success of future measures to decontaminate groundwater in Liwa area. Another objective {{of this study was to}} investigate removal of Cr(VI) using activated carbon and metal iron. Several batch and column studies were conducted to investigate the transport of Cr in Liwa soil. Batch studies revealed that Liwa soil has low sorption capacity to Cr(VI) and higher sorption capacity to Cr(III). Sorption distribution coefficients for Cr(VI) determined from column experiments were more reliable than results obtained using batch tubes since the latter method is not sensitive to chemicals that are slightly <b>sorbed</b> to <b>solids.</b> Miscible displacement experiments conducted using Cr(VI) on columns packed with Liwa soil suggested that differences in the initial concentration used or differences in the applied flow rates employed do not result in a significant impact on the shape of the breakthrough curve. Normalized effluent Cr(VI) concentration along with the corresponding values of the pore volume (PV) were utilized to determine the value of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient (D) and the retardation factor and (R) using CXTFIT 2. 0. The model was further used to simulate Cr transport under different conditions. In conclusion, columns packed with Liwa soil have dispersivity of 0. 4 cm and a retardation coefficient for Cr(VI) of about 1. 5. Reduction of Cr(VI) using iron was investigated under different pH values. Addition of iron to a solution containing Cr(VI) caused the disappearance of the chemical. It was also found that as the pH is reduced from 7 to 4, higher removal occurred with almost complete disappearance of Cr(VI) from solution at pH 4 after 2 hrs of contact time. The rate of change of Cr(VI) and total Cr concentration with the use of granular activated carbon (GAC) at different pH values was investigated. The results of the experiments showed that the concentration of Cr(VI) decreases with time in the presence of GAC, with more disappearance from solution as the pH drops. In both the carbon and the iron experiment, the actual mechanism of Cr(VI) disappearance from solution is not clear...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the microbial degradation of acenaphthene and naphthalene under denitrification conditions at soil-to-water ratios of 1 : 25 and 1 : 50 with soil containing approximately 10 (5) denitrifying organisms per g of soil. Under nitrate-excess conditions, both acenaphthene and naphthalene were degraded from initial aqueous-phase concentrations of about 1 and several mg/liter respectively, to nondetectable levels (less than 0. 01 mg/liter) in less than 9 weeks. Acclimation periods of 12 to 36 days were observed prior to the onset of microbial degradation in tests with soil not previously exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, whereas acclimation periods were absent in tests with soil reserved from prior PAH degradation tests. It was judged that the apparent acclimation period resulted from the time required for a small population of organisms capable of PAH degradation to attain sufficient densities to exhibit detectable PAH reduction, rather than being a result of enzyme induction, mutation, or use of preferential substrate. About 0. 9 % of the naturally occurring soil organic carbon could be mineralized under denitrification conditions, and this accounted for the greater proportion of the nitrate depletion. Mineralization of the labile fraction of the soil organic carbon via microbial denitrification occurred without an observed acclimation period and was rapid compared with PAH degradation. Under nitrate-limiting conditions the PAH compounds were stable owing to the depletion of nitrate via the more rapid process of soil organic carbon mineralization. Soil sorption tests showed at the initiation of a test that the total mass of PAH compound was divided in comparable proportions between solute in the aqueous phase and solute <b>sorbed</b> on the <b>solid</b> phase. The microbial degradation of the PAH compound depends on the interrelationships between (i) the desorption kinetics and the reversibility of desorption of sorbed compound from the soil, (ii) the concentration of PAH-degrading microorganisms, and (iii) the competing reaction for nitrate utilization via mineralization of the labile fraction of naturally occurring soil organic carbon...|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors can}} {{influence}} the rate of microbial degradation of organic contaminants in aquifers. Some of these factors, e. g. sorption, the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), biomass, redox conditions, cometabolism, microbial community composition, and activity of degrading microorganisms, are addressed in the thesis, with the ambition to gain insights for bioremediation in aquifers, and to prevent contaminants from spreading to drinking water supplies. The influence of sorption of organic contaminants and bacteria on biodegradation was investigated under both diffusion limited and advective flow conditions. The results demonstrated that degradation by suspended bacteria of dissolved aniline and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP) was faster than the degradation of the same compounds <b>sorbed</b> to the <b>solids.</b> Nevertheless, sorption to the solids was not sufficient to exclude trace contaminants from degradation. In another investigation, {{the main effect of}} DOM on microbial phenanthrene degradation in groundwater was stimulation of microbial growth and activity of degrading populations, with hydrophilic DOM having a better effect than hydrophobic. In another study, glyphosate degradation was different in a mixture of sediment and groundwater from two aquifers (Vejen, Denmark and Vomb, Sweden). Laboratory experiments excluded sorption and organic carbon limitation as major sources of the observed differences. Glyphosate degradation was positively correlated to the density of bacteria, but the difference in density between the two sites was too small to account for the degradation difference. Instead, {{it was found that the}} differences in metabolic activity of the degrading strains and the microbial community composition of the aquifers were large and coincided with differences in rates of biodegradation. Glyphosate sorption was lower and biodegradation was slower under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic, and most of the degraded glyphosate was not mineralized but cometabolized to AMPA. The thesis pin-points to the possibilities to increase contaminant biodegradation in aquifers by the addition of i) oxygen to stimulate aerobic degradation, ii) a primary growth substrate, e. g. DOM, to increase biomass and thereby stimulate metabolic or cometabolic degradation, and iii) microorganisms to increase the degrading population and/or genetic capacity...|$|R
30|$|Stormwater {{runoff from}} {{impervious}} {{areas such as}} roads, roofs and parking lots is increasingly catching attention due to impacts like increased frequency of flooding, deterioration of water quality in receiving waters and risk to the downstream ecosystems (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2007; Kayhanian et al. 2008; McQueen et al. 2010; Milly et al. 2002; Walsh et al. 2012). Stormwater runoff contains a range of pollutants in dissolved and particle bound forms. The adverse effect of a substance depends on properties like persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation. These features {{are affected by the}} partitioning of the substance between the dissolved and particulate phases {{as well as by the}} exposure and uptake mechanism of the type of flora/fauna considered. For example, hydrophobic organic compounds and heavy metals can <b>sorb</b> to suspended <b>solids</b> carried with stormwater runoff, accumulate in sediments of receiving waters and negatively impact benthic organisms (e.g. Nakajima et al. 2006; Gardham et al. 2014), and compounds freely available in the water phase such as dissolved copper can lead to direct toxic effects to water living organisms (e.g. Allen and Hansen 1996; Ma et al. 2002). Stormwater pollutants are regulated by different legislation around the world, e.g. the European Water Framework directive and the Environmental Quality Standards directive (European Commission 2000, 2008) or the U.S. Clean Water Act (US EPA 2016). Management of stormwater quality is thus an essential part of strategies to improve the environmental status of natural waters. Most design practices for constructing stormwater management facilities are, however, based on historical climate conditions. Climate predictions show that the future conditions will be different from those of the past, with an expected increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall events and droughts in the future in some regions (Parry et al. 2007; IPCC 2012). A reassessment of the feasibility of the adopted stormwater management strategies is therefore appropriate. Water quantity effects of climatic change related to stormwater runoff and urban drainage systems have been studied (e.g. Semadeni-Davies et al. 2008 a; Arnbjerg-Nielsen et al. 2013), whereas effects of climatic change on urban emissions including water carried pollutants from stormwater systems have so far received little interest.|$|R
