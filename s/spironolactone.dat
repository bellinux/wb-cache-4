5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and <b>spironolactone</b> {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. <b>Spironolactone</b> is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of <b>spironolactone</b> may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). <b>Spironolactone</b> is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> is marketed under a {{large number}} of brand names {{throughout}} the world. The major brand name of <b>spironolactone</b> is Aldactone. Other important brand names include Aldactone-A, Berlactone, Espironolactona, Espironolactona Genfar, Novo-Spiroton, Prilactone (veterinary), Spiractin, Spiridon, Spirix, Spiroctan, Spiroderm (discontinued), Spirogamma, Spirohexal, Spirolon, Spirolone, Spiron, <b>Spironolactone</b> Actavis, <b>Spironolactone</b> Orion, <b>Spironolactone</b> Teva, Spirotone, Tempora (veterinary), Uractone, Uractonum, Verospiron, and Vivitar.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> and its {{metabolite}} canrenone {{are highly}} plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. <b>Spironolactone</b> is bound equivalently to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. <b>Spironolactone</b> and its metabolite 7α-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, {{a study of}} high-dosage <b>spironolactone</b> treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that <b>spironolactone</b> does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that <b>spironolactone</b> increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{is rapidly}} and {{extensively}} metabolized {{in the liver}} upon oral administration and has a short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of <b>spironolactone</b> are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), 6β-hydroxy-7α-thiomethylspironolactone (6β-OH-7α-TMS), and canrenone (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone), and these metabolites have much longer half-lives in comparison (13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively). These metabolites {{are responsible for the}} therapeutic effects of <b>spironolactone,</b> and for this reason, <b>spironolactone</b> is a prodrug. Until fairly recently, the 7α-thiomethylated metabolites of <b>spironolactone</b> had not been identified and it was thought that canrenone was the major active metabolite. However, they have since been characterized and 7α-TMS has been identified as the major metabolite of <b>spironolactone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{administration}} of <b>spironolactone</b> gives the histologic characteristic of <b>spironolactone</b> {{bodies in the}} adrenal cortex. <b>Spironolactone</b> bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} that 7α-TMS accounts for around 80% of the potassium-sparing effect of <b>spironolactone</b> while canrenone only accounts for the remaining approximate 10 to 25%. In accordance, 7α-TMS occurs at higher circulating concentrations than does canrenone and has a higher relative affinity for the MR. Other known but more minor metabolites of <b>spironolactone</b> include 7α-thiospironolactone (7α-TS), {{as well as the}} 7α-methyl ethyl ester of <b>spironolactone</b> and the 6β-hydroxy-7α-methyl ethyl ester of <b>spironolactone.</b> In addition to the MR, 7α-TS and 7α-TMS have been found to possess approximately equivalent affinity for the rat prostate AR relative to that of <b>spironolactone,</b> thus likely accounting for the retention of the antiandrogenic activity of <b>spironolactone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Licorice, {{which has}} {{indirect}} mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, {{has been found}} in studies to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of <b>spironolactone.</b> Moreover, the addition of licorice to <b>spironolactone</b> has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of <b>spironolactone</b> in women treated with the drug for hyperandrogenism, and licorice may hence be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with <b>spironolactone</b> as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, <b>spironolactone</b> is clinically useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|There is also mixed/conflicting {{evidence}} that <b>spironolactone</b> may inhibit 5α-reductase, {{and thus the}} synthesis of the potent androgen DHT from testosterone, to some extent. However, the combination of <b>spironolactone</b> and the potent 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride {{has been found to}} have significant improved effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism relative to <b>spironolactone</b> therapy alone, suggesting that any inhibition of 5α-reductase by <b>spironolactone</b> is only weak or at best incomplete.|$|E
25|$|In women, menstrual {{disturbances}} {{are common}} during <b>spironolactone</b> treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses {{and almost all}} experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of <b>spironolactone</b> develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. <b>Spironolactone</b> produces an irregular, anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (or menometrorrhagia) in {{a large percentage of}} women. It has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of <b>spironolactone</b> is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and <b>spironolactone</b> has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by <b>spironolactone</b> and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.|$|E
25|$|Canrenone is an {{antagonist}} of the MR {{similarly to}} <b>spironolactone,</b> but is slightly more potent in comparison. In addition, canrenone inhibits steroidogenic enzymes such as 11β-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, and 21-hydroxylase similarly to <b>spironolactone,</b> {{but once again}} is more potent in doing so in comparison. In vitro, canrenone binds to and blocks the AR. However, relative to <b>spironolactone,</b> canrenone is described as having very weak affinity to the AR. In accordance, replacement of <b>spironolactone</b> with canrenone in male patients {{has been found to}} reverse spironolactone-induced gynecomastia, suggesting that canrenone is comparatively much less potent in vivo as an antiandrogen. As such, based on the above, the antiandrogen effects of <b>spironolactone</b> are considered to be largely due to other metabolites rather than due to canrenone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{has been}} found to {{directly}} interact with the ER. Although a study found that <b>spironolactone</b> did not interact with the human ER at the concentration range tested, a subsequent study found that the drug did interact with the human ER at higher concentrations, albeit with very low (micromolar) affinity (inhibition constant = 2 × 10−5). In the same study, <b>spironolactone</b> was administered to rats and found to produce mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic or selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-like effects that were described as very similar to those of tamoxifen. In {{spite of the fact that}} tamoxifen had three orders of magnitude higher affinity for the ER than did <b>spironolactone,</b> the two drugs showed similar potency in vivo. It has been said that the likelihood of <b>spironolactone</b> interacting with the ER itself is remote in consideration of its very low affinity for the receptor in vitro. However, metabolism of <b>spironolactone</b> may result in metabolites with greater ER affinity, which could thus account for the activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to induce the enzyme CYP3A4, which can result in interactions with various drugs. However, it has also been reported that metabolites of <b>spironolactone</b> irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>spironolactone</b> {{is known}} to possess the above activities, {{it should be noted}} that the drug is a prodrug, with active {{metabolites}} such as 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS) and canrenone being responsible for its clinical effects. For this reason, the actual in vivo clinical profile of <b>spironolactone</b> may differ from the activities and effective and inhibitory concentrations described above and to the right. In any case, interaction with both the MR and AR have been observed for metabolites of <b>spironolactone.</b> On the other hand, <b>spironolactone</b> itself has only very low affinity for the ER, suggesting that its metabolites may be responsible for this activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{has been}} found to block Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) {{production}} and that of other human herpesviruses by inhibiting the function of an EBV protein SM, which is essential for infectious virus production. This effect of <b>spironolactone</b> was determined to be independent of its antimineralocorticoid actions. Thus, <b>spironolactone</b> or compounds based on it have the potential to yield novel antiviral drugs with a distinct mechanism of action and limited toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors of}} the study {{concluded}} that direct interaction of <b>spironolactone</b> (and/or its metabolites) with the ER could {{be involved in the}} gynecomastia, feminization, and effects on gonadotropin levels that the drug is associated with. Subsequently, it has also been suggested that, as a SERM-like drug, ER agonistic activity of <b>spironolactone</b> in the pituitary gland could be responsible for its antigonadotropic effects while ER antagonstic activity of <b>spironolactone</b> in the endometrium could be responsible for the menstrual disturbances that are associated with it. Such actions might explain these effects of <b>spironolactone</b> in light of the finding that it is not significantly progestogenic or antiprogestogenic in women even at high dosages.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioavailability}} {{when taken}} by mouth of <b>spironolactone</b> is 60 to 90%. The bioavailability {{of the drug}} improves significantly when it is taken with food. Steady-state concentrations of <b>spironolactone</b> are achieved within 8days of treatment initiation.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{antiandrogen}} properties, <b>spironolactone</b> {{can cause}} effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed <b>spironolactone</b> for any {{longer than a}} short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer drug, eplerenone, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogen effects of <b>spironolactone.</b> As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as <b>spironolactone</b> or the related drug canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{has been}} widely stated that the menstrual {{irregularities}} associated with <b>spironolactone</b> are due to its progestogenic activity, and although animal studies (involving both rabbits and rhesus monkeys) have shown clear progestogenic effects, the dosages of <b>spironolactone</b> used in animals to produce progestogenic effects were very high, and no evidence of progestogenic nor antiprogestogenic effects (as assessed by endometrial changes) have been observed in women even with high clinical dosages of <b>spironolactone</b> treatment. As such, {{it has been}} stated that the progestogenic potency of <b>spironolactone</b> is {{below the level of}} clinical significance in humans and that the menstrual abnormalities associated with the drug must have a different cause. Other possible mechanisms of the menstrual disturbances associated with <b>spironolactone</b> that have been suggested include interference with the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, inhibition of enzymatic steroidogenesis, and mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>spironolactone</b> is {{a potent}} AR {{antagonist}} with no significant progestogenic effects in women even at high dosages and hence is a pure-like AR antagonist, many studies have interestingly not {{found it to be}} progonadotropic in men, nor to increase testosterone or estradiol levels. Moreover, <b>spironolactone</b> is also said to possess very little or no antigonadotropic activity (in terms of lowering gonadotropin levels to below normal) even at high dosages, although some conflicting reports exist. Nonetheless, since <b>spironolactone</b> does not generally increase gonadotropin levels in spite of potent inhibition of androgen signaling, it must have some degree of antigonadotropic activity sufficient to at least keep gonadotropin levels from increasing. As estrogens are antigonadotropic similarly to progestogens, and as SERM-like activity has been described for <b>spironolactone,</b> the antigonadotropic effects of <b>spironolactone</b> may be due to estrogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{has been}} found to act as a {{reversible}} inhibitor of human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (17β-HSD2), albeit with weak potency (Ki = 0.25–2.4μM; IC50 = 0.27–1.1μM). C7α thioalkyl derivatives of <b>spironolactone</b> like the 7α-thioethyl analogue were found to inhibit the enzyme with greater potency, suggesting that the actual active metabolites of <b>spironolactone</b> like 7α-TMS might be more potent inhibitors. 17β-HSD2 is a key enzyme responsible for inactivation of estradiol into estrone in various tissues, and inhibition of 17β-HSD2 by <b>spironolactone</b> may be involved in the gynecomastia and altered ratio of circulating testosterone to estradiol that the drug is associated with. <b>Spironolactone</b> has also been associated with positive effects on bone, and it is notable that 17β-HSD2 inhibitors are under investigation as potential novel treatments for osteoporosis due to their ability to prevent estradiol inactivation in this tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> is {{a potent}} and direct {{antagonist}} of the AR, blocking androgens like testosterone from binding to and activating the receptor. The AR antagonism of <b>spironolactone</b> mostly underlies its antiandrogen activity and is responsible for its therapeutic benefits {{in the treatment of}} androgen-dependent conditions like acne, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and its usefulness in hormone therapy for transgender women. In addition, the AR antagonism of <b>spironolactone</b> is involved in its feminizing side effects like gynecomastia in men.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} the {{predictive}} markers for transgender women requesting breast augmentation, there was a significantly higher rate of those treated with <b>spironolactone</b> requesting breast augmentation compared to other antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate or GnRH analogues, which was interpreted by the study authors as being potentially indicative that <b>spironolactone</b> may result in poorer breast development in comparison. This {{may be related to the}} fact that <b>spironolactone</b> has been regarded as a comparatively weak antiandrogen relative to other options.|$|E
25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved ejection fraction, treatment with <b>spironolactone</b> {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with <b>spironolactone.</b> However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no statistical significance. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of <b>spironolactone.</b> More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of canrenone (an active metabolite of <b>spironolactone),</b> 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of canrenone. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with <b>spironolactone</b> in patients with preserved ejection fraction. The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated. The study's prime investigator and other prominent research cardiologists are now advising physicians treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to consider prescribing <b>spironolactone</b> pending outcome of two multicenter trials of newer medications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{can also}} have {{numerous}} other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications. <b>Spironolactone</b> together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{increases the likelihood of}} hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> is not {{generally}} used in {{men for the}} treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. This is evidenced by the usefulness of <b>spironolactone</b> as an antiandrogen in transgender women.|$|E
25|$|In accordance, a {{study found}} that in women treated with a GnRH analogue, <b>spironolactone</b> therapy almost {{completely}} prevented the bone loss {{that is associated with}} these drugs, whereas treatment with the selective AR antagonist flutamide had no such effect. Other studies have also found an inverse relationship between <b>spironolactone</b> and decreased bone mineral density and bone fractures in men. Estrogens are well known for maintaining and having positive effects on bone, and {{it has been suggested that}} the estrogenic activity of <b>spironolactone</b> may be involved in its positive effects on bone mineral density. However, it should also be noted that high levels of aldosterone have been associated with adverse bone changes, and so the antimineralocorticoid activity of <b>spironolactone</b> might partially or fully be responsible for these effects as a potential alternative explanation.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that <b>spironolactone</b> was not {{associated}} with teratogenicity in the offspring of rats. Because it is an antiandrogen however, <b>spironolactone</b> could theoretically have the potential to cause feminization of male fetuses at sufficient doses. In accordance, a subsequent {{study found that}} partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of <b>spironolactone</b> that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100mg/kg per day).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} <b>spironolactone</b> is urinary frequency. Other general side effects include dehydration, {{hyponatremia}} (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because it reduces androgen levels and directly blocks androgen signaling, <b>spironolactone</b> can, in men, cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), and feminization in general, as well as testicular atrophy, reversibly reduced fertility, and sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, <b>spironolactone</b> can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{antiandrogen}} {{activity of}} <b>spironolactone,</b> {{it can be}} quite effective in treating acne in women, and also reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of <b>spironolactone</b> to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered {{to be one of}} the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, <b>spironolactone</b> is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. <b>Spironolactone</b> is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. <b>Spironolactone</b> can be used in the treatment of female pattern hair loss (FPHL). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, it should be noted that not all cases of FHPL are dependent on androgens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{has been}} shown to inhibit steroid 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is {{essential}} for the production of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. Because of this, glucocorticoid levels might be expected to be lowered, and hence, <b>spironolactone</b> might have some antiglucocorticoidic effects. In clinical practice, however, this has not been found to be the case; <b>spironolactone</b> has actually been found to increase cortisol levels, both with acute and chronic administration. Research has shown that this is due to antagonism of the MR, which suppresses negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis positively regulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn signals the adrenal glands, the major source of corticosteroid biosynthesis in the body, to increase production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Therefore, by antagonizing the MR, <b>spironolactone</b> causes an increase in ACTH secretion and by extension an indirect rise in cortisol levels. As such, any antiglucocorticoid activity of <b>spironolactone</b> via direct suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis (at the level of the adrenals) appears to be more than fully offset by its concurrent indirect stimulatory effects on glucocorticoid production.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used antiandrogens for transgender women are steroidal: <b>spironolactone</b> and cyproterone acetate. <b>Spironolactone,</b> which is relatively safe and inexpensive, is {{the most frequently used}} antiandrogen in the United States. Cyproterone acetate, which is unavailable in the United States, is more commonly used {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} potential {{side effect of}} <b>spironolactone</b> is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia in these patients can present as a non anion-gap metabolic acidosis. <b>Spironolactone</b> may put patients at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, {{there has been some}} evidence suggesting an association between use of the drug and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, <b>spironolactone</b> {{has been shown to be}} immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{evidence}} that <b>spironolactone</b> may block voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spironolactone</b> {{can cause}} hyperkalemia, which can, rarely, be fatal. Of those {{prescribed}} typical doses, 10% to 15% developed hyperkalemia, and in 6%, it was severe. An {{increase in the}} rates of hospitalization (from 0.2% to 11%) and death (from 0.3 per 1,000 to 2.0 per 1,000) due to hyperkalemia from 1994 to 2001 {{has been attributed to}} a parallel {{rise in the number of}} prescriptions written for <b>spironolactone</b> following the publication of the RALES study. The risk of hyperkalemia with <b>spironolactone</b> treatment is greatest in the elderly, in people with renal impairment, and in people simultaneously taking potassium supplements or ACE inhibitors.|$|E
