5|$|To {{increase}} capacity on South West Trains' (SWT) overcrowded suburban services into Waterloo, there have, {{for several}} years, been {{plans to increase}} train lengths from eight carriageways to ten. This would require the lengthening of platforms and in particular platforms 1 to 4, would entail a substantial re-positioning of track-work and points. SWT also <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> need {{to have access to}} at least three of the currently disused international platforms 20 to 24. Further progress depends on decisions by the Government, and SWT says that until then it cannot proceed with ordering longer trains. In May 2016, it was announced that platforms 1 to 4 would be lengthened to allow new ten-car Class 707 trains to run. Work started on 5 August 2017, and was completed on 28 August.|$|E
500|$|Morison {{has always}} had an {{interest}} in greyhound racing, ever since he attended Walthamstow Stadium as a boy. In January 2013, Morison set up a greyhound racing syndicate alongside his former strike partner at Norwich City, Grant Holt, and the two launched the SMGH Racing Club. Talking of the racing club, Morison stated – [...] "I've got lots of kennels myself, lots of animals, lots of dogs. So me and Grant got together bought a couple of dogs and it's spiralled out of control a little bit, because we've bought seven now in the space of about three months. But it's been brilliant". When he finishes playing football, he <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "a dream" [...] to be a greyhound trainer.|$|E
2500|$|On January 17, 2006, Qatar-based {{news network}} Al-Jazeera aired a silent 20-second video-tape that showed Carroll, and {{indicated}} that, in an accompanying message, an as-yet unidentified group was giving the United States 72 hours to release all female prisoners in Iraq. If that demand were not met, the group <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> kill Carroll. The silent video showed Carroll speaking {{in front of}} a white background. The Qatar-based station said the kidnappers identified themselves as members of a previously unknown armed group calling itself the [...] "Brigades of Vengeance".|$|E

2500|$|At the Milazzo {{police station}} Sandro realizes the smugglers {{know nothing about}} Anna's disappearance. When he discovers that Claudia has arrived from the islands, he meets her {{at the train station}} where their mutual {{attraction}} is evident, but Claudia urges him not to complicate matters and begs him to leave. She boards a train to Palermo, and as the train pulls away, Sandro runs after it and jumps aboard. On the train Claudia is annoyed, saying, [...] "I don't want you with me." [...] She <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier if they sacrifice now and deny their attraction, but Sandro sees no sense in sacrificing anything. Still focused on her friend's disappearance, Claudia is troubled by the thought that it [...] "takes so little to change." [...] Sandro relents and gets off the train at Castroreale.|$|E
2500|$|Manuel and Danko {{laid down}} the basic track in Woodstock in 1967, {{according}} to Griffin, and {{the contributions of the}} rest of the Band were overdubbed eight years later. Critic Dave Hopkins notes that the demo version included as a bonus track on the 2000 Music from Big Pink reissue is the same performance, without overdubbing. Griffin calls the song [...] "charming in its own right", but <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not have fit in on the original Music from Big Pink because it was all too obviously from their past: [...] "an up-tempo bluesy number that the Hawks might have played" [...] in rural Ontario in 1964. Barney Hoskyns describes the song as one of the Band's early recordings that revealed [...] "the breathtaking scope" [...] of their musical range; he praises [...] "the rollicking bar-room R style" [...] of the performance.|$|E
