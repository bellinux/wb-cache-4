5|$|By 1910, Sunday {{began to}} conduct {{meetings}} (usually {{longer than a}} month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, and then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> front page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> the subject of over sixty articles in major periodicals, {{and he was a}} staple of the religious press regardless of denomination.|$|E
50|$|For most Christians, <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> {{observed}} {{as a day}} {{of worship}} and rest, holding it as the Lord's Day and the day of Christ's resurrection. In some Muslim countries and Israel, <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> the first work day of the week. According to the Hebrew calendars and traditional Christian calendars, <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> {{the first day of}} the week. However, according to the International Organization for Standardization ISO 8601, <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> the seventh and last day of the week.|$|R

5|$|In 1890, a {{labor dispute}} {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience would not allow him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E
5|$|By fourteen, <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> {{shifting}} for himself. In Nevada, Iowa, {{he worked}} for Colonel John Scott, a former lieutenant governor, tending Shetland ponies and doing other farm chores. The Scotts provided Sunday a good home {{and the opportunity to}} attend Nevada High School. Although Sunday never received a high school diploma, by 1880 he was better educated than many of his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> not a work day, but {{the prisoners}} did not rest; they were {{required}} to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower. Prisoners were allowed to write (in German) to their families on Sundays. Inmates who did not speak German would trade some of their bread to another inmate for help composing their letters. Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.|$|E

50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the terms}} for this Sunday (and the two {{immediately}} before it — Sexagesima and Septuagesima <b>Sundays)</b> <b>were</b> eliminated in the reforms following the Second Vatican Council, and these <b>Sundays</b> <b>are</b> part of Ordinary Time.|$|R
5000|$|Awareness <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> an {{initiative}} of the Awareness Foundation. [...] "Awareness <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> an annual opportunity {{to reflect on the}} value of loving our neighbour as ourself, even if our neighbour is of a different religious faith or worldview." ...|$|R
5|$|When Billy <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> {{ten years}} old, his impoverished mother sent him {{and an older}} brother to the Soldiers' Orphans Home in Glenwood, Iowa, and later to the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home in Davenport, Iowa. At the orphanage, Sunday gained orderly habits, a decent primary education, and the {{realization}} {{that he was a}} good athlete.|$|E
5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made {{a great deal of money}} and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E
5|$|O'Dell {{set about}} {{contacting}} local musicians from the Harrisons' rented house in Nichols Canyon, as Harrison took the long-distance calls, hoping {{more than anything}} to secure Bob Dylan's participation. Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good time in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a <b>Sunday,</b> <b>was</b> the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.|$|E

5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played on {{different}} days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} be played on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> a {{conservative}} evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by {{the vast majority of the}} Protestant churches and their clergy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> a rest day, so {{the match}} resumed on Monday, 10 February. As {{it was a}} working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had fallen and the sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket, which caused erratic behaviour. Nat Thomson was out for a duck without {{addition}} to the overnight total, and a collapse ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> welcomed {{into the}} circle of the social, economic, and {{political}} elite. He counted among his neighbors and acquaintances several prominent businessmen. Sunday dined with numerous politicians, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and counted both Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. as friends. During and after the 1917 Los Angeles campaign, the Sundays visited with Hollywood stars, and members of Sunday's organization played a charity baseball game against a team of show business personalities that included Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.|$|E
5|$|Chris and Bryan Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer {{reviewed}} and rated {{the show on}} a scale out of 10, giving it a 7. This was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by Nick Tylwalk, but lower than the 7.5 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. Compared to TNA's previous PPV event No Surrender, Bound for Glory was received better as No Surrender was given a 3 out of 10 by Jason Clevett. Meanwhile, Chris and Bryan Sokol gave TNA's next PPV event Turning Point a 7 out of 10. Rival World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced two PPV events in October that competed against Bound for Glory IV. The first was the No Mercy PPV event on October5, while the second was the Cyber Sunday PPV event on October26. No Mercy was reviewed by Chris and Bryan Sokol and given a 6 out of 10, lower than the Bound for Glory IV rating. Cyber <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> rated an 8 out of 10 by Andy McNamara, higher than the Bound for Glory rating. Compared to WWE's WrestleMania XXIV PPV event on March30, Bound for Glory IV was outperformed as WrestleMania XXIV was given a 9 out of 10 by Dale Plummer.|$|E
5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> a break in the routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E

5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> a rest day, and {{the match}} resumed on Monday morning. In the third over of the day, Lindwall {{was the last}} man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its {{overnight}} score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its American equivalents, Dawson City was a law-abiding town. By 1897, 96 {{members of}} the NWMP {{had been sent to}} the {{district}} and by 1898 this had increased to 288, an expensive commitment by the Canadian government. By June 1898 the force was headed by Colonel Sam Steele, an officer with a reputation for firm discipline. In 1898, there were no murders and only a few major thefts; in all, only about 150 arrests were made in the Yukon for serious offenses that year. Of these arrests, over half were for prostitution and resulted from an attempt by the NWMP to regulate the sex industry in Dawson: regular monthly arrests, $50 ($1,400) fines and medical inspections were imposed, with the proceeds being used to fund the local hospitals. The so-called blue laws were strictly enforced. Saloons and other establishments closed promptly at midnight on Saturday, and anyone caught working on <b>Sunday</b> <b>was</b> liable to be fined or set to chopping firewood for the NWMP. The NWMP are generally regarded by historians to have been an efficient and honest force during the period, although their task was helped by the geography of the Klondike which made it relatively easy to bar entry to undesirables or prevent suspects from leaving the region.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a church}} in every village, mostly Christian denominations. <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> sacred and a day of rest as 98% of Samoans {{identify}} themselves as religious.

5000|$|Septuagesima {{comes from}} the Latin word for [...] "seventieth." [...] Likewise, Sexagesima, Quinquagesima, and Quadragesima mean [...] "sixtieth," [...] "fiftieth," [...] and [...] "fortieth" [...] respectively. The {{significance}} of this naming (according to Andrew Hughes, Medieval Manuscripts for Mass and Office 1982, 10) is as follows: [...] "Septuagesima <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> so called because it falls within seventy days but more than sixty days before Easter. The next <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> within sixty, Sexagesima, and the next within fifty, Quinquagesima ... Falling within forty days of Easter (excluding Sundays) the next <b>Sunday</b> <b>is</b> Quadragesima." [...] Because every Sunday recalls the resurrection of Christ, they are considered [...] "little Easters" [...] and not treated as days of penance. Also note that Quadragesima serves as the Latin word for the season of Lent, which (not counting <b>Sundays)</b> <b>is</b> forty days long.|$|R
