40|$|Adopting a poststructuralist {{discourse}} analysis framework, the study explores a student‘s multiple subjectivities framed within discursive relations of power. Acknowledging {{language as a}} major contestation site for nego tiating subjectivities, it looks into the narrative of Ares, a <b>senior</b> <b>university</b> <b>student.</b> Utilizing the biographical approach, the study is centered on the shifting and fluid discourses in the student life of Ares, on how she was both positioned and positi oning within conflicting discourses of an ―obedient student‖ and ―resisting student‖ surrounded by oppressive practices of academics. ―Obedience‖ {{in the context of}} Ares meant refraining from questioning an academic‘s authority, undervaluing the self, and playing by expectations. However, a competing discourse involved ―resistance‖ in the form of non - attendance to classes, contemplating on students‘ rights, recognizing oppression, blaming, and prescribing. These discourses can potentially provide a glimps e into the effects of academics‘ oppressive behaviors towards students and create possibilities for the development of institutional policies to help suppress a troubling culture of oppression in the academe. Implications for the academic community are considered...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- We have {{investigated}} collaborative problem solving in a teaching experiment, which was organized for 32 <b>senior</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> in the computerized collaborative problem solving learning environment. The participating teacher was trained by us and students had available kits, interfaces and computers equipped with 8051 micro chip programming tools. Student activities were video recorded and the analysis proceeded through writing video protocols,edited into episodes and then classified into categories. Categories were mainly derived empirically. In the analysis, we used {{concepts such as}} collaboration and problem solving,in accordance with social constructivism. The data showed that typical learning processes were collaborative (51 % of all episodes) as well as dynamic problem-solving processes, inseveral stages. Students worked quite independently of the teacher, as they learned to use the programming tool autonomously in their technology projects. It appears, however, that more teacher support, such as introducing handbooks, planning tools and advanced programming skills, {{would have been an}} advantage. And it also appears the non-group interations would provide help in the problem solving process.

40|$|The aim of {{this inquiry}} was {{to find out whether}} there is any {{relationship}} between the ability to determine fact and opinion, and overall reading comprehension skill in L 2. This question was explored across three proficiency levels. Ninety-two (31 male and 61 female) Iranian <b>senior</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> participated in the study. The overall reading ability was measured by the reading sub-section of a version of MTELP. Participants were provided with nine paragraphs selected from English newspapers and were asked to determine whether each paragraph dominantly presented factual information or an opinion. The correct responses received a score of 1 and the incorrect ones received 0. Overall, the results showed a significant correlation between the ability to determine fact and opinion, and general reading comprehension skill. However, when computed separately, only the results with the higher proficiency group showed a significant correlation. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the ability to determine fact/opinion is not a sub-skill of general reading skill at lower levels of proficiency in L 2 but tends to develop, or becomes a sub-skill, as the L 2 proficiency increases...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{innovative}} educational concept of teaching the foreign languages to the <b>senior</b> <b>university</b> <b>students.</b> The research methodology is based on M. Bennett’s model of intercultural sensitivity development necessary for the gradual transformation of ethnocentrism into ethno-relativism. The development of students’ relativistic perception of national stereotypes is perceived by the author as an important factor of both the natural cognitive mechanism and intercultural communication.  The author argues that relativistic perception of national stereotypes can be achieved by fostering the intercultural world outlook, and therefore recommends incorporating a relativistic world view component in educational content structure along with the traditional components of knowledge, skills, attitudes, motives, creative activity expertise, etc. The paper emphasizes three consequent educational modules of ethnodifferentiation, ethno-integration and ethno-relativity in the proposed methodological system. The gradual fulfillment of educational goals, related to the above modules, can ensure the transformation of students’ perception of national stereotypes at the cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels.  The proposed educational concept, approbated in the German Language Department of Zabaykalsky State University in 2010 – 2013, along with the research data prove {{the effectiveness of the}} given method, and demonstrate a substantial development of students’ intercultural competence and a decline in the ethnocentrism level...|$|R

Accordingly, the need for entrepreneurial graduates is increasing. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of higher education with regard to the entrepreneurial intentions and traits of <b>university</b> <b>students</b> in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was administered to freshmen and <b>senior</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> studying business and engineering at five established universities in Turkey, yielding a total sample of 767. Findings: This logistic regression analysis indicates that some personality traits {{play an important role in}} influencing the students' intention to become entrepreneurs. The study findings also suggest that students with higher education have a higher intention of becoming entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional method of data collection was used. However, longitudinal data from a bigger sample would have provided more valid support for the study. Practical implications: The findings of this study have important implications for those who formulate, deliver and evaluate educational policy in Turkey.

We sought to determine how these misconceptions are expressed (qualitative aspect) and, only very secondarily, to gain a general idea {{of the extent to}} which they are held (quantitative aspect). Our second {{objective was}} to explore other misconceptions about wave aspects of sound. We have also considered the degree of consistency in the model of sound used by each student. Forty students answered a questionnaire including open-ended questions. Based on their free, spontaneous answers, the main results were as follows: a large majority of students answered most of the questions regarding the microscopic model of sound according to the scientifically accepted model; however, only a small number answered consistently. The main model misconception found was the notion that sound is propagated through the travelling of air particles, even in solids. Misconceptions and mental-model inconsistencies tended to depend on the engineering programme in which the student was enrolled. However, students in general were inconsistent also in applying their model of sound to individual sound properties. The main conclusion is that our students have not truly internalised the scientifically accepted model that they have allegedly learnt. This implies a need to design learning activities that take these findings into account in order to be truly efficient. Postprint (published version...|$|R

To understand how they experience computer systems and act in their learning situation, the what, the why, the how and the where of their learning have been studied from the students’ perspective. The what aspect concerns the students’ understanding of concepts within computer systems: network protocols. The why aspect concerns the students’ objectives to learn computer systems. The how aspect concerns how the students go about learning. The where aspect concerns the students’ experience of their learning environment. These metaphorical entities are then synthesised to form a whole. The emphasis on the students’ experience of their learning motivates a phenomenographic research approach as the core of a study that is extended with elements of activity theory. The methodological framework that is developed from these research approaches enables the researcher to retain focus on learning, and specifically the learning of computer systems, throughout. By applying the framework, the complexity in the learning is unpacked and conclusions are drawn on the students’ learning of computer systems. The results are structural, qualitative, and empirically derived from interview data. They depict the students’ experience of their learning of computer systems in their experienced learning situation and highlight factors that facilitate learning. The results comprise sets of qualitatively different categories that describe how the students relate to their learning in their experienced learning environment. The sets of categories, grouped after the four components (what, why, how and where), are synthesised to describe the whole of the students’ experience of learning computer systems.

40|$|Background: Patient {{education}} is {{taken into account}} {{as one of the}} key components of comprehensive care as well as one of the significant nursing functions in order to increase community health. In this respect, education materials and written texts can improve patient information up to 50 % and consequently meet patient satisfaction. Readability is considered as an integral concept in patient education and an appropriate measure to determine how contents are perceived by readers. Aim: The present study was to measuring the readability level of patient education pamphlets in training hospitals in the city of Mashhad. Method: This study was a descriptive research conducted in 2016. In order to measure the readability level, the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Readability Test was used. The study sample included 543 patient education pamphlets used by 11 training hospitals in the city of Mashhad along with pamphlets developed by the Office of Vice-Chancellor for Treatment Affairs that were collected through the census method. The SPSS 16 software was also employed for data analysis. In terms of descriptive analysis, mean and standard deviation were used. In addition, Cronbach’s alpha correlation test was employed for inferential analysis. Results: The average readability level of patient education pamphlets was estimated equivalent to 11 th grade (11. 35 ± 1. 05). Moreover, the minimum and the maximum readability levels of the pamphlets were 9 th grade and 15 th grade, respectively. Implications for Practice: The results revealed that patient education pamphlets available in training hospitals in the city of Mashhad were endowed {{with a high level of}} readability.

The aim of the program is to engage <b>senior</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> who have the potential to become future leaders of commerce, civic life, education, the arts and industry in our society and immerse these students in a program that will nurture their spiritual, social and civic awareness. The program draws its name and inspiration from Englishman John Henry Cardinal Newman’s writings on the ‘Idea of a University’. Students will be assigned a mentor who is a leader in their own professional and/or spiritual community. Students and mentors will meet regularly to discuss their progress at university, to set future goals and to engage in mature discussions about current issues. Guest speakers, culturally broadening experiences, retreats and engagement in university activities also form part of the program. Sydney Campus Minister, Anthony Crook, conceived the idea to enable students to expand their horizons. “It is important that we allow students the opportunity to develop their sense of self, their leadership skills and view of the world in tandem with their academic endeavours.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} text authenticity and test takers’ performance on C-Tests. To fulfill the objective a single C-test was developed on an authentic text (AC-test) and along with standard C-Tests (Klein-Braley 1997) and a disclosed version of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) was administered to one hundred and thirty five junior and <b>senior</b> undergraduate <b>university</b> <b>students</b> majoring in English language and literature, English translation and teaching English as a foreign language in two universities in Iran.

The implications of the findings are discussed within a foreign language testing context...|$|R
