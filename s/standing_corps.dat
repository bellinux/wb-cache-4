25|$|A corps, in {{the sense}} of a field {{fighting}} formation, is a formation of two or more divisions, potentially 50,000 personnel or more. While the British Army has no <b>standing</b> <b>corps</b> headquarters, forces are allocated through a number of multinational arrangements to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and European commitments, providing much of the headquarters capability and framework for the multinational Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. The last purely British corps, I (BR) Corps, disbanded in Germany after the end of the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|Federalists in {{this period}} focused on {{amendments}} to the United Nations Charter as a way forward. Most involved reforms to institutions such as a more representative Security Council, a World Court with compulsory jurisdiction and judicial review authority and a democratically elected General Assembly (or a world parliament). Federalists proposed {{a number of new}} institutions such as a commission on sustainable development, an international development authority, a <b>standing</b> peacekeeping <b>corps</b> and an international criminal court.|$|R

500|$|The Auxilia (Latin, lit. [...] "auxiliaries") {{constituted}} the <b>standing</b> non-citizen <b>corps</b> of the Imperial Roman army during the Principate era (30BC–284AD), alongside the citizen legions. By the 2nd century, the Auxilia contained {{the same number}} of infantry as the legions and in addition provided almost all of the Roman army's cavalry and more specialised troops (especially light cavalry and archers). The auxilia thus represented three-fifths of Rome's regular land forces at that time. Like their legionary counterparts, auxiliary recruits were mostly volunteers, not conscripts.|$|R

50|$|For {{the opening}} of the Battle of the Somme the 56th Division was tasked with making a diversionary attack on the Gommecourt Salient. The divisional {{commander}} considered that No-man's land was too wide for a successful attack, so on the night of 26/27 May (after two days of rehearsals) the Edinburgh Field Company assisted 167th (1st London) Brigade in digging a new jumping-off line closer to the enemy. German reconnaissance aircraft were kept away by a Royal Flying <b>Corps</b> <b>standing</b> patrol during daylight, and the new line was completed on 27/28 May. The operation was audacious and completely successful.|$|R

His grandfather, Michael Schofield (callsign [...] "Mustang") {{was one of the}} most {{decorated}} Marines in the Corps. While Schofield is close to his grandfather, his relationship with his father, John Schofield, is considerably worse. John Schofield resented Michael's <b>standing</b> within the <b>Corps,</b> and despite being a successful businessman, he felt he was unable to step out from his father's shadow. This manifested in a pattern of systematic abuse against his wife and son. John Schofield ultimately committed suicide, leaving twelve million dollars to his son; Shane Schofield donated all of it to a Washington, DC hospital as he felt the money was tainted.|$|R

40|$|The pre-war British Army {{understood}} {{well the}} importance of intelligence. Like the British Army on which it was patterned, the AIF entered the First World with only a small Intelligence Staff, albeit one that understood the role that intelligence would play in modern conflicts. Intelligence was acknowledged as {{an important element of}} military planning, but the maintenance of a large Intelligence Staff or a <b>standing</b> Intelligence <b>Corps</b> was viewed as an extravagance in peace time. Despite popular myth, intelligence was an important part of battle planning during the First World War and the amount of intelligence available to the British Army increased exponentially over its course. From the time they arrived in Egypt and throughout the Gallipoli campaign, the AIFs command and staff had access to a large body of intelligence with which to plan its operations. Arriving on the Western Front, the AIF gained access to more forms and greater quantities of intelligence. Throughout 1916 and 1917, as Australian staff took a greater role in planning the battles fought by the AIF, there was continual improvement {{in the way in which}} they used intelligence to plan and conduct battles. By 1918, intelligence was often the determining factor in how and where the AIF's battles were fought and by the end of the war, the Australians had shown themselves to be adept users of and effective collectors of intelligence. Intelligence was a key input into every level of operational planning. Anzac Intelligence offers a thematic examination of how the AIF used the different types of intelligence that were available at the outbreak of the war, or which became available as the war progressed, to plan and conduct its battles. It will focus on the different types of intelligence available to the AIF and the AIFs use of these over the course of the war...|$|R

5000|$|His {{biological}} parents were Matthew and Fiona Dexter, both {{leaders in the}} earliest days of the resistance against the Psi Corps. While director of the Psi Corps, Kevin Vacit arranged for his daughter Fiona to be broken out of a rogue telepath reeducation camp, as a part of his campaign to actually nurture the resistance, believing {{at the time that the}} competition between the rogues and the Corps would strengthen the telepaths' gene pool through natural selection. An encounter with the Vorlons changed his position on this, leading him to believe that only deliberate experimentation and selective breeding would produce telepaths strong enough to protect humanity from future threats. This led directly to the purges of 2189, a Psi Corps offensive which decimated the resistance and in which Bester's parents were killed. He was found by the Psi Corps, renamed, and placed in Cadre Prime, a training group composed of telepaths whose ESP had manifested during infancy. Bester was told that his parents were members in good <b>standing</b> of the <b>Corps</b> who had been murdered by the resistance, though he was not told their names or shown any photographs. This did not distress him, as he had full confidence in the Corps' slogan, [...] "The Corps is Mother, the Corps is Father." ...|$|R
50|$|Thus was {{abolished}} {{the old system}} of titles which had stood since the Revolution, with the substitution of a new system which was to last for nearly ninety years, though military rank and titles came in 1847. This reorganization brought about the discharge of the Apothecary General and his assistants. In 1825 a new edition of the Medical Regulations was issued. It was {{essentially the same as}} that of 1818, except as to phraseology to conform to the new designations of the medical officers. The office of Assistant Surgeon General was changed to that of Medical Director of Department and the duties of the Apothecary General and his assistants were assigned to officers detailed to the purveying department. An important addition was a paragraph calling for the examination by a board of three medical officers of all applicants for the position of assistant surgeon. This provision was not put into effect until after the issue by the War Department of General Orders, No. 58, July 7, 1832, which defined the requisites for appointment. Thus was initiated the foremost factor in the high professional <b>standing</b> of the <b>corps</b> to the present day. An act of Congress of June 30, 1834 (4 Stat. 714), confirmed the provisions for entrance examinations and fixed the pay and allowances of medical officers relative to those of other officers of the service.|$|R
