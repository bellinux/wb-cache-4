40|$|Does the Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{apply to}} private action? Does it {{apply to the}} courts? Does it apply to the common law? The Supreme Court of Canada in Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union v. Dolphin Delivery (1986) 1 has {{addressed}} {{each of these three}} fundamental questions. The facts of the case were these. Dolphin Delivery was a courier company. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represented the employees of another courier company, Purolator Courier, threatened to picket the premises of Dolphin Delivery. The purpose of the picketing was to publicize an industrial dispute between the union and Purolator. Dolphin Delivery was not a party to that dispute, thus the picketing of Dolphin Delivery 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises</b> would have been 2 ̆ 2 secondary picketing. 2 ̆ 2 Dolphin Delivery sought and obtained from the courts of British Columbia an injunction to restrain the union from picketing Dolphin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises.</b> The ground upon which the injunction was granted was that secondary picketing in the circumstances of this case would constitute the common law tort of inducing a breach of contract. There was a prohibition on secondary picketing in the B. C. Labour Code, but this statutory prohibition did not apply, because the applicable labour law was federal (in view of Purolator 2 ̆ 7 s interprovincial operations), and the Canada Labour Code was silent on secondary picketing, leaving it to be regulated by the common law. In the Supreme Court of Canada, the union argued that the injunction ought to be set aside on the ground that it limited freedom of expression, guaranteed under s. 2 (b) of the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada, sitting as a seven-judge bench, held unanimously that the injunction should stand. McIntyre J., with the concurrence of Dickson C. J., Estey, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ., wrote the principal opinion, holding that the Charter did not apply to private action of the kind involved in this case.

Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985). In other words, the tensions surrounding political, economic, and social upheaval send individuals scurrying to categorize and explain the new world confronting them. Certainly, the boom-and-bust economy of nineteenth-century France generated such anxieties. Interestingly, many of those fears focused on female sexuality, a topic that might seem remote from the debates over living wages for working-class men or the appearance of new credit mechanisms. The problem that interests Thompson is twofold. First, how did French society cope with the potentially destructive power of early capitalism, a power that could dissolve familial bonds and up-end social hierarchies? Second, how did new gender norms work within the new market framework? The French answer to both problems {{was the creation of}} a virtuous marketplace, one in which honor and self-control shaped men s economic practices, and in which distinct gender roles kept women a respectable distance from the temptations of material gain. ...|$|R
40|$|No doubt some {{reform of}} the federal courts is {{essential}} {{if they are to}} cope with the proliferation of litigation over the past thirty years and the resulting 2 ̆ 2 congestion, delay, expense, and expansion 2 ̆ 2 in the federal courts. While the problem may not amount to an 2 ̆ 2 impending crisis 2 ̆ 2, the burgeoning caseload surely poses a threat, at least in the long run, to the ability of the federal courts to function effectively. The hard question is not whether something should be done, but what to do about it. There is no shortage of interesting ideas. Some of the ideas that clamor for attention are proposals for specialized courts, new layers of federal appellate review, rethinking the scope of federal jurisdiction, an expanded role for United State Magistrates, and alternative dispute resolution techniques. The pros and cons of these and other innovations turn largely on our response to a more fundamental question: Is it better to expand the federal judiciary or to cut its workload? Of these two broad alternatives, the Federal Courts Study Committee squarely prefers limits on federal jurisdiction over large increases in the number of federal judges. I believe the Committee has made the wrong choice. While neither route is an altogether satisfactory solution to the caseload problem, an expanded federal court system is less objectionable than fencing claims out of the federal courts. This article raises three objections to the Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> {{that it is necessary to}} maintain an elite federal judiciary. First, the Committee defines the problem of setting the scope of federal jurisdiction too narrowly, focusing almost exclusively on the congestion in the federal courts and ignoring the impact of its solution on other worthy goals. The issue that should be posed is not whether the current system is wholly satisfactory, but whether the costs of reform are worth the benefits, all things considered. Second, an analysis of the costs and benefits of maintaining a federal judicial elite casts substantial doubt on the Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> that greatly enlarging the federal judiciary is an unacceptable alternative. Third, the Committee altogether ignores the substantive dimension of jurisdictional reform. The principles underlying the Committee 2 ̆ 7 s proposals, if not the current proposals themselves, may have far-ranging impact on substantive rights and obligations. Some groups of litigants will lose litigating advantages they now hold, and the desirability of the recommendations depends, at least in part, on whether we think the substantive burdens of reform are fairly distributed...|$|R

Using a more recent development {{in the realm of}} virtual work [...] workplace avatars [...] the article considers the impact on law of virtual performance identity by workers where appearances can be altered in virtual reality. Current protected-class approaches to antidiscrimination law have not served as the antidote to workplace bias and exclusion. Thus, the article investigates whether avatar technology holds promise for facilitating greater inclusion of marginalized workers in the contemporary workplace. Does this mode of virtual work serve as a platform for diversity or simply create more confusion regarding our fundamental understandings of discrimination?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of essays whose ultimate aim is to challenge the standard view of: The Neo-Moorean Argument (NMA) : (1) I have a hand; (2) If I have a hand, then I am not a brain-in-a-vat; (3) Therefore, I am not a brain-in-a-vat. In this literature, philosophers debate whether NMA transmits justification to its conclusion. The transmission of justification is tightly connected with inferential justification: an argument inferentially justifies its conclusion by transmitting justification from its premises to its conclusion. Hence, these philosophers are really concerned with whether NMA inferentially justifies its conclusion. The standard view is that NMA is an instance of complete transmission failure. In other words, many philosophers maintain that, even if NMA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises</b> are justified, NMA fails to (inferentially) justify its conclusion to any degree at all. I challenge this standard view and argue that NMA is quite capable of justifying its conclusion. ^ This dissertation is divided into three parts. The first part is composed of three chapters and addresses two foundational issues for any theory of inferential justification (or transmission failure), namely evidential support and higher-level requirements. The second part is the heart of my dissertation and is composed of one chapter. Drawing on the conclusions from the first three chapters, I present an account of inferential justification which entails that NMA transmits justification to its conclusion. This account is most plausible given the denial of a certain theory of perceptual justification. The third part of my dissertation is two chapters and defends my conditions by arguing against that theory of perceptual justification and providing an alternative. ...|$|R

Indeed, the first goal {{of this paper is to}} expand on Keohane 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> and to address how France and the United States understand sovereignty. The second goal is to argue that the current conflicting perspectives on sovereignty displayed by France and the United States are a departure from a historical pattern whereby, at each key time period, challenges to the shared definition of sovereignty and of the world order it symbolized, came from nondominant actors within or without the system in question. This paper posits that we are currently witnessing contradictions amongst the dominant actors.
