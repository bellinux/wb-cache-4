25|$|Weber's {{point of}} optimal {{transportation}} is a generalization of the Fermat point problem. In its simplest form, the Fermat problem consists in locating a point D {{with respect to}} three points A, B, and C {{in such a way}} that the sum of the distances between D and each of the three other points is minimized. As for the Weber triangle problem, it consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C {{in such a way that}} the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimized. In 1971, Luc-Normand Tellier found the first direct (non iterative) numerical solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems. Long before Von Thünen's contributions, which go back to 1818, the Fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of <b>space</b> <b>economy.</b> It was formulated by the famous French mathematician Pierre de Fermat before 1640. As for the Weber triangle problem, which is a generalization of the Fermat triangle problem, it was first formulated by Thomas Simpson in 1750, and popularized by Alfred Weber in 1909.|$|E

40|$|In {{this and}} a {{previous}} paper, work by geographers {{that is based on}} the idea that we are in a period of transition to an epoch of flexible accumulation, or post-Fordism, is examined. It is argued that this thesis relies on abstracting the technical and organisational aspects of current restructuring from its value relations. An account which includes value relations shows that the phenomena said to characterise flexible accumulation are more contradictory and unstable, more varied, and more open to struggle than is supposed in work in which a new epoch is assumed. In this second part of the study internal regimes of regions, the relations between regions, and regulation of national <b>space</b> <b>economies</b> are discussed. It is argued that the politics flowing from the flexible accumulation accounts oscillate between fatalism and utopianism, and that an approach based on value relations is able to provide a clearer basis for political struggle. ...|$|R

40|$|A nation 2 ̆ 7 s {{population}} is redistributed through migration flows and counterflows between its constituent subnational areas, {{resulting in a}} geographical pattern of net migration gains or losses which may change from one time period to another. Migration effectiveness is the indicator commonly used to measure net migration {{as a proportion of}} gross migration turnover for any territorial unit. This paper explores the effect of net migration in two different countries, Australia and the United Kingdom, using measures of migration effectiveness computed from period-age migration data sets for a system of city regions assembled for four consecutive five-year periods in each country. While the evidence suggests that the overall effectiveness of net migration has declined over the 20 -year period in both countries, marked similarities and contrasts are apparent in the spatial patterning of migration that together provide useful analytical insights into the changing <b>space</b> <b>economies</b> of the two countries...|$|R

40|$|This author {{offers a}} circumspect {{appraisal}} of the recent controversies surrounding an 'institutional turn' in economic geography and urban and regional studies. He contends that, although the prevailing institutionalist perspectives undoubtedly yield many welcome innovations and useful departures, they are also beset by certain conceptual difficulties. These include, first, a thin political economy most discernible in the failure to appreciate fully the crucial {{role of the state}} in shaping the urban - regional process, and a related weakness in examining the asymmetries of power which enframe the governance of <b>space</b> <b>economies.</b> Second, there is a danger of drifting towards a soft institutionalism : a tautological trap that could invite researchers and policymakers mistakenly to envisage the presence or otherwise of a regional 'institutional thickness' or a local 'social capital' as an adequate explanation of uneven economic development. It is then contended that one relatively mature but continually evolving institutionalist political - economic framework, the Regulation Approach, might help to redress these deficits and to illuminate further our understanding of urban - regional economic change. Recent contributions examining the shifting geographies of accumulation and the rescaling of regulation are viewed to be particularly germane in this regard. ...|$|R

A Title 10 war games evolution was elaborated to support a robust operational concept. A Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach was utilized to support the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) provided the foundation to explore autonomous battle space activity {{and its relationship to}} operational energy. Design of Experiments (DOE) principles were used to specify force scale levels suitable for examination of the tradespace. The research objectively sought to understand the relationship between force scale, energy use, and mission effectiveness. Results support findings regarding key energy drivers, energy dependencies across the combat elements of the battle <b>space,</b> <b>economies</b> of scale, and net-centricity. The findings inform evaluation of force application doctrine in small land battle engagements, and provide modeling artifacts for future research efforts...|$|R
