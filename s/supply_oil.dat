40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>supplied</b> <b>oil</b> quantity and contact bulk temperature on micro-pitting life using two-roller contact machine. To quantify the failure rate of damaged surfaces of micro-pitting occurrence, the DBR(Dark and Bright Ratio) method was effectively implemented for observing not a sudden occurrence of macro-pitting but the transition of micro-pitting growth. The failure criterion is set as 4 % micro-pitting on contact surfaces, which is adopted from precedent researches. The change of surface damaged area was measured by an optical microscope and calculated {{by the use of}} dark and bright ratio of test specimen pictures taken by optical microscope. The optimum oil quantity was determined to obtain the minimum oil quantity with no change in bulk temperature despite of increasing the <b>supplied</b> <b>oil</b> quantity. In conclusion, the influence of <b>supplied</b> <b>oil</b> quantity and contact bulk temperature on micro-pitting lifetime and the surface contact strength by the S-N curves of failure rate are quantitatively reported and expressed as empirical formulas...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 {{reveals a}} {{noticeable}} {{difference in the}} effect of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates across various quantiles. The sequence of the estimated coefficients can express the structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates. Panel A reveals the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> on <b>oil</b> exporting countries. The structure of shock tends to be inverse S-shaped. Unlike the median quantile, in the lower and upper quantiles, the estimated coefficient on the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables tends to be statistically distinguishable from zero. This implies that for significant US dollar depreciations, the shock is mostly negative, whereas for significant US dollar appreciations it is mostly positive. This pattern is clearly apparent for Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. However, for Mexico, the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> tends to be inverse U-shaped. In both the lower and upper quantiles, the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have negative and statistically significant impacts on its real exchange rate. The structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates in oil-importing countries {{is shown in the}} Panel B. These shock structures tend to be U-shaped in most cases. At the lower quantiles, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have positive and statistically significant effects on both Japan and the European Union. However, at the upper quantiles, only for Japan are the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks positive and statistically significant. Overall, the effects of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates have heterogeneous impacts on different countries and across various quantiles. In particular, for significant US dollar depreciation and appreciation, the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on exchange rates is significantly distinguishable from zero.|$|R
30|$|For a {{significant}} US dollar depreciation (at lower quantiles), the extreme impacts of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks on exchange rates {{are shown in}} Table  4. For oil-exporting countries, the estimated coefficients on <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables are negative and statistically significant for Canada, Mexico and the UK at the 0.01 quantile, and for Norway at the 0.05 quantile. While for oil-importing countries, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks only have positive and significant impacts on exchange rate returns in the EU. These results can be easily explained. The <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks possibly reflect the discovery of new oil fields, better extraction technologies or a decline in OPEC’s control over the <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> Following an <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock that alters the oil balance, the real exchange rate moves to ensure an offsetting adjustment in the non-oil trade balance in order to stabilize net foreign assets. Therefore, a positive <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock has negative impacts (US dollar depreciation) on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries while having positive impacts (US dollar appreciation) in oil-importing countries.|$|R
