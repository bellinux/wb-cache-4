Satellite TV channels are accessible via cable subscription, direct-broadcast satellite services or internet-based television. Hyderabad's first dial-up internet access became available in the early 1990s and was limited to software development companies. The first public internet access service began in 1995, with the first private sector internet service provider (ISP) starting operations in 1998.

Wat Phra Dhammakaya started to develop a more international approach to its teachings, teaching meditation in not-Buddhist countries as a religiously neutral technique suitable for those of all faiths, or none. An international Dhammadayada program was also started, held in Chinese and English, and the temple started to organize retreats in English language in Thailand and abroad.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{investigating}} the use of Multi Carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) techniques in variable bit-rate transmission over geo-stationary (GEO) <b>satellite</b> <b>channels</b> by means of realistic simulations. It is known by literature that MC-CDMA techniques are much more resilient with respect to multi-user interference effects in LEO <b>satellite</b> <b>channels</b> than singlecarrier DS/CDMA ones. Moreover, MC-CDMA exhibits a natural capability to deliver multirate services simply by assigning to each user a variable-cardinality set of subcarriers. The achieved simulation results clearly confirmed the expected improved robustness of MC-CDMA techniques transmitting multirate data streams also in GEO <b>satellite</b> <b>channels,</b> with respect to state-of-the-art DS/CDMA transceivers. 1...|$|R
