50|$|<b>Stoplogs</b> are {{hydraulic}} engineering control {{elements that are}} used in floodgates to adjust the water level or discharge in a river, canal, or reservoir. <b>Stoplogs</b> are sometimes confused with flashboards, as both elements are used in bulkhead or crest gates. <b>Stoplogs</b> are typically long rectangular timber beams or boards that are placed {{on top of each other}} and dropped into premade slots inside a weir, gate, or channel. Present day, the process of adding and removing <b>stoplogs</b> is not manual, but done with hydraulic stop log lifters and hoists. Since the height of the barrier can only be adjusted through the addition and removal of <b>stoplogs,</b> finding a lighter and stronger material other than wood or concrete became a more desirable choice. Other materials, including steel and composites, can be used as <b>stoplogs</b> as well. <b>Stoplogs</b> are designed to cut off or stop flow through a conduit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stoplogs</b> are {{frequently}} used to temporarily block flow through a spillway or canal during routine maintenance. At other times <b>stoplogs</b> {{can be used}} over longer periods of times, such as when a field is flooded and <b>stoplogs</b> are being used in smaller gates {{in order to control}} the depth of water in fields. The logs may be left in and adjusted during the entire time that the field is submerged.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stoplogs</b> are modular in nature, {{giving the}} {{operator}} of a gated structure {{the ability to}} control the water level in a channel by adding or removing individual <b>stoplogs.</b> A gate may make use of one or more logs. Each log is lowered horizontally into a space or bay between two grooved piers referred to as a stop log check. [...] In larger gate structures, there will be multiple bays in which <b>stoplogs</b> can be placed to better control the discharge through the structure.|$|E

50|$|Several {{efforts have}} been made to control lake levels in the last century. In 1964 the Mossy River Dam was {{constructed}} at Terin's Landing at the outlet of the lake. The ten bay concrete <b>stoplog</b> structure complete with a fish ladder is operated by the Province. The summer target since 1993 has been 854.8 feet (260.54 m). The dam can restrict the outflow when conditions are dry and levels low but the river limits the outflow when the lake is high.|$|R
40|$|The Bannister Federal Complex is {{bordered on}} the east by the Blue River and on the south by Indian Creek. After a flood in 1961 and several {{near-miss}} floods, flood protection has been installed. The protection consists of 2, 916 feet of concrete flood walls, 8, 769 feet of levee, five rolling gates, four <b>stoplog</b> gaps, one hinged pedestrian gate, and one sandbag gap. The flood walls are over 14 feet tall. Construction was started on August 3, 1992 and was completed in early 1995.

In 1994, the dam was inspected by engineers of Hydro-Québec, who found that the dam was [...] "in a rare state of dilapidation". [...] In 1999, the European Commission granted €9.4 million to Georgia for urgent repairs at the Enguri HES, including replacing the <b>stoplog</b> at the arch dam on the Georgian side and, refurbishing {{one of the five}} generators of the power station at the Abkhaz side. [...] In total, €116 million loans were granted by the EBRD, the European Union, the Japanese Government, KfW and Government of Georgia.

40|$|Based on the {{discussion}} of the multi-level intake application status of high dam reservoir, this paper takes the Jinping-I hydropower project reservoir in the Yalong River as an example, which is shaped by the highest 305 m high arch dam, and carries out the forecasting research on the reservoir temperature by numerical simulation and physical model testing. This paper studies the intake effect of withdrawing the surface warm water by the <b>stoplog</b> gates inlets and verifies the reliability of the mathematical model by comparative analysis. The results show that for a high dam hydropower station, taking the appropriate multi-level intake measure can withdraw the surface warm water in the spawning season and provide a favorable environment for the fish reproduction. Innovative technical ideas and implementation scheme are adopted in this research. It can provide technical reference for the solutions of similar problems in the future and it also has important engineering significance on the research of water temperature in large deep reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|The Webber Pond dam is a concrete, masonry, and earthen {{structure}} {{located on}} Sevenmile Stream at the outlet of Webber Pond in Vassalboro, Maine. The dam {{is owned by}} the Webber Pond Asociation and is adjacent to a boat launch and beach owned by the Town of Vassalboro. Recently an Alaskan Steeppass fish ladder and sorting pool were installed at the dam, along with a new mechanical <b>stoplog</b> system at the pond outlet. Prior to the installation of the fish ladder and sorting pool the dam impeded the passage of upstream migrating fish such as alewives. Before the fishway was installed the Maine Department of Marine, Resources (MDMR) had been netting adult alewives {{at the base of the}} dam and lifting them over the dam into the pond for spawning and phosphorous sequestration. The MDMR wanted to improve upstream fish passage into Webber Pond and include a means of checking and sorting fish before they were allowed to pass into the lake. The new fishway provides a means for sorting and harvesting fish, acceptable hydraulics (velocity, angle of approach and turbulence) at the fish ladder entrance, access for cleaning the fish passage of debris, and the protection of the existing bridge foundation located downstream of the dam. The related improvements to the gate structure at the outlet of Webber Pond also provides safe and downstream passage for out migrating alewives and the ability to maintain lake levels while regulating downstream flow...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{engineers}} {{will use}} these two terms interchangeably by calling a stoplog a flashboard. This {{is done in}} part because unlike many other types of bulkhead gates that are one continuous unit, both <b>stoplogs</b> and flashboards are modular and can be easily designed to hold back different amounts of water. However, most engineering texts and design firms differentiate between the two structures. <b>Stoplogs</b> are specialized bulkheads that are dropped into premade slots or guides in a channel or control structure, while flashboards are bulkheads that are placed on the crest or top of a channel wall or control structure. Flashboards are sometimes designed to break away under high flow conditions and thus to provide only a temporary diversion. In contrast, <b>stoplogs</b> are intended to be reused, and failure of a stoplog will result in an uncontrolled flow through a gate.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{the boards}} used are {{subjected}} to high flow conditions. As individual <b>stoplogs</b> begin to age they are replaced. Typically small amounts of water will leak between individual logs.|$|E
5000|$|Savage Rapids Dam {{consisted}} of a 16-bay spillway section and a hydraulic-driven pumping plant section at the right abutment. The maximum height of the spillway section is about 39 ft. The first seven bays at the right end of the dam were multiple arches with buttresses on 25 ft centers. The remaining nine bays have a concrete gravity section below the gates. Spillway control was originally provided by 16 wooden-faced radial gates, each 23 ft wide and 10 ft high. Later, radial gates were replaced with metal <b>stoplogs,</b> and one double-gated river outlet with a capacity of [...] was installed {{at the center of}} the dam.

40|$|The {{impact of}} El Nino has been {{predicted}} until November 2015, this condition causes {{most of the}} rice fields in the swampy areas experiencing drought. Generally under normal conditions of rice cultivation in this area {{does not have a}} water shortage problem. Field studies was conducted in the area of swampy areas in Musi II Palembang. Rice cultivation was done at June. The results show a decline in rice production which in normal conditions reaches 5 - 6 tonnes / ha but currently only produce an average 2. 5 - 3. 0 tonnes / ha. A decline in rice production is due to water stress in the generative period. Field studies showed farmers do not make the process of adaptation of water management technologies. Drainege system is still open so that the water is so easily lost towards the swampy lowland in the mid and later. Adaptation technology with water retention systems and improving drainage channels would increase water status in the soil. It has been tested on swamp reclaimed areas at Kumpeh Muara Jambi. The drainage system is controlled by containment models using <b>stoplog</b> gate with a height of 50 cm surveillance, to maintain the ground water level in the land at optimum level under 50 - 100 cm below the soil surface.

40|$|None supplied. From summary: The pass {{componentry}} {{and location}} on the structure which had been determined prior to the 1990 / 91 elver season, was installed in early 1991. Between {{the end of this}} season and the 1991 / 92 season refinements to the pass were made to both security and function. Fluctuating lake levels, along with installation of automation equipment showed the demand for a second water supply to combat loss of water. The entry to the pass at the tailrace on the left hand side of the power house has attracted elvers. Some elvers also climb the spillway step and wall and continue on up the pass. However, elvers still gather at the transformer cooling water outlet on the right bank, and also on the draft tube <b>stoplog</b> platform. Elvers have no difficulty in climbing the troughs and pipes and drainage channels, and hence the pass is readily passable to these juvenile fish, and is working as intended. The success overall will be to have the pass without competition from the other collection points around the station. Several hundred climbing Galaxiid juveniles (whitebait) and at least 15, 000 elvers used the pass in the summer of 1991 / 92. The elver migration began in mid January 1992, peaked on the full moon in January and ended soon after new moon in early March. Maximum migration occurred around midnight and was lowest during daylight hours. The number of elvers using the pass could have been several fold higher had the water supply to the pass been reliable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{project area}} and it {{surrounding}} region {{has been a}} drought prone area since quite a long time. The {{majority of the population}} in this region lives in villages where agriculture is the main source of income. In order to utilize the river water to the possible extent and distributing the same among all the areas of the state, these projects were proposed. This Lift Irrigation Scheme was proposed in to irrigate an ayacut of 1. 23 lakh acres and to supply drinking water to the enroute villages [6]. Background / Literature The tunnel will take off from the canal end and meet the surge pool on the other end. The tunnel will be 5. 6 m in diameter D shaped and will be laid in a slope of about 1 in 2100. The tunnel is designed for a flow of 49. 60 m 3 /s and it will be concrete lined and will be designed as a gravity tunnel. The tunnel will have a trash rack and <b>stoplog</b> facility at its mouth. Tunnel Lining- Concrete linings required for tunnels, shafts, or other underground structures are designed to meet functional criteria for water tightness, hydraulic smoothness, durability, strength, appearance, and internal loads. The lining must also be designed for interaction with the surrounding rock mass [7] and the hydrologic regime in the rock and consider constructability and economy. Tunnels and shafts in rock are furnished with a final lining. The options for final lining include the following[3]: Unreinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete...|$|R
50|$|Smaller <b>stoplogs</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as handstops. Handstops are used in smaller gated structures, such as irrigation delivery ditches or the gates used to control water depth in larger submerged fields (such as rice fields).

50|$|A typical set of {{outlet works}} begins in an intake structure, {{which is usually}} a canal or intake tower. A {{regulating}} gate or valve controls water flow into the pipes of the outlet works, which discharge downstream into a stilling basin or directly into the river.The inlets of the outlet works may consist of either gates or valves, or be composed of a more primitive system of <b>stoplogs.</b> Inlets may also contain a series of other devices for different purposes, including trash racks and fish screens.|$|E
40|$|In 2009, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{evaluated}} the Touchet Consolidated Facility {{to determine if}} it is designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to effectively provide juvenile salmonids with safe passage past the diversion {{and back to the}} Touchet River. Completed in 2008, the Touchet Consolidated Facility combined two irrigation diversions with an existing intake for the Touchet Acclimation Facility. The consolidated facility includes a separate fish screen and intake for each user, a pool and chute fishway, and an adult fish trap. The fish screens portions of the facility were evaluated on April 20, 2009, using underwater videography, acoustic Doppler velocimeter measurements, and visual observations while water was diverted to the acclimation facility alone and again as water was diverted to the irrigation system and pond together. The facility is in good condition and is well maintained, although water velocities within the site do not meet the criteria set by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Approach velocities above 0. 4 ft/s at the upstream end of the facility and decreases in sweep velocity toward the bypass are likely caused by the proximity of the upstream screen to the spill over <b>stoplogs</b> that control flow at the upstream end of the forebay. We recommend working with Touchet Acclimation Facility staff to try different configurations and heights of forebay <b>stoplogs</b> while PNNL staff measure water velocities, allowing real-time monitoring of changes in approach and sweep velocities resulting from the configuration changes. It may be possible to bring approach and sweep velocities more in line with the NMFS criteria for juvenile fish screens. We also recommend evaluating the facility later in the year when river levels are low and the irrigation district is the only water user. During the site visit, it was noted that the upstream end of the fishway has relatively closely spaced louvers that point downstream. During higher river levels such as on April 20, the orientation of the louvers causes a headloss of up to 1 ft or more. Fish must maneuver through this hydraulic jump and between the louvers. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is considering alternatives to this configuration; if needed, we would be available to offer technical assistance...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{was asked}} by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation to provide {{additional}} velocity measurements at Gleed fish screens site to support decisions on mitigating extreme flow fluctuations near the screens. The site consistently has had extreme water velocities in places and a strong back eddy at the downstream end in spring and summer. With the help of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife staff, we measured the effects of different stoplog configurations behind the screens in May and July 2007. Protective metal plates in front of the trash racks were confirmed to be the cause of uneven and extreme water flow past the vertical traveling screens. <b>Stoplogs</b> were not sufficient to significantly reduce the effect of those metal plates on water velocities past and through the site. We provide a few suggestions including making it easier to raise and lower the metal plates and then adjusting them more often, constructing a new trash rack across the diversion entrance, and raising the control gate {{at the end of the}} site as long as possible in spring and during flood events...|$|E

40|$|Maintenance, remediation, and {{inspection}} of large spillway gates are best {{performed in a}} dry, dewatered state due to reduced overall cost, worker safety, and improved work quality. Provision for gate dewatering has become a key design consideration for new spillways. Unfortunately, many existing spillways were not originally constructed with gate dewatering capabilities. Therefore, maintenance {{and inspection}} work has often been scheduled during planned drawdowns or seasonally low reservoir levels. However, for operators of hydroelectric, flood control, water supply, and multi-purpose dams, artificial drawdowns can significantly impact operations, flood protection, downstream habitat, and revenue generation. Aging gates deteriorate and require significant maintenance, rehabilitation, and increased inspection. As dams age and gates deteriorate and require maintenance and rehabilitation, owners are increasingly seeking methods to dewater gate bays while maintaining operational pool levels using maintenance closure structures, such as bulkheads, <b>stoplogs,</b> cofferdams, and caissons. Designing these structures is challenging. This paper summarizes the findings from a worldwide review of the current state-of-the-practice for various types of maintenance closure structures in use for dewatering large spillway gates. Examples are provided for each maintenance closure type identified. The information, {{presented in this paper}} will be of benefit to those involved with spillways and dams, especially owners, engineers, and researchers seeking better, safer, inexpensive, and more durable maintenance closure structures that can be installed quickly...|$|E
