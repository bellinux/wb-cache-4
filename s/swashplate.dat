25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), <b>swashplate</b> (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|E
25|$|The Hughes 269 was {{designed}} with a fully articulated, three-blade main rotor, and a two-blade tail rotor that would remain as distinctive characteristics {{of all its}} variants. It also has shock absorber-damped, skid-type landing gear. The flight controls are directly linked to the <b>swashplate</b> of the helicopter {{so there are no}} hydraulic systems in the 269. There are generally two sets of controls, although this was optional on the civil 269A. For three-seat aircraft, the middle collective control stick is removable and a seat cushion can be put in its place for the third passenger.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} at Burbank, the CL-475 {{was taken}} to Rosamond Lake on Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert for testing. It was first flown on 2 November 1959, but the pilot reported severe vibrations. For six months, Lockheed experimented with three and four-bladed wooden rotors, but stability was finally achieved by using metal blades in a three-blade configuration {{and the addition of}} a gyroscopic control ring connected directly to the <b>swashplate.</b> In the mid-1960s, the helicopter was test flown by a number of government and military agencies and the military. The stability offered by the rigid rotor control system made the helicopter easy to fly, and the lessons learned from the CL-475 rigid rotor were later used to develop the XH-51 and AH-56A Cheyenne.|$|E

50|$|Modern bismuth bronzes on {{the market}} are {{developed}} to hold similar properties to leaded bronzes, {{and many of them}} bear nearly identical mechanical properties to common leaded alloys, such as machinability and high thermal conductivity. They also have a high lubricity, which makes them ideal for outer layers in machine parts which are subject to wear such as bearings and <b>swashplates.</b> Bismuth-tin bronze is not easily corrosive to water; preliminary bismuth is not easily oxidized.|$|R
500|$|The V-22 has triple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} {{flight control}} systems, which included computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the nacelles pointing {{straight up in}} conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional <b>swashplate</b> at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; the lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the [...] "80 Jump" [...] orientation with the nacelles at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The control systems automate and simplify {{to the extent that}} the V-22 can hover in low wind with no hands on the controls. According to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter ones as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{output of}} a Stirling {{tends to be}} {{constant}} and to adjust it can sometimes require careful design and additional mechanisms. Typically, changes in output are achieved by varying the displacement of the engine (often through use of a <b>swashplate</b> crankshaft arrangement), or by changing the quantity of working fluid, or by altering the piston/displacer phase angle, {{or in some cases}} simply by altering the engine load. This property is less of a drawback in hybrid electric propulsion or [...] "base load" [...] utility generation where constant power output is actually desirable.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 2000, a V-22 had {{a flight}} control error and crashed near Jacksonville, North Carolina, killing all four aboard. [...] A vibration-induced [...] from an {{adjacent}} wiring bundle caused a leak in the hydraulic line which fed the primary side of the <b>swashplate</b> actuators {{to the right side}} rotor blade controls. [...] The leak caused a Primary Flight Control System (PFCS) alert. [...] A previously undiscovered error in the aircraft's control software caused it to decelerate in response to each of the pilot's eight attempts to reset the software {{as a result of the}} PFCS alert. The uncontrollable aircraft fell [...] and crashed in a forest. [...] The wiring harnesses and hydraulic line routing in the nacelles were subsequently modified. [...] This caused the Marine Corps to ground its fleet of eight V-22s, the second grounding in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|A {{principal}} {{disadvantage of}} the coaxial rotor design is the increased mechanical {{complexity of the}} rotor hub. The linkages and <b>swashplates</b> for two rotor systems need to be assembled atop the mast, which is more complex {{because of the need}} to drive two rotors in opposite directions. Because of the greater number of moving parts and complexity, the coaxial rotor system is more prone to mechanical faults and possible failure. Coaxial helicopters are also more prone to the [...] "whipping" [...] of blades and blade self-collision according to critics.|$|R
5000|$|At AgustaWestland and its partner companies, a {{total of}} two dozen {{full-time}} engineers worked on the project in a skunkworks-style of development at AgustaWestland’s Cascina Costa facility in Italy. According to Wang, those appointed to the team were handpicked, and were typically young and passionate; each member had a specific specialty in one area. The team quickly decided that, instead of pursuing an electric-powered but otherwise conventional airplane or helicopter, a more radical approach would be adopted: A twin-rotor electric tiltrotor, lacking any transmission or <b>swashplates.</b> Wang summarised the team's philosophy as [...] "Anything that is bordline impossible, we want to do".|$|R
50|$|The <b>swashplate</b> {{consists}} of two main parts: a stationary <b>swashplate</b> and a rotating <b>swashplate.</b> The stationary (outer) <b>swashplate</b> is mounted on the main rotor mast and {{is connected to the}} cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) <b>swashplate</b> is mounted to the stationary <b>swashplate</b> by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main rotor mast. An anti-rotation link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer <b>swashplate</b> typically has an anti-rotation slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both swashplates tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating <b>swashplate</b> is connected to the pitch horns by the pitch links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) <b>swashplate</b> are the hexapod and the universal joint.Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters.|$|E

25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered hydraulic boosters transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the <b>swashplates</b> directly.|$|R
50|$|Coaxial rotors are {{a pair of}} rotors mounted {{one above}} {{the other on the}} same shaft and turning in {{opposite}} directions. The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that, in forward flight, the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other, eliminating one of the key effects of dissymmetry of lift: retreating blade stall. However, other design considerations plague coaxial rotors. There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and <b>swashplates</b> for two rotor systems. Also, because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions, the mast is more complex, and control linkages for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system.|$|R
2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a fan cooled [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers. The control column alters cyclic pitch via a pair of <b>swashplates</b> and pedals make torque corrections and control yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors. A mechanical inertial governor limited rotor accelerations; the pilot could increase the collective pitch over that set by the governor but not below it, emergencies apart.|$|R
50|$|Older model {{helicopters}} use three independent servos {{to manipulate}} the <b>swashplate.</b> The elevator servo is used to tilt the <b>swashplate</b> forward and aft (longitudinal cyclic), varying the aircraft's pitch. The aileron servo is used to tilt the <b>swashplate</b> left and right (lateral cyclic), varying the aircraft's roll. The collective pitch servo raises and lowers the entire <b>swashplate,</b> varying the collective, and hence the pitch of all the rotor blades collectively. An intermediate mechanical mixing system is used to transfer the control inputs from the servos to the <b>swashplate,</b> therefore the name of mechanical CCPM (mCCPM). This requires an elaborate system of control rods and levers, which often contains many ball bearings.|$|E
50|$|Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars {{are flat}} plates that can scan up to sixty degrees in any {{direction}} from directly ahead of them. By mounting an AESA radar on a <b>swashplate,</b> the <b>swashplate</b> angle {{is added to the}} electronic scan angle. The typical <b>swashplate</b> angle chosen for this application is 40 degrees so the radar can scan a total angle of 200 degrees out of 360.|$|E
50|$|The <b>swashplate</b> engine uses a <b>swashplate</b> {{in place}} of a {{crankshaft}} to translate the motion of a piston into rotary motion. Internal combustion engines and Stirling engines have been built using this mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Abeille was {{directed}} by René Dorand at the helicopter division of SNCAC. An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the hub, tapered strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of <b>swashplates</b> and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. Forward tilt of the rotor shafts was automatically linked to forward speed. A single lever controlled both the collective pitch and the throttle through an electrical link. The Abeille was powered by a [...] Renault 12S, an inverted, liquid-cooled V-12 engine.|$|R

It was put through many hours of powered ground checks.

Two additional static ground test articles underwent structural testing at the company's main manufacturing plant in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|R

50|$|Other <b>swashplate</b> {{and control}} design have been used. For instance, Kaman Aircraft {{helicopters}} {{do not use}} a traditional <b>swashplate</b> and instead operate servo flaps on the rotor blades to adjust the angle of attack of the blades.|$|E
50|$|A <b>swashplate</b> {{controls}} the collective and cyclic {{pitch of the}} main blades. The <b>swashplate</b> moves up and down, along the main shaft, to change the pitch of both blades. This causes the helicopter to push air downward or upward, depending on the angle of attack. The <b>swashplate</b> can also change its angle to move the blades angle forwards or backwards, or left and right, to make the helicopter move in those directions.|$|E
50|$|To {{control the}} {{collective}} {{pitch of the}} main rotor blades, the entire <b>swashplate</b> must be moved up or down along its axis without changing {{the orientation of the}} cyclic controls. Conventionally, the entire <b>swashplate</b> is moved along the mainshaft by a separate actuator. However, some newer model helicopters remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire <b>swashplate.</b> This is called cyclic/collective pitch mixing.|$|E
50|$|A common {{variable}} displacement pump used in vehicle technology is the axial piston pump. This pump has several pistons in cylinders arranged {{parallel to each other}} and rotating around a central shaft. A <b>swashplate</b> at one end is connected to the pistons. As the pistons rotate, the angle of the plate causes them to move in and out of their cylinders. A rotary valve at the opposite end from the <b>swashplate</b> alternately connects each cylinder to the fluid supply and delivery lines. By changing the angle of the <b>swashplate,</b> the stroke of the pistons can be varied continuously. If the <b>swashplate</b> is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, no fluid will flow. If it is at a sharp angle, a large volume of fluid will be pumped. Some pumps allow the <b>swashplate</b> to be moved in both directions from the zero position, pumping fluid in either direction without reversing the rotation of the pump.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>swashplate</b> is {{a device}} that {{translates}} input via the helicopter flight controls into motion of the main rotor blades. Because the main rotor blades are spinning, the <b>swashplate</b> is used to transmit three of the pilot's commands from the non-rotating fuselage to the rotating rotor hub and mainblades.|$|E
50|$|Axial piston pump: many {{designed}} with a variable displacement mechanism, to vary output flow for automatic control of pressure. There are various axial piston pump designs, including <b>swashplate</b> (sometimes {{referred to as}} a valveplate pump) and checkball (sometimes {{referred to as a}} wobble plate pump). The most common is the <b>swashplate</b> pump. A variable-angle <b>swashplate</b> causes the pistons to reciprocate a greater or lesser distance per rotation, allowing output flow rate and pressure to be varied (greater displacement angle causes higher flow rate, lower pressure, and vice versa).|$|E
