From 1991, economic liberalisation took place in India, and the industry took full advantage of this and cheaper labour costs of production. In 1993, a monumental Internal <b>Sales</b> <b>Quota</b> (ISQ) made {{the first step in}} liberalising the coffee industry by entitling coffee farmers to sell 30% of their production within India. This was further amended in 1994 when the Free Sale Quota (FSQ) permitted large and small scale growers to sell between 70% and 100% of their coffee either domestically or internationally. A final amendment in September 1996 saw the liberalisation of coffee for all growers in the country and a freedom to sell their produce wherever they wished.|$|E

40|$|Summary Companies {{that rely}} on Management By Objectives systems {{typically}} encounter two types of difficulty: objectives may be too difficult to attain, especially when there is top-down pressure; and reference to objectives defined {{at the start of}} the year may be a questionable basis for year-end performance evaluation when managers' results have been affected by unforeseen events. Our purpose is to examine how MBO is used when managers simultaneously face high pressure to achieve objectives and high environmental uncertainty. Based on a study of fourteen sales executives, this article identifies two types of organizational adjustments brought into play by executives to cope with this type of situation: a more collective management approach to ensure achievement of overall corporate objectives, and development of close interpersonal relationships that build mutual trust between sales executives and their staff. <b>Sales</b> executives <b>Sales</b> <b>quotas</b> <b>Sales</b> management Shareholder pressure Management by objectives Risk sharing Leadership...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} call for managers in the Nigerian insurance industry to espouse higher level of ethical behaviour to earn the trust of customers, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders. Arguably, this will enhance market penetration, increase patronage and higher level of profit. Theoretically however, ethical behaviour can be institutionalized in organizations if the top management support ethical behaviour through punishment and reward (high ethical climate). Other than corporate ethical values, managers’ beliefs about the rightness and wrongness of an action in a particular situation {{could also be a}} function of his/her personal moral philosophy. With respect to financial services, one aspect of marketing which have been empirically shown to have influence ethical judgement and behaviours of managers is <b>sales</b> <b>quotas.</b> When salespersons are assigned higher <b>sales</b> <b>quotas,</b> which are perceived as difficult, the tendency to engage in unethical behaviour to achieve this target becomes higher. In this study, we assess and extend the theoretical relationship between moral judgement of salespersons and perceived quota difficulty in the insurance industry. The study also explores the moderating effects of salesperson’s ethical values (idealism and relativism), corporate ethical climate, and quota failure consequences on the proposed relationship. With a structured questionnaire, data was collected from respondents in the target industry through a multi-stage sampling strategy.

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of public monopolies has often generated {{a decrease in}} quality and reliability of service. Governments have coped with this issue by imposing Minimum Quality Standards (MQS) to entrants but a recent stream of literature has raised concerns about the inadequacy of this instrument. We propose an alternative, a <b>sales</b> <b>quota</b> to be imposed on the incumbent, to overcome the competition effects that tend to generate quality downgrading. In our model an entrant invests into quality because the limit on the incumbent sales eliminates price wars and enable him (as well as the incumbent) to recoup investments in quality. The maximal welfare is obtained when the <b>sales</b> <b>quota</b> is xed at 71 % of the initial market. Laisser-faire leads to entrant s differentiation and a welfare of 91, 6 % of the Pareto optimum while our solution leads to a welfare of 99, 4 %.

50|$|The {{boards and}} {{commission}} {{use a variety}} of measures to achieve their broad purposes. Among these measures are import restrictions, such as border controls and entry controls—some of which may be bilaterally negotiated—and variable import duties. If import restrictions are not sufficient to maintain prices because of excess production, the surplus is exported at subsidized prices (with the subsidies usually coming from federal or provincial authorities). Authorities also apply production controls, such as <b>sales</b> <b>quotas</b> or limits, on the size and density of livestock holdings. Quotas exist for many different products, with the quotas usually fixed on the basis of past production. Price and quality controls and limits also exist, especially with respect to different prices for different grades of wheat or milk. The government can also pay direct income supplements, but these payments are generally restricted to certain mountain farming zones and other equally disadvantaged areas. Subsidies are mainly paid by the federal government but may in some instances be paid by provincial governments.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} U. S. sugar {{manufacturing}} cartel {{that was created}} during the New Deal. This was a legal-cartel that lasted 40 years (1934 - 74). As a legal-cartel, the industry was assured widespread adherence to domestic and import <b>sales</b> <b>quotas</b> (given it had access to government enforcement powers). But it also meant accepting government-sponsored cartel-provisions. These provisions significantly distorted production at each factory and also where the industry was located. These distortions were reflected in, for example, a declining industry recovery rate, that is, the pounds of white sugar produced per ton of beets. It declined from about 310 pounds in 1934 to 240 pounds in 1974. The cartel provisions also distorted the location of industry. For example, it kept production in California and the Far West.
