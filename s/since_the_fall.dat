5|$|By 1959 {{overcrowding}} as {{a result}} of the post-World War II baby boom forced the construction of a third school building. Land was purchased in 1960 at the former site of Hastings Pond, which had been filled in during construction of Interstate 94 through Saint Paul, and the building was completed at a cost of $3,663,529.78. Johnson High School has been located at the third school building <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1963.|$|E

5000|$|The bottom {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> {{can be seen}} quite easily by looking upstream into the canyon from Highway 3. [...] The uppermost portions are hidden from that point <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> bend about 45 degrees shortly below the first drop, {{and as a result}} can only be viewed {{from the edge of the}} canyon on the north side of the river.|$|R
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of {{communism}} many privately funded {{institutions of higher}} educations have been founded and their number is still increasing. Currently Białystok is home to one principal public university (University of Białystok) and two other public specialist universities (Białystok Technical University and Medical University of Białystok). Some institutions, such as Musical Academy in Białystok, are branches of their parent institutions in other cities, usually in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideas that}} {{underpin}} our modern world–meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on–were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them {{he added a}} rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Roman Empire.|$|E

30|$|The {{described}} {{procedure was}} applied to achieve the localization of subsequent impacts recorded during 57 rockfall simulations extracted from a database of 95 throws. Some of the throws have been discarded <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> failed (<b>the</b> blocks immediately stopped) or the energy involved was too low and did not produce an event {{large enough to be}} detected by all stations.|$|R
50|$|Tollemache {{was carried}} {{back towards the}} {{squadron}} {{by one of the}} few longboats still afloat. The French counter-attack repulsed the enemy back to the sea, and the landing troops were unable to retreat further <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> tide had left the longboats high and dry. Only ten of these boats were able to rejoin the rest of the English fleet.|$|R
5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from {{the sinking of}} the battleship Bismarck, the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Crete.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E
50|$|Lehamite <b>Falls</b> is {{probably}} <b>the</b> most underappreciated significant waterfall in Yosemite National Park, simply because it's located almost {{right next to}} Yosemite Falls, so people don't usually {{pay any attention to}} it. It is also little known <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> appear only in the early spring or after a heavy rainfall. It {{is one of the few}} features in the park that has retained its original Ahwaneechee name.|$|R
50|$|Then, in 1681, the {{alliance}} of VOC and Amangkurat II forced Pangeran Puger, his younger brother, who styled himself Susuhunan ing Alaga when he seized the throne, to relinquish it. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> Plered was considered inauspicious, Amangkurat II moved {{the capital to}} Kartasura {{in the land of}} Pajang (the northern part of the stretch of land between Mount Merapi and Mount Lawu, the southern part being Mataram).|$|R

5|$|By 2002 Sarumpaet had {{returned}} to Indonesia, where she debuted a stageplay entitled Alia, Luka Serambi Mekah (Alia, Wound of Serambi Mekah) at Ismail Marzuki Park in Jakarta; it was her first stageplay <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Suharto. Dealing with Indonesian military operations in Aceh, the play was later performed in five other cities. In December 2002 it {{was scheduled to be}} broadcast on TVRI in commemoration of Human Rights Day, but pulled at the last minute due to intervention from the military. In 2001, she and her troupe put on Dalam Kegelapan Panjang (In a Long Darkness), which dealt with the children of victims of the anti-communist purges of 1965–1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play {{an essential role in}} remaking the country into an international power.|$|E

The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch. The civil war of 69 had made it abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Siad Barre's government in January 1991, {{there had been no}} central government in Somalia until the establishment of the Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E
5|$|The cellar of the {{building}} contained a barber's shop, a grocery store and a butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent. When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to sell off the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} to convert it into a hotel. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful. As of 2009, the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation.|$|E
5|$|The first commercially {{released}} domestic {{feature film}} {{to deal with}} the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers– although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Suharto in 1998, such use of the film has become less common. Although the film's artistic aspects remain well-received, its misrepresentation of history has been criticised.|$|E

This time lag permitted a more definitive epidemiological reassessment than had been possible before. The extent of seasonal variation from 1992 - 5 fell by about half, occurring mainly as a single step down in 1992. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> was relatively greater in winter than in summer. Before 1992 the extent of seasonal variation (amplitude) was greater in those age ⩾ 5 months compared with those aged ⩽ 4 months. <b>Since</b> 1992 <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> in incidence and amplitude have been greater in the younger group, suggesting that SIDS deaths in younger and older babies may have different causes. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{reality of}} Domitian's autocracy was further {{highlighted}} by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of {{time away from the}} capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
