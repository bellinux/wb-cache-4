We mainly use a plane mirror to make the measuring light reflect and diffract between the mirror and grating scale for several times. According to the grating Doppler shift, the more times that measuring light diffracted, the higher optical subdivision can be obtained. As an example, a grating interferometer with an optical <b>subdivision</b> <b>factor</b> of 1 / 12 is designed.

40|$|Displacement laser interferometers and grating interferometers are {{two main}} {{apparatus}} for the micron-nanometer displacement measurement over a long range. However, the laser interferometers, whose measuring scale {{is based on the}} wavelength, are very sensitive to the environment. On the contrast, the grating interferometers change the measuring scale from wavelength to grating period, which is much stable for the measurement results. But the resolution of grating interferometer is usually lower than that of laser interferometer. Therefore, further investigation is needed to improve the performance of grating interferometer. As we known, the optical subdivision is a main factor that affects the measurement resolution. In this paper, a grating interferometer with high optical subdivision is presented based on the Littrow configuration. We mainly use right angle prisms accompanied with plane mirrors to make the measuring lights diffracted by the grating scale for many times. An optical <b>subdivision</b> <b>factor</b> of 1 / 24 can be obtained by this technique. A main difficulty of this technique is that the grating scale should be with high diffraction efficiency. Fortunately, the measuring light is incident on the grating scale at the Littrow angle, the grating scale can be designed with very high efficiency easily in this condition. Compared with traditional grating interferometers, this kind of grating interferometer can greatly increase the measuring resolution and accuracy, which could be widely used in nanometer-scale fabrications and measurements...|$|E
40|$|In this {{supplementary}} material, {{we provide}} a more comprehensive treatment of the various technical aspects involved in our approach, along with some extensions. In particular, we show how to extend our construction (proposed in the original paper) to arbitrary subdivision factors λ and polyhex sizes m, and discuss in greater detail why we settled on our particular choices of λ = 37 and m = 3 based on considerations including memory size and spectral quality. 1 Tiling Construction With Randomized Boundaries Summary: In this section, we provide formal details on the boundary randomization process. We first generalize the construction presented in our original paper to a large set of subdivision factors λ. Then, we demonstrate conditions on edge modifiers sufficient to ensure topologically consistent perturbations (Lemma 1). Finally, we detail the combinatorics of edge modifiers {{with respect to the}} desired <b>subdivision</b> <b>factor</b> (Lemma 2). a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 c 0 c 1 c 2 b 0 b 1 b 2 a 0 a 0 a 0 a 1 a 1 a 2 c 0 c 0 c 0 c 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 0 b 0 b 0 b 3 (a) (b) hi hj hk (c) Figure 1 : Construction of the regular tiling system: (a) hexagon sequences A, B and C starting from a given origin point (in gray) for n = { 1, 2, 3, 4 } (from left to right).

40|$|This report {{presents}} a particular implementation, and experiments on the Dividing - Cubes algorithm whose {{the aim is}} to extract and display an iso-surface from a three-dimensional (3 D) medical image. The regular subdivision of the voxels allows the projection of a subdivided voxel, on the raster image, to be at most equal {{to the size of a}} pixel. We optimize the subdivision parameters to get a compromise between a good representation of the image and a minimization of the memory space. Then, we exhibit a complexity model for discrete surfaces obtained by regular subdivisions of cells. We use it for estimating the number of points that will be generated by the Dividing-Cubes algorithm to represent the surface of 3 D medical objects. Under the assumption that surfaces have uniform orientations in the space, and can be locally be assimilated to planes, we show that the average number of points is a quadratic function of the <b>subdivision</b> <b>factors.</b> We give analytical expressions of the coeffici [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Taylor model [8] {{is one of}} the {{inclusion}} functions available to compute the range enclosures. It has the property of (m + 1) th convergence order, where, m is the order of the Taylor model used. It computes a high order polynomial approximation to a multivariate Taylor expansion, with a remainder term that rigorously bound the approximation error. The sharper bounds on the enclosures computed using the Taylor model can be obtained either by successively partitioning the domain x using suitable <b>subdivision</b> <b>factors,</b> or by increasing the convergence rate of the Taylor model using higher order Taylor models. However, higher order Taylor forms require higher degrees of the polynomial part, which in turn require more computational effort and more memory. This is the major drawback of increasing the order m of Taylor models for obtaining range enclosures with higher order convergence rates. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these drawbacks by using a lower order Taylor model, and then using extrapolation to accelerate the convergence process of the sequences generated with the lower order Taylor model. The effectiveness of all the proposed algorithms is tested on various multivariate examples and compared with the conventional methods. The test results show that the proposed extrapolation-based methods offer considerable speed improvements over the conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between parasitic infections, environmental and living conditions, and health outcomes were studied in subdivisions of lower (LSES) and higher (HSES) socio-economic status Lubumbashi, Zaire. The two LSES subdivisions had higher prevalences of Plasmodium infection and {{higher rates of}} stunting, abdominal pain and low packed cell volume (PCV) than the HSES subdivision. The prevalence and intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura {{was not associated with}} socio-economic status. Maternal education {{was a significant predictor of}} A. lumbricoides intensity in both LSES and HSES <b>subdivisions.</b> <b>Factors</b> related to poor sanitation were risk factors for A. lumbricoides in LSES subdivisions, whereas a high ratio of relatives to immediate family members per household predicted high intensity infection in the HSES subdivision. The risk of stunting was higher in children with A. lumbricoides, that of wasting was higher in children with A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura whereas the risk of kwashiorkor was high with T. trichiura but very reduced in those with A. lumbricoides. The four most common clinical conditions were diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and low PCV. Hookworm infection, T. trichiura infection, young age and residence in LSES subdivisions were determinants of diarrhea. T. trichiura infection, young age and living in a LSES <b>subdivision</b> were risk <b>factors</b> for abdominal pain. Plasmodium infection and young age were associated with fever. LSES was predictive of low PCV. No combination of parasites had antagonistic or synergistic effects on clinical indicators examined. Based on this study, it is suggested that one parasite will increase the risk of infection with another. Although maternal education should be improved in all subdivisions, attention to sanitation, crowding and diet in the LSES subdivisions, and to the role of relatives and visitors in parasite transmission in the HSES subdivision should be priorities...|$|R

METHODS [...] Apprentices attending a shipyard training school were assessed on six occasions from entry during their 17 th year to age 25 to 27; results for 114 such men were analysed. The measurements were of stature, body mass, fat free mass and body fat, thoracic dimensions, forced expiratory volume and indices of forced expiratory flow, total lung capacity, and its <b>subdivisions,</b> transfer <b>factor</b> and KCO. RESULTS [...] At best about half the variance in the final lung function could be accounted for with the concurrent reference variables. For each lung function index the proportion of explained variance was substantially increased by also including in the prediction equation the pre-employment lung function expressed in standard deviation units. CONCLUSION [...] Estimation of the longitudinal decline in lung function during adult life should be based on initial and final measurements of which the first should ideally be at age 25 but those at age 16 can be used instead: such measurements have long term value and should be preserved...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePopulation genetic {{structure}} and <b>subdivision</b> are key <b>factors</b> affecting {{the evolution of}} organisms. In this study, we analysed and compared the population genetic structure of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae over space and time in the Nianza Province, near Victoria Lake in Kenya. The parasites were collected from mosquitoes caught in six villages separated by up to 68 km in 2002 and 2003. A total of 545 oocysts were dissected from 122 infected mosquitoes and genotyped at seven microsatellite markers. Five hundred and forty-seven mosquitoes, both infected and uninfected, were genotyped at eight microsatellites. For the parasite and the vector, the analysis revealed no (or very little) genetic differentiation among villages. This {{may be explained by}} high local population sizes for the parasite and the mosquito. The small level of genetic differentiation observed between populations may explain the speed at which antimalarial drug resistance and insecticide resistance spread into the African continent...|$|R

Landslides are concentrated along the Caujerí scarp, but also in the coastal hills and in the northern part of the Baitiquirí area. There, the landslides have different characteristics and causative <b>factors.</b> <b>Subdivision</b> of the terrain into 603 terrain mapping units, individual homogeneous polygons, allowed for a more detailed characterization of the terrain than would be possible through conventional map-overlay of main factor maps. The boundaries of different landslide parts were surveyed by photo-interpretation, and landslides were described in the field from a detailed checklist, where information was collected related to landslide type, subtype, relative age, and depth. This data set enable us to generate a heuristic model, using multi-criteria analysis, which was successful in classifying the area into different hazard classes, which can be displayed either in ten more detailed or three generalized classes, depending on the user needs. Improvements in the method could be made if different weight maps were produced for different landslide types. The qualitative hazard assessment was converted into probabilistic values including event, spatial and temporal probabilities...|$|R

In this work, a state-based tumor response model was developed based on well-established radiobiological principles to evaluate the treatment response for various microenvironmental conditions. Clinically important phenomena, including the interplay between proliferation and hypoxia, were evaluated and the results suggest the existence of an optimal fractionation schedule depending on microenvironmental factors. Including the cell cycle effect into the model, the treatment efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy was explored. The evaluated efficacy was underestimated compared to the observed high local control rates, which implies alternative effects in the hypofractionated RT. Based on the clinically observed adverse outcome of high FDG uptake, possible FDG uptake mechanism was also explored, which was evaluated to be associated with metabolically-viable hypoxic cells. This mathematical framework can contribute as a useful tool in testing the common radiobiological assumptions with clinical data and generating hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Background To prevent {{secondary}} {{conditions and}} to improve and maintain health, regular physical activity is recommended as {{an important component of}} a health-promoting lifestyle for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, participation in physical activity is low in persons with SCI, especially in women. Objective The objective {{of this study is to}} identify (1) categories of functioning, the environment and personal factors that influence participation in physical activity in persons with SCI and (2) gender differences within identified factors. Methods An explorative qualitative study design using both focus groups and individual interviews based on a semi-structured interview guide was used. Statements were linked to categories or chapters of the four components of functioning (body structures, body functions, activities and participation) and of the environment included in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and a recently developed list of personal factors. An in-depth analysis of the statements was performed to identify relevant associations and gender differences. Results Twenty-six persons (13 female, 13 male) participated in the study. Sixty-seven categories and four chapters from all components of functioning and environmental factors included in the ICF and 33 <b>subdivisions</b> of personal <b>factors</b> were found to be associated with physical activity in persons with SCI. Gender differences could be assigned to areas of gender roles, social support, athletic identity, interests, and general behavioral patterns. Conclusion This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of participation in physical activity in persons with SCI and presents a first step toward the identification of gender differences. The results should be validated by further quantitative research. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Scitech Discovery Centre is a {{hands-on}} {{science and technology}} centre located in the city West Complex, West Perth. The centre contains over 160 interactive exhibits including a number of computer-based exhibits that cover topics not easily incorporated in standard interactive exhibits. The problem considered {{in this study was}} the observed low percentage of visitors completing the programmes at seven of these computer-based exhibits. The author used unobtrusive observation and survey methods of data collection, for 245 visitors, on sundays over a three month period. The study was to determine two things, firstly the holding power of the exhibits, and secondly, the characteristics that determine holding power. Holding power was defined as the percentage of visitors completing the programme. Analysis of the data showed a range of holding powers from 17 % to 77 % with further variations according to population <b>subdivisions.</b> The main <b>factors</b> found to determine the holding power of the exhibits were placed in two categories. Internal characteristics were those found within the exhibit and included screen design, programme design, level of interaction and input devices. External characteristics were those brought to the exhibit by the visitor or those already a part of the environment. They included visit timing, topic interest, and the age and gender of the visitors. It was not possible to identify a set of positive or negative characteristics relevant to all computer-based exhibits, but the findings lead to a set of recommendations for current exhibit modifications and guidelines for future exhibit development...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{discusses the}} application of two subdivision algorithms {{for the purpose of}} finding an optimal way of rendering smooth spherical surfaces. Subdivision algorithms are used on three dimensional models. These algorithms typically manipulate the original object to produce one that is more visually pleasing and more realistic to the object we are attempting to recreate. We applied two popular subdivision algorithms to some simple meshes to compare their outcomes. In this project we implemented some of these algorithms in order to gain some insight into how these algorithms differ {{in the way that they}} are transforming the input mesh. Our desired goal was to see if there is any basis for which we can say that one algorithm outperforms the other. Our comparison runs through several iterations of subdivision and compares their theses meshes visually. In comparing these meshes our desired visual outcome is a mesh that is more smooth or more spherical. Another metric we looked at was the number of faces being produced for each mesh. In addition, we compared the algorithms in terms of the time they took to perform subdivision. These metrics form the basis for our comparison of performance and we discuss the details of these further in this paper. In our results we found that the two algorithms we are comparing perform quite similarly on certain meshes with respect to the visual output and the time they take to perform subdivision. On meshes of different types however the algorithms might output visually distinguishable meshes upon repeated <b>subdivisions.</b> Finding what <b>factors</b> influence whether the algorithms perform similarly provides an avenue for future work...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evidence {{has been}} {{synthesized}} to determine hindering and facilitating {{factors associated with}} the work participation of adults with developmental dyslexia (DD), classified according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Methods: A systematic literature review has been performed. Two search strings {{were used to determine}} the population and the context of work. The ICF was expanded with two subdivisions: one that made the environmental factors more work-related and a <b>subdivision</b> of personal <b>factors.</b> For data extraction the method known as qualitative metasummary was used and the manifest frequency effect size (MFES) for each category in the ICF was calculated. Results: From 33 included studies 318 factors have been extracted and classified in the ICF. In the classification the frequency of occurrences and the consistency in direction (i. e., hindering or facilitating) have been made visible. The ICF categories with the highest MFES were mental functions with factors like feelings and emotions about dyslexia; activities like reading or writing/spelling; participation with factors like acquiring and keeping a job; social relationships at work where the attitudes and support of the employer and co-workers are important; working conditions with factors like the availability of assistive technology and accommodations on the job; and personal factors like self-disclosure and coping strategies. Conclusions: In the context of work DD affects nearly all domains of functioning, mostly in a negative way. Within each domain the impact of DD increases over the course of life. To overcome that negative influence, many forms of adaptation, compensation, or coping are mentioned. Also notable is the lack of positive attitudes toward DD of the participants with DD-with the exception of the attitudes of teachers with DD-as well as on the part of colleagues, supervisors, and employers...|$|R
