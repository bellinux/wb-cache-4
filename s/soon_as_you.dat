I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E

25|$|We {{have too}} many Jews in the towns. They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{get away from the}} frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from this or any other sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E

He remarks, [...] "there is something compelling about Black's strategy.

500|$|Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, {{fell behind}} academically. It {{was said that}} he [...] "could {{not bring himself to}} study for {{professional}} work" [...] after [...] "having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia". Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects to remind him of Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons. Horatio wrote to Tom about the latter's friends, the Djab wurrung: [...] "They told me to send you up to them as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> came back." ...|$|E
500|$|According to John Young, [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> enter Worlds End State Park, {{you hear}} it: the never-ending {{rush of the}} waters of Loyalsock Creek". The creek and its {{tributary}} Double Run have been designated as approved trout waters within the park by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. This means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season. Hunting is permitted on {{about half of the}} lands of Worlds End State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer and bears; however, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E

500|$|Through the story, Armstrong {{hoped to}} detail {{coming of age}} in America {{at the time of the}} album's release. While he {{considered}} their previous record heartfelt, he felt a more instinctual feeling to speak for the time period in which the album was released. He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{included}} known actors {{from the}} show such as David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner and William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man, {{as well as new}} actors and characters to the franchise. These included Martin Landau and Blythe Danner. The signing of these actors broke with what had become tradition for The X-Files. Carter had purposely cast virtually unknown actors for the television series, to make it more believable; [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> put in an actor whose face is very recognizable, you've got a situation that works against the reality of the show." [...] He saw creating the film as a chance to break this rule. He offered Glenne Headly the small role of a bartender. A fan of the show, she accepted enthusiastically.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{noted the}} genre's {{lack of a}} clear definition. Robert Loss {{acknowledges}} the challenges of defining [...] "grunge"; he states that one can recount stories from the grunge scene to try and explain it, but as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> try to define grunge this way, [...] "it slips out of your hand". Roy Shuker states that the term [...] "obscured a variety of styles." [...] Stetson states that grunge was not a movement, [...] "monolithic musical genre", or a way to react to 1980s-era metal pop; he calls the term a misnomer mostly based on hype. Shuker states that the [...] "'Seattle sound' became a marketing ploy for the music industry." [...] Stetson also states that prominent bands considered to be grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney and Hammerbox) all sound different. Mark Yarm, author of Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge, pointed out vast differences between grunge bands, with some being punk and others being metal-based.|$|E

500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the}} other possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please you may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." [...] After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{week after}} the {{official}} opening of the ride at Cedar Point, attraction reviewer Brian Krosnick of Theme Park Tourist submitted an online review {{saying that it was}} [...] "truly breathtaking". The review applauded [...] "the inclusion of on-ride audio and such an exemplary lighting package", commenting that it was [...] "more than anyone expected or could've asked for". Krosnick pointed out that, because of the location of the ride beside Lake Erie and the hot summers, the lights on the ride attract massive [...] "clouds" [...] of bugs. He felt the ride cycle might be too short for the type of ride, particularly the time spent at the top. On July 13, 2011, Nick Sim, also from Theme Park Tourist, reviewed the ride at Kings Island and made similar remarks. Los Angeles Times blogger Brady MacDonald complimented the [...] "impressive nighttime spectacular from anywhere in the park". He reported having thoroughly enjoyed the ride at Knott's Berry Farm and said that he would ride it every time he visited the park. Tom Sherer of the Sandusky Register praised Cedar Point's WindSeeker for having one of the best views of the park and commented that it [...] "isn't as extreme as a lot of people fear, unless you’re afraid of heights." [...] He criticized the name WindSeeker, pointing out that the ride closes in high winds. Another reviewer called the view from Knott's Berry Farm's version [...] "simply breathtaking" [...] and urged readers to [...] "get a ride on it as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can". The same reviewer, however, also criticized the choice of music, suggesting that the park should have used [...] "themes from more 'southwestern' films" [...] to fit with the overall theme of the Fiesta Village area. Members of the general public have also applauded the addition.|$|E

500|$|The G2's {{rear-facing}} {{camera was}} considered good for its class, with its processor contributing to quicker HDR photo processing than its competitors. The Verge remarked that despite LG having [...] "practically stole" [...] Samsung's camera design and modes, the G2's camera interface {{were among the}} better implementations of Android camera software due to its available options. However, its low-light photos {{and some of its}} other modes were panned for not being as good as those of other devices such as the Nokia Lumia 920 and HTC One. In a photography-focused review by Digital Photography Review, the optical image stabilization system was praised for helping maintain good levels of exposure, and well-lit photos were found to have a decent level of detail, noting that its lens was [...] "sharp pretty much all across the frame and free of chromatic aberrations." [...] However, it was noted that [...] "as the light gets dimmer and in the ISO starts to increase", the device began to suffer from [...] "very heavy-handed noise reduction which results in visible softness", and further noted that [...] " [...] detail starts to suffer as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go higher than base ISO and by ISO 400 most low-contrast detail is gone." [...] However, in a December 2013 comparison against other recent phones such as the One, Galaxy S4 Zoom, Xperia Z1, iPhone 5S, and Lumia 1020 by TechRadar, the G2 was named the best cameraphone of the six for [...] " [...] very well in terms of picture quality, ease of use and functionality, as well as post processing", although it was panned for not having as many options as its competitors, and for the probability of fingers accidentally getting into landscape shots due to the positioning of the lens.|$|E
