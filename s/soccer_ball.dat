5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball,</b> Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} eight, Alex {{had begun}} playing both {{basketball}} and football. He would shoot hoops with a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> and a milk crate nailed to a tree. The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria due {{to the success of}} National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon and Owumi often followed the NBA. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined the Harvard School of Public Health. In sixth grade, he enrolled at the local Tobin K-8 School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played basketball and football. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. At Burke in 2003, he won The Boston Globe Scholar Athlete Award, given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club.|$|E

5|$|The team's {{original}} shield {{was implemented}} in 1996 {{consisting of the}} team's name, D.C. United, above a black bald eagle facing right on a red field, clawing three soccer balls overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were intended to represent the region's three jurisdictions. The bird, associated {{with the federal government}} based in Washington, D.C., symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including speed and power. The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. This second logo design reoriented the eagle facing left, and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers. At the center of the eagle is a single gold-colored star and <b>soccer</b> <b>ball,</b> which represents the team's victory in Major League Soccer's inaugural cup in 1996. The logo can also be adorned with four silver stars above it, representing the MLS Cups the team has won.|$|E

Rothenberg Trophy, named for Rothenberg's contributions to American soccer. The Rothenberg Trophy was a dark gold trophy that had two handles around a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball,</b> with the league's logo imprinted on the plaque. In 1999, the Rothenberg Trophy was redesigned with a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> placed on a beacon. In 2008, the trophy was redesigned again to its present state and renamed the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the sphere}} has Euler {{characteristic}} 2, {{it follows that}} P = 12. That is, a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> constructed in this way always has 12 pentagons. In principle, the number of hexagons is unconstrained. This result is also applicable to fullerenes.|$|E

The effect of the different balls on the flight path has been calculated. Major differences between the different <b>soccer</b> <b>balls</b> have been found...|$|R

25|$|In January, 1983, {{a second}} cougar, seven-month-old Kyna--- Welsh for wise or graceful lady--- became SIUE's second live mascot. Chimega's cage had been divided {{in two and}} a large, caged run would later be added. At one time, Kyna was {{released}} by pranksters/vandals. Later, she had severe health issues after eating a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball.</b> Due to liability insurance issues, she was restricted from interacting with the public in late 1986. Then, in June, 1987, the university administration, without consulting students, staff, or alumni, donated Kyna to an exotic animal park. Despite protests, Kyna did not return, and SIUe has since been without a live cougar mascot.|$|E

Numerous dignitaries attended, including United States President Bill Clinton, Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl and President of Bolivia Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada.

Ross was also supposed to kick a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> into the goal from the penalty spot {{at the beginning of}} her performance, with the goal then splitting in two as part of a pre-orchestrated stunt. She kicked the ball wide to the left, missing the goal, but the goalposts were collapsed anyway in accordance with the stunt plans. In addition, Daryl Hall and Jon Secada also gave musical performances.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Saudi Arabia {{bears the}} shahada or Islamic {{declaration}} of faith. Because the shahada is considered holy, Saudi Arabia's flag code is extremely strict {{and even the}} slightest violation amounts to desecration {{not only of the}} flag but is also blasphemous to Islam. This has led to several incidents of controversy. In 1994, McDonald's printed carry-out bags bearing the flags of all nations participating in the FIFA World Cup (with a green flag with Saudi Arabia's coat of arms superimposed, rather than the Saudi flag), while Coca-Cola did the same on cans of soda. Because of Saudi outrage, the companies stopped producing those items. Also during the FIFA World Cup, in 2002, Saudi officials protested against printing the flag on a <b>soccer</b> <b>ball</b> on the belief that kicking the creed with the foot was totally unacceptable.|$|E
