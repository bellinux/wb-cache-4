5|$|The {{game was}} not a {{significant}} commercial success but received widespread critical praise and has since become a cult classic. It was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It was considered by video game journalists to be the best role-playing game of 1999, and continues to receive attention long after its release, with a <b>source</b> <b>port</b> version of Torment released on April 11, 2017 by Beamdog.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} for Windows computers on December 7, 2007. A patch was later released which added new functionality to the in-game map, added widescreen support, and tweaked several game settings. A Macintosh port was released November 13, 2008, courtesy of Ambrosia Software. The game {{was released on}} Steam on December 15, 2008; it included the addition of 27 Steam Achievements. A Linux version of the game was developed by Ryan C. Gordon in 2009; an open beta ran until February 6, 2010, and the Linux version of the game was released {{as part of the}} Humble Indie Bundle. The source code for the game's engine was released under the GNU General Public License on June 3, 2010. A modified version was released on the iPad on November 2, 2011. This version, which includes touchscreen support and changes to the way the map works, was created by Andrew Church, who was approached to do the port by Holowka after he did an unofficial PlayStation Portable <b>source</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
2500|$|To fix this, {{all major}} DNS servers {{implemented}} <b>Source</b> <b>Port</b> Randomization, as both djbdns and PowerDNS had before. This fix is {{widely seen as}} a stopgap measure, as it only makes the attack up to 65,536 times harder. [...] An attacker willing to send billions of packets can still corrupt names. [...] DNSSEC has been proposed as the way to bring cryptographic assurance to results provided by DNS, and Kaminsky has spoken in favor of it.|$|E

2500|$|Don Hopkins {{announced}} that he is creating a free and open <b>source</b> <b>port</b> of the game SimCity to the OLPC {{with the blessing of}} Will Wright and Electronic Arts, and demonstrated SimCity running on the OLPC at the Game Developer's Conference in March 2007. The free and open source SimCity plans were confirmed at the same conference by SJ Klein, director of content for the OLPC, who also asked game developers to create [...] "frameworks and scripting environments—tools with which children themselves could create their own content." ...|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{vulnerability}} {{was related}} to DNS only having 65,536 possible transaction IDs, a number small enough to simply guess given enough opportunities. [...] Dan Bernstein, author of djbdns, had reported this as early as 1999. djbdns dealt with the issue using <b>Source</b> <b>Port</b> Randomization, in which the UDP port {{was used as a}} second transaction identifier, thus raising the possible ID count into the billions. Other more popular name server implementations left the issue unresolved due to concerns about performance and stability, as many operating system kernels simply weren't designed to cycle through thousands of network sockets a second. [...] Instead, other implementers assumed that DNS's time to live (TTL) field would limit a guesser to only a few attempts a day.|$|E

Other <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> added similar functionality, and command-line loadable DeHackEd support is now common with most modern <b>source</b> <b>ports.</b> Boom also provided the BEX (Boom EXtended) extensions for DeHackEd support. BEX allows greater flexibility in string editing, application of codepointers to any frame, and extra codepointers.|$|R

50|$|Every TCP and UDP packet {{contains}} a source IP address and <b>source</b> <b>port</b> number {{as well as}} a destination IP address and destination port number. The IP address/port number pair forms a socket. In particular, the source IP address and <b>source</b> <b>port</b> number form the source socket.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, for UDP, NATs {{do not need}} to have port preservation. Indeed, {{multiple}} UDP communications (each with a distinct endpoint) can occur on the same <b>source</b> <b>port,</b> and applications usually reuse the same UDP socket to send packets to distinct hosts. This makes port prediction straightforward, as it is the same <b>source</b> <b>port</b> for each packet.|$|E

50|$|When a {{computer}} {{on the private}} (internal) network sends an IPv4 packet to the external network, the NAT device replaces the internal IP address in the source field of the packet header (sender's address) with the external IP address of the NAT device. PAT may then assign the connection a port number {{from a pool of}} available ports, inserting this port number in the <b>source</b> <b>port</b> field (much like the post office box number), and forwards the packet to the external network. The NAT device then makes an entry in a translation table containing the internal IP address, original <b>source</b> <b>port,</b> and the translated <b>source</b> <b>port.</b> Subsequent packets from the same connection are translated to the same port number.|$|E

50|$|For {{software}} {{and video games}} where source code is available (see List of commercial video games with available source code), instead of emulation, <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> were created for the Pandora; notable examples are Jagged Alliance 2 and Homeworld.|$|R
50|$|The {{source code}} {{availability}} {{led to the}} creation of Descent <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> for modern computer operating systems and hardware by the game's community. Notable examples are DXX-Rebirth and D2X-XL (with Oculus Rift support), as well as a homebrew Wii version.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{tradition}} from Heretic and Hexen, Raven released the source {{code of the}} Hexen II engine on November 10, 2000.

50|$|After the game's {{official}} support ended, game engine recreations of Strife {{were created by}} Doom <b>source</b> <b>port</b> developers through reverse engineering. Notably authors were Jānis Legzdiņš (author of the Doom <b>source</b> <b>port</b> Vavoom), Randy Heit (author of ZDoom), Samuel Villarreal (author of SvStrife), and James Haley (author with Samuel Villareal of Chocolate Strife). Except for the last, these allow for high resolution graphics modes, better mouselook, and expanded modding capabilities.|$|E

50|$|Cisco RAPT {{implementation}} is port {{address translation}} (PAT) or NAT overloading, and maps multiple private IP addresses {{to a single}} public IP address. Multiple addresses can be mapped to a single address because each private address is tracked by a port number. PAT uses unique <b>source</b> <b>port</b> numbers on the inside global IP address to distinguish between translations. The port number are 16-bit integers. The total number of internal addresses that can be translated to one external address could theoretically {{be as high as}} 65,536 per IP address. Realistically, the number of ports that can be assigned a single IP address is around 4000. PAT attempts to preserve the original <b>source</b> <b>port.</b> If this <b>source</b> <b>port</b> is already used, PAT assigns the first available port number starting {{from the beginning of the}} appropriate port group 0-511, 512-1023, or 1024-65535. When there are no more ports available and there is more than one external IP address configured, PAT moves to the next IP address to try to allocate the original <b>source</b> <b>port</b> again. This process continues until it runs out of available ports and external IP addresses.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, as was {{the case}} with some of the engines/game cores in ScummVM, the {{original}} developers have helped the projects by supplying the original source code (those can be then called <b>source</b> <b>ports).</b> This is the best case, optimal for accuracy and minimizing the effort. An example is Beneath a Steel Sky.|$|R
5000|$|Doom was {{the last}} first-person shooter title by id Software to use a 16.16 fixed point {{representation}} {{for all of its}} non-integer computations, including map system, geometry, rendering, player movement etc. This was done in order for the game to be playable on 386 and 486SX CPUs without an FPU. For compatibility reasons, this representation is still used in modern Doom <b>source</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Several <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> {{have been}} created for various games {{specifically}} to address online multiplayer support. Most older games were not created {{to take advantage of}} the Internet and the low latency, high bandwidth Internet connections available to computer gamers today. Furthermore, old games may use outdated network protocols to create multiplayer connections, such as IPX protocol, instead of Internet Protocol. Another problem was games that required a specific IP address for connecting with another player. This requirement made it difficult to quickly find a group of strangers to play with — the way that online games are most commonly played today. To address this shortcoming, specific <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> such as Skulltag added [...] "lobbies", which are basically integrated chat rooms in which players can meet and post the location of games they are hosting or may wish to join. Similar facilities may be found in newer games and online game services such as Valve's Steam, Blizzard's battle.net, and GameSpy Arcade.|$|R

50|$|Many cache {{poisoning}} {{attacks against}} DNS servers {{can be prevented}} by being less trusting of the information passed to them by other DNS servers, and ignoring any DNS records passed back which are not directly relevant to the query. For example, versions of BIND 9.5.0-P1 and above perform these checks. <b>Source</b> <b>port</b> randomization for DNS requests, combined {{with the use of}} cryptographically-secure random numbers for selecting both the <b>source</b> <b>port</b> and the 16-bit cryptographic nonce, can greatly reduce the probability of successful DNS race attacks.|$|E
50|$|For ICMP flows, the <b>Source</b> <b>Port</b> is zero, and the Destination Port number field codes ICMP message Type and Code (port = ICMP-Type * 256 + ICMP-Code).|$|E
50|$|As {{users of}} a {{platform}} {{that was not}} targeted by commercial porting houses, the Omni Group historically did <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> of games for NeXTStep/OpenStep pro bono, especially maintenance updates of id games. They continued to do so during the transition through Rhapsody into macOS, catching {{the eye of the}} existing Macintosh games industry in the process, and were then contracted to port a number of games commercially.|$|R
50|$|If {{the source}} code is available, support can by {{provided}} most effectively. Sometimes the source code is released intentionally, sometimes by leaking or mistake, {{such as what}} happened with the game engine of the Thief series. Sometimes fans even completely reverse-engineer source code from the original program binary. With the source code available even the support of completely different but recent platforms with <b>source</b> <b>ports</b> becomes possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} {{system will be}} based on the common open source Linux distribution Debian which allows the use of already available desktop open source applications from the Debian ARM repository, for instance Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice, GIMP, etc. The around 1,500 applications, created for the mostly open source OpenPandora software ecosystem, are expected to be available for the Pyra in short time by <b>source</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
