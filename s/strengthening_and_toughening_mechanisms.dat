The density of solute atom and vacancies significantly raised up after solution treating, and retained as supersaturated solid solution after water quenching, which acted as the driving force for the precipitation during subsequent aging.

Cleats connecting the vertical stiffener and horizontal base panel to T-shaped sandwich joints were reinforced in the through-thickness direction with pins.

40|$|A {{low carbon}} {{bainitic}} steel with Cu–P alloying was developed. The new steel aims {{to meet the}} demand of high strength, high toughness and resistance to chloride ion corrosion for the components used in the environment of sea water and oceanic atmosphere. Mechanical properties of the steel were tested and <b>strengthening</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were analyzed by comparing hot-rolled microstructures of the low carbon bainitic steels with and without Cu–P alloying. The results show that Cu–P alloying provided strong solution strengthening with weak effect on ductility. The toughness loss caused by Cu–P alloying could be balanced by increasing the amount of martensite/remained austenite (M/A island) at lower finishing temperature. The static recovery process during rolling interval was delayed by the interaction of phosphorous, copper atoms with dislocations, which was favorable to the formation of bainitic plates. Super-fine Nb(C, N) particles precipitated on dislocations had coherency with bainite ferrite at 830 ◦C finishing temperature.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{mechanical properties}} of natural biomaterials have attracted intense attention from researchers with {{focus on the}} <b>strengthening</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Nevertheless, no material is unconquerable under sufficiently high load. If fracture is unavoidable, constraining the damage scope turns to be a practical way to preserve {{the integrity of the}} whole structure. Recent studies on biomaterials have revealed that many structural biomaterials tend to be fractured, under sufficiently high indentation load, through ring cracking which is more localized and hence less destructive compared to the radial one. Inspired by this observation, here we explore the factors affecting the fracture mode of structural biomaterials idealized as laminated materials. Our results suggest that fracture mode of laminated materials depends on the coating/substrate modulus mismatch and the indenter size. A map of fracture mode is developed, showing a critical modulus mismatch (CMM), below which ring cracking dominates irrespective of the indenter size. Many structural biomaterials in nature are found to have modulus mismatch close to the CMM. Our results not only shed light on the mechanics of inclination to ring cracking exhibited by structural biomaterials but are of great value to the design of laminated structures with better persistence of structural integrity.

Direct quenching (DQ) has gained {{interest in the}} past few decades and requires quenching immediately after working above or below the austenite recrystallization temperature to form martensitic microstructures. In the current study, microalloyed ASTM A 514 steel is used to produce martensite from either equiaxed or pancaked prior austenite grain (PAG) microstructures. The equiaxed PAG conditions simulate microstructures produced by RA/Q and the pancaked PAG conditions simulate microstructures produced by controlled rolling (CR) before DQ. Controlled rolling followed by DQ was simulated with double hit compression in a Gleeble ® 3500. The prior austenite grain size (PAGS) was varied between 9 and 75 µm prior to controlled rolling. The <b>strengthening</b> <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are being investigated in the as-quenched (AsQ), low temperature tempered (LTT: 200 °C), and high temperature tempered (HTT: 600 °C) conditions. The equiaxed PAG condition has a Hall-Petch (H-P) relationship between yield strength (or microhardness) and PAGS in the AsQ condition. There is not a H-P relationship between PAGS and microhardness in the CR-DQ conditions. The CR-DQ conditions generally exhibit higher microhardness than the RA/Q conditions with similar PAGS, with the most significant differences in the larger PAGS conditions. Toughness was only measured in the equiaxed PAG conditions. The smallest PAGS has the lowest ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) with the highest strength in the AsQ and LTT conditions.

Among these, pangolin scales and the feather shaft are systematically and analytically studied, answering the questions how the scales function as an armor and the shaft fulfills flight, which contribute to advancing the current knowledge of natural keratinous materials and providing valuable insights in developing new bioinspired designs. The pangolin is the only known mammal that has keratinous scales covering the main body. Arboreal and ground pangolin scales show an overlapping pattern in a hexagonal arrangement to provide multi-layered coverage. Scales show three regions in the solid interior that features flattened cells forming crossed lamellae, rarely seen in most keratinous materials. Two dimensional x-ray diffraction reveals the presence of α-helices and possible β-sheet, and the microfibrils are crossed {{in a range of}} directions. Scales show an interlocking interface between lamellae, which results from the suture-like cell membrane complex. Scales are transverse isotropic and show a strain-rate dependence, which favor the function in resisting external forces from multi-directions. The feather shaft, a naturally refined lightweight and stiff flight material, is distinguished in having a changing shape factor: circular at the calamus but square towards the distal rachis; this produces a tailored flexural stiffness along the shaft length fulfilling the local stress requirements. The cortex has a complex fibrous hierarchical structure, both making the shaft longitudinally strong, dorsal-ventrally stiff and torsionally rigid, yet capable of desirable deflection and twisting.

In addition, the PhD investigates the effects of tensile and compressive pre-loading on the impact damage tolerance of z-pinned laminates. These research studies provide original findings about the capacity of z-pins to increase the damage tolerance of aircraft laminate panels (such as wing or fuselage skin sections) against barely visible impact damage events.

40|$|Outstanding {{mechanical}} properties of biological multilayered materials are {{strongly influenced by}} nanoscale features in their structure. In this study, mechanical behavior <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of abalone nacre-inspired multilayered materials are explored. In nacre’s structure, the organic matrix, pillars and the roughness of the -aragonite platelets play important roles in its overall mechanical performance. A micromechanics model for multilayered biological materials is proposed to simulate their mechanical deformation <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The fundamental hypothesis of the model is that nanoscale pillars and asperities have near theoretical strength. It has been shown earlier that organic matrix behaves stiffer in proximity of mineral platelets. However, the suggested values for stiffness and strength of organic matrix appear to be high. The proposed model assumes that pillars and the asperities confine the organic matrix to {{the proximity of the}} platelets and hence increase their stiffness and strength. The modeling results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results for abalone nacre. The results show that the stiffness of the organic matrix affects the stiffness of material, whereas platelets’ aspect ratio determines the ultimate strength. The pillars and the asperities are responsible for the ductility of multilayered material. In the proposed model, although all the components of the bioinspired structure have brittle behavior, the overall structure has a ductile response. The highly nonlinear behavior of the suggested multilayered material is a result of a distributed deformation in the nacre-like structure due to existence of nanoasperities and nanopillars with near theoretical strength...|$|R

The effect of increasing stitch density on the improvement to the interlaminar fracture toughness and healing of mode I delamination cracks generated under static and fatigue interlaminar loads is determined. The self-healing <b>and</b> delamination <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of the mendable stitches are identified...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} thermoset, <b>toughened</b> thermoset, <b>and</b> {{thermoplastic}} resin matrix systems were characterized for Mode I critical strain energy release rates, and their composites were tested for interlaminar critical strain energy release rates using the double cantilever beam method. A clear correlation is {{found between the}} two sets of data. With brittle resins, the interlaminar critical strain energy release rates are somewhat larger than the neat resin values due to a full transfer of the neat resin toughness to the composite <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> associated with crack growth. With tougher matrices, the higher critical strain energy release rates are only partially transferred to the composites, presumably because the fibers restrict the crack-tip deformation zones...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the fact}} that nature {{provides}} multifunctional composites by using universal building blocks, the authors design and test synthetic composites with a pattern inspired by the microstructure of cortical bone. Using a high-resolution multimaterial 3 D printer, the authors are able to manufacture samples and investigate their fracture behavior in mechanical tests. The authors’ results demonstrate that the bone-inspired design is critical for toughness amplification and balance with material strength. The failure modes of the authors’ synthetic composites show similarities with the cortical bone, like crack deflection and branching, constrained microcracking, and fibril bridging. The authors’ results confirm that our design is eligible to reproduce the fracture <b>and</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>mechanism</b> of bone...|$|R
