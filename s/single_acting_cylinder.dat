50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of open coiled spring. In double acting cylinders two ports both extend and retract by means of compressed air.|$|E
50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as double acting or single acting. In <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In double acting cylinder {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. Directional control valves required for the easy operation of double acting cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{economical}} and {{the simplest}} design. Hydraulic fluid enters through a port {{at one end}} of the cylinder, which extends the rod by means of area difference. An external force, internal retraction spring or gravity returns the piston rod.|$|R
50|$|In some applications, a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} <b>cylinder</b> {{is adequate}} {{to accomplish the}} work except for one stage that is required to be double acting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} <b>cylinders</b> are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> rod style <b>cylinder,</b> the <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic <b>cylinder</b> is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R

The modeling approach uses the thermodynamic principles of energy and mass conservation. We demonstrate that {{pneumatic system}}s suffer from two effects: unwanted dynamics due to gas compressibility and discontinuous nonlinearties in the servovalves due to choked flow.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the control strategy proposed {{for a new}} wave energy converter (WEC) design, the MGR. The control aims to maximise the energy absorption from waves, adapting converter's resistance to the incoming wave size. The MGR is a near shore submerged converter that {{takes advantage of the}} oscillating water column created by the wave when it passes on the converter's platform. The wave column moves the platform, transmitting the force to a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> that pumps sea water to the coast, where is turbined generating electricity. The control strategy is based on adjusting the system pressure to the coming wave size to create the optimal resistance, absorbing the maximum energy from it. The pressure is controlled by the aperture of turbine jet, positioning jet needle. In addition, the PLC implements the synchronous generator's load (torque) {{in order to maintain the}} turbine working at the maximum efficiency rotation speed.

5000|$|The first {{generation}} of LEGO Pneumatics ran from 1984 through 1988. This generation is characterised by single port pneumatic cylinders and the more complex plumbing including a three port distribution block with a pressure and vacuum outlet port. These pressure and vacuum lines ran to a switch to provide pressure for extension or vacuum for retraction of the pneumatic cylinders. These are often falsely compared to <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> that require gravity to retract. The difference is that these units retract on the application of vacuum.|$|R

Introduction: The air compressor plant tested {{is a part of}} the equipment of the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory at the Kansas State Agricultural College. It consists of a vertical steam engine, an air compressor, an air receiver, and a Westinghouse steam engine used as an air motor. The arrangement of the plant is shown in the accompanying scheme. The vertical steam engine is supposed to develop about ten horse power when running at two hundred fifty recolutions per minute. The diameter of its piston is six inches, and its stroke is eight inches. The diameter of the piston rod is one and one-eighth inches. The engine receives steam from a two and one-half inch pipe, which is connected to the steam main. The steam before reaching the engine passes through a steam separator. The condition of the steam was about. 995. The engine exhausted into the air. The air compressor is of the Ingersoll –Sergeant make. The diameter of its piston is eight inches, and its stroke is eight inches. The diameter of its piston rod is one and three-eighths inches. The compressor is driven by the steam engine with a two ply leather belt.

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{aircraft}} manufacturing, cold expansion products literally hold these aircraft together. The problem faced today is that the Little Brute Hydraulic Puller designed and built by Fatigue Technology Inc. is a handheld steel hydraulic cylinder that is heavy and expensive to produce. In a market that demands continuous improvement, {{there is a constant}} push to make the product cheaper, better and lighter. In order to accomplish this demand a composite tube will be substituted in the design as the primary pressure cylinder instead of the traditional steel pressure cylinder {{in order to create a}} lighter and cheaper design. Two separate designs we have been designed and built to withstand a given test pressure which will correlate to the sample provided by Polygon Composites. The first design is a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> that has caps at both end which extend past the outside diameter of the cylinder and will use bolts to hold the caps together. The second design will be similar however, the caps will thread onto an aluminum sleeve fitted outside the composite cylinder. The purpose of the aluminum sleeve will be to determine if the sample can meet the strength requirements with or without the extra layer. Each cylinder will be loaded until failure and the load will compared to a theoretical value established based on the dimensions of the sample. Both designs will be analyzed to determine their potential weight savings, cost of manufacturing and its potential improvement in machining and assembly time...|$|R

Introduction: The following tests were made on the {{compressed air}} plant in the Engineering Laboratory of the Kansas State Agricultural College. The plant is equipped as follows: a vertical engine the make and rated horse power of which are unknown, belted, through a main shaft, to a double acting, horizontal, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolution, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolutions per minute and the receiver pressure. A Westinghouse engine with two 6 x 8 <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{was connected to the}} air receiver and used as an air motor. The object of the tests was to determine 1 st the efficiency of the plant, or the ratio of the developed brake horse power of the motor to the indicated horse power of the engine; 2 nd the efficiency between the engine and compressor cylinders, and between the compressor cylinder and the brake on the motor; 2 rd the horse power lost in heating the air and the cooling water. A series of three tests was conducted, the duration of each of which was one hour. Indicator cards were taken on the engine and compressor every five minutes throughout the test; as there was no means of taking cards on the air motor, a rope brake was constructed and used instead. Every five minutes, {{at the same time that}} the indicator cards instead. Every five minutes, at the same time that the indicator cards were taken, the speeds of the engine compressor and motor were noted, and at the same time, the initial and final temperatures of the air and cooling water, and the readings of the scale of the rope brake on the motor were taken. All water which passed through the water jacket of the compressor was carefully weighed and recorder, so that the total weight of water which passed through the jacket during the test was known...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{erecting}} the mast of a large mobile drilling rig. The mast is erected to the vertical position using a telescopic cylinder. However, to lower the mast, gravity is not available for the initial tilt back from the vertical position. Thus, the plunger stage only of the telescopic actuator is equipped as a double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> to provide the initial force to pull the mast back from vertical. Once the tilt back has been initiated, then gravity takes over and supplies the force to complete the full cylinder retraction. The remaining stages, therefore, are <b>single</b> <b>acting.</b> This special combination is much less complex and much less costly than using an entirely double acting design.|$|R

50|$|The {{length of}} a {{hydraulic}} cylinder is the total of the stroke, {{the thickness of the}} piston, the thickness of bottom and head and the length of the connections. Often this length does not fit in the machine. In that case the piston rod is also used as a piston barrel and a second piston rod is used. These kinds of cylinders are called telescopic cylinders. If we call a normal rod cylinder single stage, telescopic cylinders are multi-stage units of two, three, four, five or more stages. In general telescopic cylinders are much more expensive than normal cylinders. Most telescopic <b>cylinders</b> are <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> (push).
