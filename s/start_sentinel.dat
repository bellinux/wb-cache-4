50|$|Orion {{travels to}} Kaon and meets Megatron in person, {{along with two}} of his followers, Shockwave and Soundwave. Orion and Megatron engage in intense but {{friendly}} debates over the nature of free will, and they find broad agreement in the need for a new form of Cybertronian government. However, Megatron favours confrontation and revolution, while Orion hopes to inspire the masses to change the system from within. As Megatron's political movement gains power, it also grows more violent. Terrorists professing allegiance to him commit multiple bombings across Cybertron. Megatron repeatedly states in public speeches that he does not know the terrorists and did not orchestrate these attacks. The terrorists then attack a casino in the city of Altihex, where Sentinel Prime (the main political leader of Cybertron) is attending a show. When the bombings <b>start,</b> <b>Sentinel</b> relies on his three bodyguards - Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker - to escort him to safety. However, the bodyguards instead take Sentinel to Kaon and present him to Megatron. Starscream flirts with joining Megatron's forces, but sees Sentinel as a potential bargaining chip and does not allow Megatron to kill him, ordering Skywarp and Thundercracker to take him to Trypticon Station, a scientific space station that orbits Cybertron.|$|E
40|$|Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin immuunikatoviruksen (HIV) yleisyyttä tuberkuloosipotilailla Somalimaassa ja arvioitiin HIV-infektion vaikutusta taudinkulkuun. HIV on tärkein kansanterveydellinen ongelma Afrikassa ja se sen kantajilla on suuri riski sairastua tuberkuloosiin. Tutkimus toteutettiin kahdessa suuressa tuberkuloosisairaalassa Boramassa ja Hargeisassa vuosina 2003 - 2004. Aineiston muodostivat 800 näissä sairaaloissa hoidettua tuberkuloosipotilasta. Suurimmalla osalla potilaista (82 %) oli keuhkotuberkuloosi. Potilaista 11 % oli HIV-positiivisia. Värjäysnegatiivinen tuberkuloosi oli yleisempää HIV-infektion kantajilla (56 %) kuin muilla potilailla (24 %). Kolmen kuukauden hoidon jälkeen edelleen värjäyspositiivisia oli 12 % HIV-infektoituneista ja 6 % muista potilaista. Hoidon lopussa 38 % HIV-positiivisista oli parantunut tuberkuloosista, mikä ole selvästi vähemmän kuin muista potilaista (73 %). Tulokset osoittavat HIV-infektion yleistyneen tuberkuloosipotilailla myös Somalimaassa, vaikka tiulanne on edelleen selvästi parempi kuin monissa muissa Saharan eteläpuolisen Afrikan maissa. HIV-potilaiden tuberkuloosi on erityinen haaste sillä hoitotulokset ovat huonompia kuin muilla potilailla. The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to assess human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among patients with tuberculosis in Somaliland and to analyse differences in disease characteristics, smear conversion and treatment outcome between HIV seropositive and seronegative tuberculosis (TB) patients. The study was conducted in two main TB centres in Somaliland, Borama and Hargeisa from January 2003 to August 2004. A total of 839 patients treated in these centres were enrolled. Thirty-one patients withdrew from the study and 8 cases were excluded for not fulfilling the study criteria. Data on HIV serological testing and follow up of sputum smear conversions and treatment outcome was obtained for 800 TB patients. Age groups 15 24 and 25 34 years comprised 66 % of the TB patients. Age distribution was similar among men and women. The majority of the patients were residents of Borama and Hargeisa districts. Of the patients 81. 5 % (95 % 78. 4 83. 8) had pulmonary and 18. 5 % (95 % CI 16. 2 21. 6) extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Of the patients with pulmonary disease, 73 % (95 %CI 69. 5 76. 3) were smear-positive cases and 27 % (95 % CI 23. 6 30. 4) smear-negative. Hargeisa TB centre had a higher proportion of pulmonary smear-negative cases compared to Borama (34 % versus 14 %). Among 800 TB patients tested for HIV infection, 10. 9 % (95 % CI 8. 9 13. 2) were HIV seropositive. In Borama, the HIV seroprevalence was 14. 5 % (95 % 10. 9 19. 0) and in Hargeisa 8. 8 % (95 % CI 6. 6 11. 6). Among 536 men and 264 women, HIV prevalence was 11. 1 % (95 % CI 8. 8 14. 1) versus 10. 2 % (95 % CI 7. 1 14. 1). Occupation and marital status were also associated with HIV infection. The disease characteristics among the 713 HIV seronegative TB patients showed that 81. 5 % (95 % CI 78. 4 84. 1) were pulmonary and 18. 5 % (95 % CI 15. 8 21. 5) were extrapulmonary, while the corresponding figures among the 87 HIV seropositive patients were 79 % (95 % CI 69. 6 86. 4) and 21 % (95 % CI 13. 5 30. 3). Among the 581 HIV seronegative pulmonary TB patients, 76 % (95 % CI 72. 9 79. 8) were smearpositive and 24 % (95 % CI 20. 1 27. 0) smear-negative. Among the 68 HIV seropositive pulmonary TB patients, 44 % (95 % CI 32. 4 55. 2) had pulmonary smear positive disease and 56 % (95 % CI 44. 7 67. 5) pulmonary smear-negative TB. Smear results at 5 / 6 months of TB treatment were obtained from 411 TB patients with smear conversion in 97 % (95 % CI 94. 6 98. 2). Treatment outcome was obtained from 800 TB patients and among them 50 % (95 % CI 46. 2 53. 2) were cured, 31 % (95 % 7 CI 28. 0 34. 4) completed treatment, 4. 5 % (95 % CI 3. 2 6. 1) died, 2. 4 % (95 % CI 1. 0 2. 9) failed, 2. 5 % (95 % CI 1. 6 3. 8) defaulted, 4. 4 % (95 % CI 3. 1 6. 0) transferred and 6 % (95 % CI 4. 5 7. 8) could not be evaluated. No smear conversion was reached at 2 / 3 months of TB treatment for 12 % of the HIV seropositive and 6 % of the seronegative TB cases (odds ratio, OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 0. 43 7. 38). No difference was observed between HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative TB in smear results at 5 / 6 months of TB treatment, with failure rates of 4 % versus 3 % (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 46 9. 75). Treatment failure rates among HIV smearnegative and HIV smear-positive TB were 62 % versus 27 %. HIV smear-negative TB patients had more frequent failures (OR 4. 44, 95 % CI 1. 36 14. 96). HIV seroprevalence among the TB patients in Somaliland has increased. The national prevalence among TB patients was 4. 7 % in 1999, while the seroprevalence in the current study was 10. 9 %. The figures of Borama TB centre were 10 % in 1999 and 14. 5 % in 2003. In Hargeisa, seroprevalence increased from 7 % to 8. 8 %. No difference was found between HIV seropositive and seronegative patients in disease characteristics (pulmonary and extrapulmonary). The proportion of smear-negative TB was higher among the HIV seropositive. The treatment outcome was poorer among the HIV seropositive patients. It is recommended to <b>start</b> <b>sentinel</b> sites for HIV surveillance in the TB centres...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Government {{agencies}} are increasingly emphasizing opioid safety in hospitals. In 2012, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) <b>started</b> a <b>sentinel</b> event program, the “Safe Use of Opioids in Hospitals. ” We {{sought to determine}} if opioid use patterns in our emergency department (ED) changed from 2011, before the program began, to 2013, after start of the program. Methods: This was a retrospective study of all adult ED patients who received an intravenous opioid and had a serum creatinine measured. We recorded opioids used, dose prescribed, and serum creatinine. As an index of the safety of opioids, uses of naloxone after administration of an opioid was recorded. Results: Morphine {{is still the most}} commonly used opioid by doses given, but its percentage of opioids used decreased from 68. 9 % in 2011 to 52. 8 % in 2013. During the same period, use of hydromorphone increased from 27. 5 % to 42. 9 %, while the use of fentanyl changed little (3. 6 % to 4. 3 %). Naloxone administration was rare after an opioid had been given. Opioids were not dosed in an equipotent manner. Conclusion: The use of hydromorphone in our ED increased by 56 % (absolute increase of 15. 4 %), while the use of morphine decreased by 30. 5 % (absolute decrease 16. 1 %) of total opioid use from 2011 to 2013. The JCAHO program likely was at least indirectly responsible for this change in relative dosing of the opioids. Based on frequency of naloxone administered after administration of an opioid, the use of opioids was safe...|$|R

40|$|The current {{prevalence}} of HIV in India {{is estimated to}} be around 4. 6 million infections, 74. 8 per cent of those infected being men and 85. 3 per cent of infections occurring through the sexual route. Analysis of data from biological and behavioural surveillance from across the country brings out the fact that the epidemic is heterogeneously distributed and is spreading not onlygeographically, but also shows increasing rates in different risk groups, while continuing to affect the general population. The epidemic is in an advanced stage in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kar-nataka, Manipur and Nagaland. Nationwide efforts have been initiatedduring the last decade through a comprehensive National AIDS Control Programme. The response has been participatory, multi-sectoral, evidence based and with a number ofsuccess stories. This gives us hope that a sustained high-quality response will contain and manage the epidemic and its consequences. The first HIV infection in India was detected in 1986. Since then HIV in-fections and AIDS cases have been reported {{in all parts of the}} country. By the end of July 2003, a total of 54, 061 AIDS cases had been reported to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) (NACO 2002). Available data from the <b>start</b> of <b>sentinel</b> surveillance to the present indicate a varied picture. Epidemiological analysis of data and reports in India indicate that the highest number of HIV infections have been reported in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, and the highest rates among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the north-eastern state of Manipur (NACO 2001 b; Sarkar et al. 2003; WHO Regional Offices for South-East Asia and Western Pacific 2001). Trends indicate two distinct characteristics of the spread of HIV infection: from groups practising risk behaviours to the general population, and from urban to rural areas (NACO 2001 b). The predominant mode of transmission is through the sexual route (85 per cent) and another 3 per cent of transmission occurs through injecting drug use, most of them in the north-eastern states.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Dutch {{public health}} {{services}} are charged with collective preventive care for the population [...] care that should, by law, be based on epidemiological data. General practices potentially offer important data for this purpose, particularly since more and more use a computer. This study aimed to assess whether {{it is possible to}} obtain useful epidemiological data from this source. DESIGN [...] In 1990, the Rotterdam Municipal Health Service, in collaboration with the Erasmus University Rotterdam, <b>started</b> a computerised <b>sentinel</b> practice network. The main features of this and a specific small investigation are described. SETTING [...] The following institutions cooperate in the network: Municipal Health Service Rotterdam Area; Departments of General Practice and of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Rotterdam; Rotterdam District Association of General Practitioners. PATIENTS [...] Data are currently collected from 20 general practitioners and > 40, 000 patients. In a specific project, the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors in different ethnic groups was compared. MAIN RESULTS [...] It was possible to build up a regional epidemiological registration system in this manner. In the cardiovascular project we found striking differences between ethnic groups. The risk profile for Turkish men, in particular, was less favourable. The health service also uses the system to improve cooperation between public health and primary health care (for example, in cervical screening, influenza vaccination). CONCLUSION [...] Computerised general practices offer great possibilities for research and for preventive activities in which public health care and general practitioners can cooperate...|$|R
40|$|In May 1999 {{a working}} group was started to {{evaluate}} the current surveillance systems for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and to make suggestions for a renewed effective and efficient STD surveillance system in the Netherlands. The surveillance system has to {{provide insight into the}} prevalence and incidence of STD in the Netherlands and has to be used for (regional and national) STD control as well. The renewed surveillance system also needs to be profound for national policy making and sensitive to detect national trends. After evaluating the current surveillance systems the needs for information on the occurrence and spread of STD was determined. Their final proposal yields to <b>start</b> a STD <b>sentinel</b> with a few Municipal Health Services (MHS) outside the large cities in the west of the country and 6 STD clinics in the four large cities. This STD sentinel needs to be complemented with the Infectious diseases Surveillance Information System (ISIS) for the notification of hepatitis B and the national laboratory surveillance for four STD. A periodic survey on the occurrence of STD is necessary to estimate the incidence and prevalence of STD in the Netherlands and to interpret the data from STD surveillance. This survey is also needed for the adjustment of the renewed surveillance system. Furthermore, it is recommended to monitor STD and related diagnoses as urethritis, PID and chlamydial infections in the national morbidity sentinel of general physicians the in collaboration with the Dutch Institute for Research on Health Care (NIVEL). Finally, it is recommended to include congenital syphilis on the list of notifiable diseases again...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Opinions {{about the}} optimal lymph node {{dissection}} (LND) template in prostate cancer differ. Drainage and dissemination patterns {{are not necessarily}} identical. OBJECTIVE: To present a precise overview of the lymphatic drainage pattern and to correlate those findings with dissemination patterns. We also investigated {{the relationship between the}} number of positive lymph nodes (LN+) and resected lymph nodes (LNs) per region. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-four patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were prospectively enrolled. Patients did not show suspect LNs on computed tomography scan and had an LN involvement risk of ≥ 10 % but ≤ 35 % (Partin tables) or a cT 3 tumor. INTERVENTION: After intraprostatic technetium- 99 m nanocolloid injection, patients underwent planar scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. Then surgery was performed, <b>starting</b> with a <b>sentinel</b> node (SN) procedure and a superextended lymphadenectomy followed by radical prostatectomy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Distribution of scintigraphically detected SNs and removed SNs per region were registered. The number of LN+, as well as the percentage LN+ {{of the total number of}} removed LNs per region, was demonstrated in combining data of all patients. The impact of the extent of LND on N-staging and on the number of LN+ removed was calculated. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 470 SNs were scintigraphically detected (median: 6; interquartile range [IQR]: 3 - 9), of which 371 SNs were removed (median: 4; IQR: 2. 25 - 6). In total, 91 LN+ (median: 2; IQR: 1 - 3) were found in 34 of 74 patients. The predominant site for LN+ was the internal iliac region. An extended LND (eLND) would have correctly staged 32 of 34 patients but would have adequately removed all LN+ in only 26 of 34 patients. When adding the presacral region, these numbers increased to 33 of 34 and 30 of 34 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Standard eLND would have correctly staged the majority of LN+ patients, but 13 % of the LN+ would have been missed. Adding the presacral LNs to the template should be considered to obtain a minimal template with maximal gain.
