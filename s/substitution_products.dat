50|$|A {{nitrogen}} {{bound to}} both a good electrofuge {{and a good}} nucleofuge {{is known as a}} nitrenoid (for its resemblance to a nitrene). Nitrenes lack a full octet of electrons are thus highly electrophilic; nitrenoids exhibit analogous behavior and are often good substrates for electrophilic amination reactions. Nitrenoids can be generated from O-alkylhydroxylamines containing an N-H bond via deprotonation or from O-alkyloximes via nucleophilic addition. These intermediates react with carbanions to give substituted amines. Other electron-deficient, sp3 amination reagents react by similar mechanisms to give <b>substitution</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E

Also very important is the fact that such substitutes allow vegans, and people who are seriously ill (gout, PKU, rheumatoid arthritis etc. require the avoidance of foods with high protein content because of the purine levels, among other factors), lactose intolerant, or allergic to dairy protein, to enjoy all commonly cow milk based foods without health problems or ethical concerns.|$|E
50|$|Diastereotopic {{groups also}} arise in achiral molecules. For instance, any {{one pair of}} CH2 hydrogens in 3-pentanol (Figure 1) are diastereotopic, as the two CH2 carbons are enantiotopic. Substitution of {{any one of the}} four CH2 hydrogens creates two chiral centers at once, and the two {{possible}} hydrogen <b>substitution</b> <b>products</b> at any one CH2 carbon will be diastereomers. This kind of relationship is often easier to detect in cyclic molecules. For instance, any pair of CH2 hydrogens in cyclopentanol (Figure 1) are similarly diastereotopic, and this is easily discerned as one of the hydrogens in the pair will be cis to the OH group (on {{the same side of the}} ring face) while the other will be trans to it (on the opposite side).|$|E

Two types of dyed solar cells, based on either N 719 or N 719 -TBP, have been characterized employing standard current-voltage (I-V) performance test, UV-vis optical spectroscopy, incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The performance tests show a drastic efficiency reduction of ∼ 50 % in the N 719 -TBP containing cells as compared to N 719 -dyed cells. The lower performance of N 719 -TBP was caused by lower overall light harvesting efficiency due to ca. 30 nm blue shift in the absorption spectrum of the dye, ca. 50 % shorter electron diffusion length due to lower electron recombination resistance, and ca. 14 % lower charge separation efficiency, which most likely can be ascribed to decreased dye regeneration efficiency caused by the replacement of one NCS ligand with TBP in the <b>substitution</b> <b>product.</b> The observations made {{in this study of}} DSC cells dyed with the <b>substitution</b> <b>product,</b> representing a worst case scenario of cells with 100 % degraded dye, are in agreement with the characteristics of N 719 -dyed solar cells degraded at 85 C, where the effect of ligand substitution is somewhat less pronounced...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we study}} the {{reactivity}} of 2 -bromo- 3 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone with secondary amines. In general, secondary amines react with 2 -bromo- 3 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone by substituting at the 3 -methoxy position. The reactivity of an amine with the quinone is {{inversely proportional to}} the increasing size of the alkyl groups on the amine. In the reaction of 2 -bromo- 3 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone with methylethylamine, 3 -N-methylethylamino- 2 -bromo- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone is obtained in good yield. Diisopropylamine, on the other hand, fails to yield a <b>substitution</b> <b>product</b> with 2 -bromo- 3 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone. The <b>substitution</b> <b>product,</b> 2 -N-alkylalkylamino- 3 -bromo- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone, is often found to further derive to a dealkylation product. For example, 2 -bromo- 3 -N-methylpropylamino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone, as the primary product of 2 -bromo- 3 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone with methylpropylamine, was found to form 2 -bromo- 3 -N-methylamino- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone as the major dealkylation product by dealkylation of the propyl group {{in the presence of}} excess amine.

40|$|The nucleophile/electrophile {{combination}} in the aromatic substitution reaction using aminothiazole derivatives as nucleophiles {{has been}} the subject of this study. The reaction between 2, 4 -dipyrrolidinylthiazole and the neutral carbon electrophile 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzene gave a stable Wheland-Meisenheimer (WM) complex. This represents another example, among those already found by the research group in which this work has been carried out, of stable zwitterionic σ-intermediates. When the reaction was carried out with halonitrobenzene derivatives, it produced the <b>substitution</b> <b>product</b> in position 5 of the thiazole ring. 2, 4 -dipyrrolidinylthiazole and arenediazonium salts gave the coupling product at the C 5 of the thiazole ring together with many byproducts and the stable Wheland intermediate formed by attack of the proton on the C 5 of the starting thiazole reagent. Arenediazonium salts were coupled also with 2 -pyrrolidinylthiazole. In this case quantitative formation of the <b>substitution</b> <b>product</b> deriving from the attack of the electrophile on the carbon nucleophilic position of the thiazole ring was obtained. In conclusion, the results had allowed to expand the knowledge on electrophilic/nucleophilic interactions in the aromatic substitution involving thiazole heteroaromatics and provided a further example of stable Wheland-Meisenheimer intermediates...|$|R

Carbonylation of the anti-[Cr(CO) (3) -mu,eta:eta-indenyl-Ir(COE) (2) ] analogue (II) gives the eta(1) -[eta(6) -Cr(CO) (3) -indenyl]-Ir(CO) (4) (VII) species in a single fast step. In contrast to {{the behavior of the}} corresponding rhodium complexes, for which eta(1) intermediates have never been observed and the aromatized <b>substitution</b> <b>product</b> is the stable product, the rearomatization of the cyclopentadienyl ring in iridium complexes to give the "normal" <b>substitution</b> <b>product,</b> viz., anti-[Cr(CO) (3) -mu,eta:eta-indenyl-Ir(CO) (2) ] (III) is a difficult process which takes place only on bubbling argon through the solution.

Related researches can be clearly classified into firm-driven substitution and customer-driven substitution. However, if production inventory is stock-out when a firm updates its product, the firm may use a new generation product to satisfy the customer’s demand of old generation product or use updated component to substitute old component to satisfy production demand.
