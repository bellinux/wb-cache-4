5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently the Communist Party {{broke away from the}} Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Rome Wilfrid {{stopped in}} Frisia to visit Willibrord. Following Wilfrid's arrival in Rome the pope held a council, which {{declared}} that the King of Northumbria <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> the earlier papal decrees restoring Wilfrid to his see. Wilfrid was disconcerted {{to find that the}} papal court spoke Greek, and his biographer noted that Wilfrid was displeased when the pope discussed the appeal with advisers in a language Wilfrid could not understand. The pope also ordered another council to be held in Britain to decide the issue, and ordered the attendance of Bosa, Berhtwald and Wilfrid. On his journey back to England Wilfrid had a seizure at Meaux, but he had returned to Kent by 705.|$|E

5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E
5|$|Some hymns narrate that Chinnamasta likes {{blood and}} thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines. The Shaktisamgama Tantra says that only brave souls (viras) <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> Vamamarga worship to the goddess. The Shakta Pramoda warns that {{improper}} worship brings severe consequences, with Chhinnamasta beheading the person and drinking his blood. Further, it explains the worship rituals {{to be followed by}} householders and those to be followed by renouncers. The Todala Tantra mentions that, as part of Chhinnamasta's worship, Shiva or his fierce form, Bhairava, be worshipped as Kabandha ("headless trunk") as the goddess's consort.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} land border {{disputes}} between Croatia and Serbia.

5|$|By {{the time}} Smetana {{completed}} his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed {{that his son}} <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, {{and at the same}} time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1995 title, the Rockets {{opted to}} {{modernize}} their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team {{went with the}} idea of Missouri City artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill. Nash would later sue the Rockets for breach of contract, given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes. The NBA suggested that the identity <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> the cartoon-inspired imagery that other teams adopted during the 1990s, leading to a rocket painted with sharkmouth nose art orbiting a basketball. Red was retained, but navy blue and silver became the uniform's primary colors. Both the home white and away navy uniforms featured gradient-fading pinstripes and futuristic number fonts, with side stripes of navy fading to red. This was used until the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|Hubert Marie Eugène Pierlot (23 December 1883 – 13 December 1963) was a Belgian {{politician}} and 32nd Prime Minister of Belgium, serving between 1939 and 1945. Pierlot, {{a lawyer and}} jurist, served in World War I before entering politics in the 1920s. A member of the Catholic Party, Pierlot became Prime Minister in 1939, shortly before Belgium entered World War II. In this capacity, he headed the Belgian government in exile, first from France and later Britain, while Belgium was under German occupation. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, a violent disagreement broke out between Pierlot and King Leopold III over whether the King <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> the orders of his ministers and go into exile or surrender to the German Army. Pierlot considered Leopold's subsequent surrender a breach of the Constitution and encouraged the parliament to declare Leopold unfit to reign. The confrontation provoked a lasting animosity between Pierlot and other conservatives, who supported the King's position and considered the government's exile to be cowardly.|$|E

5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria {{it was decided}} that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that the deterioration of the Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Swaminarayan {{wrote the}} Shikshapatri on 11 February 1826. While the {{original}} Sanskrit manuscript is not available, it {{was translated into}} Gujarati by Nityanand Swami {{under the direction of}} Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers <b>should</b> <b>follow.</b> A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and {{it is one of the}} very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself. Acharya Tejendraprasad of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E
5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it <b>should</b> <b>follow</b> the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E
