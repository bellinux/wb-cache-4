25|$|The bishop or eparch of a see, {{even if he}} {{does not}} also hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is the centre of unity for his diocese or eparchy, and, {{as a member of the}} College of Bishops, shares in {{responsibility}} for governance of the whole Church (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, not just an administrative subdivision of <b>something</b> <b>larger,</b> the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was immediately dismantled {{to make way}} for <b>something</b> <b>larger.</b> Construction on the Basilica began in 1921 after Father Baker unveiled plans at a parish council meeting to build a shrine in homage to the Blessed Mother. Because of Baker's influence in the community and well-known charitable reputation across the nation, he was able to get sufficient financial support to begin construction quickly. Baker solicited support for his project, and thousands from across the nation contributed funding both large and small, mostly through a direct-mail fundraising club. Designed by Emile Ulrich, the basilica was constructed at a cost of $3.2 million, but the project was completed without the parish incurring any debt.|$|E

Sakurai described Alcor's enigmatic appeal as laying in the aspect of being part of <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> than himself.

500|$|Others, like Harold Bloom, have {{emphasized}} the [...] "exhausted landscape", the completion, the finality of death, although [...] "Winter descends here as a man might hope to die, with a natural sweetness". If death in itself is final, here {{it comes with a}} lightness, a softness, also pointing to [...] "an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief." [...] The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging [...] "to <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> than the self", as James O'Rourke expresses it, but the cycle comes to an end each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied {{at the end of the}} poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats's own possible fear.|$|E

That year, she starred in Mark Robson's war picture Lost Command for Columbia Pictures opposite Anthony Quinn, Alain Delon, and George Segal. Quinn expressed his love of working with Cardinale, stating that although he adored Cardinale and Loren equally, [...] "I relate easier to Claudia, Sophia creates an impression of <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> than life, something unobtainable. But Claudia – she's not easy, still she's within reach". She also played a Mexican marquessa in Richard Brooks' Western The Professionals, uniting her on screen once again with Burt Lancaster in what she [...] considered to be her best American film. The following year, she appeared in Una rosa per tutti (A Rose for Everyone) and in Alexander Mackendrick's sex farce Don't Make Waves opposite Tony Curtis. Although occasional funny moments were noted, Don't Make Waves was generally panned by the critics {{and the lack of}} chemistry with co-star Curtis was highlighted. Leonard Maltin, though, described the film as [...] "a gem".|$|E

[...] Large-data studies of flow experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task. [...] For example, flow experiences {{can be obtained by}} prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires. [...] A classic example is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory. [...] One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1939, {{with the}} risk of war with Nazi Germany increasing, {{it was clear to}} the Royal Navy that it needed more escort ships to counter the threat from Kriegsmarine U-boats. One {{particular}} concern was the need to protect shipping off the east coast of Britain. What was needed was <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> and faster than trawlers, but still cheap enough to be built in large numbers, preferably at small merchant shipyards, as larger yards were already busy. To meet this requirement, the Smiths Dock Company of Middlesbrough, a specialist in the design and build of fishing vessels, offered a development of its 700-ton, [...] whale catcher Southern Pride. They were intended as small convoy escort ships that could be produced quickly and cheaply in large numbers. Despite naval planners' intentions that they be deployed for coastal convoys, their long range meant that they became the mainstay of Mid-Ocean Escort Force convoy protection {{during the first half of}} the war.|$|E
2500|$|For {{instance}} {{objects and}} {{people do not have}} a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans {{in the context of their}} culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something. Viewing representation in such a way focuses on understanding how language and systems of knowledge production work to create and circulate meanings. Representation is simply the process in which such meanings are constructed. In much the same way as the post-structuralists, this approach to representation considers it as <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> than any one single representation. A similar perspective is viewing representation as part of a larger field, as Mitchell, saying, [...] "…representation (in memory, in verbal descriptions, in images) not only 'mediates' our knowledge (of slavery and of many other things), but obstructs, fragments, and negates that knowledge" [...] and proposes a move away from the perspective that representations are merely [...] "objects representing", towards a focus on the relationships and processes through which representations are produced, valued, viewed and exchanged.|$|E

She remarked, [...] "I thought it was brilliant. It's just amazing. Absolutely brilliant". She particularly praised the nose and mouth. Richard Stone, the most prolific of Royal portrait painters, praised the painting in that it captured Catherine's true warmth, saying [...] "I liked it, very much so. So often with official portraits they can be rather stiff and starchy, but this has a lovely informality about it, and a warmth to it. It was jolly brave of him to paint it well over lifesize, because that's extremely difficult. It's very challenging to do <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> than life, {{and he seems to}} have pulled it off very well." [...] Royal Society of Portrait Painters president Alistair Adams suggested that there [...] "are no airs and graces, there's no background context to allude to success or power – it's very much on a level of one to one with the viewer. It's quite natural, it's open, it's straightforward and very pure – it's immediate and not overly sentimental."

2500|$|Ethical {{conduct is}} {{justified}} by reasons {{that go beyond}} prudence to [...] "something bigger than the individual," [...] addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as [...] "somehow universal", specifically in the injunction to 'love thy neighbor as thyself', interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight {{to the interests of}} others as one gives to one's own interests. This universalising step, which Singer traces from Kant to Hare, is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists, from Hobbes to David Gauthier, who tie morality to prudence. Universalisation leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues, on the strength of the thought that one's own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others. Taking these into account, one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that is most likely to maximise the interests of those affected; utilitarianism has been arrived at. Singer's universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them, whereas a Kantian's applies to the judgments of rational agents (in Kant's kingdom of ends, or Rawls's Original Position, etc.). Singer regards Kantian universalisation as unjust to animals. As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of Practical Ethics, arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as 'the paradox of hedonism', which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it, and the need most people feel to relate to <b>something</b> <b>larger</b> than their own concerns.|$|E
