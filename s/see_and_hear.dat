5|$|On {{his return}} voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days {{in what would}} become his only visit to that region. He was greeted {{as if he were}} a head of state, rather than a physicist, which {{included}} a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> differently at night {{with a focus on}} bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams.|$|E
25|$|Since 1988, Hay-on-Wye {{has been}} the venue for a {{literary}} festival, now sponsored by The Daily Telegraph newspaper, which draws a claimed 80,000 visitors over ten days {{at the beginning of}} June to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> big literary names from all over the world.|$|E

25|$|Harvard law {{professor}} Alan Dershowitz {{wrote that the}} problem with the report is what its composers willfully and deliberately refused to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear.</b> He said that the commission ignored easily accessible videotapes that show Hamas operatives routinely firing rockets from behind human shields, and the report dismissed eyewitness accounts published by reputable newspapers and admissions by Hamas leaders regarding Hamas military activities.|$|E
25|$|J. B. Rhine's {{experiments}} with Zener cards were discredited {{due to the}} discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being {{able to read the}} symbols {{from the back of the}} cards and being able to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow's {{rise to the}} Industrial Revolution {{was shown}} by cotton, iron and steel trading, with a cotton {{printing}} press showing images of finished goods, and charting the markets for the city's products.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game. Originally, these were closed rehearsals that the band {{eventually}} opened up to friends and family members. Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the street. Today, upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. Many of these people do not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours just for a chance to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the band.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} and most {{successful}} of Boughton's works is the opera The Immortal Hour, {{an adaptation of}} the play by Fiona Macleod (the pseudonym of William Sharp) based on Celtic mythology. Having been successful in Glastonbury and well received in Birmingham, {{the director of the}} then new Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Barry Jackson, decided to take the Glastonbury Festival Players' production to London where it achieved the record breaking run of over 600 performances. On its arrival at the Regent Theatre in 1922, it secured an initial run of over 200 consecutive performances and a further 160 in 1923, with a highly successful revival in 1932. People came to see the opera {{on more than one occasion}} (including members of the Royal family) and especially to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the young Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies whose portrayal as Etain began her professional acting career.|$|E

25|$|Other {{adjustments}} that CBS made {{in hopes}} of improving its coverage included hiring reporter Sonny Hill to cover the league on a full-time basis. CBS also put microphones and cameras on team huddles to allow viewers to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> coaches at work. Finally, CBS introduced a halftime segment called Red Auerbach on Roundball, featuring the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics coach. The segment intended to not only educate CBS' viewers about {{the complexities of the}} pro game, but also to teach young players how to improve their skills. They also subtly introduced audiences to an all-star team based on Auerbach's criteria such as screening and passing. In a Red on Roundball halftime segment which appeared on CBS' NBA telecasts in the 1973–74 season, Auerbach and referee Mendy Rudolph discussed and demonstrated the practice of flopping with obvious disapproval.|$|E
25|$|On 14 July 1827 Guerrero sailed from Havana for Africa. Her {{departure}} {{was noted}} (along {{with that of}} several other suspected slave ships) by British commissioners in Havana. About 700 Africans, some of whom may have been forcibly taken from other slave ships, were on Guerrero when it sailed from Africa for Cuba. On 19 December 1827 Guerrero was sailing south towards Cuba in the Florida Straits carrying 561 Africans who had survived the voyage when it was spotted by HMS Nimble near Orange Cay (on the Great Bahama Bank). Nimble was smaller and more lightly armed (crew of 56, with, by various reports, eight, five or just three guns) than Guerrero. Nimble fired two shots to order the suspected slave ship to stop for inspection, but Guerrero ran, starting a five-hour chase during which the weather turned bad and night came on. As Nimble closed {{the distance between the}} ships they commenced firing at each other. The crew on the lightship Caesar, stationed on Carysfort Reef near Key Largo, could <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the battle, which appeared to be about ten miles away.|$|E
25|$|Most {{aircraft}} arriving into Manchester Airport use the Instrument Landing System, {{which in}} line with most other airports has a glide slope of 3 degrees equal to descending 318 feet per nautical mile. The prevailing wind direction is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practice this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle and Heald Green and takeoff towards Knutsford. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, lining up to the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has 3 stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN {{from the north and}} east and MIRSI from the west. If you live within 20 miles of the airport, you will likely <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Illyan {{begins as}} an {{operative}} of Barrayaran Imperial Security Service - imperial intelligence and counter-intelligence agency. He {{has had a}} bioelectronic device implanted in his head: an eidetic memory chip that records everything he <b>sees</b> <b>and</b> <b>hears</b> <b>and</b> allows him to recall that information instantly. This was done on a whim by Barrayaran Emperor Ezar, after {{he learned that the}} technology had been recently invented on the planet Illyrica. Since most such implants produced schizophrenia or worse in their hosts, it is clear that Ezar regarded Illyan as expendable.|$|R

500|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning (chapter 38), the enthroned {{figure of}} High tells Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) that two ravens named Huginn and Muninn sit on Odin's shoulders.

As a result, Odin is kept informed of many events. High adds that it is from this association that Odin is referred to as [...] "raven-god". The above-mentioned stanza from Grímnismál is then quoted.|$|E

500|$|One {{of those}} who {{addressed}} the design problem was Lewis Miller. [...] A wealthy inventor and industrialist, Miller supervised a Sunday school in Canton, Ohio, and later one in Akron. [...] When the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Akron decided to construct a new building, Miller worked with several architects to plan the Sunday-school wing. [...] He devised a plan in which wedge-shaped classrooms were separated by partitions radiating {{from the direction of}} a central superintendent's platform. [...] Doors on the platform-facing side of each classroom could be closed during grade-separated lessons, or opened to allow all pupils to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the superintendent during school-wide exercises. [...] The new church, following these plans, was constructed in 1866–67.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in history, the Presidential Inaugural Committee opened the full length of National Mall, which extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, as the public viewing area for the {{swearing-in}} ceremony. The presidential committee set aside a section of the mall close to the U.S.Capitol for people holding reserved tickets for the inaugural event. The committee directed the opening of the entire National Mall to make the event [...] "'the most open and accessible in history,' allowing those who [...] get the [...] tickets to the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds to fill the mall". To enable people in attendance to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the swearing-in ceremony, the committee arranged for placement of JumboTrons at points along the entire mall.|$|E
500|$|Physically, kitsune {{are noted}} for having {{as many as}} nine tails. Generally, {{a greater number of}} tails {{indicates}} an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. These [...] gain the abilities to <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (omniscience).
