5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in <b>spider</b> <b>legs</b> are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
500|$|New Cutie Honey is set {{one hundred}} years after {{the events of the}} {{original}} 1973 Cutie Honey television series, in the fictional Cosplay City. [...] vows to rein in a citywide crime wave and restore peace. However, a self-proclaimed [...] "Lord of Darkness" [...] named , feared even by other criminals there, seeks to derail his efforts in the first four episodes. A large freelance gang of armored, axe-wielding mutant motorcyclists, joined by two of Dolmeck's allies—, a very young-looking red-haired girl who rides naked in a humanoid robot slightly shorter than him and can psychokinetically move objects and people; and , who wears decorative robotic <b>spider</b> <b>legs</b> and an electronic [...] scope, and can use stealth technology, see through objects, sense spacetime disturbances, and trap people in strong webs—attack an outdoor meeting of the Mayor and his fellow citizens. Dolmeck then halts the attackers and asks the Mayor to rule the city with and under him. Unknown to all, Light's secretary [...] is a gynoid who previously could transform into the titular red-haired, sword-wielding heroine Cutie Honey or summon other personas and powers, often after shouting [...] "Honey Flash!" [...] She later confronts the biker gang and another female minion of Dolmeck, and inadvertently regains those abilities and lost memories before defeating the group.|$|E

40|$|Currently robot {{designers}} are ever more inspired by nature {{to develop and}} design legged robots to mimic the walking style of insects over uneven and rough surfaces. In this work, walking behavior and method {{of a kind of}} spider Araneus diadematus are investigated. Image processing techniques are used to obtain kinematic param-eters of the <b>spider’s</b> <b>legs.</b> The positions of defi ned points on the <b>spider’s</b> <b>legs</b> were recorded in terms of time. After extracting the necessary data, a linkage mechanism of the legs was designed. By using the position of defi ned points on <b>spider’s</b> <b>legs</b> as input to our model and implementation of trigonometric relations, parameters such as angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration of each link were obtained. Then, a model of linkage mechanism for the <b>spider’s</b> <b>legs</b> in SIMULINK environment of MATLAB was created. By allocating mechani-cal properties of linkages such as mass and moment of inertia to the model, quantities of torque in joints, which were needed for producing the traversed path of <b>spider’s</b> <b>legs,</b> were obtained. These quantities can be used for selection and control of actuators in the novel robotic system in order to mimic the spider’s walking style. ...|$|R

2500|$|Mr. Freeze {{appears in}} The Batman, voiced by Clancy Brown. Unlike most {{versions}} of the character, this iteration is a bank robber that fires ice blasts directly out of his hands. After a successful diamond heist, Victor Fries is pursued by the vigilante Batman into a cryogenic lab. Victor is presumed dead after being accidentally locked in cryogenic chamber and electrocuted. When Victor awakens, he discovers his new cryokinetic abilities and forces a scientist to create a cryogenic suit to contain his condition. In the episode [...] "The Big Chill", Mr. Freeze commits a series of robberies and freezes Batman's body. Upon freezing a park, he holds the police at bay until the Dark Knight defeats him. In the episode [...] "Fire and Ice", Mr. Freeze teams up with Firefly to put Gotham in a permanent winter. Batman defeats both and leaves them tied up outside the police station. In the episode [...] "The Icy Depths", Mr. Freeze competes against the Penguin to claim an umbrella that {{is in fact a}} map to a sunken treasure. When the location is found, Freeze freezes the surrounding waters so that he can access the boat. When the ice starts to melt, he fights the Penguin to claim the treasure. Both of them are fished out of the water by the police. An older version appears in the episode [...] "Artifacts". In the year 2027, Mr. Freeze's powers have increased to the point that he wears a special mecha suit but he also loses an unhealthy amount of weight and the ability to walk and is forced to use mechanical <b>spider</b> <b>legs.</b> After a near-death fight with Batman and Nightwing, he places himself in cryogenic suspension until someone wakes him up in the future of 3027. Once his suit is repaired, he continues terrorizing Gotham. Eventually, law enforcement officers use Batman's methods to defeat Freeze and place him in a special cell. In the episode [...] "Rumors", Mr. Freeze is among the villains captured by the titular villain. In the episode [...] "The Joining" [...] (Part 2), Mr. Freeze joins the Joker, Bane and the Penguin in fighting the Joining when Arkham Asylum is attacked. Freeze saves Commissioner Gordon by freezing one of the Joining's robots. In the episode [...] "The Batman/Superman Story" [...] (Part 1), Mr. Freeze is hired by Lex Luthor, along with Black Mask, Clayface and Bane, to kidnap Lois Lane and use Lois as bait for Superman. He and the villains are defeated by Superman, Batman and Robin.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{inherent}} compliance, soft actuated joints {{are becoming increasingly}} important for robotic applications, especially when human-robot-interactions are expected. Several of these flexible actuators are inspired by biological models. One perfect showpiece for biomimetic robots is the <b>spider</b> <b>leg,</b> because it combines lightweight design and graceful movements with powerful and dynamic actuation. Building on this motivation, the review article focuses on compliant robotic joints inspired by the function principle of the <b>spider</b> <b>leg.</b> The mechanism is introduced by an overview of existing biological and biomechanical research. Thereupon a classification of robots that are bio-inspired by spider joints is presented.

Yet before she reached the wall she found herself down and crawling upon {{her hands and knees}} straight toward the hole from which the two eyes still clung to hers. At the very threshold of the opening she made a last, heroic stand, battling against the force that drew her on; but in the end she succumbed. With a gasp that ended in a sob Tara of Helium passed through the aperture into the chamber beyond.|$|E
60|$|The girl's captor narrated {{once more}} {{the story of her}} capture. He stated facts just as they had occurred, without embellishment, his voice as expressionless as his face, and his story was {{received}} in the same manner that it was delivered. The creatures seemed totally lacking in emotion, or, at least, the capacity to express it. It was impossible to judge what impression the story made upon them, or even if they heard it. Their protruding eyes simply stared and occasionally the muscles of their mouths opened and closed. Familiarity did not lessen the horror the girl felt for them. The more she saw of them the more repulsive they seemed. Often her body was shaken by convulsive shudders as she looked at the kaldanes, but when her eyes wandered to the beautiful bodies and she could for a moment expunge the heads from her consciousness the effect was soothing and refreshing, though when the bodies lay, headless, upon the floor they were quite as shocking as the heads mounted on bodies. But by far the most grewsome and uncanny sight of all was that of the heads crawling about upon their <b>spider</b> <b>legs.</b> If one of these should approach and touch her Tara of Helium was positive that she should scream, while should one attempt to crawl up her person--ugh! the very idea induced a feeling of faintness.|$|E
6000|$|Take as {{an example}} that into which we rowed that day in Monos, as the old Spaniards named it, from monkeys long since extinct; a curved shingle beach some fifty yards across, shut in right and left by steep rocks wooded down almost to the sea, and worn into black caves and crannies, festooned with the night-blowing Cereus, which crawls about with hairy green legs, like a tangle of giant spiders. [...] Among it, in the cracks, upright Cerei, like {{candelabra}} twenty and thirty feet high, thrust themselves aloft into the brushwood. An Aroid {103b} rides parasitic on roots and stems, sending downward long air-roots, and upward brown rat-tails of flower, and broad leaves, four feet by two, which wither into whity-brown paper, and are used, being tough and fibrous, to wrap round the rowlocks of the oars. Tufts of Karatas, top, spread their long prickly leaves among the bush of 'rastrajo,' or second growth after the primeval forest has been cleared, which dips suddenly right and left to the beach. [...] It, and the little strip of flat ground behind it, hold a three- roomed cottage--of course on stilts; a shed {{which serves as a}} kitchen; a third ruined building, which is tenanted mostly by lizards and creeping flowers; some twenty or thirty coconut trees; and on {{the very edge of the}} sea an almond-tree, its roots built up to seaward with great stones, its trunk hung with fishing lines; and around it, scattered on the shingle, strange shells, bits of coral, coconuts and their fragments; almonds from the tree; the round scaly fruit of the Mauritia palm, which has probably floated across the gulf from the forests of the Orinoco or the Caroni; and the long seeds of the mangrove, in shape like a roach-fisher's float, and already germinating, their leaves showing at the upper end, a tiny root at the lower. In that shingle they will not take root: but they are quite ready to go to sea again next tide, and wander on for weeks, and for hundreds of miles, till they run ashore at last on a congenial bed of mud, throw out <b>spider</b> <b>legs</b> right and left, and hide the foul mire with their gay green leaves.|$|E

60|$|In fine weather, when by the spy-glass on {{the hill}} the sea was {{observed}} to run low upon the reef, {{there would be a}} sound of preparation in the very early morning; and before the sun had risen from behind Ben More, the tender would steam out of the bay. Over fifteen sea-miles of the great blue Atlantic rollers she ploughed her way, trailing at her tail a brace of wallowing stone-lighters. The open ocean widened upon either board, and the hills of the mainland began to go down on the horizon, before she came to her unhomely destination, and lay-to at last where the rock clapped its black head above the swell, with the tall iron barrack on its <b>spider</b> <b>legs,</b> and the truncated tower, and the cranes waving their arms, and the smoke of the engine-fire rising in the mid-sea. An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no pleasant assemblage of shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might play for a whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but that of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself. Times were different upon Dhu Heartach when it blew, and the night fell dark, and the neighbour lights of Skerryvore and Rhu-val were quenched in fog, and the men sat prisoned high up in their iron drum, that then resounded with the lashing of the sprays. Fear sat with them in their sea-beleaguered dwelling; and the colour changed in anxious faces when some greater billow struck the barrack, and its pillars quivered and sprang under the blow. It was then that the foreman builder, Mr. Goodwillie, whom I see before me still in his rock-habit of undecipherable rags, would get his fiddle down and strike up human minstrelsy amid the music of the storm. But it was in sunshine only that I saw Dhu Heartach; and it was in sunshine, or the yet lovelier summer afterglow, that the steamer would return to Earraid, ploughing an enchanted sea; the obedient lighters, relieved of their deck cargo, riding in her wake more quietly; and the steersman upon each, as she rose on the long swell, standing tall and dark against the shining west.|$|E

[...] and he extended {{what appeared to be}} a bundle of tentacles from the posterior part of his head.

If he is hurt, I would suffer if I remained connected with him; but the instant one of them is injured or becomes sick we desert it for another. As we would suffer the pains of their physical injuries, similarly do we enjoy the physical pleasures of the rykors. When your body becomes fatigued you are comparatively useless; it is sick, you are sick; if it is killed, you die. You are the slave of a mass of stupid flesh and bone and blood. There is nothing more wonderful about your carcass than there is about the carcass of a banth. It is only your brain that makes you superior to the banth, but your brain is bound by the limitations of your body. Not so, ours. With us brain is everything. Ninety per centum of our volume is brain. We have only the simplest of vital organs and they are very small for they do not have to assist in the support of a complicated system of nerves, muscles, flesh and bone. We have no lungs, for we do not require air. Far below the levels to which we can take the rykors is a vast network of burrows where the real life of the kaldane is lived. There the air-breathing rykor would perish as you would perish. There we have stored vast quantities of food in hermetically sealed chambers. It will last forever. Far beneath the surface is water that will flow for countless ages after the surface water is exhausted. We are preparing for the time we know must come--the time when the last vestige of the Barsoomian atmosphere is spent--when the waters and the food are gone. For this purpose were we created, that there might not perish from the planet Nature's divinest creation--the perfect brain." ...|$|E
