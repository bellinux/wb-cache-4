40|$|One of {{the best}} {{suggested}} solutions for prevention of severe-slugging flow conditions at offshore oilfields is the active control of the production choke valve. This thesis is a study of robust control solutions for stabilizing multiphase flow inside the riser systems; through S-riser experiments and OLGA simulations. ?Nonlinearity? as the important characteristic of slugging system poses some challenges for control. Focus of this thesis is on online tuning rules that take into account nonlinearity of the slugging system. The main objective has been to increase the stability of riser systems at higher levels of valve openings with more production rates. Similar {{research has been done}} previously, but is repeated in this thesis using new systematic <b>tuning</b> <b>methods.</b> Three <b>different</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> have been applied in this thesis. One is Shams?s set-point overshoot method developed by Shamsozzhoha (Shamsuzzoha and Skogestad 2010). The other is IMC- (Internal Model Control) based <b>tuning</b> <b>method</b> with respect to the identified model of the system from closed-loop step test. The last <b>tuning</b> <b>method</b> is simple PI tuning rules with gain scheduling for the whole operating range of the system considering the nonlinearity of the static gain. The two latter methods have been developed very recently by Jahanshahi and Skogestad (Jahanshahi and Skogestad 2013). Two series of experiments have been carried out using a medium-scale two-phase flow S-riser loop. A single loop control scheme with riser-base pressure as the measurement was used. The robustness of <b>different</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> was compared by slowly decreasing the set-point of the closed-loop system, which was the inlet pressure, until instability was reached. The choke valve opening was increasing gradually by decreasing the set-point. A control with a robust <b>tuning</b> <b>method</b> can maintain system stability in a large range of conditions. The choke valve was then replaced with a quicker valve after the first set of experiments. The same experiments were repeated and the effect of control valve dynamics was investigated thereafter. The experiments were simulated in OLGA and the same control tests were performed. The OLGA case was constructed based on the first series of tests with valve 1 and the designed controllers with <b>different</b> <b>tuning</b> strategies were applied. Results of the experiments verified those of the simulations. The <b>tuning</b> <b>method</b> with the highest robustness was thus the one which could stabilize the system at the largest choke valve opening (the lowest inlet pressure). The best <b>tuning</b> <b>method,</b> with respect to robustness is the simple PI tuning rules with gain scheduling for the whole operating range of the system. With this method, it was possible to stabilize the experimental riser system up to a choke valve opening of 37 % from an open-loop stability of 16 %. It was also able to stabilize the simulated riser system until a choke valve opening of 75 % from an open-loop stability of 26 %. Top side measurements were in general difficult to use in anti-slug control. Measurement of the topside density using a conductance probe installation was not successful. Therefore, no cascade anti-slug control schemes could be tested. </p...|$|R

40|$|Most signal {{processing}} / communications applications heavily rely on filters. For adaptive spectrum filtering and for applications that switch between sets of different filter implementations, {{it would be}} beneficial to utilize just one, tuneable band-pass filter. In recent years, the study of metamaterials emerged as an area of scientific research due to the unique attributes of metamaterials. Metamaterials typically are artificial structures with properties not found in nature, for instance negative refraction indexes. Their feature sizes span {{a fraction of the}} wavelength corresponding to their frequency of operation. A sub group of metamaterials, the electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures, exhibit stopbands for electromagnetic waves irrespective of polarization or angle of incidence. EBG structures prominently achieved surface wave suppression to minimise cross talk between neighbouring devices and improving antenna efficiency by acting as a perfect magnetic conductor within a certain frequency range. The thesis investigates the suitability of EBG structures for filter implementations. The goal is to provide a tuneable band-pass filter for adaptive spectrum filtering and communication applications. The bandgap of an infinite array of EBG cells is numerically determined. Based on those results, an EBG band-pass filter implementation on a printed circuit board (PCB) is designed, fabricated and characterized. <b>Different</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> were incorporated into the PCB design to create a tuneable EBG band-pass filter.

40|$|Student:		Anders HammerSupervisor:	Kjetil UhlenContact:		Daniel MotaCollaboration with:	Voith HydroProblem descriptionIEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) {{presented}} in 2005 a new PSS structure named IEEE PSS 4 B (Figure 0 1). Voith Hydro wants to analyse {{the pros and}} cons of using this new type compared to older structures. The PSS 4 B is a multi-band stabilizer that has three separate bands and is specially designed to handle different oscillation frequencies in a wide range. Until now, Voith Hydro has used the common PSS 2 B in their installations, but in the future they will probably start to implement the new PSS 4 B. This master thesis will seek to find an answer on following questions: 	How should the PSS 4 B be tuned to give the best damping of the local and inter-area oscillation mode? 	Will an implementation of PSS 4 B give a better result compared to PSS 2 B? 	What are {{the pros and cons}} of PSS 2 B and PSS 4 B? Figure 0 1 : The multi-band stabilizer, IEEE PSS 4 B [1]. MethodIn order to test and compare different PSS models, a simple two-area network model is created in a computer simulation programme (SIMPOW). One of the generating units is a hydro generator, which has a model of a static excitation system made by Voith Hydro. This network is characterised by a poorly damped inter-area oscillation mode, and in addition some local oscillation modes related to each machine. Different PSS structures (PSS 2 B and PSS 4 B) are then tuned and installed in the excitation system of the hydro generator, in order to improve the stability of the network. <b>Different</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> of the PSS 4 B are designed, tested and later compared with the more common stabilizer the PSS 2 B. Simplifications are made where parts of the stabilizer is disconnected in order to adapt the control structure to the applied network and its oscillations. Totally 5 <b>different</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> are presented, and all these methods are based on a pole placement approach and tuning of lead/lag-filters. ResultsInitial eigenvalues of the different setups are analysed and several disturbances are studied in time domain analysis, in order to describe the robustness of the system. Figure 2 illustrates the rotor speed of the generator, where the different PSS s are implemented. PSS 4 B is clearly resulting in increased damping of all speed oscillations in this network. The same results can also be seen in an eigenvalue analysis. Conclusion The best overall damping obtained in this master thesis occurs when the high frequency band of the PSS 4 B is tuned first, and in order to maximize the damping of the local oscillation mode in the network. The intermediate frequency band is then tuned as a second step, according to the inter-area oscillation mode. Results of this tuning technique show a better performance of the overall damping in the network, compared to PSS 2 B. The improvement of the damping of the inter-area oscillation mode is not outstanding, and the reason is that the applied machine is relative small compared to the other generating units in the network. The oscillation modes in the network (local and inter-area) have a relative small frequency deviation. A network containing a wider range of oscillation frequencies will probably obtain a greater advantage of implementing a multi-band stabilizer...|$|R

40|$|The {{liquid level}} control in tanks and flow control between {{cascaded}} or coupled tanks {{are the basic}} control problems exist in process industries nowadays. Liquids are to be pumped, stored or mixed in tanks for various types of chemical processes and all these require essential control and regulation of flow and liquid level. In this paper, <b>different</b> types of <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> are proposed for Proportional-Integral (PI) controller and are further improved with integration of Advanced Process Control (APC) method such as feedforward and gain scheduling to essentially control the liquid level in Tank 2 of a coupled tank system. The MATLAB/Simulink tools are used to design PI controller using pole-placement, Ciancone, Cohen Coon and modified Ziegler-Nichols <b>tuning</b> <b>method</b> with Cohen Coon <b>tuning</b> <b>method</b> {{found to have a}} better performance. Advanced process control such as feedforward-plus-PI, Gain Scheduling (GS) based PI, Internal Model Control (IMC) based PI, feedforward-plus-GS-based PI and feedforward-plus-IMC-based PI controllers are further tested as improvement version to further compare the significance of the advanced process control outcomes hence GS-PI, improved GI-base PI-plus FF found to have better performance. The GS method is built over five operating points to approximate the system’s nonlinearity and is eventually combined with feedforward control to yield a much better performance...|$|R
40|$|Floating {{wind turbine}} will suffer from more fatigue and {{ultimate}} loads compared with fixed-bottom installation {{due to its}} floating foundation, while structural control offers a possible solution for direct load reduction. This paper deals with the modelling and parameter tuning of a spar-type floating wind turbine with a tuned mass damper (TMD) installed in nacelle. First of all, a mathematical model for the platform surge-heave-pitch motion and TMD-nacelle interaction is established based on D’Alembert’s principle. Both intrinsic dynamics and external hydro and mooring effects are captured in the model, while tower flexibility is also featured. Then, <b>different</b> parameter <b>tuning</b> <b>methods</b> are adopted to determine the TMD parameters for effective load reduction. Finally, fully coupled nonlinear wind turbine simulations with different designs are conducted in different wind and wave conditions. The results demonstrate that the design of TMD with small spring and damping coefficients will achieve much load reduction in the above rated condition. However, it will deteriorate system performance when the turbine is working in the below rated or parked situations. In contrast, the design with large spring and damping constants will produce moderate load reduction in all working conditions...|$|R
