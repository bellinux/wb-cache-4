It is intended {{as an aid to}} those who require a good and readily accessible overview of the economic context of tropical timber, covering production, consumption and trade in the principal products, and is based on the most reliabme and most recent data available. They are presented here in the form of figures, maps and trend curves, so that the major elements of the world situation and its developments to be understood at a glance. The work is based on the annually updated statistics of the ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organization), and on the results of the « Forest Sector Questionnaire » introduced jointly by the UN-ECE, the FAO, Eurostat and the ITTO. The final section contains figures presenting more global economic data, setting this survey of the tropical timber economy in a wider perspective. forest, tropical, rainforest, log, timber, Sawn timber, plywood, Veneer, <b>Secondary</b> <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> imports, exports, trade, volume, value, trend, forest cover, wood consumption, firewood, pulpwood, forest economics...|$|E

At {{the same time there}} has been increased use of non-tariff barriers to restrict their trade. These barriers could have an important impact on the trade of <b>secondary</b> <b>processed</b> <b>products,</b> as well as the production, consumption and trade of wood products used in their manufacture. This paper describes the development of an economic model of the international trade of <b>secondary</b> <b>processed</b> wood <b>products</b> within the structure of the spatial equilibrium Global Forest Products Model. The model was used to assess the effect of removing non-tariff barriers to New Zealand exports of prefabricated housing, and builder's carpentry and joinery to three key trading partners...|$|R
40|$|Romania's {{international}} agrifood trade {{increased significantly}} {{during the last}} decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood trade balance showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, {{for the first time}} in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood trade balance turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>processed</b> <b>products.</b> A higher ratio of <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country's food industry. The results for total trade show that the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> represented at most 46 % of the Romanian exports, and at least 63 % of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade. The analysis is detailed for intra and extra-EU trade and by main partners and groups of products...|$|R
40|$|Both baobab and {{tamarind}} are {{plant species}} with high potential for arid and semi-arid {{areas in the}} developing world. They can provide food, medicine, wood {{and a number of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> for income generation that can help to meet basic needs of an increasing number of people in a context of decreasing land availability. Farmers in these regions, however, need improved planting material with known properties for integration in (traditional and improved) agroforestry and cropping systems. They also need well-documented planting techniques for sustained yields and production. Improved disease-free cultivars are not available; rapid and easy methods of germplasm production/multiplication are not developed; and distribution pathways are mostly non-existent. Integration into agroforestry systems could stabilise them, but trees with desired growth habit have yet to be developed. There is also a need to collect/conserve/utilise germplasm for tree improvement. Market chains and infrastructure are poorly developed. The project addresses issues of new crop/niche development through a holistic research approach and envisages multidisciplinary activities to broaden availability of improved plant material for introduction into agroforestry systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the side}} effects of the stricter regulation on tropical hardwood or timber imports. It considers the place of Europe within the global timber market, where Europe accounts only for a very limited share. It also explains the high selectivity of European markets, with its consequences. While tropical wooden furniture and other <b>secondary</b> <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> are not considered as timber here, their question is also discussed. The number of empirical studies specifically dealing with {{the side effects}} of EU regulations is limited, but the results are converging, showing that these regulations have a general adverse effect, contrary to the initial aim of promoting the sustainability of tropical timbers. These side effects are essentially to divert the trade towards countries with lower standards, and to add a burden on most of the producing countries which have already a set of comparative disadvantages for the production of legal or sustainable timber. The effects are positive on a limited number of companies which markets are very dependent of Europe. The question is then analysed from a broader perspective, replacing the effects of the EU regulations as an incidental factor compared to the increasing consumption of tropical timber by the three developing giants: Brazil, India and China. timber trade, trade regulation, environmental regulation, Europe, tropical timber, tropical hardwwod, side effect, adverse effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{free trade}} {{agreement}} (FTA) between SACU and Mercosur would be significant globally, {{as it would be}} a truly "south-south" relationship between three of the developing world's emerging agricultural powers, namely Argentina, Brazil and South Africa. In this article, the GTAP database and the associated general equilibrium model is used to assess the potential welfare and trade gains from such an agreement. The results show that there are comfortable welfare gains for South Africa derived from a better use of land, labour and capital (enhanced allocative efficiency); increased net investment increasing the amount of capital employed in the economy; and a small contribution from increased labour employment. These gains are negated somewhat by terms of trade that go against South Africa. However, an FTA with Mercosur is not good for the South African agriculture sector. Imports of agricultural products increase dramatically, mostly in terms of increased imports of <b>secondary</b> (<b>processed)</b> agricultural <b>products.</b> Export gains are modest, but are largely from trade creation rather than trade diversion. Furthermore, there are marginal reductions in the prices of all agricultural products, which benefits consumers but harm producers. Overall, the FTA is bad news for South Africa's commercial farmers. Whether small-scale and emerging farmers benefit depends on whether they are food deficit or food surplus producers. © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Concern {{about the}} fate of waste {{products}} produced by a wide range of industrial processes has led to the realization that they may have potential uses and, therefore, value. In an effort to develop more sustainable processes and reduce waste storage, the use of waste as a resource has been gaining attention worldwide. Consequently, there have been a large number of studies aimed at utilizing such wastes. Conversion of Large Scale Wastes into Value-added Products discusses various selected classes of large-scale waste and their current applications and potential future applications. This book provides a snapshot of a continually evolving field, which includes both well-established processes and a drive toward developing strategies for new applications of wastes. The first chapter provides a general introduction to the area of large-scale waste utilization, including drivers for waste recovery, and <b>secondary</b> <b>processes</b> and <b>products</b> for waste reuse. Subsequent chapters discuss applications and potential applications in specific classes of large-scale waste: •	Various types of waste generated from different metal processing operations •	Waste generated by coal combustion, a major source of power generation that produces enormous quantities of waste •	Waste electrical and electronic equipment, important for recycling finite resources and reducing health and environmental risks •	Food waste, a significant and diverse waste stream with economic and environmental impacts The final chapter presents a general conclusion to the broad subject of waste utilization, summarizing the topics and addressing future trends in waste research. </p...|$|R

30|$|The primary process {{does not}} always fulfill the direct need or desire for the object, {{in which case the}} primary process becomes illusionary; by fantasy it allows one to imagine the {{fulfillment}} of desire (Freud, [1999], p. 181). The <b>secondary</b> <b>process,</b> the formation of the ego, produces a sense of reality. Where the id is disorganised and impulsive and relates to basic instincts, the ego (which is formed from the id) is a kind of supervisor, working to oversee the id (Freud, [1999], p. 181). Also, the <b>secondary</b> <b>process</b> affords recognition between internal and external fantasies, allowing the developing child to distinguish between real and imagined objects. The <b>secondary</b> <b>process</b> also creates a distinction between two or more desired objects, creating a degree of calculation within the child’s psyche and allowing for the deferment of satisfaction.|$|R

40|$|Primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>processes</b> are the {{foundational}} axes of the Freudian mental apparatus: one horizontally as {{a tendency to}} associate, the primary process, and one vertically as the ability for perspective taking, the <b>secondary</b> <b>process.</b> Primary process mentation is not only supposed to be dominant in the unconscious but also, for example, in dreams. The present study tests {{the hypothesis that the}} mental activity during REM-sleep has more characteristics of the primary process, while during non-REM-sleep more <b>secondary</b> <b>process</b> operations take place. Because the solving of a rebus requires the ability to non-contexually condensate the literal reading of single stimuli into a new one, rebus solving is a primary process operation by excellence. In a replication of the dream-rebus study of Shevrin and Fisher (1967), a rebus, which consisted of an image of a comb (German: “Kamm”) and an image of a raft (German: “Floß”), resulting in the German rebus word “kampflos” (Engl. : without a struggle), was flashed subliminally (at 1 ms) to 20 participants before going to sleep. Upon consecutive awakenings participants were asked for a dream report, free associations and an image description. Based on objective association norms, there were significantly more conceptual associations referring to Kamm and Floß indexing <b>secondary</b> <b>process</b> mentation when subjects were awakened from non-REM sleep as compared to REM-awakenings. There were not significantly more rebus associations referring to kampflos indexing primary process mentation when awakened from REM-sleep as compared to non-REM awakenings. However, when the associations were scored on the basis of each subject’s individual norms, there was a rebus effect with more idiosyncratic rebus associations in awakenings after REM than after non-REM-sleep. Our results support the general idea that REM-sleep is characterized by primary process thinking, while non-REM-sleep mentation follows the rules of the <b>secondary</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

So far, only one single study tried to test this hypothesis applying the method of subliminal stimulation on the sleep-dream cycle (Shevrin & Fisher, 1967). In this experimental study we successfully replicated these early findings. Moreover, additional stimuli were used and neurophysiological measurements recorded.

Domestic Support and Border Measures for <b>Processed</b> Horticultural <b>Products</b> In horticultural markets, trade barriers often apply to the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> whereas domestic support applies to farm-produced raw commodities. Here we assess the effects of such trade barriers and domestic support by simulating the effects of policy reform on global processing tomato markets, which are faced with modest <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> tariffs and high domestic support in the European Union (EU). Both protection and EU subsidy drive down world welfare, but we find that reducing import tariffs for tomato products would yield greater effects on markets and larger welfare impacts outside Europe than would reductions in EU domestic support.

40|$|In his ‘Project for a {{scientific}} psychology’ Freud (1895) distinguishes two fundamental modes of mental functioning: primary processes, which aim at releasing received activations by the shortest pathways possible and <b>secondary</b> <b>processes,</b> which aim at producing adequate actions {{in order to}} realise specific alterations in the external world. In the modern neurosciences of the last 30 years numerous studies also resulted in the converging conclusion that two visual pathways could be differentiated in the brain, a dorsal pathway hosting vision for action and a ventral pathway hosting vision for identification (e. g. Ungerleider and Mishkin 1982; Milner and Goodale 1995). In this paper these psychodynamic and sensorimotor models are compared. This analysis starts with the observation that Freud, who adhered to the school of physiology of von Helmholtz, used a concept, called ‘indication of reality’, to characterise {{the function of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>process.</b> It is proposed that this concept parallels the modern notion of ‘efference copy’. On the basis of this parallel it is then proposed that the <b>secondary</b> <b>process</b> is carried by the dorsal pathway which hosts a comparison mechanism involving the efference copies. In Freud’s model <b>secondary</b> <b>process</b> functioning has an inhibiting effect on primary processes. For this and other reasons, parallels are then proposed between the primary process and ventral pathway functioning, which is constrained by interferences from the dorsal pathway. In final, a brief case description of a psychotic patient is commented from both sensorimotor and psychodynamic perspective. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
