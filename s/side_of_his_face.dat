5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when {{he was supposed to}} be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Investigating one of {{a series}} of {{large-scale}} power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with its bright lights. The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
60|$|Captain Bowers {{looked him}} up and down. He saw a man of about fifty nervously {{fingering}} the little bits of fluffy red whisker which grew at the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and trying to still the agitation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tremulous mouth.|$|R

5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Sérurier {{was born}} at Laon on 8 December 1742, the son of Mathieu-Guillaume Sérurier. The family formed part of the minor provincial nobility, his father holding the title Seigneur de Sort and the job of mole-catcher to the king's {{breeding}} stud. After 1750 his father's title became Seigneur de Saint-Gobert. Sérurier got a good education and was of sober character. He received a commission as lieutenant in the Laon militia battalion on 25 March 1755, his uncle being the unit's commander. He transferred to the Soissons militia battalion on 12 June 1758. When he heard that the Laon battalion was called {{to serve in the}} Seven Years' War he switched back to his old unit on 30 November 1758. After sustaining a bayonet wound, he transferred into the Mazarin Infantry Regiment as a cadet on 1 October 1759. At the Battle of Warburg on 31 July 1760, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick surprised the French under Louis Nicolas Victor de Felix d'Ollieres, Count Du Muy. While defending a critical post, Sérurier was hit on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> by a bullet, which broke his jaw and left a lasting scar. The injury also cost him most of his teeth. He was promoted to second lieutenant on 25 April 1762.|$|E

50|$|Melvin Burkhart (1907-2001) was a sideshow {{performer}} {{known as}} the Human Blockhead for driving a large steel spike up his nose with a hammer. He was also known as Melvin the Two-Faced Man, due to his ability to wear different facial expressions on the two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and as Melvin the Anatomical Wonder for his abilities as a contortionist. His act also included magic, sword swallowing, fire eating, and an electric chair.|$|R
50|$|Violator (also {{known as}} The Clown), {{the eldest of}} the {{brothers}} and the most prominently featured in the comics. He has blue-gray skin, a slender frame, and large red compound eyes, with two horns protruding from the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> along with a single large horn on his back. He is initially sent to Earth by Malebolgia to train the newly reborn Al Simmons, but quickly comes to resent this role, as he considers himself to be superior to all Hellspawn. He acts as Spawn's archnemesis throughout the series.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, Ginsberg {{suffered}} two minor strokes {{which were}} first diagnosed as Bell's Palsy, {{which gave him}} significant paralysis and stroke-like drooping of the muscles in one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
25|$|Édouard worked several ranches in the Willow Bunch area, herding cattle {{with the}} scout Johnny Chartrand. He ranched for {{farmers in the}} area of Willow Bunch up until age 17, when his height and weight made the job too difficult. His large height and weight may have caused a riding {{accident}} that disfigured the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> or {{it could have been a}} paralysis to the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> By 17, he was 7’1”. With his large family living in poverty, he decided to exhibit his feats of strength for profit. He toured throughout North America, going as far as California with André Gaudry, a Metis man, and Albert Légaré, Jean-Louis’ son.|$|E
25|$|He has a {{circular}} scar {{on the right}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> just above his lip. In {{the early days of}} his film career, Hung was involved in a street fight outside a Kowloon nightclub, and was stabbed with a broken cola bottle.|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{describes}} Yang Zhi {{as about}} seven chi tall, with red whiskers on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> {{and a blue}} birthmark on <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> which earns him the nickname [...] "Blue Faced Beast". He is highly skilled in martial arts and uses either a saber or a spear in battle. He is also an excellent archer as well. He is a descendant of Yang Ye, the progenitor of the Generals of the Yang Family. He works as a minor officer {{in the office of}} Gao Qiu, a Grand Marshal, in Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan).|$|R

5000|$|Love Thadani (uncredited) as [...] "Bro"/Jesus Christ - Santino's mysterious supernatural friend, {{who is the}} {{supposed}} source <b>of</b> <b>his</b> healing powers. In scenes where He speaks to Santino, <b>His</b> <b>face</b> is hidden and remains so throughout the series. Camera angles used to obscure <b>His</b> <b>face</b> are from behind Him, hair covering the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>face</b> (for <b>side</b> shots), a view <b>of</b> <b>His</b> torso part with the head offscreen (when seated), and other forms. In the [...] "afterlife" [...] scenes in the finale, sunlight obscures <b>His</b> <b>face</b> when cameras are focused on Him and {{before the end of}} the afterlife scenes, He is seen in silhouette.|$|R
25|$|Jason Matthew Patrick Moran (22 September 1967 – 21 June 2003) was an Australian {{criminal}} from Melbourne, {{and one of}} {{the leaders}} of the Moran family, notable for its involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings.

25|$|Most {{developed}} frostbite on {{the left}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as a young child. For several years thereafter, flesh rotted and infection spread, with the primitive medicine of the day unable to treat the condition. His condition worsened and Most was diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a last-gasp measure a surgeon was called in. A two-inch section of his jawbone was removed, resulting in permanent disfigurement.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Adler {{suffered}} a stroke and was briefly comatose after taking a particularly potent speedball—a cocktail of heroin and cocaine used intravenously—which caused a temporary paralysis of the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> resulting in a speech impediment. The following year, he pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace {{in relation to a}} domestic violence charge involving a woman with whom he had been living; he was sentenced to four days in jail, three years' probation, and mandatory drug counseling.|$|E

6000|$|... "When he {{is moving}} {{about in the}} trees, he looks much like a very large Squirrel, while on the ground he might {{be mistaken for a}} young Fox. His coat is a rich, dark, yellowish-brown, {{becoming}} almost black on the tail and legs. His throat usually is yellow, though sometimes it is almost white. The <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> are grayish, and his good-sized ears are grayish-white on the inside. His tail is about half as long as his body and is covered with long hair, but isn't bushy like a Squirrel's. While his general shape is that of Shadow the Weasel, his body is much heavier in proportion to his size.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{alternate}} future setting of The Dark Knight Returns, plastic surgery returns Dent's face to normal, {{but at the}} unforeseen cost of permanently destroying the good-hearted Harvey Dent personality. The monstrous Two-Face is left in permanent control—to the extent that one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> henchmen now refers to him only as [...] "Face". He attempts {{to blow up the}} Gotham Twin Towers with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> swathed in bandages, with the intention of dying in the explosions. He then sees both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as scarred, or as he later says to Batman when he captures him, [...] "At least both sides match". Later in the series, his psychiatrist (who is characterized as completely inept) describes Dent's condition as [...] "recovering nicely".|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} round, Jones caught Calzaghe with an uppercut and knocked him down, {{as well as}} cutting the Welshman {{on the bridge of}} the nose. However, Jones failed to {{capitalize}} on the knock down. In the 2nd round Calzaghe began to control the action and dominated Jones throughout the remainder of the fight. As the fight progressed Jones absorbed more and more punishment and suffered a cut over his left eye. Jones' corner, who had never seen Roy cut before, didn't know how to properly handle the situation and blood covered the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Ultimately, Jones lost by unanimous decision, winning only one round (10-8 in the first) on the 3 official judges cards. There was a crowd of 14,152. The fight generated 225,000 pay-per-view buys.|$|E
25|$|Also {{reminiscent}} of the Raphael painting are the positioning {{of the head and}} torso, unusual among Rembrandt's painted self-portraits. When painting himself, Rembrandt generally used the more convenient arrangement for a right-handed artist, placing the mirror {{to the left of the}} easel, so as not to have his view impeded by his working arm and hand, with the left side of the face most prominently featured. There are several frontal self-portraits, but Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar is one of only two, along with Self-Portrait as Zeuxis, that Rembrandt painted in which he is turned to the left, thus revealing more of the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> It has been suggested that this difference in angle was an intentional variation from the series of self-portraits he was painting at the time.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he still seems to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E
5000|$|Another early {{documented}} sighting was recounted by cryptozoologist Don Davis. During the mid-1940s {{he was on}} a Boy Scout trip near Payson, AZ, {{of which}} he gave the following account: [...] "The creature was huge. Its eyes were deep set and hard to see, but they seemed expressionless. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> seemed pretty much devoid of hair, but there seemed to be hair along the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>His</b> chest, shoulders, and arms were massive, especially the upper arms; easily upwards of 6 inches in diameter, perhaps much, much more. I could see he was pretty hairy, but didn't observe really how thick the body hair was. The face/head was very square; square sides and squared up chin, like a box".|$|R
60|$|Walter {{could hardly}} help {{laughing}} aloud with delight {{at the notion}} of the disappointment of the rebels. The next thing was to consider of Edmund's equipment; Rose turned over her ancient hoards in vain, everything that was not too remarkable had been used for the needs of the family, and he must go in his present blood-stained buff coat, hoping to enter Bosham too early in the morning for gossips to be astir. Then she dressed Walter in her own clothes, not without <b>his</b> making many <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> disgust, especially when she fastened his long curled love-locks in a knot behind, tried to train little curls over the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and drew her black silk hood forward so as to shade it. They were nearly of the same height and complexion, and Edmund pronounced that Walter made a very pretty girl, so like Rose that he should hardly have known them apart, which seemed to vex the boy more than all.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} findings seen in Sturge-Weber syndrome {{are thought}} to arise from an embryologic malformation affecting the vessels that supply the face, eye, and brain. 3 The port-wine nevus in our patient affected the left eye and both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and neck. Port-wine nevi are caused by a malformation of small veins and capillaries {{beneath the surface of}} the skin. It is thought that this vascular malformation originates during the first trimester of gestational development when the primitive cephalic venous plexus fails to regress. 3 Fewer than 50 % of children with port-wine nevi have pial angiomatosis with the corresponding neurologic complications of Sturge-Weber syndrome. 1 Some children can lack a port-wine nevus and still have pial angiomatosis. 2 Commonly in Sturge-Weber syndrome, there is dilation of the intracra-nial deep veins that occurs because of malformation or thrombosis of the smaller cortical veins. 4 In our patient, there is almost complete absence of the deep venous system with shunting of blood through the cavernous sinu...|$|R
500|$|Making {{his debut}} in Halo 2, Special Ops Commander Rtas 'Vadum is never {{named in the}} game itself, leading to the {{unofficial}} nickname of [...] "Half-Jaw" [...] by fans, due to the missing mandibles on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> With the release of The Halo Graphic Novel, however, the character was finally named in the story Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor as Rtas 'Vadumee. The character is voiced by Robert Davi.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Lincoln's {{features}} were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later {{one of his}} eyes became swollen and the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> discolored. Maunsell Bradhurst Field {{wrote in a letter}} to The New York Times that the President then started [...] "breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.". As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became [...] "perfectly natural" [...] (except for the discoloration around his eyes).|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the player's {{point of view in}} the game, [...] "The Last Voyage" [...] focuses on the Covenant. In Halo: Combat Evolveds sequel Halo 2, players experience some of the plot {{through the eyes of the}} Arbiter, a Covenant warrior. The Arbiter is aided by a fellow Covenant Elite who is never named in the game itself; fans called the character [...] "Half-Jaw" [...] due to the Elite missing his mandibles on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "The Last Voyage" [...] names the Elite Rtas 'Vadumee, explains his injury, and describes events during Halo that the player did not see.|$|E
5000|$|Terror has {{the ability}} to replace lost body parts (hand, feet, arms, legs, eyes, ears, nose, etc.) with limbs and organs taken from other organisms. He secretes a natural acid that serves as both solvent and glue: the {{substance}} loosens the connective tissues in the target body, allowing him to more easily rend the parts he needs. Even if reduced to a head, torso and single arm, this allows Terror to gain enough leverage to remove the needed parts. Once that is accomplished, the substance then helps bond the purloined limbs or organs to Terror's body. The 10" [...] spikes on his cheeks on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> can be removed and used as weapons, and if lost or damaged will regrow. He has greenish yellow skin, pronounced sharpened canine teeth, and a face resembling a nearly naked skull without lips or eyelids. He also has a metal glove encasing the hermetically sealed hand of a deceased lover.|$|R
60|$|She was not {{a good-looking}} woman, my sister; and I had a general {{impression}} that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> smooth <b>face,</b> and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that {{they seemed to have}} somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.|$|R
