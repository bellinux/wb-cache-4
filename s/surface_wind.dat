5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E is monitored by Meteo France's La Reunion {{tropical cyclone}} centre (MFR, RSMC La Reunion).

40|$|To confirm whether <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> {{strengthen}} above warm waters around oceanic fronts {{using in}} situ data, a field measurement was conducted using both expendable bathythermographs and Global Positioning System sondes released concurrently across the Kuroshio {{front in the}} East China Sea in December 2010. In contrast to previous studies mainly based on satellite observations, the finding of the present field survey is the local weakening of <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> at the northern flank of the Kuroshio front. From the above field observation {{in conjunction with a}} regional numerical model experiment, it is suggested that the northwesterly winds crossing the Kuroshio front from the cooler side first weaken at the northern flank of the front because of the onset of upward transfer of the "nonslip" condition at the sea surface. Thereafter, as the atmospheric mixed layer with warm and humid air mass develops gradually downwind over the Kuroshio region, the <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> are gradually accelerated by the momentum mixing with strong <b>winds</b> aloft. The <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> remain strong over the cool East China Sea shelf, and it is thus considered that the <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> only weaken at the northern flank of the Kuroshio front. However, numerical modeling indicates that this local weakening of the <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> occurs as a transient state with a short duration and such a structure has thus rarely been detected in the long-term averaged wind fields observed by satellites.

5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E
5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, {{have criticized}} the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale; however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are defined}} as being warm cored, non-frontal synoptic cyclones, that develop over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> circulation. They are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked, by the World Meteorological Organisation's Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales. The scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in; with for example the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale and the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the Western Hemisphere. All of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds, which are either observed, measured or estimated using various techniques, over a period between one and ten minutes.|$|E

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the {{depression}} moved west-northwestward between {{the islands of}} St. Vincent and St. Lucia {{under the influence of}} a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00UTC on October5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph (119km/h), corresponding to a <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> intensity of 60mph (95km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155mi (250km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|In late October1991, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed near the Caroline Islands. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the system gradually became more defined. On October31, convection {{associated with the}} system quickly increased, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Early on November1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as {{a tropical}} depression, at which time the system was situated roughly 415km (260mi) north-northeast of Palau. Following a satellite-derived <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> estimate of 45km/h (30mph) later that day, the JTWC also began monitoring the low as a tropical depression. Initially, forecast models showed the system continuing on an arcing path out to sea; however, the system turned westward on November2 and threatened the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Uring. Late on November3, the depression turned west-southwestward towards the Visayas in response to an approaching cold front, an event typical of late-season cyclones in the basin. On November4, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter assigning it the name Thelma.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E

25|$|The term {{thermal wind}} is often {{considered}} a misnomer, since it really describes {{the change in}} wind with height, rather the wind itself. However, one can view the thermal wind as a geostrophic wind that varies with height, so that the term wind seems appropriate. In {{the early years of}} meteorology, when data was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using the thermal wind relation and knowledge of a <b>surface</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction as well as thermodynamic soundings aloft. In this way, the thermal wind relation acts to define the wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain the thermal wind moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering a clarification to that effect.|$|E

The semiempirical model assumes a subcloud-layer momentum force balance between pressure gradients, Coriolis acceleration, linearized friction, and downward momentum mixing, and it utilizes boundary conditions from the 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40). Observed pressure gradients are linearly decomposed into boundary layer (defined as the region below 850 hPa) and free-tropospheric components, and the <b>surface</b> <b>winds</b> and convergence associated with these components are computed. Results show that <b>surface</b> zonal <b>winds</b> are predominantly associated with a combination of free-tropospheric pressure gradients and downward momentum mixing, whereas the distribution of convergence is primarily due to boundary layer temperature gradients, which are closely related to SST gradients. The authors conclude that the climatological distribution of boundary layer convergence is primarily a function of the pattern of SST gradients and is better regarded as a cause rather than a consequence of deep convection.
