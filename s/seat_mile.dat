2500|$|The Boeing 747-8I was {{intended}} to fill a niche between the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 777-300ER. [...] The future for the 747-8 passenger version appears limited. Airlines bought the original 747 primarily for its range, not its capacity. The advent of long-range twin-engine jets, notably Boeing's own 777, took away the 747's range advantage. Compared to the 747-8I, the upcoming 777-9X [...] "mini jumbo jet" [...] is projected to have a lower fuel cost per <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> and greater cargo capacity, though it has a lower passenger capacity and higher list price; consequently the 777-9X has totalled more orders than the 747-8I due to airlines placing {{a high value on}} fuel efficiency. For operators who require high capacity on routes such as Emirates Airlines, most have preferred the Airbus A380 as it is an all-new design while the 747-8's lineage is 40 years old, although some have criticized the A380's looks and complimented the 747-8I's appearance. Analysts do not see bright prospects for VLA (very large aircraft - those with more than 400 seats) whose orders have slowed in the mid-2010s, since there are widebody twinjets with similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.|$|E

2500|$|Rival {{performance}} {{claims by}} Airbus and Boeing {{appear to be}} contradictory, their methodologies unclear and neither are validated by a third party source. [...] Boeing claims the 747-8I to be over 10% lighter per seat and have 11% less fuel consumption per passenger, with a trip-cost reduction of 21% and a seat-mile cost reduction of more than 6%, compared to the A380. The 747-8F's empty weight {{is expected to be}} 80 tonnes (88 tons) lighter and 24% lower fuel burnt per ton with 21% lower trip costs and 23% lower ton-mile costs than the A380F. On the other hand, Airbus claims the A380 to have 8% less fuel consumption per passenger than the 747-8I and in 2007 Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per passenger than the airline's 747-400 fleet. Emirates' Tim Clark also claims that the A380 is more fuel economic at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83. One independent, industry analysis shows fuel consumption in litres per seat per 100 kilometres flown (L/seat/100km) as 3.27 for the A380 and 3.35 for the B747-8I, or a fuel cost per <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> of $0.055 and $0.057 respectively.

2500|$|Caledonian's short-haul re-equipment {{effort to}} replace the {{remaining}} obsolete piston and turboprop airliners in its fleet, initially focused on Boeing's 737. It intended {{to place an order}} for three series 200 aircraft before the end of 1967. The aircraft were to be delivered by spring 1969 to accomplish the transition to an all-jet fleet ahead of the 1969 summer charter season. As the 737 was an all-American aircraft like the previously ordered 707, Caledonian needed to approach the BOT once more to request an import tax exemption. Predictably, the BOT opposed this. It threatened to withdraw the tax concession it had granted the airline to import brand-new 707s free of duty if 737s were selected instead of One-Eleven 500s. Caledonian did not favour the One-Eleven 500 because it could not match the 737-200's range, which was reckoned sufficient to fly British holidaymakers non-stop from the UK to the Canary Islands and to destinations in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as lower costs per <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> {{as a result of the}} latter's wider fuselage accommodating a greater number of passengers seated six (rather than five) across. In the cut-throat short-/medium-haul charter airline business these were important cost and marketing advantages that could make all the difference between profit and loss. In addition to the risk of losing the BOT's tax concession to import new 707s duty-free into the UK outweighing the 737-200's range and cost advantage over the One-Eleven 500, sterling's devaluation together with increases in Boeing's basic sales price had made ordering One-Elevens more attractive financially. Based on an order for four aircraft valued at £7.5 million, buying an equivalent number of 737s was £1-1.5 million more expensive. Another factor swinging Caledonian's short-haul re-equipment decision in favour of the British aircraft was the manufacturer's ability to offer the Scottish airline a high-density, 109-seat version featuring an increased range of [...] (compared with [...] for the baseline 97-seat, single-class One-Eleven 500 ordered by BEA). This brought most of the Mediterranean and North Africa within range. These considerations resulted in Caledonian placing an order for three One-Eleven 500s for delivery in 1969. It also took out an option on a fourth aircraft, which was to be delivered in 1970 if confirmed.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, airline {{carriers}} such as Midway Airlines and America West Airlines, which commenced operations after 1978, {{soon realized}} {{a cost of}} available <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> (CASM) advantage {{in relation to the}} traditional and established, legacy airlines such as Trans World Airlines and American Airlines. Often this CASM advantage has been attributed solely to the lower labor costs of the newly hired and lower pay grade workers of new start-up carriers, such as ValuJet, Midway Airlines, and their like. However, these lower costs can also be attributed to the less complex aircraft fleets and route networks with which these new carriers began operations, in addition to their reduced labor costs.|$|E

50|$|Average seating {{configuration}} of an airline’s operating fleet. The measure is derived by dividing total available <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> flown {{by the number}} of aircraft miles flown. It is important to understand the average aircraft size as it is an important determinant of employees needed to service the operation of a particular airline. Further, economies of scale generally mean that all other things being equal, an airline's CASM declines with increasing seat density (for instance, two small jet engines on a small commercial jet aircraft generally cost not much less to maintain than two large jet engines on a large commercial jet aircraft).|$|R

5000|$|RASM is a {{commonly}} used measure of unit revenue for airlines, expressed in cents received for each available <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> and determined by dividing various measures of operating revenue by Available Seat Miles. This number is frequently used {{to allow a}} comparison between different airlines or {{a comparison of the}} same airline across periods. In theory, the higher the RASM the more profitable the airline should be, assuming that the CASM remains constant. Various measures of revenue may be used. Passenger RASM (or PRASM) is passenger (or scheduled ticket) revenue per ASM. Operating RASM or Total RASM is the airline's total operating revenue per ASM.|$|E
5000|$|Available seat miles (ASM) or Available seat {{kilometres}} (ASK) [...] is {{a measure}} of an airline flight's passenger carrying capacity. It is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometres flown. An available <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> is the fundamental unit of production for a passenger-carrying airline. A unit in this case is one seat, available for sale, flown one mile. For example, an aircraft with 300 seats available for sale flying 1,000 statute miles would generate 300,000 ASMs for that particular flight. That the seats are available for sale is critical. An aircraft that had 300 seats but which was limited (for regulatory or technical reasons) to selling only 250 of them on a particular flight of 1,000 miles would generate 250,000 ASMs on that flight, not 300,000. Similarly, if passenger seats on a particular flight are dedicated to crew rest purposes, such seats would not be included in the calculation of ASMs for that flight.|$|E

50|$|Modern jet {{aircraft}} have twice the fuel {{efficiency of the}} earliest jet airliners. Late 1950s piston airliners like the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation and DC-7 were 1% to 28% more energy intensive than 1990s jet airliners which cruise 40 to 80% faster. The early jet airliners were designed {{at a time when}} air crew labor costs were higher relative to fuel costs than today. Despite the high fuel consumption, because fuel was inexpensive in that era the higher speed resulted in favorable economical returns since crew costs and amortization of capital investment in the aircraft could be spread over more <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> flown per day.|$|R
50|$|By January 1959, British European Airways (BEA) {{announced}} that it was interested in the purchase of six aircraft, with a possibility of up to 20, and had issued a letter of intent stating such, on the condition that all requirements, including noise levels, were met. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had also placed an order for 12 military transport versions. New York Airways signed a letter of intent for the purchase of five at $2m each, with an option of 15 more albeit with qualifications, after calculating that a larger Rotodyne could operate at half the <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> cost of helicopters; however, unit costs were deemed too high for very short hauls of 10 to 50 miles, and the Civil Aeronautics Board was opposed to rotorcraft competing with fixed-wing on longer routes. Japan Air Lines, who had sent a team to Britain to evaluate the Rotodyne prototype, stated they would experiment with Rotodyne between Tokyo Airport and the city itself, and were interested in using it on the Tokyo-Osaka route as well.|$|E
50|$|CASM (or CASK) is a {{commonly}} used measure of unit cost {{in the airline}} industry. CASM is expressed in cents to operate each <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> offered, and is determined by dividing operating costs by ASMs. This number is frequently used to allow a cost comparison between different airlines or for the same airline across different time periods (say for one year vs the preceding year). A lower CASM means that {{it is easier for}} the airline to make a profit, as they have to charge less to break even. A low CASM, however, {{is by no means a}} guarantee of profitability. Further, CASM should only be compared across airlines with care. For instance, all other things being equal, an airline with a longer average stage length will have a lower CASM, because fixed costs will account for a lower portion of its total costs. For this reason, to be meaningful, CASM comparisons across different airlines generally require, at a minimum, that CASMs for all airlines be adjusted to a common stage length, or that the CASMs be graphed versus the stage length of all the airlines being compared.|$|E
