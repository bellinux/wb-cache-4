40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} {{the development of}} an axial suspended active magnetic bearing (AMB) experimental bench for load and disturbance tests. This test bench must be capable of levitating a 2 kg <b>steel</b> <b>disc</b> at a stable working distance of 3 mm and a maximum attraction distance of 6 mm. The suspension is accomplished by two electromagnets producing upward and downward attraction forces to support the <b>steel</b> <b>disc.</b> An inductive sensor measures the position of the <b>steel</b> <b>disc</b> and relays this to a PC based controller board (dSPACE® controller). The control system uses this information to regulate the electromagnetic force on the <b>steel</b> <b>disc.</b> The intent is to construct this system using relatively low-cost, low-precision components, and still be able to stably levitate the 2 kg <b>steel</b> <b>disc</b> with high precision. The dSPACE® software (ControlDesk®) was used for data acquisition. In this paper, an overview of the system design is presented, followed by the axial AMB model design, inductive sensor design, actuating unit design and controller development and implementation. The paper concludes with results obtained from the dSPACE® controller and evaluation of the axial suspended AMB experimental bench with load and disturbance tests...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the author}} {{presents}} {{the operation and}} development of active magnetic bearings (M s), with specific focus on axial M s. The project objective {{is the development of}} an axial AMB system. The electromagnetic design, inductive sensor design, dspacem controller model design and actuating amplifier design are aspects discussed in this dissertation. The physical model constitutes two electromagnets positioned above and beneath a 2 kg <b>steel</b> <b>disc</b> with an air gap of 3 mm {{on either side of the}} disc. The electromagnetic design is done analytically and verified using ~uic!dield @ finite element analysis software. Inductive sensors are designed to obtain position feedback from the model. These sensors measure the distance of the air gap between the suspended <b>steel</b> <b>disc</b> and the electromagnets. The dspacea 1104 controller board and software is used for controlling purposes. This dissertation describes the system development from the ~ i m u l i i @ model to the real-time model, where the dspaceQ controller board controls the physical hardware. The dspacea controller sends out control signals via DIA ports to actuating amplifiers. The actuating amplifiers then provide a controlling current to the electromagnets.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{mechanical}} pulps: thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and groundwood pulp (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two <b>steel</b> <b>discs.</b> In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.|$|E
