40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of several turbulent nonreacting and reacting <b>spray</b> <b>jets</b> {{is carried out}} using a fully stochastic separated flow (FSSF) approach. As is widely used, the carrier-phase is considered in an Eulerian framework, while the dispersed phase is tracked in a Lagrangian framework following the stochastic separated flow (SSF) model. Various interactions between the two phases {{are taken into account}} by means of two-way coupling. Spray evaporation is described using a thermal model with an infinite conductivity in the liquid phase. The gas-phase turbulence terms are closed using the k-epsilon model. A novel mixture fraction based approach is used to stochastically model the fluctuating temperature and composition in the gas phase and these are then used to refine the estimates of the heat and mass transfer rates between the droplets and the surrounding gas-phase. In classical SSF (CSSF) methods, stochastic fluctuations of only the gas-phase velocity are modeled. Successful implementation of the FSSF approach to turbulent nonreacting and reacting <b>spray</b> <b>jets</b> is demonstrated. Results are compared against experimental measurements as well as with predictions using the CSSF approach for both nonreacting and reacting <b>spray</b> <b>jets.</b> The FSSF approach shows little difference from the CSSF predictions for nonreacting <b>spray</b> <b>jets</b> but differences are significant for reacting <b>spray</b> <b>jets.</b> In general, the FSSF approach gives good predictions of the flame length and structure but further improvements in modeling may be needed to improve the accuracy of some details of the Predictions.

40|$|When {{droplets}} {{are expelled}} {{at a high}} velocity by a spray, a strong vertical air jet is induced throughout which the smallest droplets are dispersed (their Reynolds numbers associated with their relative motion being small). In our analysis {{we focus on the}} interaction between an external cross-flow and this <b>spray</b> <b>jet.</b> This interaction and the distances by which the <b>spray</b> <b>jet</b> and, over a longer distance, the large droplets are deflected are found to depend largely on the ratio of the cross-wind speed to the induced air speed U 0 =Uj. Using a multi-zone analysis we show that with a weak cross-flow (U 0 =Uj. 0 : 1), in the region immediately below the nozzle the spray entrains the external cross-flow and acts like a line sink; the streamlines close to the spray curve inwards to the centre, while further away the sink flow is weak and the streamlines follow the cross-wind. The external flow stagnates at a certain distance from the spray centreline which depends on U 0 =Uj.

40|$|The {{validity}} of a steady-flamelet model and a flamelet/progress-variable approach for gaseous and spray combustion is investigated by a two-dimensional {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) of gaseous and <b>spray</b> <b>jet</b> flames, and the combustion characteristics are analysed. A modified flamelet/progress-variable approach, in which total enthalpy rather than product mass fraction is chosen as a progress variable, is also examined. DNS with an Arrhenius formation, in which the chemical reaction is directly solved in the physical flow field, is performed as a reference to validate the combustion models. The {{results show that the}} diffusion flame is dominant in the gaseous diffusion jet flame, whereas diffusion and premixed flames coexist in the <b>spray</b> <b>jet</b> flame. The characteristics of the spray flame change from premixed–diffusion coexistent to diffusion-dominant downstream. Comparisons among the results from DNS with various combustion models show the modified flamelet/progress-variable approach to be superior to the other combustion models, particularly for the spray flame. Where the behaviour of the gaseous total enthalpy is strongly affected by the energy transfer (i. e. heat transfer and mass transfer) from the dispersed droplet, and this effect can be accounted for only by solving the conservation equation of the total enthalpy. However, even the DNS with the modified flamelet/progress-variable approach tends to underestimate the gaseous temperature in the central region of the <b>spray</b> <b>jet</b> flame. To increase the prediction accuracy, a combustion model for the partially premixed flame for the spray flame is necessary...|$|E

40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>jets</b> of {{intermediate}} {{optical density}} (between dilute sprays and hard liquid cores) {{are of interest}} due to their practical as well as conceptual relevance. Such flows may span broad regions from the primary atomization zones near the injector tip to the downstream parts dominated by dispersed sprays. Understanding {{the dynamics of the}} liquid structures in this transitional domain is important, since it is likely to impact the quality of the flow further downstream. Conceptually, <b>sprays</b> <b>jets</b> of intermediate optical density are also intermediate in complexity and form a relevant model problem for advancing the computations of such flows. This paper uses a well-designed, air-assisted atomizer, where the liquid is injected from a needle that may be recessed upstream relative to the jet exit plane into the surrounding air-blast co-flow. The <b>spray</b> at the <b>jet</b> exit plane is fully dense when the needle is flush, but transitions to intermediate density as the needle is gradually recessed until it is dilute at suffi-ciently large recess distances. Sprays induced by various recess locations of the injection needle are studied. High-speed, microscopic shadowgraph imaging is employed to monitor the evolution of liquid fragments in the flow. These are classified into three categories: spherical droplets, ligaments, and irregular shapes. The statistics of each of these shapes are monitored at various axial locations in the jet and it was confirmed that the size and probability of their occurrence depend on the initial Weber number, fuel to air mass ratio and recess distance. 8 page(s...|$|R

Several droplet evaporation models are studied in order to confirm their predictive capabilities in terms of the time-averaged droplet temperature in the two-phase reactive flow. All the models under consideration are found to capture the formation of a double reaction zone flame and the measured lift-off height within a good level of accuracy. However, the simulated wet-bulb temperature in the hot burnt gas between the two reaction zones is considerably higher in comparison to measurements.
