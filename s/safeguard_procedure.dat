It consists of five ar ticles focusing on the core issues regarding inter-creditor equity in the context of domestic insolvency law.

40|$|Constraints {{nonlinear}} optimization {{problems can}} be solved using penalty or barrier functions. This strategy, based on solving the problems without constraints obtained from the original problem, have shown to be e ective, particularly when used with direct search methods. An alternative to solve the previous problems is the lters method. The lters method introduced by Fletcher and Ley er in 2002,, has been widely used to solve problems of the type mentioned above. These methods use a strategy di erent from the barrier or penalty functions. The previous functions de ne a new one that combine the objective function and the constraints, while the lters method treat optimization problems as a bi-objective problems that minimize the objective function and a function that aggregates the constraints. Motivated {{by the work of}} Audet and Dennis in 2004, using lters method with derivative-free algorithms, the authors developed works where other direct search meth- ods were used, combining their potential with the lters method.

40|$|The US {{has placed}} certain special nuclear {{materials}} declared excess to their strategic needs under international safeguards through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This Presidential initiative has obligated materials at several Department of Energy (DOE) facilities for these safeguards activities {{to demonstrate the}} willingness of the US to ban production or use of nuclear materials outside of international safeguards. However, IAEA inspection activities generally tend to be intrusive in nature and are not consistent with several domestic <b>safeguards</b> <b>procedures</b> implemented to reduce worker radiation exposures and increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of accounting for and storing of special nuclear materials. To help identify and provide workable solutions to these concerns, the Office of Safeguards and Security has conducted a program to determine possible changes to the DOE safeguards and security requirements designed to help facilities under international safeguards inspections more easily comply with domestic safeguards goals during international inspection activities.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore {{volunteering}} opportunities for young adults with criminal records (‘young ex-offenders’). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study was conducted primarily in one London borough. It involved mapping volunteering opportunities for young ex-offenders and conducting in-depth interviews with young ex-offenders and practitioners from volunteer-involving organisations and resettlement organisations. FINDINGS: Several perceived benefits of volunteering for young ex-offenders were identified; particularly in relation to ‘softer’ outcomes such as building confidence, learning new skills and developing a routine. Perceived challenges focused on whether or not organisations were able to provide volunteers with adequate levels of support; concerns about levels of engagement among volunteers and confusion over <b>safeguarding</b> <b>procedures,</b> particularly in relation to the obtaining of Disclosure and Barring Checks.

40|$|The Uruguay Round Negotiating Groups on countervailing and {{antidumping}} procedures {{share many}} common issues. This is not accidental, claims this paper, but mirrors the way import-competing firms {{have become the}} driving force of antidumping and countervailing procedures set up under the Tokyo Round. Countervailing actions are likely to be a poor instrument for limiting subsidies for economic reasons inherent in the profit maximizing behaviour of the complaining firms. However, to strengthen disciplines on countervailing measures would be meaningless without narrowing the currently pervasive definition of dumping and strengthening disciplines in antidumping procedures. This is related to the fact that US and EC firms have increasingly used antidumping procedures as a substitute for countervailing actions. The paper underlines the importance of disciplines in antidumping procedures by noting the links between antidumping, <b>safeguard</b> <b>procedures,</b> and the Multifibre Arrangement.

The case raises a number of concerns. It is also consistent with a suspicion that some practitioners, and even some judges, have begun to express: that on occasions, the safeguarding process itself might constitute a form of abuse.

40|$|The study {{explores the}} initial {{decision}} making of managers within {{services for children}} when faced with an allegation of abuse against a member of staff. Much {{has been written about}} thresholds for intervention in response to abuse of children within their families. When the alleged abuse or poor childcare practice is by professionals, the initial decision making is equally complex, but the thresholds for inclusion in the formal safeguarding processes have received less attention. The study responds to the gap identified by practitioners in determining the appropriate level of intervention to reported behaviours across a range of children’s services. It makes available summary descriptions of nine allegations reported between March 2008 and February 2009, in two Local Safeguarding Children Board areas. Descriptive accounts from the participants, obtained through semi structured interviews, provide insight into the actions taken and approach to decision making including the role of relationships. The descriptions included systematic information gathering and consultation with others, conducted within a tight time frame, which was not dependent on knowledge of <b>safeguarding</b> children <b>procedures.</b> The findings suggest that awareness of specific <b>safeguarding</b> <b>procedures</b> for the management of allegations did not enhance practice or decision making, and could operate to blur responsibility for decision making. Further data was drawn from semi structured interviews utilising vignettes constructed from the anonymised real cases to explore the levels of incidents reported across agencies. The finding that practice varied more between areas than between agencies suggested that responses were attuned to local interpretation and implementation of the national guidance. The comparison of responses across the study suggests that in some situations the current processes for managing allegations may not serve either the welfare of the child or {{the best interests of the}} worker.

In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the <b>safeguards</b> <b>procedures</b> were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly.

The type and cost of the fibre source is clearly key to the economic competitiveness of any pulp mill. Nevertheless, investment institutions often carry out only limited assessment of the fibre source of the proposed mill. Although {{a growing number of}} financial institutions have adopted policies to employ social and environmental safeguard screening for investments in developing countries and transitioning economies, the scope of such screenings is in fact quite limited and they are often implemented ineffectively. In this way, investment institutions often underestimate both the financial risks associated with pulp mills, as well as their social and environmental impacts. Most greenfield pulp mill projects developed by new sponsors are subject to safeguard screening. The primary focus of these screenings is on the manufacturing aspects of the mill, and not on fibre supply which in many cases is still years from being realised. This is an inherent weakness. Projections and reports provided by project sponsors are often insufficiently detailed to allow investment institutions to identify weaknesses and omissions. Better results can also be obtained by looking beyond the project at hand to review the project sponsor’s track record in existing and previous ventures...|$|R
