30|$|Traditionally, {{rail freight}} {{transport}} has performed better (making it first choice for shippers/consignees) when serving high volume markets, including cargoes such as <b>solid</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fuels</b> (CER 2013). There is a significant and {{fundamental change in the}} manufacturing and consumption pattern in Europe (and other developed countries) meaning that the share of raw material for heavy manufacturing as a proportion of the total freight transport has declined (Network 2013 a, b, c). By contrast, the share of ‘semi-finished’ and finished products has increased. The increase in a market in which {{rail freight transport}} is traditionally weak is a significant contributor to rail’s loss of freight market share.|$|E

The system is based on analysis {{of the image of}} a heated ash sample. In the beginning, we describe {{the way in which the}} ash specimen is prepared, as well as its thermal processing, and also give criteria for specifying the characteristic temperature points of phase transitions according to the ISO 1171 standard. Later, we present the scheme of the apparatus for automated determination of ash fusibility and the image acquisition method. Finally, we describe the chosen criteria of automated determination of characteristic points on the basis of selected sample image geometry coefficients. The ultimate determination of the values of those points on the basis of many calculated coeffici ents, fuzzy logic is applied...|$|E
