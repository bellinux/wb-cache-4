40|$|Using a {{safe and}} {{accurate}} alternative to scalpel blades for various surgical operations has been more considering today. There are many studies about the healing process of various tissues after using different methods like radiofrequency, electro surgery <b>and</b> <b>scalpel</b> <b>blade</b> for the surgical incisions, but choosing the right instrument {{is very important in}} cosmetic surgeries. This study was undertaken to get more histopathologic details about the healing process after using either Radiofrequency (RF) or Scalpel blade as a skin incision method. So, an experimental study was designed in that 12 mice were randomly divided in three groups with the same situation and two different incisions were cut in each mouse on ventral skin by <b>scalpel</b> <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> radio surgical equipment. The skin specimens from scalpel blade incision as group one sample and radiosurgical incision as group two sample were harvested on the same operation day and a weekly manner to day 21. All samples were stained with Hematoxillin - Eosin and observed under light microscopy. Results showed less tissue contraction at the cutting edge and better collagen alignments in RF incision in comparison to scalpel blade incisions in which having fibrosis and more tissue contraction. These histopathologic findings might be the reason for more elasticity and less scar tissue remaining after skin Radiofrequency surgery...|$|R

Corneas were injured with <b>scalpel</b> <b>blades,</b> <b>and,</b> 2 weeks later, LGs were collected for immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.

The victim may be the source of the blood, but the bloodstains are found where one might expect to find victim???s blood for reasons other than homicide. The circumstances are further complicated if the blood is in low quantities and exhibits a non-specific bloodstain pattern. Prior research has demonstrated that bloodstains can contain trace amounts of wound cells, which can be identified by tissue-specific microRNAs.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{designed}} to detect T. gondii DNA from tissues of aborted caprine and ovine fetuses by single tube nested PCR. A total of 327 tissues from 45 and 31 caprine and ovine aborted fetuses respectively were analyzed. Tissues analyzed were, 76 brains, 76 lungs, 70 livers, 65 hearts and 40 placentas. Approximately five grams of each tissue was finely chopped with a sterile <b>scalpel</b> <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> re-suspended in sterile distilled water. DNA extraction was conducted according to standard protocol. Two successive amplifications were performed in a single tube using 18 S- 5. 8 S rRNA ITS 1 targeted primers in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the reaction and to minimize the chance of contamination. All samples analyzed were negative for T. gondii DNA. We conclude that the organism may not play important role in ovine and caprine abortions in the study area. Our next plan is to analyze tissues from the feline definitive host and rodents in the area in order to detect and sequence T. gondii DNA to enable us compare it to known clades.

The neck was held stiffly. Radiography of the cervical region showed a focal area of increased radio-opacity over the dorsal, caudal and lateral aspect of the dorsal spinous process of C 2. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a hypoechoic area approximately 15 cm in diameter superimposed over the dorsal spinous process of C 2. An aspirate was taken of the mass, which revealed purulent exudate confirming the diagnosis of an abscess. The abscess was lanced with a <b>scalpel</b> <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> samples of the purulent material revealed a pure culture of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi. The guttural pouches (Eustachian tube diverticulae (ETD)) were then evaluated endoscopically and multiple chondroids were seen filling most of the right ETD. Surgery was subsequently performed and 189 chondroids were removed via a right-sided hyovertebrotomy.

The animals received an epidural anesthesia and local anesthesia (vaginal vault) and after ten minutes the vaginal vault was incised with a <b>scalpel</b> <b>blade</b> <b>and</b> tissue was dissected {{to provide access to}} the pelvic cavity and to retract the ovary into the vagina. Then, a luteal biopsy was performed with a Yomann biopsy nipper. Signs indicative of pain and stress during the vaginal vault incision, traction of ovary or luteal biopsy were observed only in two collections. However, these signs were observed in ten collections during dissection of the vaginal wall and peritoneum. The occurrence of ataxia was observed in 26 collections and it was usually related to a longer duration of the procedure. Ataxia could be divided in light (15 / 26), moderate (6 / 26) and severe (5 / 26). The occurrence of ovarian adhesions ipsilateral to the incision was evaluated only in the initial four collections. Adhesions were present in 16 collections. The protocol described above provided a safe and efficient method to acquire luteal samples.

40|$|As A GUIDE to the proliferative {{activity}} of cell populations the labelling index, 1 s (i. e. {{the proportion of}} cells which are in the phase of DNA synthesis) is generally preferred to the mitotic index for several reasons: the labelling index is a larger fraction than the mitotic index and is therefore easier to estimate accurately; labelled cells are more easily recognized and counted than mitoses; and, {{in the case of}} human tumour tissue, labelling is less likely to be affected by the trauma of surgery (Steel and Bensted, 1965).

MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 47 patients who underwent liver resection at our Institution from 2004 to 2010 using the TissueLink with either the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) or the Harmonic Scalpel. The TissueLink was used with the CUSA in 27 patients and with the Harmonic Scalpel in 20 patients. ResultsMedian estimated blood loss (EBL) in the Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> <b>and</b> CUSA groups was 250 and 1035  mL respectively (p <  0. 05). Three patients were transfused banked blood perioperatively in the Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> group <b>and</b> 11 in the CUSA group (p <  0. 05).
