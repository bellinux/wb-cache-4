40|$|The {{control of}} shock noise or screech from a jet near a {{flexible}} structure is discussed. The {{pressure from the}} supersonic jet consists of a shock with spiral and flapping nonaxisymmetric modes superimposed on broadband response. This shock induces a nonlinear-nonstationary loading problem associated with acoustic wave generation and propagation coupled with structural vibration. Control of the shock is achieved by placing a ring at the nozzle lip oscillating at the shock fundamental frequency. The ring prevents the shock characteristics originating in the column of the shear layer from sustaining connection with the out-of-phase surface vibration. <b>Shock-free</b> <b>flow</b> is maintained over a large pressure ratio.

An Euler solution with self-induced oscillation and separation driven by a strong shock is contrasted with a shock-free solution whose separation is caused by numerical error.

Critical fluctuating pressure environments are predicted at transonic Mach numbers. Comparisons between predicted environments and wind tunnel test results, in general, showed good agreement.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{strategy}} to design locally conservative finite-difference approximations of convective derivatives for <b>shock-free</b> compressible <b>flows</b> with arbitrary order of accuracy, that generalizes the approach of Ducros et al. (2000) [1], {{and that can be}} applied as a building block of low-dissipative, hybrid shock-capturing methods. The approximations stem from application of standard central difference formulas to split forms of the convective terms in the compressible Euler equations, which guarantee strong numerical stability and (near) energy preservation in the inviscid limit. A convenient implementation of the high-order fluxes is suggested, which guarantees improved computational efficiency over existing methods. Numerical tests performed for isotropic turbulence at zero viscosity show stability of schemes with order of accuracy up to ten, and effectiveness of convective splitting of Kennedy and Gruber (2008) [2] in providing extra stability in the presence of strong density variations. Numerical simulations of compressible turbulent boundary layer flow indicate suitability of the method for non-uniform grids, and overall support superior computational efficiency of high-order schemes.

40|$|A fixed-geometry {{diffuser}} {{system was}} designed for use in Mach 4 free-jet tests of a hydrogen-burning modular scramjet engine. The scramjet engine has a rectangular cross section that blocks up to 33 percent of the existing tunnel nozzle exit area and swept leading edges of the scramjet produce an asymmetric downward flow that sharply increases when the scramjet inlet unstarts. Effects of these conditions on {{the operation of the}} diffuser system are not accurately predictable. An experimental investigation has therefore been conducted in unheated air using a subscale model of the tunnel-scramjet-diffuser system to substantiate the design.

40|$|International audienceTai-Ping Liu Liu_JJ {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} "physical solution" of the isentropic Euler system when the gas is surrounded by vacuum. This notion can be interpreted {{by saying that the}} front is driven by a force resulting from a Hölder singularity of the sound speed. We address the question of when this acceleration appears or when the front just move at constant velocity. We know from Gra,SerAIF that smooth isentropic flows with a non-accelerated front exist globally in time, for suitable initial data. In even space dimension, these solutions may persist for all t∈; we say that they are eternal. We derive a sufficient condition in terms of the initial data, under which the boundary singularity must appear. As a consequence, we show that, in contrast to the even-dimensional case, eternal flows with a non-accelerated front don't exist in odd space dimension. In one space dimension, we give a refined definition of physical solutions.

40|$|Numerical and {{analytical}} {{solutions to the}} steady compressible Euler equations corresponding to a compressible analogue of the linear Stuart vortex array are presented. These correspond to a homentropic continuation, to finite Mach number, of the Stuart solution describing a linear vortex array in an incompressible fluid. The appropriate partial differential equations describing the flow correspond to the compressible homentropic Euler equations in two dimensions, with a prescribed vorticity–density–streamfunction relationship. In order to construct a well-posed problem for this continuation, it was found, unexpectedly, to be necessary to introduce an eigenvalue into the vorticity–density–streamfunction equation. In the Rayleigh–Janzen expansion of solutions in even powers of the free-stream Mach number M[infty infinity], this eigenvalue is determined by a solvability condition. Accurate numerical solution by both finite-difference and spectral methods are presented for the compressible Stuart vortex, over a range of M[infty infinity], and of a parameter corresponding to a confined mass-flow rate. These also confirm the nonlinear eigenvalue character of the governing equations. All solution branches followed numerically were found to terminate when the maximum local Mach number just exceeded unity. For one such branch we present evidence {{for the existence of}} a very small range of M[infty infinity] over which smooth transonic <b>shock-free</b> <b>flow</b> can occur...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation is performed to study compressible, viscous flow around a circular cylinder. The present study considers two-dimensional, <b>shock-free</b> continuum <b>flow</b> by varying the Reynolds number between 20 and 100 and the freestream Mach number between 0 and 0. 5. The {{results indicate that}} compressibility effects elongate the near wake for cases {{above and below the}} critical Reynolds number for two-dimensional flow under shedding. The wake elongation becomes more pronounced as the Reynolds number approaches this critical value. Moreover, we determine the growth rate and frequency of linear instability for cases above the critical Reynolds number. From the analysis, it is observed that the frequency of the Bénard-von Kármán vortex street in the time-periodic, fully-saturated flow increases from the dominant unstable frequency found from the linear stability analysis as the Reynolds number increases from its critical value, even for the low range of Reynolds numbers considered. We also notice that the compressibility effects reduce the growth rate and dominant frequency in the linear growth stage. Semi-empirical functional relationships for the growth rate and the dominant frequency in linearized flow around the cylinder in terms of the Reynolds number and freestream Mach number are presented.

In view of the stepwise integration methods to be used, the exponent designated the profile shape can be varied along the surface between the integral fraction limits 1 / 5 and 1 / 11 through interpolation. Agreement obtained between theoretical and experimental boundary-layer development in a supersonic nozzle at a nominal Mach number of 2 indicates the general validity of the approximations used in the analysis - in particular, the method of extrapolating low-speed skin-friction relations to high Mach number flows.

40|$|Steady, inviscid, {{supersonic}} flow past conical wings is studied {{within the context}} of irrotational, nonlinear theory. An efficient numerical method is developed to calculate cones of arbitrary section at incidence. The method is fully conservative and implements a body conforming mesh generator. The conical potential is assumed to have its best linear variation inside each cell; a secondary interlocking cell system is used to establish the flux balance required to conserve mass. In regions of supersonic cross flow, the discretization scheme is desymmetrized by adding the appropriate artificial viscosity in conservation form. The algorithm is nearly an order of magnitude faster than present Euler methods. It predicts known results as long as the flow Mach numbers normal to the shock waves are near 1; qualitative features, such as nodal point lift-off, are also predicted correctly. Results for circular and thin elliptic cones are shown to compare very well with calculations using Euler equations. This algorithm is then implemented in the design of conical wings to be free from shock waves terminating embedded supersonic zones adjacent to the body. This is accomplished by generating a smooth cross-flow sonic surface by using a fictitious gas law that makes the governing equation elliptic inside the cross-flow sonic surface. The shape of the wing required to provide this <b>shock-free</b> <b>flow,</b> if such a flow is consistent with the sonic surface data, is found by solving the Cauchy problem inside the sonic surface using the data on this surface and, of course, the correct gas law. This design procedure is then demonstrated using the simple case of a circular cone at angle of attack...|$|E

40|$|In 1997, the Pillan volcano on Io {{was home}} to a fierce {{volcanic}} eruption that emplaced extensive lava flows and a circular plume deposit. The gas/magma flow issuing from the unresolved vent region appeared to form an almost vertical jet. We consider steady eruptions of gas and magma, and take the vent to be either a fissure or a point source. In the fissure scenario, the upper-conduit flow must reach Mach 1 in the 25 - 75 m depth range to produce the vent velocities of 550 - 600 m/s that are required to explain the observed plume heights. Conduit wall deflections in the range 20 - 30 degrees from vertical (values referring to the upper meter of the conduit) and similar to 26 - 30 % by mass of incorporated crustal SO 2 are also needed. In the point-source scenario, sonic flow conditions and similar velocities are achieved in the depth range 350 - 500 m for similar conduit wall deflections and gas mass proportions in the erupting mixture.
