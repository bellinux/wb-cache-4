5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour. Designers <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or seakeeping.|$|E

As well as that, the All Blacks <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on fitness. This enabled them to play with speed much longer than their opposition.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Morris {{was kept}} largely housebound at Elm House by his mother; there, he <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> reading, favouring {{the novels of}} Walter Scott. Aged 6, Morris moved {{with his family to}} the Georgian Italianate mansion at Woodford Hall, Woodford, Essex, which was {{surrounded}} by 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. He took an interest in fishing with his brothers as well as gardening in the Hall's grounds, and <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> exploring the Forest, where he was fascinated both by the Iron Age earthworks at Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks and by the Early Modern Hunting Lodge at Chingford. He also took rides through the Essex countryside on his pony, and visited the various churches and cathedrals throughout the country, marveling at their architecture. His father took him on visits outside of the county, for instance to Canterbury Cathedral, the Chiswick Horticultural Gardens, and to the Isle of Wight, where he adored Blackgang Chine. Aged 9, he was then sent to Misses Arundale's Academy for Young Gentlemen, a nearby preparatory school; although initially riding there by pony each day, he later began boarding, intensely disliking the experience.|$|E

Violet died in 2006, before Connie became internationally known, and Connie sang at her funeral.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of an {{extensive}} formal education, Brock appreciated its importance. As an adult, he <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> reading {{in an attempt to}} improve his education. He read many works on military tactics and science, but he also read ancient history and other less immediately practical topics. At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Samuel Johnson.|$|E

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, one of which {{included}} the first complete performance of {{the final version of}} his First Symphony and another the premiere of the revised version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony. Before this visit he had <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> keeping in touch with Rimsky-Korsakov and those around him. Rimsky-Korsakov, along with Alexander Glazunov, Anatol Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the Belyayev circle. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in the company of these men, and his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and money {{restoring}} Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} in Washington {{for more than}} two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were {{a close-knit}} couple, and {{contrary}} to the prevailing custom <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with their children, {{who grew up in}} a warm family atmosphere.

In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E
5|$|After Roger's birth, James and Henriette {{had three}} more children: two daughters {{who died in}} infancy and a second son, Alfred, born in 1839. The {{marriage}} was unhappy, and the couple <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> apart, he in England, she in Paris with Roger. As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and his English was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848. In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards, in which he served for three years, mainly in Ireland.|$|E
