40|$|Cutting edge l The {{efficient}} {{calculation of}} price <b>sensitivities</b> continues <b>to</b> {{be among the}} greatest practical challenges facing users of Monte Carlo methods in the derivatives industry. Computing Greeks is essential to hedging and risk management, but typically requires substantially more computing time than pricing a derivative. This article shows how an adjoint formulation {{can be used to}} accelerate the calculation of the Greeks. This method is particularly well suited <b>to</b> applications requiring <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> a large number of parameters. Examples include interest rate derivatives requiring <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> all initial forward rates and equity derivatives requiring <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> all points on a volatility surface. The simplest methods for estimating Greeks are based on finite difference approximations, in which a Monte Carlo pricing routine is rerun multiple times at different settings of the input parameters in order <b>to</b> estimate <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> the parameters.

40|$|<b>Sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> {{moderately}} intense stimuli representing four taste {{qualities to}} man were determined for 79 hamster chorda tympani fibers. Some fibers were {{very sensitive to}} sucrose, sodium chloride, or hydrochloric acid, but none were very sensitive <b>to</b> quinine. These <b>sensitivities</b> were not randomly distributed among fibers: the sucrose sensitivity was separated from and negatively correlated with the other sensitivities which were associated and positively correlated with each other. Moreover, there were {{a limited number of}} sensitivity patterns: (a) fibers responding best to sucrose responded second-best to salt, less to acid, not to quinine; (b) fibers responding best to salt either responded second-best to sucrose and not to acid or quinine; or second-best to acid, less to quinine, and not to sucrose; and (c) fibers responding best to acid responded second-best to salt, more to quinine, and less to sucrose than other fibers.

5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
