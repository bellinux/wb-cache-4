40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original methodology developed {{to facilitate the}} apprehension of maritime topics into regional planning documents, by analyzing economic and environmental effects of maritime activities and uses. This work {{is a part of}} the SYSCOLAG program which is a pilot operation at national level for experimenting with a knowledge-pooling system applied to the field of integrated coastal area management (ICAM). SYSCOLAG aims to constitute an interface between ‘knowledge’ and the ‘users of knowledge ’ on questions related to the conservation and the development of the coastal zone of the Languedoc-Roussillon. With this aim, a pilot model have been developed to propose a methodology to evaluate economic and environmental effects of maritime activity and uses in a territorial planning document. The application of this pilot model to the Thau case study have been realised on the basis of working groups of experts (scientists, local authorities and endusers) and also by the organisation of public meetings at the initiative of the local authority (<b>Syndicat</b> <b>Mixte</b> du Bassin de Thau) as part of the consultation process of this management plan. In this pilot model, which is the furthest advanced in the current state of progress of the programme, this phase made it possible to identify the stakes and the priorities for the sustainable development of the territory concerned (Tha...|$|E
