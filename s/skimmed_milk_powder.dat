40|$|The {{utilization}} of groundnut milk in manufacturing the spread cheese in Sudan was investigated. Groundnut milk was prepared from grinded groundnut seeds. Four samples of spread cheese were prepared from groundnut milk with {{different levels of}} <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> 0, 5, 10 and 15. The prepared spread cheese samples were stored for 6 months at 30 ± 2 o C. Analyses of chemical composition were carried on prepared spread cheese samples and the analyses were carried out at intervals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months during storage period. The chemical analyses of spread cheese samples at zero time processing were for total solids 35. 79, 37. 91, 39. 59 and 41. 49 %, the protein content 12. 82, 14. 35, 15. 98 and 17. 56 %, the fat content 14. 98, 14. 99, 14. 99 and 15. 0 %, the ash content 4. 16, 4. 18, 4. 21 and 4. 23 % for samples A, B, C and D respectively. The pH was affected by the levels of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> and storage period. The levels of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> significantly (p 0. 05) affected the pH value of the spread cheese. Sample D (15 % <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder)</b> recorded the lowest (5. 14) and sample A (0 % <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder)</b> the highest (5. 60). Sample B (5 % <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder)</b> and sample C (10 % <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powder)</b> were at an intermediate position (5. 56 and 5. 45), respectively.
