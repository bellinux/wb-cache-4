40|$|DNA barcoding is {{a method}} {{promising}} fast and accurate identification of animal species based on the sequencing of the mitochondrial c oxidase subunit (COI) gene. In this study, we explore the prospects for DNA barcoding in one particular fish group, the billfishes (suborder Xiphioidei-swordfish, marlins, <b>spearfishes,</b> and sailfish). We sequenced the mitochondrial COI gene from 296 individuals from the 10 currently recognized species of billfishes, and combined these data with a further 57 sequences from previously published projects. We also sequenced the rhodopsin gene from a subset of 72 individuals to allow comparison of mitochondrial results against a nuclear marker. Five of the 10 species are readily distinguishable by COI barcodes. Of the rest, the striped marlin (Kajikia audax) and white marlin (K. albida) show highly similar sequences and are not unambiguously distinguishable by barcodes alone, likewise are the three <b>spearfishes</b> Tetrapturus angustirostris, T. belone, and T. pfluegeri.

40|$|Sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) is a circumtropically {{distributed}} spe-cies (Hoolihan, 2005). Sailfish is {{a member}} of the billfish family, Istio-phoridae, which also includes marlins and <b>spearfishes,</b> and is considered a bycatch species in commercial fisher-ies. Off the eastern coast of Taiwan, sailfish are economically important and seasonally abundant from April to October (abundance peaks from May to July). Sailfish are mainly caught by drift gill nets, although some are also caught by set nets, harpoons, and as incidental bycatch in inshore long-line fisheries (Chiang, 2004). There are virtually no discards of sailfish in Taiwan. For the past decade, the annual landings of sailfish off Taiwan waters have fluctuated between 500 and 1000 metric tons, of which over 50 % have come from waters off Tai-tung (eastern Taiwan).

Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both isoforms of nonmammalian RYRs indicates that the fish heater cells express only the alpha RYR isoform. The calcium dependency of [3 H]ryanodine binding to the RYR isoform expressed in heater indicates functional identity with the non-mammalian alpha RYR isoform. Fluorescent labeling demonstrates that the RYR is localized in an anastomosing network throughout the heater cell cytoplasm. Measurements of oxalate supported 45 Ca 2 + uptake, Ca 2 + ATPase activity, and [32 P]phosphoenzyme formation demonstrate that the SR contains a high capacity for Ca 2 + uptake via an ATP dependent enzyme. Immunoblot analysis of calsequestrin revealed a significant amount of the Ca 2 + binding protein in the heater cell SR. The present study provides the first direct evidence that the heater SR system contains the proteins necessary for Ca 2 + release, re-uptake and sequestration, thus supporting the hypothesis that thermogenesis in the modified muscle cells is achieved via an ATP-dependent cycling of Ca 2 + between the SR and cytosolic compartments...|$|E
40|$|Chiefly {{arising from}} their {{sporting}} potentialities in big game angling, the large “Bill-fishes”, or Marlin, and Sword-fishes have attracted considerable attention in recent times. Commercial fishermen of Japan and anglers of the United States {{have been most}} ardent {{in the pursuit of}} these peculiar creatures. While a good deal has been learnt about them, there still remains much to discover. In the case of the Marlins, for example, hardly anything is known of their reproduction, of the larval or postlarval early forms, and even those who have studied these fishes from ample material over a wide area are as yet uncertain of the absolute identity of the species, and are often unable to identify with any certainty the rare occasional reasonably small specimens that are encountered. In South Africa shore angling is so good throughout virtually the entire year that there has been little incentive to explore the possibilities further out, especially as quiet seas are a rare condition. Quite recently, however, big game angling at sea has developed almost explosively and increasingly large fishes are being captured. During our extensive travels in the tropical Western Indian Ocean it became obvious that great numbers of the larger angling fishes were present, including those treated here. Although that area is windy and storm-lashed for much of the year, remote from facilities, and barren, its potentialities are relatively unexplored, but are clearly so great that it will not be long before it becomes recognised as one of the chief big game angling areas of the world. These fishes are at present placed in the families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae. The latter embraces the Sailfishes, the Marlins and the <b>Spearfishes,</b> usually granted distinction by only generic rank.

40|$|Billfishes (marlins, <b>spearfishes,</b> {{sailfishes}} and swordfish) {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} and largest marine apex predators, and perhaps their most recognizable attribute is their bill or rostrum. The proposed function for this novel structure has ranged from hydrodynamic enhancement to defensive weaponry. However, the most supported hypothesis for its function has been linked to feeding. Billfishes have been observed to subdue their prey with their rostrum, either stunning or cutting them into pieces before ingestion. Due to their large body sizes and pelagic lifestyles a thorough investigation of the function of this structure has been logistically challenging. The goal of my dissertation is to investigate the role of the rostrum during feeding from a functional, mechanical and morphological standpoint. By the use of interdisciplinary approaches that blend engineering with biology, the function of the rostrum and billfish putative feeding behavior was investigated. By the use of different approaches that involve morphological characterizations, histology, estimation of performance measurements such as bite force and the investigation architectural tradeoffs from geometric morphometrics analysis, my dissertation aims to characterized the role of the rostrum in billfishes as a possible adaptation for feeding. Results showed that the rostrum in billfishes is mechanically capable of acting as a feeding weapon; continuous stress distribution along its length suggest no particular point that could lead to breakage during feeding. Finite element analysis, as well as bending experiments suggest feeding behavior may be species specific and strictly associated with rostrum morphology. While istiophorids may be morphologically suited to strike their prey {{with a wide range of}} motions, swordfish appear to be specialized from a mechanical and hydrodynamic standpoint to hit their prey with lateral strikes. Biting performance is relatively low in these top predators compared to other non-billfish species suggesting the rostrum may facilitate prey processing reducing the need for powerful biting. However contrary to my expectations rostrum length was not a predictor of bite force. Skull variation was evident among billfish species. Swordfish, the species with the longest rostrum, had the smallest head and the lowest relative bite force whereas blue marlin, the species with the stiffer, most compact rostrum, had the largest head and one of the greatest relative bite forces. The shortbill spearfish showed a relatively low bite force indicating predatory success in this species may be linked to an extended lower jaw that may facilitate a speed efficient jaw during prey capture. Whether the rostrum in billfishes has evolved as an adaptation for feeding, remains uncertain. However results from this study demonstrate that rostrum material properties, morphology and head architecture, in addition to relatively low biting performance in billfishes, favor a role of prey capture for the rostrum...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>spearfishing</b> is {{a popular}} method of {{capturing}} fish, its ecological effects on fish populations are poorly understood, which {{makes it difficult to}} assess the legitimacy and desirability of <b>spearfishing</b> in multi-use marine reserves. Recent management changes within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) fortuitously created a unique scenario by which to quantify the effects of <b>spearfishing</b> on fish populations. As such, we employed underwater visual surveys and a before-after-control-impact experimental design to investigate the effects of <b>spearfishing</b> on the density and size structure of target and non-target fishes in a multi-use conservation park zone (CPZ) within the GBRMP. Three years after <b>spearfishing</b> was first allowed in the CPZ, there was a 54 % reduction in density and a 27 % reduction in mean size of coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), the primary target species. These changes were attributed to <b>spearfishing</b> because benthic habitat characteristics and the density of non-target fishes were stable through time, and the density and mean size of coral trout in a nearby control zone (where <b>spearfishing</b> was prohibited) remained unchanged. We conclude that <b>spearfishing,</b> like other forms of fishing, can have rapid and substantial negative effects on target fish populations. Careful management of <b>spearfishing</b> is therefore needed to ensure that conservation obligations are achieved and that fishery resources are harvested sustainably. This is particularly important both for the GBRMP, due to its extraordinarily high conservation value and world heritage status, and for tropical island nations where people depend on <b>spearfishing</b> for food and income.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Spearfishing</b> was {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} economic activity in the Caribbean {{as a result of}} socioeconomic factors related to underemployment and the low capital outlay for equipment. For a year (2011) we surveyed <b>spearfishing</b> in 23 Jamaican beaches. <b>Spearfishing</b> has expanded from approximately 1 % of fishers in 1991 to about 10 % in 2011. The fishery is larger than expected and probably produced 4 000 tons per year. Though reef fishes dominated catches, other resources such as lobsters, conch and octopus were regularly taken. Many small juvenile fishes were observed in catches well below their adult or optimum sizes. A total of 58 % of spear-fishers reported they would have significant difficulty finding alternative employment if <b>spearfishing</b> was banned. Spearfishers reported exploiting the entire island shelf and also nearly all the offshore banks, especially Pedro Bank. Night <b>spearfishing</b> was common and targeted sleeping reef fishes.
