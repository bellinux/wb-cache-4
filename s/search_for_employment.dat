25|$|There are {{substantial}} numbers of immigrants from other Arab countries (mainly Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Egypt) and non-Arab-speaking Muslim countries. Also, recent years have seen an influx of people from Ethiopia and South East Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, as well as smaller numbers of other immigrant minorities, Colombians and Brazilians (of Lebanese descent themselves). Most of these are employed as guest workers {{in the same fashion}} as Syrians and Palestinians, and entered the country to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> in the post-war reconstruction of Lebanon. Apart from the Palestinians, there are approximately 180,000 stateless persons in Lebanon.|$|E

The film follows {{a young woman who}} leaves home to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> and becoming married to a wealthy man, but the marriage is kept secret. The husband is arrested by mistake {{and by the time he}} is freed, his wife and child depart and he believes them dead. The young woman entrusts her baby, Lena, to her mother before her death. At age 16, Lena goes to the city is visited by her father, but the relationship is only known when he sees a picture of her mother in her locket. The film was an adaptation of Mary Jane Holmes' [...] 1856 novel Lena Rivers and was released on August 12, 1910. It had a wide national release and received positive reviews from critics.|$|E

500|$|Sarnia's {{population}} {{experienced a}} continual growth from 1961 to 1991, with a 1991 population of 74,376. In 2001 the population had declined by approximately 3,000. Since 2001 Sarnia's {{population has been}} growing slowly, with a 2011 population count of 72,366. Despite these gains, an April 2010 report [...] "Sarnia-Lambton's Labour Market" [...] states: [...] "Large petrochemical companies are the community's main economic drivers. Over the recent past, several plants have shutdown, and of those still in operation, increased automation and outsourcing has led to significantly fewer workers." [...] These shutdowns and the resulting loss of jobs, and therefore population as workers <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> elsewhere, will contribute to a general decline shown by one August 2011 study, which shows that the population will decline by 17% over the next twenty-five years. [...] The Monteith-Brown study cited outlines a plan for restructuring the city based on hybrid zoning areas, which will bring work opportunities closer to the neighborhoods where people live. [...] The City of Sarnia and Lambton County are also implementing an economic development plan {{with an emphasis on}} bio-industries and renewable energy.|$|E
500|$|Somerset {{returned}} to Britain in late September to attend horse sales at Newmarket but suddenly left for Dieppe on 26 September, probably after {{being told by}} Newton {{that he was in}} danger of being arrested. He returned again on 30 September. A few days later, his grandmother, Emily Somerset, Dowager Duchess of Beaufort, died and he attended her funeral. The Hon. Hamilton Cuffe, Assistant Treasury Solicitor, and James Monro, Commissioner of Police, pressed for action to be taken against Somerset, but the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, blocked any prosecution. Rumours of Somerset's involvement were circulating, and on 19 October Somerset fled back to France. Lord Salisbury was later accused of warning Somerset through Sir Dighton Probyn, who had met Lord Salisbury the evening before, that a warrant for his arrest was imminent. This was denied by Lord Salisbury and the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster. Probyn's informant may have been the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Richard Pearson. The Prince of Wales wrote to Lord Salisbury, expressing satisfaction that Somerset had been allowed to leave the country and asking that if Somerset should [...] "ever dare to show his face in England again", he would remain unmolested by the authorities, but Lord Salisbury was also being pressured by the police to prosecute Somerset. On 12 November, a warrant for Somerset's arrest was finally issued. By this time, Somerset was already safely abroad, and the warrant caught little public attention. After an unsuccessful <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment</b> in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, Somerset lived {{the rest of his life}} in self-imposed and comfortable exile in the south of France. Other names mentioned by the press were Lord Ronald Gower and Lord Errol. Also implicated was the prominent social figure Alexander Meyrick Broadley, who fled abroad for four years. The Paris Figaro even alleged that Broadley took General Georges Boulanger and Henri Rochefort to the house. The allegation against Boulanger was later challenged by his supporters. In December 1889 it was reported that both the Prince and Princess of Wales were being [...] "daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character" [...] bearing upon the scandal. By January 1890 sixty suspects had been identified, twenty-two of whom had fled the country.|$|E

Among the various criticisms it receives, one of the most recurrent is the assertion that it could discourage the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment,</b> encouraging laziness of people.

[...] Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress. He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: [...] "The difference… is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment," [...] while those in the North had to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Felony records greatly {{influence}} {{the chances of}} people finding employment. Many employers seem to use criminal history as a screening mechanism without attempting to probe deeper. They are often more interested in incarceration {{as a measure of}} employability and trustworthiness instead of its relation to any specific job. People who have felony records have a harder time finding a job. The psychological effects of incarceration can also impede an ex-felon’s <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>employment.</b> Prison can cause social anxiety, distrust, and other psychological issues that negatively affect a person's reintegration into an employment setting. [...] Men who are unemployed are more likely to participate in crime [...] which leads to there being a 67% chance of ex-felons being charged again. In 2008, the difficulties male ex-felons in the United States had finding employment lead to approximately a 1.6% decrease in the employment rate alone. This is a loss of between $57 and $65 billion of output to the US economy.|$|E
