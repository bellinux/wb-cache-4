3000|$|The {{halogenated}} donepezil {{were subjected}} to molecular docking study against acetyl cholinesterase (AChE). Crystal structur of AChE were collected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (PDB ID: 1 EVE) (Berman et al. 2002).

Later on, the fully optimized structures of the halogenated compounds were opened using ADT to add gasteiger charges and to set TORSDOF followed by the conversion of all rotatable bonds into non-rotatable. Next, we saved both the protein and ligand structures in [...].PDBQT format as it is the only one supported file format that required by AutoDock Vina (version 1.1. 2, May 11, 2011) for docking analysis (Trott and Olson 2010).|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of data was evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer test (for multiple comparison) to compare between control and treated groups.

30|$|For {{statistical}} analysis, SAS <b>software</b> <b>package</b> (<b>Version</b> 9.3, SAS Institute) was used.
