40|$|Abstract One of {{the first}} {{publications}} of Prakash Panangaden is about compositional semantics of <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> back in 1984. Digital net-works transform streams of input signals to streams of output signals. If the output streams {{of the components of}} the network are functions of their input streams, then the behavior of the entire network can be nicely characterized by a recursive stream function. In this paper we consider signal flow graphs, i. e., open <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> with feedbacks, obtained by composing amplifiers, mergers, copiers, and de-layers. We give two characterizations of the recursive stream functions computed by signal flow graphs: one algebraic in terms of localization of modules of polynomials, and another coalgebraic in terms of Mealy machines. Our main result is that the two characterizations coincide. “Tell all the truth but tell it slant- success in circuit lies. ” — Emily Dickinson...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{communication}} networks must {{cope with}} ever increasing demands on network resources. Intelligent agents which learn to manage network traffic from past experience hold {{the promise of}} providing the robustness {{necessary in order to}} meet these demands. Qlearning belongs to a class of machine learning algorithms which enable intelligent agents to change their behaviour based on feedback from their environment.

Each node learns a routing policy based on feedback from its neighbours.

40|$|W avelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) {{is currently}} being deployed in telecommunications networks {{in order to satisfy}} the increased demand for capacity brought about by both narrowband services and new broadband services such as high-speed Internet. While it is thought that WDM will ultimately evolve to interconnected rings or perhaps a mesh network, the objective of the Wavelength Switched Packet Network (WASPNET) project is to gain a more long-term understanding of how optical networks will develop. WASPNET is a WDM transport network that uses optical packet switching, resulting in greater flexibility, functionality, and granularity than possible with the current generation of WDM networks. These optical packets may be used to carry asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) or IP, for example, and the network is also designed to support <b>synchronous</b> <b>digital</b> hierarchy/synchronous optical <b>network</b> (SDH/SONET) traffic, thus permitting a smooth upgrade path. Optical packet switches [1 – 3] have attracted considerable research interest internationally due to their potential for overcoming projected difficulties with very large electronic switching cores, such as connection, pinout, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems. A key problem when designing packet switches of any kind is contention resolution, since multiple packets may arrive asynchronously {{at the same time to}} go to the same output. Buffering is often employed to solve this problem, but since optical random access memory (RAM) does not exist, delay lines (usually made of optical fiber) must be used to store optical packets and implement buffering. Various solutions to optical packet switching have been proposed, dictated by the buffering strategy [1].
