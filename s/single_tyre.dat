5000|$|Although the FIA {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a regulation <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> manufacturer from 2008, there only was one supplier (Bridgestone) from 2007 to 2010, since Bridgestone's only rival, Michelin, ended their participation in Formula One after the 2006 season.|$|E
50|$|The car was Fiat Linea {{prepared}} for competition. The FPT 1.4 16v turbo - 210cv {{is the final}} speed above 200km/h. The transmission has six forward speeds with sequential shift mechanism. Pirelli is the <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> supplier for the championship.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Signatech-Fiat. The FPT engine have 150 hp and a top speed of more than 200 km/h. The transmission has five forward speeds with sequential shift mechanism. Pirelli is the <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> supplier for the championship.|$|E
50|$|Steering is {{assisted}} by a hydraulic servo. Both axles are with <b>single</b> <b>tyres</b> size of 14.5-20". Fuel capacity is 210 litres. The direct current electrical system {{is equipped with}} an 840-Watt, 24-Volt generator. There are two 145 Ah batteries. A towing bracket at the rear end. A reconnaissance winch of 6.5-ton capacity and 60-metre cable length is mounted as standard {{and it can be}} used both in front and rear end of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The tubular {{backbone}} {{construction was}} once again selected. The main advantages of central load carrying backbone tube are in its high torsional and bending stiffness protecting the truck's body against load stresses. Another advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drive train {{as well as it}} enables a concept of modular construction where designers and customers can specify 4,6,8, wheel drive and various length wheelbase combinations. A new cab-over-engine design was implemented, as were the wide profile super <b>single</b> <b>tyres</b> and central tyre inflation/deflation system.|$|R
50|$|Militarisation {{packages}} and modification are extensive and range from basic to near-tactical, and can include air-conditioning and/ or an auxiliary heater to manage extreme climate conditions, blackout lighting, NATO trailer coupling, rifle brackets in the cab, a roof hatch for observation and/or {{a machine gun}} mount, and steel bumpers with black out lights. To enhance mobility, <b>single</b> <b>tyred</b> axles (with differential locks) are available, these with a central tyre inflation system (CTIS) and runflat inserts if required. More extensive militarisation can include a fording capability of up to 750 mm, a self-recovery winch, and military-specific electrics/electronics and communication/ command equipment.|$|R

5000|$|The late 20s {{and early}} 30s were {{an era of}} {{transition}} in relation to bicycle equipment and race conditions. Areas of controversy were the use of variable gears and two sprocket wheels, <b>single</b> <b>tyres,</b> the use of butterfly or wing nuts [...] {{and the provision of}} outside assistance. The Dunlop Grand Prix permitted variable gears but prohibited butterfly or wing nuts and singles. The riders were required to repair their own bikes during the stage, were not able to change bicycles unless it was bona fide damaged [...] and no spare parts or other assistance were permitted. Similarly the riders were not permitted to accept food or drink other than from officials at feeding stations or procured by rider from established store, hotel or refreshment room.|$|R
5000|$|Volkswagen's first {{joint venture}} into trucks {{outside of their}} own LT range was with MAN Nutzfahrzeuge (Commercial Vehicles) from 1977-1993. Truck {{production}} started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced. It was available with four engines and four wheelbases over its lifetime; {{there was also a}} 4X4 version called 8.150 FAE. FAE means [...] "forward control" [...] cab, all-wheel drive, <b>single</b> <b>tyres</b> so the F nomenclature means [...] "forward control" [...] cab. This series is usually referred to as the G90, from the most common model, but also as the [...] "G"-series. In the United Kingdom it was originally marketed as the [...] "MAN MT" [...] series. The original lineup in the UK consisted of the 6.90 and the 8.90 (the first digit denoting the GVW in tonnes, the second for power in metric horsepower) and the 8.136 and 9.136.|$|R
50|$|Australian road {{transport}} {{has a reputation}} for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super <b>single</b> <b>tyres</b> are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.|$|R
50|$|To further {{keep costs}} in check, the BTCC uses a <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> {{supplier}}, with Dunlop the current supplier of rubber {{to all the}} teams. For dry races, the Dunlop SportMaxx Prime tyre is used, along {{with the use of}} the Option tyre (Soft/Hard) mandated at one race each meeting. For wet races, the Dunlop SportMaxx BluResponse tyre is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{other big}} story of 2007 was {{the return to}} a <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> formula (Bridgestone). It was {{perceived}} that this accounted {{for some of the}} reason why Ferrari led the early tests, although it was claimed by Bridgestone that the 2007 tyre is of a completely new build, thus minimising any real benefit for the 2006 Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Toyota, Williams, Midland/Spyker and Super Aguri).|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} event for Bridgestone as a <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> {{supplier}} in MotoGP, before they are replaced by Michelin for the 2016 season.After a court trial involving Valentino Rossi's clash with Marc Márquez in the previous race, the FIM staff and CAS rejected Rossi's appeal of suspension of three penalty points given for purposely pushing Márquez wide, and declared that he would start the round from last place.|$|E
5000|$|From 1967 until 1977, MAN {{collaborated with}} France's Saviem, selling their light to medium duty trucks with MAN badging in Germany and certain other markets. After {{the end of}} this, a deal was struck with Volkswagen which lasted until 1993. Production of a truck using the Volkswagen LT body started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced. It was {{available}} with four engines and four wheelbases over its lifetime; {{there was also a}} 4X4 version called 8.150 FAE.

50|$|The Bedford OY is an army lorry (truck) {{built by}} Bedford for the British Armed Forces and {{introduced}} in 1939. It {{was based on}} Bedford's O-series commercial vehicles with a modified front end and <b>single</b> rear <b>tyres.</b> It was designed for a 3-ton payload. The OYD was a general service vehicle, while the OYC was a tanker version for carrying water or petrol. These vehicles were widely used during, and after, World War II but were later superseded by the Bedford RL.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of low bridges on {{almost all of}} the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. An batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80hp six-cylinder engine powered <b>single</b> <b>tyres</b> on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room. Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.|$|R
50|$|Drive axles are MAN <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> hub-reduction, {{and with}} the {{exception}} of the heavier tractor units which are full-time all-wheel drive for traction and torque distribution reasons, all models have selectable front axle(s) drive. All axles have cross-axle differential locks and there are longitudinal differential locks in rear (and front on 8×8 and 10x10 chassis) axle combinations and the transfer case. Axle weight ratings are 9000 kg or 11,000 kg for front axles, and 10,000 kg for rear axles with single wheels/tyres.|$|E
5000|$|The 2008 British Superbike Championship {{season was}} {{scheduled}} to begin on 6 April 2008, however snow at Brands Hatch forced the abandonment of the day's races, which were later rescheduled. [...] The series was rescheduled to start on 20 April and end on 12 October 2008. Starting with this season the championship will have a <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> supplier. Pirelli beat Dunlop to sign a 3-year deal. For the 2008 season the engine configuration regulations have been changed in parallel {{with those of the}} World Superbike Championship, to permit the racing of 1200 cc V-twins against 1000 cc four-cylinder machines.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of {{successful}} initiatives in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, {{the introduction of a}} Smart Truck or performance-based standards (PBS) approach in the heavy vehicle sector in South Africa was identified by the CSIR as a research area warranting funding because of the potential benefits in terms of transport efficiency, road/vehicle safety and the protection of road infrastructure. The PBS approach involves setting standards to specify the performance required from the operation of a vehicle on a network rather than prescribing how the specified level of performance is to be achieved. A need was identified to design, manufacture and operate a number of PBS demonstration projects in South Africa in order to gain practical experience in the PBS approach and to quantify and evaluate potential benefits. The Smart Truck demonstration projects have been designed and manufactured to comply with the safety standards of the Australian PBS system. These include directional and non-directional manoeuvres such as acceleration capability, slow speed swept path, static rollover threshold and rearward amplification. In order to evaluate the impact of the PBS vehicles on pavements, the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design and Analysis Methodology was used to calculate the road wear characteristics of various baseline and PBS vehicle combinations. In most cases, the PBS vehicles were found to be significantly more road-friendly per ton of payload than the corresponding baseline vehicles. Modifications for reducing road wear were identified such as load redistribution {{in order to reduce the}} load on the steering axle, replacing wide-based <b>single</b> <b>tyres</b> with dual tyres and, where appropriate, replacing a single steer axle with a twin steer axle unit. The paper describes the results of road wear analyses of five PBS vehicles and the corresponding baseline vehicles...|$|R
50|$|The TGM range became {{available}} commercially during 2006, replacing the earlier M2000 range. The first customer for militarised TGM models was the Austrian Army. Militarised TGM models have gross vehicle weights ranging from around 12- to 18-tonnes {{and are available}} with wheelbase options of 3.2, 3.6, 3.9, 4.2 and 4.5 m. Standard engine option for militarised TGM models is the six-cylinder D08 engine with up to 340 hp, this coupled to a nine-speed ZF manual all-synchromesh gearbox and MAN two-speed transfer case with selectable or permanent all-wheel drive. An Allison fully automatic transmission is optional. Axles are of the hub-reduction type, rear drive axles being <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> specific if required. Examples with undriven front axles are also available. Suspension is by conventional leaf springs, complemented by shock absorbers and anti-roll bars as required. Standard tyre size is 14.00 R 20, with options including 395/85R 20 or 525/65R 20.5.|$|E
5000|$|Randy de Puniet {{rejoined the}} team in [...] Again, the team {{struggled}} with the satellite bike and Michelin tyres. De Puniet's best finish was only sixth position at the United States Grand Prix. De Puniet returned for the [...] season, once again with the RC212V, but with Bridgestone tyres, as MotoGP shifted to a <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> manufacturer rule. In the British Grand Prix, De Puniet finished third, his best result with the team, and the team's first podium in the premier class since Stoner's 2006 podium. In , de Puniet finished the season in ninth place aboard a Honda RC212V, with his best result being a fourth place at the Catalan Grand Prix. After the departure of de Puniet to the Pramac Racing team, the team signed reigning Moto2 world champion Toni Elías for the 2011 season, and Elías finished 15th in the championship, finishing five races in the top ten.|$|E
5000|$|A hugely {{significant}} change in 2005 was the absence of tyre changes during pit stops. Under new regulations, a driver had to use one set of tyres during qualifying and the race itself. Tyre changes were allowed for punctures and for wet weather, {{under the direction of}} the FIA. The FIA had to post a [...] "change in climatic conditions" [...] notice in order for tyre changes to occur normally. After Kimi Räikkönen's disastrous accident at the Nurburgring when his suspension collapsed after a flat-spotted tyre ripped the carbon fiber suspension apart, team principals and the FIA agreed that a <b>single</b> <b>tyre</b> change per car could be made without penalty, provided it was to change a tyre that had become dangerously worn like Räikkönen's had. Obviously, preserving a single set of tyres for the entire race became a new challenge for drivers; the challenge for tyre manufactures was to produce more durable, long-lasting compounds. Michelin-shod runners had a distinct advantage over their Bridgestone counterparts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a finite element (FE) study on the analysis of reinforced concrete decks in multi-cell box girder bridges under wheel loading. The deck bending moments were investigated for typical multi-cell box girder bridges with various overhang widths and girder spacings. A parametric study related to the tyre pressure distribution showed that a <b>single</b> uniform <b>tyre</b> pressure distribution produces maximum moment effects in reinforced concrete (R/C) decks. The FE analysis showed that the AASHTO LRFD and Standard Specifications methods overestimated the overhang transverse negative bending moments for overhang widths between 105 cm (3. 5 ft) and 165 cm (5. 5 ft) and the transverse positive bending moment for girder spacings between 3 m (10 ft) and 4. 2 m (14 ft).
