5|$|Battlefield Germany is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during a fictional <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> which the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact engage in a conventional war throughout Europe, mostly centring in West and East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Blue Line trains share {{a single}} tunnel with Orange Line and Silver Line trains {{to cross the}} Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, {{creating}} a choke point. A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the Blue Line between the Rosslyn and Stadium–Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown. The proposal was later rejected due to cost, but Metro again started considering a similar <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP events may be designed for educational or political purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> which {{they are forced to}} improvise speech or writing in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulties}} in communication about sexuality-related matters in HIV prevention require appropriate research approaches. Scenarios {{can be useful}} in qualitative, quantitative research methods and interventions related to sensitive cognitive issues of human sexuality. This paper presents an analysis of the use of <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> HIV/AIDS prevention research from the literature and empirical evidence. Examples of scenario-based instrument development research studies in safer sex communication for the prevention of HIV/AID by Kalichman (2000) and Magowe (2006) are provided. A computer-based search of articles addressing the use of case <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> research was conducted on Google and Google scholar, using the following search terms: “case scenarios”, “scenarios <b>in</b> research”, case <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> safer sex negotiation: “case <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> safer sex communication”, “case <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> dyadic communication”, “partner communication”, “case research”, “vignettes in HIV/AIDS research”, and, “sexuality related vignettes”. Papers included provided the definition, purpose, components, types of scenarios, use of <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> safer sex communication. Examples are drawn from instruments development studies using with case scenarios. Twenty-nine documents were retrieved, and eight of these studies addressed the use of <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> research. Five studies were specifically on HIV prevention research, focusing on safer sex communication, negotiation or couple/partner communication. The content of the studies included the definition of scenarios, case scenarios and vignettes; purpose and use of <b>scenarios</b> <b>in</b> research. Studies showed that <b>scenarios</b> are useful <b>in</b> qualitative elicitation of themes and content for instrument development for further quantitative research. Nursing deals with sensitive and complex cognitive issues in human behavior, and therefore scenario-based research can help develop personoriented research and interventions while protecting the individual’s privacy and confidentiality.   </p...|$|R

5|$|In the PlayStation 2 version, {{there are}} nine plot lines that the player will {{have the chance to}} experience, one for each of the heroines in the story except Sango and Ruri, who share the same plot line. This is {{expanded}} to ten plot lines in the Windows and PlayStation Portable versions with the addition of Sasara's scenario, and further expanded to eleven scenarios in the PlayStation 3 version with the addition of Mio's <b>scenario.</b> <b>In</b> order to view all of the plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in alternate directions. In all versions, the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> To Heart 2 Another Days, which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be heading up a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

5|$|Leo Kashida {{worked as}} an {{outsourced}} writer with Key on Tomoyo After, Little Busters! and Angel Beats. Chika Shirokiri, another outsourced writer who worked with Key on Little Busters!, also wrote the scenario for Kud Wafter. Manack and members of PMMK composed music in Little Busters!, and members of MintJam helped with arrangement. Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before Kanons release, working {{as one of the}} signature composers, but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of Little Busters!. Jun'ichi Shimizu composed all the music in Kud Wafter. Two outsourced writers worked on the scenario for Rewrite and its fan disc Rewrite Harvest festa!: Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, and Romeo Tanaka. Rewrite and Harvest festa! also featured three outsourced musical composers: Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Mizutsuki later returned to compose music for Harmonia. At the time Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer, Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on the <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> Little Busters!. Tonokawa later contributed to the <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> Rewrite and Harvest festa!, but resigned from Key in 2015. Itaru Hinoue, one of Key's founding members, was Key's main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for six of Key's games. Hinoue resigned from Key in September 2016 after working on Harmonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} places the player {{in control of}} either Jennifer or Helen, {{escaping}} from Scissorman within the university research building. The second chapter will have the player retrieve the Demon Idol, {{a clue to the}} murder investigation. The <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> which the idol is retrieved can change depending on choices made by the player earlier. Helen may search for it within the city library, or reporter Nolan Campbell or detective Stan Gotts will search for it in the home of a Barrows family butler. The final chapter occurs at Barrows Castle, putting the player in control of the same character they controlled in chapter one. Jennifer or Helen must use the Demon Idol to open a vortex in the castle basement and destroy Scissorman. Depending on the narrative followed and choices made along the way, 10 different endings can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. The player has a chance to assume the role of four protagonists, two in each Ef: The First Tale and Ef: The Latter Tale. Each protagonist is paired with a heroine, and each <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> the original PC versions of the visual novels includes scenes with sexual content. These scenes are removed or modified in the PlayStation 2 port.|$|E

The size of the <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> Harvest festa! is roughly comparable in size to Tomoyo After. The fan disc also features official character art of Inoue, a supporting character who was not illustrated in Rewrite. Unlike Rewrite, Kotarou is fully voiced in the fan disc. The five system sound themes included with the Rewrite laptops were released with the fan disc, with the addition of dialogue of Kagari by Kana Hanazawa.|$|E

In both minigames, the player controls one of the heroines from To Heart 2 storyline, who is made available upon the completion of her <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> the main portion of the game. The first of the two minigames, titled , is a scrolling shooter in which the player's goal is to progress through a vertically scrolling level, while attacking enemies that resemble confectioneries and dodging their attacks. The second, titled , is a puzzle game in which the player competes against an opponent for the highest score, by connecting three or more books of the same color and eliminating them from the screen.|$|E
5|$|A 113-page guidebook titled To Heart 2: Master Guide was {{published}} by MediaWorks on January 15, 2005. The book contains poster artwork, the 'face patterns' of each character, selected CG scenes and a guide on how to play through each character's scenarios. Voice actress interviews are also included, {{as well as a}} brief guide on how to play through each <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> To Heart. This was followed by another 192-page guidebook for the visual novel titled The Essence of To Heart 2: To Heart 2 Official Guidebook, which {{was published}} by Enterbrain on March 4, 2005. The book contains detailed character descriptions, a complete walk through to every heroine in the game, computer graphics, and interviews with the game's development staff. Enterbrain also released a 223-page guidebook entitled The Essence of To Heart 2 Portable: To Heart 2 Portable Official Guidebook for the PlayStation Portable version of the game on August 18, 2009. The guidebook is based on the original Essence for the PlayStation 2 game, but contained new and revised content for the PSP version. A guidebook for the PSP spinoff To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers, named To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers Official Complete Guide, was released by Enterbrain on August 11, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a safety is scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by the defense, and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently with CBS) called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different <b>scenario,</b> <b>in</b> which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> the early 2020s.|$|E
