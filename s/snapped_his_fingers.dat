5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles <b>snapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
