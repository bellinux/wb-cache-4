40|$|Methods {{are rooted}} in {{paradigms}} and serve as the proper instruments for researching {{the kinds of questions}} that make sense within a given paradigm. In this article, I will argue that methods which derive from the mechanistic paradigm of modern science are inappropriate for astrological research and therefore unlikely to provide support for the astrological hypothesis. A paradigm is the worldview within which one attempts to understand a given phenomenon. Theories are housed in paradigms like steel girders within a skyscraper. Remove a theory from the paradigm it naturally supports and the theory becomes unintelligible, like trying to understand the concept of "steel girder " with no concept of what "building " means. Without buildings, steel girders make no sense. Vice versa, placing a theory in the wrong paradigm and then assessing its validity is like placing a dream under a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine to discern its meaning. Reduced to electronic signals that form images on a computer screen, the dream becomes unintelligible. <b>Something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> when astrology is interred in the mechanistic paradigm an...|$|E
