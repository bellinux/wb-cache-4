Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{group and}} relational differences in personality, health, and coping across 189 Australian students and 243 Singaporean students. Life Orientation Test—Revised showed a one-factor structure for Australians but a two-factor structure for Singaporeans. Australians {{tended to be}} more agreeable, more conscientious, more optimistic, more satisfied with their lives, while Singaporeans {{tended to be more}} neurotic and more pessimistic. Singaporeans tended to utilize less frequent adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. Neuroticism was a <b>significant</b> predictor <b>for</b> state-trait anxiety and stress, while unipolar optimism was a <b>significant</b> predictor <b>for</b> life satisfaction and unipolar pessimism was a <b>significant</b> predictor <b>for</b> trait anxiety for both samples. Bipolar optimism was a <b>significant</b> predictor <b>for</b> trait anxiety and life satisfaction for both samples whereas it was a <b>significant</b> predictor <b>for</b> state anxiety for the Singaporean sample. Optimists, pessimists, and neurotics in both samples tended to use different coping strategies. Limitations and implications are discussed...|$|R

The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic {{elements in the}} same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E

What is <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944 the Royal Navy sent a {{flotilla}} into the Adriatic, both to secure the area and to attack German coastal shipping. The coastal shipping became increasingly <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the German forces deployed in the Independent State of Croatia, and especially Dalmatia—as road and rail routes became unsafe for use because of activity of the Yugoslav Partisans. To deny that option, the Royal Navy initiated Operation Exterminate, primarily aimed at destruction of German corvettes. On 26 October, the Yugoslav Partisans informed Lieutenant Commander Morgan Morgan-Giles, commander of the coastal forces in the north Adriatic, that there were two German destroyers in a cove on the south coast of the Rab Island.|$|E

5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
