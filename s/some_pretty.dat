The teams {{exchanged}} power plays before Lutchenko scored a power play goal on a slap shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E

25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.|$|E
25|$|The {{competitive}} edge for Dorsey's Micom 2000 was that, {{unlike many other}} machines, it was truly programmable. The Micom machine countered the problem of obsolescence by avoiding the limitations of a hard-wired system of program storage. The Micom 2000 utilized RAM, which was mass-produced and totally programmable. The Micom 2000 {{was said to be}} a year ahead of its time when it was introduced into a marketplace that represented <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> serious competition such as IBM, Xerox and Wang Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|It {{was about}} this time that the quartet of the Rue du Vieux Colombier, so famous in French {{literary}} history, was formed. It consisted of La Fontaine, Racine, Boileau and Molière, the last of whom was almost {{of the same age}} as La Fontaine, the other two considerably younger. Chapelain was also a kind of outsider in the coterie. There are many anecdotes, <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> obviously apocryphal, about these meetings. The most characteristic is perhaps that which asserts that a copy of Chapelain's unlucky Pucelle always lay on the table, a certain number of lines of which was the appointed punishment for offences against the company. The coterie furnished under feigned names the personages of La Fontaine's version of the Cupid and Psyche story, which, however, with Adonis, was not printed till 1669.|$|E

25|$|López had <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> memorable moments {{while playing}} in Puerto Rico. In his debut, {{he struck out}} 11 Tiburones de Aguadilla batters, {{including}} the side in the fifth inning, but lost the game. He rebounded in his next start, pitching a shutout against the Leones de Ponce and also homering in that win. Then, López faced Negro league star Terris McDuffie and the Senadores de San Juan in game one of a crucial series. During the game, Cangrejeros fans roared when López struck out Monte Irvin {{with the bases loaded}} and forced McDuffie to hit into an eight inning double play to preserve a 2–1 lead. Previously, López had driven in both Santurce runs with a single. He was carried off the field by the Santurce fans after the victory, while the Cangrejeros swept the two games of the series.|$|E
25|$|France’s {{experience}} in Afghanistan has mirrored every other country’s misadventures in this Central Asian state; some small successes followed by <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> devastating defeats. Initially, the French involvement in Afghanistan {{was limited to}} the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Kabul; as that mission expanded to encompass the entire country, France slowly amped up its involvement. By 2008, France had sole responsibility for Kapisa, and a district of Kabul Province that borders it. The French mission in Afghanistan has been fraught with struggle. The French military has fought very hard in Afghanistan and lost a lot of soldiers in the process: 87 since 2008 (many argue that there were more fatalities), behind only the U.S., Canada, and the UK. Yet, the newly elected French President François Hollande announced that French troops would withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2012– sparking speculation about whether this indicated the NATO coalition there is starting to crumble.|$|E

Adenike Gboyega of MOBO gave a positive review to Banks' performance, writing that Banks [...] "flexed with <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> impressive live vocals" [...] during her performance.

500|$|The {{book was}} adapted into a two-part episode for the Goosebumps {{television}} series. Airing as episodes 8 and 9 {{of the third}} season, the first episode aired on October 25, 1997 and the second episode aired on November 1, 1997. The character Clay {{was not included in}} the episodes. A reviewer on DVD Talk wrote, [...] "This two-part episode is largely enjoyable, with <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> scary moments, though it has a disturbing subtext and an ending that may leave younger children especially feeling squeamish".|$|E
500|$|In the {{introduction}} {{section of the}} book, Randall Munroe recounts wondering as a child whether [...] "there were more hard things or soft things in the world", concluding that [...] "the world contained about three billion soft things and five billion hard things". The conversation that was produced by this question impressed Munroe's mother {{to such a degree}} that she wrote it down. Though Munroe later stated that his question was rather meaningless, he used it as an example of how [...] "thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> interesting places".|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more mixed or {{negative}}, with many criticizing the negative reveal {{of the feminist}} Lilith House. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV thought that the episode raised more questions than it answered: such as [...] " [...] seem to accept that several rapes were faked, and then Veronica seems to just leave without that question being answered," [...] arguing that the abrupt ending to the scene constituted an out-of-character moment (she should have acted more negatively). In addition, he criticized Bell's performance, commenting [...] "Speaking of Veronica, she seemed like she was on something tonight. Just outright acting silly-odd, dancing around with <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> lame jokes." ...|$|E

You resemble none of the rest, Lina. There are <b>some</b> <b>prettier</b> faces than yours here. You are not a model beauty like Harriet Sykes, for instance--beside her your person appears almost insignificant--but you look agreeable, you look reflective, you look what I call interesting." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Triangle" [...] is also {{notable for}} {{featuring}} the first kiss between Mulder and Scully. In a positive critique, Kerry Fall from DVD Journal {{wrote that the}} entry was made particularly notable, in and of itself, due {{to the presence of}} the kiss. Kessenich opined that the kiss built off [...] "the seeds that were planted in the movie ... Scully clearly believes this is a man lost in delirium, but Mulder ... is finally beginning to deal with <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> powerful feelings he has for his partner." [...] Paula Vitaris, on the other hand, was frustrated; she complained [...] "hen are these kisses that are not kisses going to end?" ...|$|E
500|$|The trophies were {{presented}} to the winning crews by the five-time Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave. OUWBC's winning president Chitty said [...] "It's a really special moment, something I've been working towards for three years" [...] while her counterpart Reid accepted that Cambridge [...] "didn't get off to [...] best start and Oxford did" [...] and that the conditions were [...] "pretty horrendous around the halfway mark with the wind against the tide and <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> high waves". [...] Oxford's stroke Davies said: [...] "I'm so glad we can be role models to all the young women out there." [...] Cambridge's coach Baker noted [...] "We’ve got a young crew that {{has come a long}} way and they raced their best ... We’ve improved quite a lot, but it just wasn’t good enough".|$|E

60|$|That night Jack Dalton {{told them}} {{the story of a}} bear hunt, which was more than ordinarily interesting. He said that bears were by no means {{plentiful}} in the lake region and yet there were a few around, <b>some</b> of <b>pretty</b> fair size.|$|R
500|$|After the tour, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich, who, {{according}} to Yorke, [...] "gave us a walloping kick up the arse". In October 2006, recording started at Tottenham House in Marlborough, Wiltshire, a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as {{the building was}} in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as [...] "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. It definitely had an effect. It had <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> strange vibes." [...] The sessions were productive, and the band recorded [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] and [...] "Bodysnatchers". In October, Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had [...] "started the record properly now ... starting to get somewhere I think. Finally." ...|$|E
500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed {{it was the first}} CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".|$|E
500|$|General Cornwallis {{occupied}} {{the house of}} Thomas Cooch, and Howe's forces remained at Iron Hill for five days. [...] In a letter to Congress, Washington justified the defeat by saying, [...] "This Morning the Enemy came out with considerable force and three pieces of Artillery, against our Light advanced Corps, and after <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> smart skirmishing obliged them to retreat, being far inferior in number and without Cannon." [...] Certain that Howe would advance along the main road toward Wilmington in his bid to capture Philadelphia, Washington continued to fortify {{the city and the}} Red Clay Creek. He moved his headquarters from Wilmington to Newport, and the army formed defenses between Newport and Marshallton. While Howe's army remained in place, the two forces engaged in small skirmishes over the next few days. One officer under Howe noted that the rebel patrols, which usually consist of 10 to 15 dragoons and 20 to 30 infantrymen, now appear more often, and they fire at our posts occasionally." ...|$|E
