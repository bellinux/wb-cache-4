40|$|Sudden slip on {{geological}} faults {{or other}} discontinuities in rock may be preceded by an initial phase of "slow" fault creep. A simple plane strain {{model of a}} suddenly loaded fault is analysed to illustrate the possible transition from stable slip behaviour to accelerated, unstable slip. The model assumes that a peaked shear load is applied suddenly to the fault region. The rate of slip movement {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the difference between the applied shear stress and the cohesive and frictional slip resistance. It is found that the evolutionary fault movement can be described succinctly by a non-linear ordinary differential equation describing the activated length of the <b>sliding</b> <b>fault</b> as a function of time. The differential equation is found to depend on a single, dimensionless parameter whose value determines whether the fault slip decays monotonically or accelerates in an unstable manner...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} contact damage {{accumulation}} from cyclic loading with spheres and ensuing strength degradation in relatively tough, heterogeneous ceramics is developed. The damage {{takes the form}} of a quasi-plastic zone beneath the contact, consisting of an array of closed frictional shear faults with attendant “wing ” microcracks at their ends. Contact fatigue takes place by attrition of the frictional resistance at the <b>sliding</b> <b>fault</b> interfaces, in accordance with an empirical degradation law, allowing the microcracks to extend. At large numbers of cycles or loads the microcracks coalesce, ultimately into radial cracks. Fracture mechanics relations for the strength degra-dation as a function of number of cycles and contact load are derived. Indentation–strength data from two well-studied coarse-grain quasi-plastic ceramics, a micaceous glass-ceramic and a silicon nitride, are used to evaluate the model. Compar-ative tests in static and cyclic contact loading confirm a dominant mechanical component in the fatigue. At the same time, the presence of water is shown to enhance the fatigue. The model accounts for the broader trends in the strength degradation data, and paves the way for consideration of key variables in microstructural design for optimum fatigue resis-tance. I...|$|E

In the preceding paper, Scholz discusses this problem {{in the context of}} fault strength and the state of stress within the crust. I focus on the second-order aspects of brittle failure that relate to the stability of frictional <b>sliding,</b> <b>fault</b> slip, and earthquakes. The presentation is divided into three sections covering friction laws, field observations of the rheology of brittle fault zones, and current directions in laboratory research. A generic theme is the question of what is the minimum level of complexity in terms of parameters and mechanisms needed to describe laboratory observations, seismic data, and other field observations of faulting. 1) Friction laws. What level of complexity? A central goal in fault mechanics and problems involving brittle deformation at plate margins is to put forth a reasonably complete description of the strength and constitutive properties of lithospheric faults and, in particular, the seismogenic zone. Constitutive laws for brittle failure are necessary for describing and understanding the field observations and theoretical results used to construct and test hypotheses for crustal deformation.

East Suzhou mining area, located in the overlying system of Xu-Su thrust nappe structure, has good sealing conditions to preserve gas, which leads to a well developed high-gas coal reservoir. Relatively, south Suzhou mining area lies in the underlying system, showing a low gas content. Meanwhile, mine structures also control the heterogeneity of gas distribution. For example, relatively large scale mine fractures are always the demarcation of adjacent gas division and the shear fractures is the main basis for division of relatively closed tectonic units.

40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{a series of}} high-resolution friction experiments on large floating saline ice floes in an environmental test basin. In these experiments, a central ice floe was pushed between two other floes, sliding along two interfacial faults. The frictional motion was predominantly stick–slip. Shear stresses, normal stresses, local strains and slip displacement were measured along the <b>sliding</b> <b>faults,</b> and acoustic emissions were monitored. High-resolution measurements during a single stick–slip cycle at several positions along the fault allowed us to identify two phases of frictional slip: a nucleation phase, where a nucleation zone begins to slip before the rest of the fault, and a propagation phase when the entire fault is slipping. This is slip-weakening behaviour. We have therefore characterized what we consider to be a key deformation mechanism in Arctic Ocean dynamics. In order to understand the micromechanics of sea ice friction, we have employed a theoretical constitutive relation (i. e. an equation for shear stress in terms of temperature, normal load, acceleration, velocity and slip displacement) derived from the physics of asperity–asperity contact and sliding (Hatton et al. 2009 Phil. Mag. 89, 2771 – 2799 (doi: 10. 1080 / 14786430903113769)). We find that our experimental data conform reasonably with this frictional law once slip weakening is introduced. We find that the constitutive relation follows Archard's law rather than Amontons' law, with Embedded Image (where τ is the shear stress and σn is the normal stress) and n[*]=[*] 26 / 27, with a fractal asperity distribution, where the frictional shear stress, τ[*]=[*]ffractal Tmlws, where ffractal is the fractal asperity height distribution, Tml is the shear strength for frictional melting and lubrication and ws is the slip weakening.

30|$|The rupture {{behavior}} of a fault from the Dieterich-Ruina constitutive model (Ruina [1983]; Dieterich [1978]) describes the frictional evolution of a <b>fault</b> for different <b>sliding</b> velocities with the material parameter (a-b) representing the difference in steady-state friction. It indicates stable <b>sliding</b> of <b>fault</b> surfaces during slip if (a-b) > 0 or unstable sliding if (a-b) < 0. The synonyms for stable and unstable sliding are velocity-strengthening and velocity-weakening behavior, respectively. The effect of clay on the rupture {{behavior of}} faults has been studied by many laboratory experiments. Ikaris et al. ([2011]) found experimental evidence {{for the relationship between}} the weakness of rocks and their frictional stability: rock samples with a low friction coefficient show velocity-strengthening behavior, whereas samples with high friction coefficients show velocity-weakening behavior (Figure 1). This indicates the occurrence of brittle failure only on rocks with high friction coefficients. Zoback et al. ([2012]) observed experimentally on shale gas samples that faults with clay contents higher than 30 % slide stable (i.e., (a-b) > 0), whereas faults with a lower clay content slip unstable (i.e., (a-b) < 0, Figure 1 c). They reasoned that such clay-rich <b>faults</b> <b>slide</b> aseismically, whereas the faults with lower clay contents produce microseismic events. The dataset of Tembe illustrates a dependence of (a-b) of illite-quartz samples on the illite content. For these samples, no velocity-weakening behavior is observed. The {{reason for this is that}} quartz can behave both velocity strengthening and velocity weakening, and under the experimental conditions, it was velocity-strengthening (a-b) > 0 (Figure 1 c), but nevertheless the effect of the clay proportion of the samples on (a-b) is significant.|$|R

Changes in climate exert a first-order control on the recession of the icefront and the calving of the icebergs. Glacial and geological processes related to iceberg calving and transport shape the morphology of the seafloor in the area characteristically.

This data was complemented by a survey using a portable Seabeam 1180 multibeam system temporarily mounted on the small local vessel Smilla which could navigate through areas inside the icefjord inaccessible to large research vessels. A comprehensive image of the morphology of the area was achieved by compiling and merging both datasets. Different morphological features such as ridges, shaped like drumlins and valleys which could be connected to channel systems, directing debris flows to a deposition centre characterize {{the central part of the}} survey area. Here, a series of prominent circular features 80 m to 150 m in diameter and up to 30 m deep have been found and are interpreted as pockmarks.
