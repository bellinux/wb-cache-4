5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E
5|$|Jadzia confides in Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) {{that she}} feels obligated to pursue Curzon's oath, but Kira warns her about what killing <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> do to her. Kang, likewise, tells Jadzia {{that she is not}} bound by Curzon's oath, but she insists on joining their quest. Kor, as buoyant as ever, is delighted to have her along. Koloth is dismissive, until she shows him her skills with a Klingon bat'leth. Kang refuses to accept her, until she shames him with his own devotion to Klingon honor, and insists that she have the chance to avenge her godson. Before Jadzia can request a leave of absence, Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) confronts her in her quarters, refusing her request before she can make it. Jadzia tells him that she is going and begs him not to make her disobey a direct order. He does not give her {{permission}} to go but does not stop her either.|$|E

Later this month, <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> overhear Nancy, Darren and Maxine talking about Patrick's death, this person is thought to be Neeta Kaur who takes a sudden dislike to Darren, but this is because of Darren {{grabbing}} Maxine, it is later revealed that Nico Blake was the one who overheard them.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E

He does, however, receive support from Ariadne Oliver, and from a vicar's wife (Mrs Dane Calthrop) who desires him to stop {{whatever}} evil may be taking place. He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets Mr Bradley, a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him {{the means by which}} the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets that <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> die within {{a certain period of time}} and the client bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a certain period of time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed).|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> speak about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence {{is probably one of the}} most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E
500|$|According to Franklin, the {{selective}} fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced {{to attract and}} hold people's attention {{by focusing on the}} unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there [...] "and the world is structured to believe in them." [...] She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. [...] "And somewhere, <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'" ...|$|E

The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> die, and the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'"

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the organization, Christman began protesting in Florida against Scientology {{with members of the}} Lisa McPherson Trust. She picketed with signs outside of the organization's Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida. Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing, and Christman and Minton were fined US$100. On February 21, 2001, Judge Thomas E. Penick {{dismissed}} other charges in the case, and criticized Scientology for its treatment of critics, commenting, [...] "I'm missing the point here. I hope <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> let us know when the great invasion is coming." [...] This experience was a defining period for Christman, as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal. She maintained that the actions by representatives of Scientology against her were examples of the policy, [...] "Fair Game"; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR).

Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear that <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> come {{up with the idea of}} spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E

She leaves empty-handed. Rosamunde, a fellow orphan from the Kinraide orphan home, arrives at Obernewtyn and coldly informs Elspeth that her brother Jes had discovered he also had mental abilities, but was killed by guards in an escape attempt. Rushton comforts the distraught Elspeth, and asks her why she plagues him. Fearful that <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> soon be after her as well, her group’s escape plans begin in earnest. Elspeth returns a second time to the Doctor’s office, but when Vega, Alexi and Ariel enter, she learns Ariel {{is part of the}} Obernewtyn family, and that they are searching for a Misfit to help them find the location of Beforetime weapons. Pre-warned that two Councilmen are coming to fetch her for questioning by the Herders, at nightfall she makes to escape but Rushton stops her. He reveals a secret network of drains which gets her safely to the farms. Once she is safely through the drains after a close shave with Ariel's pack of mad, wild wolves, she finds that the path to the farms has been obscured by a blizzard and gets lost. She nearly dies, but a Misfit named Domick finds her and locks her in the farmhouse to return later to Obernewtyn.

Convincing them that her powers can help find him, she makes her way on foot through the blizzard to the far mountains, with Maruman as her guide.|$|E
