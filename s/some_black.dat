5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although <b>some</b> <b>black</b> students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of <b>some</b> <b>black</b> families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived {{through the ages}} and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by <b>some</b> <b>Black</b> artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>Black</b> Hebrews renounced their American {{citizenship}} {{to try to}} prevent more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped negotiate an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing and social services. The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel.|$|E
5|$|The Buckeye {{was first}} bred and {{developed}} in 1896, by a Warren, Ohio resident named Nettie Metcalf. They {{are the only}} American breed of chicken {{known to have been}} developed by a woman, despite the fact that women were customarily given charge of the household poultry flock throughout much of U.S. history. Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks, Buff Cochins, and <b>some</b> <b>black</b> breasted red games to produce the Buckeye. Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters. Contrary to popular belief the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed and Metcalf actually sent birds to the RIR breeders for them to improve their breed.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. <b>Some</b> <b>black</b> players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E

5|$|After {{production}} concluded on Harlem Nights, Bakshi {{wanted to}} distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi began writing the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin while editing Coonskin, and storyboarding a proposed series for ABC. The characters of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based upon Bakshi's high school friends, Norman Darrer and Allen Schechterman. }} Warner Bros. had previously agreed to distribute Fritz the Cat before pulling their funding from that film, but {{were eager to}} option the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin, and greenlit the film in 1973. Several African American animators, including graffiti artists, were hired by Bakshi's studio, {{at a time when}} black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios. Following controversy over the film Coonskin, <b>some</b> <b>black</b> animators left Bakshi's studio in embarrassment, resulting in production problems for Hey Good Lookin.|$|E

5|$|The {{common loon}} or great {{northern}} diver (Gavia immer) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure whiteunderpartsexcept <b>some</b> <b>black</b> on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with <b>some</b> <b>black</b> barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and {{a great source of}} pride for the white community, as well as for <b>some</b> <b>black</b> Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen <b>some</b> <b>black</b> smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes.

5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who has settled in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes he has <b>some</b> <b>black</b> ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught {{at the scene of the}} crime and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he is guilty of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E
