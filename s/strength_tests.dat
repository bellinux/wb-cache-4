25|$|The Isle of Man {{celebrated its}} inaugural celebration in 2012 at the Isle of Man College of Higher {{education}} on 19 November 2012. The organization emphasised the 2012 theme which highlighted World Health Organization figures showing {{that every year}} over {{half a million people}} die from violence and 83% of them are men and boys, and that a similar proportion of the global burden of disease (ill-health, disability or early death) from violence is borne by males. For activities the NSC held <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> and health advice; The Children's Centre loaned out their interactive babies and some parenting information and Will Sutton attended as the 'Positive' male role model for the day. The Student Council baked and sold cakes, and Sami-Jaine Martin (Student President) was running a Sexual Health Stand. The engineering group was selling moustaches and raising money for men's cancer charities, while construction group (with help from the art department) made an 8ft seaside cut out for photographs on the day. The beauty therapy department offered their time to pamper the boys with Indian head massages and face mapping, and there were also 3 students who volunteered to have their chest waxed to raise money for charity.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} step in diagnosing BFS is checking the patient for clinical weakness. Clinical weakness is often determined {{through a series of}} <b>strength</b> <b>tests,</b> such as observing the patient's ability to walk on his or her heels and toes. Resistance <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> may include raising each leg, pushing forward and backward with the foot and/or toes, squeezing with fingers, spreading fingers apart, and pushing with or extending arms and/or hands. In each such test the test provider will apply resisting force and monitor for significant differences in strength abilities of opposing limbs or digits. If such differences are noted or the patient is unable to apply any resisting force, clinical weakness may be noted.|$|E
25|$|Muscle <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the presence of a neuromuscular disease, but cannot determine its cause.

5000|$|Compressive <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> are {{conducted}} by certified technicians using an instrumented, hydraulic ram {{which has been}} annually calibrated with instruments traceable to the Cement and Concrete Reference Laboratory (CCRL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S., or regional equivalents internationally. Standardized form factors are 6" [...] by 12" [...] or 4" [...] by 8" [...] cylindrical samples, with some laboratories opting to utilize cubic samples. These samples are compressed to failure. Tensile <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> {{are conducted}} either by three-point bending of a prismatic beam specimen or by compression {{along the sides of}} a standard cylindrical specimen. These destructive tests are not to be equated with nondestructive testing using a rebound hammer or probe systems which are hand-held indicators, for relative strength of the top few millimeters, of comparative concretes in the field.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a laboratory investigation on optimum level of Fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) as a partial replacement of cement {{to study the}} strength characteristics of concrete. Portland cement was partially replaced by 5 %, 6 %, 7 %, 8 %, 9 %, 10 % of GGBS and Fly ash by 20 %, 40 %, 60 % respectively. The water to cementations materials ratio was maintained at 0. 45 for all mixes. The strength characteristics of the concrete were evaluated by conducting Compressive <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> Splitting Tensile <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and Flexural <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> The compression <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> were conducted for 7 days and 28 days of curing and split tensile <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and flexural <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> were conducted for 28 days of curing on a M 25 grade concrete. The mix proportion M 25 {{was found to be}} 1 : 1. 36 : 2. 71. The test results proved that the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength of concrete mixtures containing GGBS and Fly ash increases as the amount of GGBS and Fly ash increase. After an optimum point, at around 9 % of GGBS and 40 % of Fly ash of the total binder content, the further addition of GGBS and fly ash does not improve the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength...|$|R

40|$|Concrete has {{weakness}} in the lower tensile strenght and it is brittle so that concrete is given steel enforcement to overcome it. In the research, the concrete mix is given additional material of galvanic fiber wire. The addition is meant to increase {{the strength of the}} concrete.

50|$|Because of {{the large}} number of boiler explosions on steamboats, the U.S. Congress passed {{legislation}} in 1830 which approved funds for correcting the problem.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{standardized}} <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> in the Constant-Murley shoulder assessment of adults with healthy shoulders in a randomized, single-blind design. The following questions {{were to be}} answered: (1) Can the spring balance and a digital dynamometer both yield the same result? (2) What is the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the <b>strength</b> <b>test?</b> (3) Is the <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> sensitive to change in technique or affected by calculation with mean or maximum values? Ten subjects were included in {{a comparison of the}} Handyscale (digital dynamometer) and the mechanical spring balance for concurrent validity, resulting in intraclass correlation coefficient values ranging from 0. 96 to 0. 99. For intraobserver and interobserver reliability, 2 observers tested 20 subjects with the Handyscale and retested them after 2 weeks. Regardless of technique during testing, this resulted in almost perfect agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0. 89 – 0. 98). The digital dynamometer can replace the conventional spring balance. The standardized <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> in the Constant-Murley shoulder assessment is reliable in young subjects with healthy shoulders, independent of technique or whether calculated with mean or maximum values.
