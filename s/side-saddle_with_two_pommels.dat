50|$|Historical reenactment participants, notably {{those in}} American Civil War reenactments, {{also tend to}} use the <b>two</b> <b>pommel</b> sidesaddle, since the single pommel sidesaddle that was used into mid-19th century is now {{regarded}} as creating an insufficiently secure seat for safe riding. Most sidesaddles have a regular girth or cinch, an overgirth that holds the flaps down, and most have either a back cinch or a balancing strap to hold the saddle down {{in the back and}} provide additional stability.|$|R
50|$|Modern sidesaddles {{are usually}} {{based on the}} Jules Pellier <b>two</b> <b>pommel</b> design. The {{underlying}} tree, girthing system, flap or fender design, styling features and type of leather used may differ, however, {{the structure of the}} fixed pommel and leaping horn is a consistent design feature across all riding styles. Sidesaddles built on a tree designed for sidesaddle use are properly balanced, but many modern sidesaddles are build on modified astride tree, which may result in an unbalanced, unridable saddle.|$|R

This engine runs on a gauge of 3.5 inches known as Gauge III and is powerful enough to pull several people. High Lines are a configuration of a continuously elevated track and riders sit <b>side-saddle</b> or <b>with</b> legs straddling the track depending on lineside clearances.|$|R
60|$|Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby (whom he {{just knew}} by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a <b>side-saddle</b> attitude, <b>with</b> {{one foot in}} a cotton stirrup. It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit's dignity and service, not to lunch. She {{supervised}} the meal officially, but implied that in her own stately person she considered lunch a weakness.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{the door}} {{of one of the}} supremely respectable and aristocratic but {{somewhat}} gloomy-looking houses in Cavendish Square, whose mauve plate-glass windows and link-extinguishers are like fossils of a past era of civilisation, three riding horses were being walked up and down, <b>two</b> <b>with</b> <b>side-saddles</b> and one for a gentleman. They were taken aside as a four-wheel drove up, while a female voice exclaimed—- ...|$|R
50|$|Eyser {{competed in}} both sets and did poorly {{in the first}} one. He was placed 10th in gymnastic 9-event {{all-around}} competition, which included 3 routines on both the horizontal bar and parallel bars, <b>two</b> on <b>pommel</b> horse and one on vault. Eyser was 71st in another gymnastic all-around event, which included the same devices, but smaller number of routines. He also competed in the athletics triathlon, but finished the last {{with the results of}} 8 m (26.1 ft) in shot put, 15.4 s in 100 meters sprint and 4 m (13 ft) in the long jump.|$|R
50|$|Eyser {{performed}} {{much better}} in the second competition set. On a single day of October 29, he won 6 medals in total, of which 3 were gold (parallel bars, long horse vault, and 25-foot rope climbing), <b>two</b> silver (<b>pommel</b> horse and 4-event all-around), and one bronze (horizontal bar). His main rival was another American, Anton Heida, who also won 6 medals, 5 gold and one silver. Heida shared gold with Eyser in the vault, was second after Eyser on parallel bars, but won the horizontal bar, pommel horse, all-around and team competitions. In the team competition, which was then held by the clubs, Concordia finished fourth.|$|R
60|$|In {{two minutes}} {{he had a}} little fire going clearly. He started, with his can, for the water hole. When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the bushes, a <b>side-saddled</b> pony <b>with</b> down-dropped reins {{cropping}} grass a little distance to his left. Just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was Josefa O'Donnell. She had been drinking water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands. Ten yards away, to her right, half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion. His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer's. His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping.|$|R
60|$|In {{the court}} of the old mansion, half manor-place, half farm-house, or rather a decayed manor-house, {{converted}} into an abode for a Cumberland tenant, stood several saddled horses. Four or five of them were mounted by servants or inferior retainers, {{all of whom were}} well armed with sword, pistol, and carabine. But two had riding furniture for the use of females--the one being accoutred <b>with</b> a <b>side-saddle,</b> the other <b>with</b> a pillion attached to the saddle.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bhaer did {{not approve}} of fighting, and {{did not think it}} a proof of either manliness or courage for <b>two</b> lads to <b>pommel</b> one another for the {{amusement}} of the rest. All sorts of hardy games and exercises were encouraged, and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles without whining; but black eyes and bloody noses given {{for the fun of it}} were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play.|$|R

For a crest, a panache of peacock plumes, all proper, {{charged with the}} arms of the shield. There is a new moon, as it were, not full, with both ends upward, yellow in a blue field, and <b>two</b> chipped sword <b>pommels</b> <b>with</b> crosses and hilts, of which one {{is in the middle of}} the moon, and the other beneath it. On a helmet above a crown is a peacock's tail, with the same moon and pommels.|$|R

In the grave with the skeleton was an ornate iron sword, described by the British Museum as [...] "probably the finest Iron Age sword in Europe". The sword itself was around 69 centimeters long. The scabbard was constructed in two sections, a front plate of decorated copper alloy, and a rear plate of iron. The iron pommel of the sword was decorated with fine red glass beads, and the <b>two</b> handle sections, <b>pommel</b> and handle guard were attached with rivets. The handle guard was made of horn, and the handle itself is an iron tube decorated with glass enameling.|$|R
