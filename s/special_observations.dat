40|$|Background: <b>Special</b> <b>observation</b> (the {{allocation}} of nurses {{to watch over}} nominated patients) is one means by which psychiatric services endeavour to keep in-patients safe from harm. The practice is both contentious and of unknown efficacy. Aims: To assess the relationship between <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> and self-harm rates, by ward, whilst controlling for potential confounding variables. Method: A multivariate cross sectional study collecting data on self-harm, <b>special</b> <b>observation,</b> other conflict and containment, physical environment, patient and staff factors for a six month period on 136 acute admission psychiatric wards. Results: Constant <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> {{was not associated with}} self-harm rates, but intermittent observation was associated with reduced self-harm, as were levels of qualified nursing staff and more intense programmes of patient activities. Conclusions: Certain features of nursing deployment and activity may serve to protect patients. The efficacy of constant <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> remains open to question...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Special</b> <b>observation</b> is a {{practice}} in common use in {{acute care settings}} for older people, in particular when dementia and/or delirium are/is experienced, {{but there is little}} evidence of best practice approaches. Aim and objectives: The overall aim of this project was to develop a working definition of <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> in acute aged care settings. The objectives were to identify barriers and enablers for undertaking <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> and compare descriptions of <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> practice by staff with those in policy and related documents. Methods: The setting was an acute care ward in a large regional hospital in New South Wales, Australia and the participants worked on this ward. Data consisted of policy and related documents and focus groups (Round 1 and Round 2). The data analysis technique adopted was content analysis. Findings: A total of four policy and related documents were reviewed and a total of six focus groups were undertaken (3 in Round 1 and 3 in Round 2). Participants consisted of Registered Nurses, Enrolled Nurses and Assistants in Nursing (n= 11). All participants completed Round 1 and Round 2 focus groups. The outcome was a working definition of <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> in acute aged care. Conclusions: The working definition reflects current and aspirational practice. <b>Special</b> <b>observation</b> is delivered following an individual assessment undertaken by nurses with advanced assessment and care planning skills using a nurse-patient ratio of 1 : 1 to: (i) enable person-centred therapeutic practice interventions and (ii) promote safety. Best practice <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> is promoted through the delivery of evidence based education and monitoring of adherence to a single policy. Future initiatives include writing a new policy and influencing other services in the hospital with reviewing their <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> practice. Implications for practice: <b>Special</b> <b>observation</b> with older persons is an area of practice where the potential for therapeutic activities remains unrecognised. Definitions need to have meaning for staff at a local level; Staff need help to know how to make better use of locally available evidence; Evidence based policies can be more easily developed from clearly generated definitions of <b>special</b> <b>observation</b> in acute aged car...|$|R

AIMS The aims of this study are to (i) establish the state of current published research on <b>special</b> <b>observations</b> in regard to older persons with dementia and/or delirium and (ii) make recommendations for research and practice. DESIGN AND METHOD A literature review. RESULTS Most literature pertains to adult mental health practice and services. Themes were generated and discussed in relation to gerontological practice.

It concludes that there is no published research on special or constant observations in relation to older people with dementia/delirium or the purpose of this activity. There is therefore a clear need to establish a research base in the topic.

However, until gerontological research is improved, research from mental health nursing will need to be drawn on with caution and the purpose of special observation determined locally.
