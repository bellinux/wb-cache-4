Negotiations had been {{underway}} with Pan American World Airways since early 1982, but the Civil Aeronautics Board would not approve sale to Pan Am because it felt that Pan Am would have a monopoly over other American carriers in the region. Pan American responded by offering to jointly lease the routes with Air Florida for three years at a price of 30 million USD. Pan American Chairman, and former Braniff International President, Ed Acker had previously served as Chairman of Air Florida before taking the leadership position at Pan American.

The demand for hotels {{during the period of}} the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear outpaced that of the [...] "Restoring Honor" [...] rally. The rally spawned several grassroots websites and Facebook groups for organizing and discussion, some with more than 10,000 followers. Proposals were made for dozens of sister rallies in other major cities, such as Seattle, Chicago, Austin, and Los Angeles to take place on the same day as the demonstration in Washington, D.C. On September 28, Arianna Huffington announced on The Daily Show that The Huffington Post would provide [...] "as many buses as people to fill them" [...] at a specified meeting place in Manhattan, although her plans were later scaled back and preregistration was imposed.|$|E
