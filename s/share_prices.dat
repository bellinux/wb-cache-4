The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion.

40|$|The {{issue of}} what determines <b>share</b> <b>price</b> of firms {{generated}} a lot of arguments among scholars all over the world. Various studies were conducted {{in an attempt to}} investigate whether corporate attributes such as firm size, leverage, profitability, liquidity, firm growth among others influence <b>share</b> <b>price</b> of an organization but the findings yielded mixed results. It is on this background that this study examines the impact of corporate attributes on the <b>share</b> <b>price</b> of listed pharmaceutical firms in Nigeria using a panel data of five sampled firms for a period of ten years (2004 - 2013). The data is extracted from the annual accounts of the selected firms.

The study reveals that firm size, leverage, profitability and growth have positive and significant relationship with <b>share</b> <b>price</b> implying that they have impact in increasing <b>share</b> <b>price.</b> However, the relationship between liquidity and <b>share</b> <b>price</b> is found to be negative, indicating that liquidity has no influence in enhancing <b>share</b> <b>price</b> of listed pharmaceutical firms in Nigeria.

40|$|Purpose– The paper aims {{to examine}} the {{influence}} of financial disclosure (FD) level and time on the value relevance of earnings, book value, and cash flows relative to three <b>share</b> <b>price</b> proxies, namely average annual <b>share</b> <b>price,</b> annual closing <b>share</b> <b>price,</b> and <b>share</b> <b>price</b> after a three-month period following the financial year-end for Jordanian companies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs price model to examine the influence of FD level and time on the value relevance of three accounting variables relative to three <b>share</b> <b>price</b> proxies for 91 Jordanian companies (consisting of 5, 460 observations) within 2004 - 2009. Findings– Relative to three <b>share</b> <b>price</b> proxies, the findings proved that FD level and time have a significant influence on the value relevance of book value, but not for cash flows. Also, FD level and time have a significant influence on the value relevance of earnings relative to annual closing <b>share</b> <b>price,</b> while they are not relative to <b>share</b> <b>price</b> after a three-month period following the financial year-end. FD time has a significant influence on the value relevance of earnings relative to the average annual <b>share</b> <b>price.</b> Annual closing <b>share</b> <b>price</b> is the most reliable in indicating value relevance of accounting information. Originality/value – The paper confirms {{that there is a}} shift away from earnings towards book value as the basis for firm valuation.
