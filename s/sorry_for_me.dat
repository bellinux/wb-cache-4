[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|Mac {{is portrayed}} as near death at the {{beginning}} of the film, having woken up in a drunken stupor in a boundless, empty flatland with nothing in his possession, a shot that scholar Roy M. Anker said [...] "pointedly reflects the condition of his own soul". The dialogue in other scenes suggests the threat of mortality, including a moment when Mac has trouble singing due to his bad voice and says, [...] "Don't feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> Rosa Lee, I'm not dead yet." [...] In several lasting shots, the vast sky dwarfs Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny, starkly symbolizing their isolation, as well as the fragility of human existence. The fact that Mac sustains his newfound life with Rosa Lee and Sonny after his daughter's death, rather than reverting to his old pattern of alcoholism and abuse, is consistent with a recurring theme in Foote's works of characters overcoming tragedy and finding in it an opportunity for growth and maturation.|$|E
2500|$|Lawyers {{convinced}} LAPD {{to allow}} Simpson to turn himself in at 11a.m. on June 17, 1994, although the double murder charge meant that no bail {{would be set}} and a first-degree murder conviction {{could result in a}} death penalty. More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive. At 2p.m., LAPD issued an all-points bulletin. At 5p.m., Robert Kardashian, a friend of Simpson's and one of his defense lawyers, read a letter by Simpson to the media. In the letter Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, [...] "First everyone understand I {{had nothing to do with}} Nicole's murder ... Don't feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I've had a great life." [...] Some interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother Eunice collapsed after hearing it, and reporters joined the search for Simpson. Simpson's lawyer Robert Shapiro was present at Kardashian's press conference and said that Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation. Over the television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender.|$|E

6000|$|... [Quickly.] I'm {{convinced}} she did. I thought her explanation very natural. I'm <b>sorry</b> it's necessary <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to interfere with}} her plans.|$|R
60|$|For I {{was sure}} they had been burnt, perhaps more than once. How, I never learned, for which I am rather <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> it {{interests}} <b>me</b> to study burnt fingers, {{if they do not}} happen to be my own. Then we changed the subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Hugh, I've {{thought it}} all out. You really don't want me. You only say {{this because you}} are <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> because you dislike to have your {{feelings}} wrung. You needn't be <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I shall be much happier away from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|FALDER. That's what I've found, Mr. Cokeson. Awfully <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> [With quiet bitterness] But it doesn't do to {{associate}} with criminals! ...|$|E
60|$|Morrell and Oppenheimer were <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and rapped me {{sympathy and}} advice. Oppenheimer {{told me he}} had gone through it, and worse, and still lived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] {{said the}} abashed Spike. [...] "Dat's right. It ain't {{up to me}} to come buttin' in. Sorry, boss. Sorry, gents. <b>Sorry</b> loidy. <b>Me</b> <b>for</b> de tall grass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] {{said the}} abashed Spike, {{restored}} {{to a sense}} of his position. [...] "Dat's right. I've got wheels in me coco, that's what I've got, comin' buttin' in here. Sorry, Mr. Chames. <b>Sorry,</b> gents. <b>Me</b> <b>for</b> the tall grass." ...|$|R
60|$|My dear Taylor--Your {{alteration}} {{strikes me}} as being a great Improvement--And now I will attend to the punctuations you speak of--The comma should be at soberly, {{and in the other}} passage, the Comma should follow quiet. I am extremely indebted to you for this alteration, and also for your after admonitions. It is a <b>sorry</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> that any one should have to overcome prejudices in reading my verses--that affects me more than any hypercriticism on any particular passage--In Endymion, I have most likely but moved into the go-cart from the leading-strings--In poetry I have a few axioms, and you will see how far I am from their centre.|$|R
6000|$|... "You--you {{have found}} her so?" [...] he returned. [...] "I--I am glad of that." [...] He was so very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{that he could}} {{scarcely}} speak.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't {{marry you}} simply because you're <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I thought I could, but--it's {{asking too much}} of you. We had better say no more about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied; [...] "it {{was sweet}} of you. You did it impulsively, {{because you were}} <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and I think it was sweet. But impulse is not courage." ...|$|E
5000|$|In April, Cairns placed fifth on vault at the World Cup {{event in}} Maribor, Slovenia, {{with a score}} of 13.775. After the event, she said, [...] "I know internationally most people thought I had retired. <b>Sorry,</b> got <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a little while longer! Even in Great Britain, people thought I had finished. I find it hilarious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'm more {{disturbed}} than Mopsy is," [...] she said. [...] "What I felt {{must be some}} excuse <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> what I said; it was unjustifiable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> that, because I am {{sure you}} could not find an honester lawyer to manage your affairs for you. He does {{everything}} <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{and so he did}} for Sir Florian Eustace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks; {{but why do}} {{you care}} whether a priest of my church loves his calling or not,--you, a Protestant? It is that you are <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as an unhappy man, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't think--strangely enough--that {{he regards}} me as nasty. I {{think that at}} bottom--for that IS," [...] said the Princess, [...] "the strangeness--he's <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Yes, I think that, deep within, he pities me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he is, an' he's {{the only}} one in this whole circus who 'pears to be <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You'd better not let Mr. Lord see you sittin' in that chair or he'll raise a row." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] replied Elizabeth, [...] "I am heartily <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him; but he {{has other}} feelings, which will {{probably}} soon drive away his regard <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You do not blame <b>me,</b> however, <b>for</b> refusing him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I was smarting under a {{sense of}} defeat. Undeserved defeat, but what of that? That didn't soften the smart any. And {{to think of the}} circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any {{political}} firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith! And I could see that those others were <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> me--which made <b>me</b> blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching. Put yourself in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn't you have struck below the belt to get even? Yes, you would; it is simply human nature. Well, that is what I did. I am not trying to justify it; I'm only saying that I was mad, and anybody would have done it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} more than {{endeavour}} on this occasion. I went down to Hendon Hall, and was shown into the drawing-room. I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Hampstead's sake, {{but it was impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You pity me. You think I'll only be cannon-fodder for the Germans. You {{want to be}} nice, kind, {{sweet to}} me--to send me away with better thoughts.... Isn't that what you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|With my valise over my {{shoulder}} I returned to the hall to take leave of my hostess. Now she seemed somewhat contrite. Fate and she had conquered, I was going away, and she was <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|JEAN. Just that ye were a guid frien' to me. He made {{believe he}} was awfu' <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> because ye gied me nae siller; and I said, [...] "Wha tellt him that?" [...] and that he lee'd.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'm more {{disturbed}} than Mopsy is," [...] {{she said}} to Carroll. [...] "What I felt must be some excuse <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You were right, of course. I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> what I said; it was unjustifiable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, as {{the smoke}} curled about them, [...] "knowing you as I know you, and ALL of you, all I {{can say is}} that I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Sonny for what he's missed--awfully <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him, but equally glad <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> And [...] . one other thing: five years hence I've {{something}} to tell you, something rich, something ridiculously rich, and all about me and the foolishness of me over you. Five years. Is it a date?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sally did {{not make}} these rides easy <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> she was sweeter than {{anything}} that has a name. Since {{the evening of the}} dance I had tried to avoid her. Either she was sincerely <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her tantrum or she was bent upon utterly destroying my peace.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't think you're mad,' she said, quietly. 'I {{only think}} you're too quixotic. You're <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{and you are}} letting a kind impulse carry you away, as you did {{last night at the}} casino. It's like you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let us {{forget what}} has happened, Peter. We were {{neither of us}} ourselves. I was tired and frightened and disappointed. You were <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> just at the moment, and your nerves were strained, like mine. It was all nothing. Let us forget it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He went off, dusting ’imself {{down with}} his little pocket-’ankercher, and arter the skipper ’ad told me wot he’d like to do, only he was too <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do it, ’e {{went back to the}} ship to put on a clean collar, and went off for the evening.|$|E
6000|$|Stella took a {{chair by}} her husband's side. [...] "I am truly <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> you, Lewis," [...] she said. [...] "It {{is even a}} sad parting <b>for</b> <b>Me.</b> If you will let me say it, I have a sincere regard for dear Mr. Penrose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know--I know,' said Guy, {{colouring}} deeply, and all irritation {{disappearing from}} voice and manner; 'I {{know there is}} no excuse <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I can only repeat that I am heartily <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> whatever I may have said, either of him or of you.' ...|$|R
50|$|You know I am {{not sure}} I {{am going to be}} around if I get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame so you must read this <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I {{am not sure}}, I guess I am feeling <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> myself at this time but you must {{remember}} everything I want you to do and say.
