50|$|Some digital patient monitors, {{especially}} those used EMS services, often incorporate a defibrillator into the patient monitor itself. These monitor/defibrillators usually have the normal capabilities of an ICU monitor, but have manual (and usually semi-automatic AED)defibrillation capability. This is particular good for EMS services, {{who need a}} compact, easy to use monitor and defibrillator, {{as well as for}} inter- or intrafacility patient transport. Most monitor defibrillators also have transcutaneous pacing capability via large AED like adhesive pads (which often can be used for monitoring, defibrillation and pacing)that are applied to the patient in an anterior-posterior configuration.

5000|$|Pulse oximetry uses two light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under-read SpO2 levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood. SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO2 and pulse rate. In addition, <b>SET</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple {{studies have shown that}} compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions.

40|$|Abstract—For {{anti-fuse}} or flash-memory-based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), single-event transient (SET) -induced faults {{are significantly}} more pronounced than single-event upsets (SEUs). While most existing work studies SEU, this paper proposes a retiming algorithm for mitigating variational SETs (i. e., SETs with different durations and strengths). Considering the reshaping effect of an <b>SET</b> <b>pulse</b> caused by broadening and attenuation during its propagation, SET-aware retiming (SaR) redistributes combinational paths via postlayout retiming and minimizes {{the possibility that}} an <b>SET</b> <b>pulse</b> is latched. The SaR problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and solved efficiently by a progressive ILP approach. In contrast to existing SET-mitigation techniques, the proposed SaR {{does not change the}} FPGA architecture or the layout of an FPGA application. Instead, it reconfigures the connection between a flip-flop and an LUT within a programmable logic block. Experimental results show that SaR increases mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by 78 % for variational SETs with a 10 -min runtime limit while preserving the clock frequency on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in-depth study on FPGA retiming for SET mitigation. Index Terms—Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), retiming, single-event transients.

One prominent advantage of this 2 -PCM synapse obviously arises from its operations in crystalline regime for both LTP and LTD events that consumes less energy than amorphization case. Additionally, as the information stored in the designed device is chiefly in crystalline state, it is therefore less susceptible to the resistance drift effect that often occurs in phase-change materials in amorphous states.|$|E

40|$|Objective Evaluation of the {{accuracy}} of Masimo signal extraction technology (<b>SET)</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry in anaesthetized late gestational pregnant sheep. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seventeen pregnant Merino ewes. Methods Animals included in study were late gestation ewes undergoing general anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery or foetal surgery in a medical research laboratory. Masimo Radical- 7 pulse oximetry (SpO 2) measurements were compared to co-oximetry (SaO 2) measurements from arterial blood gas analyses. The failure rate of the pulse oximeter was calculated. Accuracy was assessed by Bland & Altman's (2007) limits of agreement method. The effect of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), perfusion index (PI) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration on accuracy were assessed by regression analysis. Results Forty arterial blood samples paired with SpO 2 and blood pressure measurements were obtained. SpO 2 ranged from 42 to 99 % and SaO 2 from 43. 7 to 99. 9 %. MAP ranged from 24 to 82 mmHg, PI from 0. 1 to 1. 56 and Hb concentration from 71 to 114 gL- 1. Masimo pulse oximetry measurements tended to underestimate oxyhaemoglobin saturation compared to co-oximetry with a bias (mean difference) of - 2 % and precision (standard deviation of the differences) of 6 %. Accuracy appeared to decrease when SpO 2 was < 75 %, however numbers were too small for statistical comparisons. Hb concentration and PI had no significant effect on accuracy, whereas MAP was negatively correlated with SpO 2 bias. Conclusions and clinical relevance Masimo <b>SET</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry can provide reliable and continuous monitoring of arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation in anaesthetized pregnant sheep during clinically relevant levels of cardiopulmonary dysfunction.

The created 30 nm scale phase change memory cell (aerial array density: similar to 207 Gbit inch(- 2)) showed a threshold switching voltage of 1. 1 V, a value compatible to conventional phase change memory cells. More significantly, the cell could be amorphized by a reset pulse of 1. 8 V height and 100 ns width, where the reset current was 100 mu A. Such a low reset current, presumably caused by nanoscale small cell dimension, is greatly beneficial for low power consumption device operation.

30|$|The {{stochastic}} switching in {{this research}} was investigated only under unipolar switching mode. Thus, the active core of our prototypes only undergoes a reduction from TiO 2 to TiO 2 -x, after employing a number of pulses that induce a cumulative thermally driven mechanism [12, 13]. In contrast to the bipolar switching model where resistive switching is attained via displacement of ionic species (a well-controlled stable process), unipolar switching is mainly ascribed to a thermally driven reduction of TiO 2, which may cause inconsistent switching [14]. As a result, the activation energy supplied by a single <b>set</b> <b>pulse</b> {{is not sufficient to}} generate formation and rupture of continuous filaments. Resistive switching events are thus not available at each programming pulse, as demonstrated in Figure  1 c,d. The aim of pulse-induced measurement in this manuscript is to supply well-controlled identical activation energies to the thermally driven filamentary formation and rupture procedure [14], which makes it possible to only investigate the influence of initial filament distribution on stochastic switching.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 b, when a {{continuous}} sweep positive pulse voltage from 0 to 1.4  V {{is applied to}} the device, the conductivity decreases continuously with six easily recognized states; when a continuous sweep negative pulse voltage from 0 to − 0.6  V {{is applied to the}} device, the conductivity increase continuously with difficultly distinguishable ones. In order to clearly illustrate this change trend, the curves of current and voltage versus time are plotted in Fig.  2 c. Figure  2 d shows the device conductivity can also be increased or decreased by consecutive potentiating or depressing pulses. It is easily observed that the conductance in the last <b>set</b> <b>pulse</b> is different from the one in the first reset pulse. This can be ascribed to the partial change in internal structure after the device has experienced a process from very low conductivity to high conductivity. As known, the migration of oxygen vacancies in oxide-based memristor leads to the conductivity change during the device operation, even if the reverse bias voltage cannot be completely restored the memristor to the initial state. This is also a common phenomenon in other memristor devices [12].|$|E
