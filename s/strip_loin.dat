40|$|To {{determine}} sensory {{preference and}} value of fresh beef steak differing in aging technique, strip steaks were evaluated by consumers in Denver (n = 132 consumers) and Chicago (n = 141 consumers). Wet-aged Choice <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were matched with dry-aged Choice <b>strip</b> <b>loins,</b> whereas wet-aged Prime <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were matched with dry-aged Prime <b>strip</b> <b>loins.</b> Dry-aged <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were commercially aged in air in a controlled environment for 30 d and vacuum-aged for 7 d during shipping and storage. Wet-aged <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were vacuum-packaged and aged for 37 d in a 1 °C cooler. Pairs of <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were matched to similar Warner- Bratzler shear force values and marbling scores. Twelve sensory evaluation panels (of 12 scheduled panelists each) were conducted over a 3 -d period in each city. Individual samples {{from a pair of}} steaks were evaluated by the panelists for sensory traits. Bids were placed on the samples after sensory traits were obtained utilizing a variation of the Vickery auction with silent, sealed bids. No significant differences for sensory traits of flavor, juiciness, tenderness, or overall acceptability were detected between wet-aged Choice samples and dry-aged Choice samples. Although wet-aged Choice samples were numerically superior for all sensory traits, consumers placed similar bid values (P = 0. 12) on wet- and dry-aged Choice samples (3. 82 per 0. 45 kg and 3. 57 per 0. 45 kg, respectively). Wet-aged Prime samples were rated more desirable (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) for flavor, tenderness, and overall acceptability than dry-aged Prime samples.

40|$|Specific {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} that third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3 GCr) Escherichia coli, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole- resistant (COTr) E. coli, 3 GCr Salmonella enterica, and nalidixic acid-resistant (NALr) S. enterica may be present in cattle production environments, persist through beef processing, and contaminate final products. The prevalences and concentrations of these organisms were determined in feces and hides (at feedlot and processing plant), pre-evisceration carcasses, and final carcasses from three lots of fed cattle (n= 184). The prevalences and concentrations were further determined for <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> from 103 of the carcasses. 3 GCr Salmonella was detected on 7. 6 % of hides during processing and was not detected on the final carcasses or <b>strip</b> <b>loins.</b> NALr S. enterica was detected on only one hide. 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli were detected on 100. 0 % of hides during processing. Concentrations of 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli on hides were correlated with pre-evisceration carcass contamination. 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli were each detected on only 0. 5 % of final carcasses and were not detected on <b>strip</b> <b>loins.</b> Five hundred and 42 isolates were screened for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) virulence-associated markers. Only two COTr E. coli isolates from hides were ExPEC, indicating that fed cattle products are not {{a significant source of}} ExPEC causing human urinary tract infections.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{methods for}} controlling Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella non-pathogenic bacterial surrogates during {{the production of}} marinated non-intact beef products. Hot (~ 30 degrees C) boneless, beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> (n = 54, Institutional Meat Purchase Specification 180) were inoculated with one of two levels (approximately 5. 8 and 1. 9 log 10 CFU/cm 2, hereafter referred to as high- and low-inoculated, respectively) of non-pathogenic, rifampicin-resistant E. coli organisms used to simulate harvest floor contamination. The inoculated beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were chilled at 2 degrees C for 24 h, and then vacuum packaged and aged for 7 to 24 days at 2 degrees C. The beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were subjected to one of five treatments or control (no treatment). Spray treatments were: 2. 5 % L-lactic acid, 5. 0 % L-lactic acid, 1, 050 ppm acidified sodium chlorite, 205 ppm peroxyacetic acid, and tap water. Lactic acid treatments were applied at ~ 53 degrees C, whereas the other sprays were applied at room temperature (~ 25 degrees C). Treated and control pieces were tumble marinated using a commercial marinade. Sample counts were collected throughout the experiment to track reductions in inoculated microorganisms as impacted by antimicrobial treatment and processing. For the high-inoculated <b>strip</b> <b>loins,</b> the 5. 0 % L-lactic acid treatment was most effective (P < 0. 05) across treatments and control at reducing surrogate organisms on meat surfaces before marination, producing a 2. 6 log 10 CFU/cm 2 reduction. The water treatment accounted for the least (P < 0. 05) reductions across treatments and control of surrogate organisms on the meat surface before marination. Peroxyacetic acid produced the greatest reduction of surface surrogate organisms in the finished, marinated product. The water treatment resulted in greater internalization of surrogate microorganisms {{when compared to the}} control. Furthermore, certain less effective antimicrobial sprays such as water may facilitate internalization of surface bacteria, more so than non-treated subprimals. It is important that producers of non-intact beef products focus on using effective antimicrobial sprays that maximize reductions and minimize internalization of surface bacteria into the finished product...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effects of endpoint temperature, cooking method, and marbling on Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF; an objective method for determining tenderness) of three beef muscles. Eighteen subprimals of a muscle containing low content of connective tissue, longissimus lumborum (<b>strip</b> <b>loin),</b> and two muscles containing a high content of connective tissue, biceps femoris (bottom round) and deep pectoralis (brisket), were selected from USDA Select and Choice (Certified Angus Beef) carcasses. After 14 days of aging, subprimals were frozen, fabricated into steaks, and stored frozen until cooking. Steaks were assigned to one of two cooking methods, the Magikitch’n® electric belt grill (a rapid conduction method) or a water bath (a slower, convection method); and one of nine endpoint cooking temperatures, 104, 113, 122, 131, 140, 149, 158, 167, or 176 °F. According to WBSF results, optimum tenderness for the <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> occurred around 131 °F. Higher marbling protected tenderness at higher endpoint temperatures. Tenderness increased in bottom round and brisket muscles as endpoint temperature increased from 104 to 140 °F, then tenderness decreased as endpoint temperature rose from 149 to 176 °F. Endpoint temperature was the only significant factor affecting bottom round tenderness. Steaks cooked in the water bath had higher WBSF and, therefore, were less tender than those cooked on the belt grill. This was true for both the <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> and brisket. The effect of increasing endpoint temperature on WBSF of the <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> was different than for the bottom round and brisket...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of the meat yield {{breeding}} values of sires on highly valued parts of carcasses in their progeny. The study was carried out on Czech Fleckviehs, a breed dual purpose milk-beef production. Cutting parts evaluated were: round, <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> and tender loin (first-class meat); rib, shoulder blade (boneless), fore shank, flank, chuck roll + neck (second-class meat) and separable fat. The correlation analysis showed significant negative relationships only for the relative breeding values of trading classes and the rib (r=− 0. 2079); relative breeding values of net daily gain with <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> (r=− 0. 2433). Although <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> is an important first-class meat cut, the correlation is rather low. Correlations between other meat cuts with breeding values were non-significant. The correlation between meat cuts and age showed the same pattern as correlations between meat cuts and weight at slaughter. Significant negative correlations were found between first-class meat and increasing age (r=− 0. 1979) and weight (r=− 0. 2884). In contrast, for second-class meat there were positive correlation with increasing age and weight (r= 0. 3489 for age, r= 0. 4495 for weight).
