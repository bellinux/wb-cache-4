[...] Cyrus notably avoids specifically naming her former television series Hannah Montana, instead calling it [...] "my show" [...] when flashback pictures of her earlier career was shown, presumably to distance herself from the franchise.

[...] Craig Jenkins [...] of Prefix Music opined that [...] "Bink’s beat for 'Devil in a New Dress' peters out midway through, and a live band plays a sultry, emotive take on that beat." [...] Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on [...] "Monster", this track more than makes up for it.

500|$|In 2006, Greg Calloway was {{approached}} by producers to produce a soundtrack for the film. He presented the idea to Atlantic Records chairman Craig Kallman, {{and one of the}} company's artists, T.I., got an acting role in the film. However, the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures owned the rights to the film; [...] "It was a Universal film and {{they were not going to}} give the soundtrack to WMG" [...] (Atlantic's parent company). Thus Scott brought back Marc Streitenfeld, who had worked with him in A Good Year. The composer stated that [...] "the overall tone needed to be <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> and darker" [...] given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of blues and soul music to fit the 1970s setting. The musical score for American Gangster was recorded between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself. Additional score material was composed and recorded by Hank Shocklee.|$|E

According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of C major, with Minogue's vocal range spanning from C4 to D5.

BBC Radio 2 noted that {{the composition of the}} song is [...] "deceptively simple, but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music." [...] They described the song's bassline as [...] "pulsing," [...] and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk. The song does not follow the common verse-chorus structure and is instead composed of numerous [...] "misplaced sections." [...] Dennis reasoned that these sections [...] "somehow work together" [...] as she and Davis [...] "didn't try to force any structure after the event. The seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> than any of us."

500|$|A dance {{version of}} the song, mixed with {{fragments}} of the dance track [...] "Feels Like Home" [...] by Meck, was performed in the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour {{as part of the}} rave segment. In the rave segment, Madonna appeared wearing a breastplate and a short wig. She danced energetically around the whole stage as backup singer Nicki Richards provided vocals during the intermediate solo. Screens displayed a message of equality of religions, as symbols and texts from different scriptures flashed by, including messages from the Bible, Qur'an, Torah and Talmud. Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph declared the performance as {{one of the highlights of}} the tour, while Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle compared Madonna rising on a platform with that of a superhero. The performance was included both in the CD and DVD of the live release of the tour, titled Sticky & Sweet Tour, filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina from December 4–7, 2008. In January 2010, Madonna performed an acoustic {{version of the}} song live during the [...] telethon.

Farley wrote, [...] "One gets {{the feeling that}} the band [...] charged ahead on gut instincts; the sheer scope of the album (28 songs) didn't allow for second-guessing or contrivance." [...] Time selected Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as the best album of the year in its year-end [...] "Best of 1995" [...] list. Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A rating; reviewer David Browne praised the group's ambition and wrote, [...] "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is more than just the work of a tortured, finicky pop obsessive. Corgan presents himself as one of the last true believers: someone for whom spewing out this much music results in some sort of high art for the ages. He doesn't seem concerned with persistent alterna-rock questions of 'selling out', and good for him: He's aiming for <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> and all-conquering." [...] IGN gave the album a score of 9.5 out of 10 and said, [...] "As the band's magnum opus it single-handedly changed the face of Alternative Rock. That said, it's not just music, but a work of art." [...] The Music Box gave it all five stars and said, [...] "Indeed, for all its melodramatic self-indulgence, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness {{is one of the best}} double albums of new material to be released by anyone in a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E

[...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} and writers initially formed a general {{plan for the}} show {{through the end of}} a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet likened {{the end of the third}} season to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of <b>something</b> <b>bigger</b> and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] She elaborated that [...] "the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show" [...] moving forward. The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to [...] "skew a little darker because of" [...] this change, with Loeb adding that [...] "It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [...] I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making Deadpool anytime soon on [...]" [...] Marvel [...] "had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak" [...] in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of Ghost Rider in the season over one of Marvel's Netflix series, because Marvel felt [...] "that this character was right to tell [...] stories right now" [...] and having him on S.H.I.E.L.D. aided that because [...] "it was so unexpected". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.|$|E
