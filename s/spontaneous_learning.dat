40|$|There is {{evidence}} that <b>spontaneous</b> <b>learning</b> leads to relational understanding and high positive affect. To study spontaneous abstracting, a model was constructed by combining the RBC model of abstraction with Krutetskii’s mental activities. Using video-stimulated interviews, the model was then used to analyse the behaviour of two Year 8 students who had demonstrated spontaneous abstracting. The analysis highlighted the crucial role of synthetic and evaluative analysis, two processes that seem unlikely to occur under guided construction. I became interested in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>learning</b> as a secondary mathematics teacher. I wondered why students sometimes became so engaged in tasks that they lost all sense of time, self, and the world around them, were completely focused on the task at hand, reported developing a deep understanding of the mathematics they explored, and displayed indicators of pleasure during the process. I wanted to increase the likelihood, and number, of students experiencing this phenomenon. To do this, I needed to explore the learning process in more detail, in particular looking for examples of abstraction (Dreyfus, Hershkowitz, & Schwarz, 2001). Spontaneous abstracting may be more easily identified than abstraction resulting from guided construction due to body language indicators of the high positive affect I have just described. For this reason, study of spontaneous abstracting could provide a useful way {{to learn more about}} other forms of abstraction. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>Learning</b> The term spontaneous has previously been used to denote student learning that is not caused by the teacher: We do not use spontaneous in the context of learning to indicate the absence of elements with which the student interacts. Rather we use the term to refer to the non-causality of teaching actions, to the self regulation of the students when interacting [...] . we regard learning as a spontaneous process in the student’s frame of reference. (Steffe & Thompson, 2000, p. 291) Steffe and Thompson’s expression “in the student’s frame of reference ” is crucial to understanding the nature of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>learning,</b> as I will show below.

40|$|Biofeedback {{is known}} to improve {{postural}} control and reduce postural sway. However, the effects that different biofeedback modes (coding for more or less complex movement information) may have on postural control improvement are still poorly investigated. In addition, most studies do {{not take into account}} the effects of <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>learning</b> from repetition of a task when investigating biofeedback-induced improvement in postural control. In this study, we compared the effects of four different modes of audio-biofeedback (ABF), including direction and/or magnitude of sway information or just a non-specific-direction alarm, on the postural sway of 13 young healthy adults standing on a continuously rotating surface. Compared to the non-specific-direction alarm, ABF of continuous postural sway direction and/or amplitude resulted in larger postural sway reduction in the beginning of the experiment. However, over time, <b>spontaneous</b> postural motor <b>learning</b> flattened the effects of the different modes of ABF so that the alarm was as effective as more complex information about body sway. Nevertheless, motor learning did not make ABF useless, since all modes of ABF further reduced postural sway, even after subjects learned the task. All modes of ABF resulted in improved multi-segmental control of posture and stabilized the trunk-in-space. <b>Spontaneous</b> motor <b>learning</b> also improved multi-segmental control of posture but not trunk-in-space stabilization as much as ABF. In conclusion, although practice standing on a perturbing surface improved postural stability, the more body sway information provided to subjects using ABF, the greater the additional improvement in postural stability...|$|R

KM {{is inherent in the}} face-to-face conversational interactions embedded in planned formal training, planned informal sharing, and <b>spontaneous</b> informal <b>learning.</b> When face-to-face interaction is not possible, KM is accomplished through textualization. It helps the members of the workplace acquire new work-related knowledge and integrate it to their common, contextualized knowledge base. The contents of the knowledge base are manifested in the members’ professional practices and explicated by their professional/communal discourse. By virtue of their distinctive practices and discourse, the members form a community of practice (CoP) and gain their professional/communal identity.

We collected data on the differences in learning effects and student appreciation.

Drawing on Activity Theory (Leont'ev 1978; Engestrom 1999; 2001) and the concept of Affinity Space (Gee 2004; 2007; 2008), the analysis shows how the Internet plays a significant role in creating opportunities for L 2 literacy activities, providing a number of online resources and support. In addition, {{it was found that the}} features of those online communities in which community members self-manage participation also expand the potential of L 2 literacy activities regardless of the learners' Japanese language skills.

40|$|The chapter {{describes}} the historical transformation of poor and/or segregated {{districts in the}} timeframe ranging from the “extensive” accumulation regime of the XIX century to the “fragmented” regime {{that emerged from the}} crisis of the 1970 s.

This model fosters informal fields of interaction that allow the most disadvantaged subjects to develop survival strategies and to cooperate also in absence of those shared cultural models that the politics of recognition find so relevant. Without resorting to the abusing metaphor of the porous city, we can say that in Naples there is a long tradition of practice of “togetherness” among strangers, places where people can meet out of scheduled arrangements. These forms of encounters are based on friendships and kinship networks but also on the simple sharing of daily life and work spaces.

40|$|OBJETIVE: Greater {{information}} regarding motivations and treatment barriers faced by substance-dependent individuals has clinical {{and public health}} implications. This study aimed to formulate hypotheses regarding psychological, social and family variables that can be constructed as motivations or subjective barriers for the early seeking of formal treatment. METHODS: A qualitative {{study was conducted in}} an intentional sample (selected through saturation and variety of types) of 13 substance-dependent individuals who sought treatment. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted using open questions, and the transcribed data were subjected to qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Four types of spontaneous harm reduction measures were identified, according to the subjective logic of each participant: having some periods at rest (not using and recovering from adverse effects); caretaking by close acquaintances (relatives, partners, drug dealers and alcoholic beverage sellers); selectivity regarding substance source, type and means of administration; establishing "healthy" limits of ingestion. CONCLUSIONS: The measures identified might represent barriers to the early seeking of treatment but might also represent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>learning</b> of abilities beneficial to future treatment. Health care professionals should take into consideration their existence and should address them in clinical settings. Issues representative of the formulated categories should be presented in structured questionnaires used in future quantitative studies of barriers to treatment in this population...|$|E
