5000|$|The [...] "sailor" [...] was a {{standard}} form of fashionable headgear {{for women and}} children in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Children often wore it with sailor suits. For women, the sailor became fashionable from the 1870s onwards, in a rather smaller form than its inspiration. One 1870s variation on the style was the Marin anglais bonnet, which added extra trimmings of flowers and ribbons to the sailor hat form. In most decades since the 1870s the sailor, or variations thereof, has been in fashion, or a <b>staple</b> <b>form</b> of headgear. One popular variation was the [...] "short-back sailor", distinguished by its large broad flat brim, narrowing sharply (sometimes to nothing) in the back, and frequently worn at an upwards tilt.|$|R

The village church, {{dedicated}} to St James the Great, dates to the Saxon period {{but there have been}} Bronze Age finds in the land surrounding the village. Staple {{is one of the few}} places in Kent that does not appear in the 1086 Domesday Book, because it was appendant to Adisham, which lies to its southwest but is separated from it by the hundred and parish of Wingham. Together Adisham and <b>Staple</b> <b>formed</b> the Hundred of Downhamford. Staple is situated near the end of an arm of the Wantsum Channel, all that survives of which is the Durlock stream (possibly derived from the Celtic *duro- [...] "settlement" [...] and *loccu- [...] "lake, pool", attesting the presence of the former channel). In prehistoric times this channel provided access to the sea; one reason that Staple was chosen as an export location.|$|R

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{prevalent}} type of cancer and second {{leading cause of death}} in women. Among others, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most invasive as it has the highest recurrence and death rates with no targeted therapeutic available thus far. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is one of the important targets as more than fifty percent of the TNBC overexpress it but all the therapies designed against it have failed to show significant results. The juxtamembrane domain of EGFR has been explored comparatively recently and has been used to design a decoy peptide with the anticipation to affect the EGFR downstream functions. Previous research has shown it to cause cell death in cancer cells. This study is aimed towards deciphering the mechanism of action of the <b>stapled</b> <b>form</b> of this decoy peptide-SAH 5. It presents evidence that the peptide leads to an immediate intracellular calcium release from the Inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate on the endoplasmic reticulum, an inhibition of which can rescue SAH 5 induced cell death. The study also demonstrate that the peptide is able to increase the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in mitochondria, part of which is triggered by the peptide-induced calcium release...|$|R

In 1948 Roebuck and his wife Oceola <b>Staples</b> <b>formed</b> The <b>Staple</b> Singers to sing as a gospel group in local churches, with their children. The Staple Singers first recorded in the early 1950s for United and then the larger Vee-Jay Records, with songs including 1955's [...] "This May Be the Last Time" [...] (later covered by The Rolling Stones as [...] "The Last Time") and [...] "Uncloudy Day". In the 1960s the Staple Singers moved to Riverside Records and later Stax Records, and began recording protest, inspirational and contemporary music, reflecting the civil rights and anti-war movements of the time. They gained a large new audience with [...] "Respect Yourself" [...] (which featured Pops, nearly 57 at the time, on lead on the long version {{for more than two}} minutes), the 1972 US # 1 hit [...] "I'll Take You There", [...] "If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)", and other hits.

5000|$|Outward clinch staples {{are blind}} staples, i.e. {{there is no}} anvil, and they are applied with a staple gun. When applied, each <b>staple</b> leg <b>forms</b> a curve bending outwards. This is in part caused by {{the shape of the}} crown, which is like an {{inverted}} [...] "V", and not flat as in ordinary staples. Also, the legs are sharpened with an inside bevel point, causing them to tend to go outwards when forced into the base material. These staples are used for upholstery work, especially in vehicles, where they are used for fastening fabric or leather to a foam base.|$|R

40|$|Student {{portfolios}} {{have been}} widely known and implemented for some time in academic fields such as writing and business. Similarly, portfolios have been a <b>staple</b> <b>form</b> of documentation of performance skills in the fine arts, providing students and teachers with a method for displaying and judging evidence of best practice and samples of {{the full range of}} talent. Another popular application has been to provide a device for demonstrating the value of experiential learning or for assessing credit for prior learning. Some portfolios are shared by students and faculty advisors for the purpose of academic advising and career counseling. Also, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) advocates the portfolio model as an effective tool for showcasing a representative breadth of acquired skills for professional success and career preparation. NCATE uses specified licensure competencies and professional standards as benchmarks against which to measure achievements signified by portfolio artifacts. Despite the history of portfolios in certain disciplines, the portfolio approach to gauging student accomplishments and growth in learning was not adopted extensively in higher education until recently. Instead, emphasis on advanced content knowledge acquisition and traditional forms of assessment and evaluation prevailed. In English and a few other disciplines, portfolios and journals have long been employed in college classes with some regularity. But recently — following the groundswell of interest in teaching, course, and institutional portfolios — learning portfolios began to attract significant attention in college and university settings. Now, the numerous Web sites that exist for online information on portfolios, offering rich and diverse models of how portfolios are used worldwide for multiple purposes, are coming predominantly from colleges and universities around th...|$|R

40|$|Food {{insecurity}} in Vanuatu mainly {{stems from}} the country’s growing dependency on imported food staples and a concurrent shift away from traditional <b>staples</b> and <b>forms</b> of small-holder agriculture. The change in dietary patterns and agricultural production is especially pronounced within the peri-urban areas surrounding the country’s capital, Port Vila, {{and has become a}} major public policy issue for the country. While populations have become more food insecure, the occurrence of land disputes stemming from custom land ownership and expatriate investment have become more frequent. Often, local Ni-Vanuatu cite land disputes as disincentives or barriers to investing in or expanding traditional small-holder agricultural production. After reviewing some of the literature on food security and land tenure in Vanuatu, this paper uses survey data collected from Vanuatu peri-urban and rural areas in June, 2012 to test the relationship between perceived land disputes and food security...|$|R
40|$|Up {{until the}} First World War {{a number of}} <b>staple</b> exports <b>formed</b> the core of Britain’s {{industrial}} economy, employing a large workforce and developing the towns and cities associated with them. While the nineteenth century saw {{the rapid expansion of}} these export industries, the twentieth century was marked by their extensive decline. Jute was one industry that experienced such a contraction. As the export of processed jute declined, both the employers and the government faced the problem of managing this descent. Located almost entirely in and around Dundee, jute provides a valuable case study of a local industry but also an important insight into Britain’s managed economy. By looking at jute as the forerunner of decline this study assesses the successes and failures of these efforts. It also addresses broader arguments about the political economy of twentieth-century Britain...|$|R
