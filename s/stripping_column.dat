The wastewater feed and the stripping liquid (fresh water) feed were passed into the <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> at a temperature of 25 oC and a pressure of 1 atm. From the results obtained from the investigations carried out, it was revealed that pure water was obtained as the bottom product of the <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> used for the purification of the wastewater but the mass fractions of the hydrogen sulphide and the purified water in the top product were found to vary with the changes in the parameters considered.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{regenerate}} clinoptilolite natural zeolite by air stripping followed by removal of ammonium from aqueous solutions. The research was carried out in continuous system. The characteristics of graded clinoptilolite from Semnan (one of the central provinces in Iran) mines were determined and then regeneration tests were done by contacting of 1 N NaCl solution with given weights of ammonium saturated zeolite. Then the brine of column was transferred to the air <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> for regeneration. The pH of brine solution before entrance to a <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> was increased to 11. Air stripped ammonia from the brine was converted to the ammonium ion by using acid scrubber. The outlet effluent from <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> was collected for reuse. The results showed that the cation exchange capacities were 17. 31 to 18. 38 mg NH 4 +/g of zeolite weight. Regeneration efficiency of zeolite by NaCl solution and air stripping was in the range of 92 %- 97 % under various operational conditions. However, the efficiency of acid absorption of released ammonia in stripping process was 55 % with a major rejection of the surplus ammonia to the atmosphere. It could be concluded that the method studied may be considered as an advanced and supplementary process for treating effluents of aqueous solution and fishponds in existing treatment plants...|$|E

From the existing capture technologies, the only proven and mature technology is chemical absorption using aqueous amine solutions.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that {{addition}} of chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) which have been associated with cancer in humans. The DBPs of much concern and which are the focus of this study are the trihalomethanes (THMs). Since their discovery, efforts have been made to prevent THM formation. This study focuses on removal of THMs after their formation rather than at preventing their formation. Because THMs are known to be very volatile, aeration using a low-cost packed air <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> was thought to be an ideal method for removing THMs and {{was at the center of}} this study. ^ One factor that made this study unique was the ability of this air <b>stripping</b> <b>column</b> to reduce THM concentration from a very small initial THM concentration of about 37 ppb. Results showed that, although it is considerably more difficult to remove THMs when initial concentrations are low, this method was effective at removing over 70 % of total THMs. This method was especially effective when air to water ratios were above 50 : 1. ^ Other studies have been conducted using this same principal, but this study was unique because of the low capital and operating costs involved. This alone makes results of this study highly attractive to smaller utilities that are, like larger utilities, regulated by federal law to meet the 80 part per billion (ppb) limit for total THM concentration. Total cost for this removal method was found to be 2. 1 cents per thousand gallons of water treated. ...|$|E
