2500|$|When compared, {{groundwater}} {{heat pumps}} {{are generally more}} efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil. Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized. This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity, and the overall system {{has been designed to}} be just big enough to handle a [...] "typical worst case" [...] cold spell, or is simply undersized for the load. One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop, is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop. There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; one way is to make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot. A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized, by ensuring <b>soil</b> <b>thermal</b> properties and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design.|$|E

The paper sets out the methodology of experimental studies of <b>soils</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the external temperature forcing given by seasonal, interannual, and climatic temperature changes on the surface heat flow of Mars and determine how meaningful measurements of the internal planetary heat flow can be obtained. The influence of seasonal temperature changes is found to be efficiently removed if measurements are extended over the period of at least a full Martian year. Interannual variability due to, e. g., eolian-driven surface albedo changes typically alters the heat flow by less than 15 %, although errors may be larger if the <b>soil's</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity and the albedo variations are both large. Heat flow perturbations caused by long-term climatic changes are found to stay below 15 %. In order to also determine the <b>soil's</b> <b>thermal</b> conductivity with an accuracy of 20 % or better, a direct conductivity measurement is required. We conclude that a measurement of the Martian planetary heat flow is possible with an accuracy of 30 % or better if measurements are extended over the period of at least a full Martian year and thermal conductivity is directly measured. Temperature sensors should have a precision of 0. 1 K, and measurements should be conducted up to a depth of 3 – 5 m...|$|R
