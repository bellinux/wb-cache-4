40|$|In {{preparation}} for the autumn term in 2011, the Swedish elementary school adopted new <b>syllabuses</b> regarding, inter alia, the civic education (Sw. Samhällskunskap). The civic education has traditionally been a disciplinary subject with a main purpose of mediating democratic values {{as well as providing}} general orientation in the society. Generally, the civic education intends to reflect the world in which people live in, being a complex society which to a large extent is regularly affected by global aspects and developments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to review all the elementary school’s <b>syllabuses</b> relating to the civic education with specific focus on the globalisation perspective. By this study, it is my intention to review changes that continuously have been implemented in relation to the <b>syllabuses</b> and subject over the time. The study has been performed by applying a qualitative and quantitative analysis as to the content in the various <b>syllabuses.</b> The outcome of this study indicates that the civic education to a very large extent has been affected by the globalisation process. In previous <b>syllabuses,</b> the global perspective was primarily applied for the purpose of comparing the Swedish system with the global perspective. It is obvious that the global perspective has taken an important role in the most recently adopted <b>syllabuses</b> with a clear focus on how the globalisation affects various working areas and people in general. In comparison with previous <b>syllabuses,</b> the civic education has also grown and currently comprises of a wider range of working areas. The disciplinary purpose of the subject (as referred to above) is, however, still an important element also in relation to the most recently adopted <b>syllabuses</b> for the subject...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{transformation}} of national <b>syllabuses</b> into local ones, as expressed in teachers’ organized conversations. It also investigates what view of knowledge is expressed in local <b>syllabuses</b> and what implications that view has for the educational task entrusted to schools by society. The data collected consist of six focus-group conversations in which teachers discuss national and local <b>syllabuses.</b> The thesis takes its theoretical point of departure in relational curriculum theory, with support from Ricoeur. These perspectives {{form the basis for}} the model that is used to study {{the transformation of}} national <b>syllabuses</b> are transformed into local ones – and what they are transformed in relation to. This transformation process results in four local ‘spaces of possibilities’: The analysis shows that teachers interpret the national <b>syllabuses</b> as documents which open up unlimited freedom in their teaching. The teachers use this freedom to turn from the content of national <b>syllabuses</b> towards other texts. Teachers feel that the only thing limiting them in their teaching is the grading of students, which places many different kinds of demands on them. The view of knowledge that emerges from the spaces of possibilities described is an individualistic one. The teachers fall back on their own experience, rather than reading, interpreting and developing an understanding of what the national <b>syllabuses</b> mean in relation to their experience and knowledge. In terms of content, the education provided is directed inwards towards the teacher’s own individual view of knowledge, rather than outwards towards the task given to schools by society. It is concluded that it is the teachers who, individually and based on their personal points of view, decide what knowledge students need to prepare them for life, rather than the goals set out in national <b>syllabuses.</b> Charlotta Pettersson is also affiliated to / är också knuten till Specialpedagogiska skolmyndigheten</p...|$|R
5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or <b>syllabus</b> above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or <b>syllabus,</b> {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of the observation data was conducted in multiple stages. The first step was an {{analysis of}} the course <b>syllabuses</b> that are connected to the vocational education at the project. This analysis broke down the goals in the course <b>syllabuses</b> into concretely observable goals of practical know-how. This step was central to the upcoming analysis in order to assign the field notes to suitable categories. This allowed me to focus on the observable know-how goals. The second step in the analysis considered the transforming of field notes into understandable meanings by adding complementary words to the sentences. The detected tasks in the field notes were categorised into the most suitable goals in the course <b>syllabuses</b> by placing them in a matrix that enabled me to compare the field notes with goals displayed in course <b>syllabuses.</b> The analysis of course <b>syllabuses</b> detected a total of 108 goals. These were divided into 53 know-how goals and 55 know-what goals. Based on what could be seen through observations, this study focused on the observable practical know-how goals. Thereby, patterns of what the students are doing when they are conducting their PBVE were detected. From this stage the data were transformed into understandable knowledge of the relationship between goals in course <b>syllabuses</b> and potential competence gained from this PBVE.|$|R

Maybe the potential of the project is more suited to providing the building industry with competent workers than to fulfilling goals in course <b>syllabuses.</b> If that is the case, then the course <b>syllabuses</b> do not fit the needs.
