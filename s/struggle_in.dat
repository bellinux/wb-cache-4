5|$|After {{the death}} of Vladimir Lenin in January 1924, {{there was a brief}} power <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union, from which Joseph Stalin rose to take the reins of power. Armenian society and its economy were changed by Stalin and his fellow Moscow policymakers. In 1936, the TSFSR was {{dissolved}} under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead. For the Armenian people, conditions grew worse under Stalin's rule. In a period of twenty-five years, Armenia was industrialized and educated under strictly prescribed conditions, and nationalism was harshly suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} season {{received}} generally mixed reviews, the second season was highly praised, with some reviewers declaring {{it one of the}} best comedies of the television season. Nevertheless, Parks and Recreation continued to <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> the Nielsen ratings and averaged about 4.68 million household viewers per week, lower than Thursday night NBC shows Community, 30 Rock, and The Office. Amy Poehler was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, and both the series and actor Nick Offerman received nominations from the Television Critics Association Awards.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E

Most of the work was about his activities and the strategies he used during the 1904 Sasun uprising.|$|E

5|$|Stalin's early {{policies}} {{pushed for}} rapid industrialisation, nationalisation of private {{industry and the}} collectivisation of private plots created under Lenin's New Economic Policy. As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge, a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution. Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, but were repulsed by the Soviets in December. On Stalin's orders, the USSR launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany. Stalin died in March 1953, his death triggered a power <b>struggle</b> <b>in</b> which Nikita Khrushchev after several years emerged victorious against Georgy Malenkov.|$|E

On 4 May 1940 German troops reached Rjukan, {{a month after the}} invasion of Norway had started. The ferries were camouflaged and by January 1941 lack of coal resulted in the steamships being fired by wood.|$|E
