In a CNN interview about the show, he told Larry King [...] "no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do with Phenomenon. If somebody goes on that show and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust [...] live and on television." ...|$|E
500|$|The album artwork was {{designed}} by John Lorenzi, who contributed to the covers on Megadeth's two previous albums, Endgame and United Abominations (2007). The title was revealed as 13, with Mustaine commenting [...] "I started playing guitar at 13 and this is our 13th record and I was born on the 13th. As soon as I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to call it '13', I started noticing 13 everywhere. They never used to have 13th floors in hotels but now they have them again." [...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13. Drover stated in a subsequent interview that [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] had originally been the working title for the album. The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E

"This {{ended his}} attempt, {{although}} he was 'terribly anxious,' so the psychic <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to try for the completion of this score through another psychic. If I can get that eighth bar taken up and carried on by 'Ernest' through another psychic the case will become complicated.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{after all}} <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to quote {{a few of}} my old {{gleanings}} from gravestones, not because they are good of their kind--my collection will look poor and meagre enough compared with those that others have made--but I have an object in doing it which will appear presently in the comments.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't <b>said</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to marry}} you at all, have I?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> tartly, just to <b>be</b> consistent. For <b>I</b> wasn't feeling tart.|$|R

6000|$|... "Right ho, Jeeves. So {{much for}} that, then. Now here's {{something}} else: You noticed that I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to put this}} project through tomorrow, and no doubt you wondered why I said tomorrow. Why did I, Jeeves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; {{that would}} have been too much on the surface. He knew the effect of that," [...] looking in his sleepy eyes for a twinkle of response. [...] "No; his very reserve <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to take her to ground too transcendent for her to walk on, but if I say one word, I shall never get her there at all. It was a deep refinement, you see, and he really meant it, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> deeper," [...] and she shook her head at him.|$|R

5000|$|When writing Since I Saw You Last, Barlow {{came up with}} a {{song called}} [...] "Face to Face", and knew {{straight}} away that he wanted to try to get his friend Sir Elton John to sing it with him. Barlow says: [...] "I called him and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to email you this song. Literally, within an hour he was back saying let’s book a studio, let’s get in there and do it." [...] They both met up in Abbey Road Studios and recorded the vocals to the song in 10 minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to move anything?" [...] growled Paul Shepley, {{his manner}} showing {{that that was}} just what he had had in mind to do. [...] "Don't you get too fresh around me, or there will be trouble!" ...|$|E
60|$|I protested. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to take a}} {{vacation}} anyway, and business was not pressing just then. I also hinted that, while I had no doubt of her capacity, she might have found the duties of superintendent rather arduous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much, Fred! I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do it, and I'm {{going to}} stick to my word. Besides that, I might as well tell you, Halliday, that I don't believe Harkness is the best fellow for the position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, Missis! dear Missis! don't think me ungrateful,--don't {{think hard}} of me, any way,--I heard all you and master <b>said</b> tonight. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to try to}} save my boy--you will not blame me! God bless and reward you for all your kindness!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't think so. When {{we found}} her address among the truck Strange had left with the foreman, it was the proper {{thing for me to}} tell her he was drowned. This led to another letter or two, and when I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Montreal she asked me to meet her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Didn't {{you hear}} me?' says I; 'I'm {{to be shot}} in two weeks. Did you think I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to a lawn-party? And it wouldn't hurt of Roosevelt could get the Japs to send down the Yellowyamtiskookum or the Ogotosingsing or some other {{first-class}} cruisers to help. It would make me feel safer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Dan laughed. [...] "Why, it wasn't such a very ironclad {{engagement}} as all that, Alice.

Besides, how could I explain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not other people's secrets,' <b>said</b> John. 'Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to fetch}} you some food; {{you are looking}} quite faint, you have had nothing since yesterday's dinner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, it isn't," [...] he said hastily. [...] "It was {{for your}} sake she spoke this time. She only <b>said,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, <b>I</b> ought to {{consider}} myself engaged." [...] There was a silence. [...] "And if I ask you to come down any time, you won't stop away, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to {{tell you}} is the truth. What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> {{to tell you}} I'd as soon say in the {{presence}} of the lady as here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would have}} liked to be, poor dear, but he felt he had to be {{cautious}} and prepare the way before telling me. If it hadn't been for Bailey, he might be doing it still.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I met him," [...] said Marner; [...] "but I couldn't stop to {{tell him}} anything, only I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> for the doctor, {{and he said the}} doctor was at the Squire's.

6000|$|... "Don't go, George," [...] says Berry, {{squeezing}} {{me by the}} hand. So I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to sleep}} at Versailles that night; but if she would give a convoy to Jack Butts, it would be conferring a great obligation on him; with which favour the old lady accordingly complied, saying to him, with great coolness, [...] "Get up and sit with John in the rumble, Mr. What-d'ye-call-'im." [...] The fact is, the good old soul despises an artist {{as much as she}} does a tailor.|$|E
5000|$|... "This is {{not just}} a foreign war. They brought that war to our shores on 9/11. They are at war with us.

500|$|In May 2005, having {{received}} no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website, gaining significant public interest. Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an Internet phenomenon. Henderson published the responses he then received from board members. Three board members, {{all of whom}} opposed the curriculum amendments, responded positively; a fourth board member responded with the comment [...] "It is a serious offense to mock God". Henderson has also published the significant amount of hate mail, including death threats, that he has received. Within one year of sending the open letter, Henderson received thousands of emails on the Flying Spaghetti Monster, eventually totaling over 60,000, of which {{he has said that}} [...] "about 95 percent have been supportive, while the other five percent have <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to hell".
