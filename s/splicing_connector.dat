40|$|Due to {{increases}} in power demand and limited investment in new infrastructure, existing overhead power transmission lines often need to operate at temperatures higher than those used for the original design criteria. This {{has led to the}} accelerated aging and degradation of <b>splice</b> <b>connectors.</b> It is manifested by the formation of hot-spots that have been revealed by infrared imaging during inspection. The implications of connector aging is two-fold: (1) significant {{increases in}} resistivity of the <b>splice</b> <b>connector</b> (i. e., less efficient transmission of electricity) and (2) significant reductions in the connector clamping strength, which could ultimately result in separation of the power transmission line at the joint. Therefore, the <b>splice</b> <b>connector</b> appears to be the weakest link in electric power transmission lines. This report presents a protocol for integrating analytical and experimental approaches to evaluate the integrity of full tension single-stage <b>splice</b> <b>connector</b> assemblies and the associated effective lifetime at high operating temperature...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental tests on <b>splice</b> <b>connectors</b> joining two main steel bars. The objective was to investigate bond strength, slip and failure modes of the connected steel bars confined by the grouted sleeve connectors. A total of 21 grouted <b>splice</b> <b>connectors</b> were tested until failure under increasing axial load. Each sleeve connector consisted of steel pipe, steel spiral with vertical bars and cement grout. The key parameter was the diameter of the spiral reinforcement which confined the splicing of two steel reinforcement bars. The effects of spiral diameter of 35, 45, 55, 65, 75 and 85 mm on the bond strength and slip were critically investigated. The test results indicate that specimens with smaller spiral reinforcement accompanied by four shear keys provide greater bond strength. The improvement in bond strength is due to the confinement provided by the spiral reinforcement which eventually increases the axial tension capacity of the sleeve connector...|$|R

50|$|They fulfill {{numerous}} uses, including {{allowing the}} wires {{to be easily}} terminated to screw terminals, fast-on / quick-disconnect / spade-foot type terminals, wire splices, or various combinations of these. A tube-shaped connector with two crimps for splicing wires in-line is called a butt <b>splice</b> <b>connector.</b> Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire. The crimping is accomplished with special crimping pliers. A key idea behind crimped connectors is that the finished connection is gas-tight.|$|R
50|$|Solid {{aluminum}} conductors {{were originally}} {{made in the}} 1960s from a utility grade aluminum alloy that had undesirable properties for a building wire, and were used with wiring devices intended for copper conductors. These practices were found to cause defective connections and potential fire hazards. In the early-1970s new aluminum wire made from one of several special alloys was introduced, and all devices — breakers, switches, receptacles, <b>splice</b> <b>connectors,</b> wire nuts, etc. — were specially designed for the purpose. These newer aluminum wires and special designs address problems with junctions between dissimilar metals, oxidation on metal surfaces and mechanical effects that occur as different metals expand at different rates with increases in temperature.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to transmission loss, {{including those of}} any <b>splices</b> and <b>connectors,</b> allowance should be made for at least several dB of optical power margin losses, to compensate for component aging and to allow for future splices {{in the event of}} a severed cable.|$|R
40|$|The grouted <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connector</b> system takes {{advantage}} of the bond-slip resistance of the grout and the mechanical gripping of reinforcement bars to provide resistance to tensile force. In this system, grout acts as a load-transferring medium and bonding material between the bars and sleeve. This study adopted the end-to-end rebars connection method to investigate the effect of development length and sleeve diameter on the bonding performance of the sleeve connector. The end-to-end method refers to the condition where reinforcement bars are inserted into the sleeve from both ends and meet at the centre before grout is filled. Eight specimens of grouted <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connector</b> were tested under tensile load to determine their performance. The sleeve connector was designed using 5 mm thick circular hollow section (CHS) steel pipe and consisted of one external and two internal sleeves. The tensile test results show that connectors with a smaller external and internal sleeve diameter appear to provide better bonding performance. Three types of failure were observed in this research, which are bar fracture (outside the sleeve), bar pullout, and internal sleeve pullout. With reference to these failure types, the development length of 200 mm is the optimum value due to its bar fracture type, which indicates that the tensile capacity of the connector is higher than the reinforcement bar. It is found that the performance of the grouted <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connector</b> is influenced by the development length of the reinforcement bar and the diameter of the sleeve. ...|$|R
50|$|An {{optical fiber}} {{connector}} terminates {{the end of an}} optical fiber, and enables quicker connection and disconnection than <b>splicing.</b> The <b>connectors</b> mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass. Better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers. In all, about 100 fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the market.|$|R
50|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance traveled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the very high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a signal across large distances. In optical fibers the main attenuation source is scattering from molecular level irregularities (Rayleigh scattering) due to structural disorder and compositional fluctuations of the glass structure. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of infrared missile domes. Further attenuation is caused by light absorbed by residual materials, such as metals or water ions, within the fiber core and inner cladding. Light leakage due to bending, <b>splices,</b> <b>connectors,</b> or other outside forces are other factors resulting in attenuation.|$|R

The major challenges for future networks with fibre to the premises (FTTP) is; economic viability, resource sustainability, the ability to evolve and adapt to new technologies with out large scale uplifts, particularly of the physical layer infrastructure, and {{also be able to}} accommodate a wide range of operating and business models. This tutorial will examine these issues and possible network architectural solutions that offer potential economic viability, substantial reductions in resource usage, particularly power consumption, and the ability to evolve as new technologies emerge in the future.

It combines passive elements (fibre optic cabling, patch panels, <b>splice</b> boxes, <b>connectors</b> and standard copper 8P8C patch cords) and active mini-switches (called FTTO switches) to provide end devices with Gigabit Ethernet. FTTO involves centralised optical fibre cabling techniques to create a combined backbone/horizontal channel; this channel is provided from the work areas to the centralised cross-connect or interconnect by allowing the use of pull-through cables or splices in the telecommunications room.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} results of {{laboratory}} testing of compression and bolted splices installed on stranded aluminum power conductors. The tests on compression <b>splices</b> involved <b>connectors</b> of 10 different designs using 240 mm 2 stranded aluminum cable. Testing on the bolted splices was performed on connectors of 16 different designs installed on stranded aluminum cable with dimensions of 50 and 240 mm 2. Splice performance was assessed {{on the basis of}} resistance measure-ments during short-circuit tests and thermal cycling as specified by the IEC 61238 - 1 standard, and from inspections of cross-sectioned connections. Differences in splice performance are related to such factors as physical properties of the materials in contact, splice assembly procedures, number of compression indentations or number of bolts, and other rele-vant parameters. The influence of conductor deformation on the ability to disrupt of aluminum oxide films on the conductor surface during connector installation is addressed. The laboratory data indicate that large mechanical deformations in a <b>splice</b> significantly improve <b>connector</b> performance. For com-pression splices, relatively soft (annealed) conductors lead to inferior performance than hard-drawn conductors, unless the soft conductor hardens significantly when it is deformed during installation. The sequence in which the compression indenta-tions are made, may influence connector performance. Key words...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of connections in precast concrete structure elements {{is the main}} factor that {{plays an important role}} in the Industrialised Building System. Various types of connections have been developed by previous researchers to improve the existing connections in the market. This study was conducted to develop a new <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connector,</b> using spiral and elongated bar, which can produce comparable bond strength with the tensile capacity of reinforced bars. In the first phase of the study, 52 specimens were tested under tensile loads until all specimens reached their ultimate failure state. Based on the study conducted, ES- 65 - 4 - 200 specimens with bar embedment length of 200 mm, spiral inner diameter of 65 mm, four elongated bars of Y 10 inside the spiral bar, and use of grout was selected. In phase 2, the selected <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connector</b> was used in the precast concrete wall panel system. Then, the connector was tested under shear loads to study the connection’s performance. In this phase, three monolithic specimens, three specimens with Nisso Master Builders (NMB) connectors, and three specimens with the proposed connector were tested. The performance of connections under tensile and shear loads was evaluated based on the ultimate loading capacity, displacement, strain, stress and failure mode. The results show that the wall specimens using spiral and elongated bar connectors, ES- 65 - 4 - 200 achieve satisfactory structural performance with the ultimate shear capacity 28 % higher than monolithic wall and NMB wall connection. These results indicate that the combination of spiral and elongated bar is able to improve the performance of the splice sleeve connections in precast concrete wall structures...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{investigate}} the use of precast concrete connections is a topic of growing demand. The precast structural members are normally connected via lapping of reinforcement bar. However, {{the large numbers of}} connections that are required in precast concrete system pose problems in term of strength and the failure of the connection. The application of grouted <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connectors</b> in the market is fast gaining popularity. The adoption of existing <b>splice</b> sleeve <b>connectors</b> are not economics as these connectors in the market are proprietary and purchased from foreign country. The stability of precast concrete structure depends on the continuity between the structural member and the connection, thus the connection must exhibit the ability of transferring loads, possess sufficient strength and ductility and easy to handle and simple to erect. In this research, the connections, were the main criteria to be observed based on their performance, shear, bending and the connection failure. This research aims to develop a connection in precast wall by using different number of grouted sleeve connectors, to test the bond strength of a connection with spiral bar connectors in the wall under four point bending test and to determine the types and behavior of failure that may occur in the connection and wall panel. Based on the study conducted, the connectors were inserted in three precast wall with same size each to form one wall panel. These wall panels were tested under four point bending test in order to review the performance of the connection between the walls. In four point bending test, a uniform maximum two point loads were applied {{on the top of the}} wall panel to check the connection failure and shear failure in the wall.

40|$|Abstract: The {{allocation}} of power losses between optical source and detector {{is referred to}} as the power budget. To ensure that the fiber system has sufficient power for correct operation, we need to calculate the span's power budget, which is the maximum amount of power it can transmit. Transmission distance depends on transmitter output power, receiver’s sensitivity, fiber quality, <b>splice</b> loss, <b>connector</b> loss, safety margin and signal losses caused by other factors. The reliability or performance of a fiber optic communication system can be enhanced through careful selection and matching of all the subparts (transmitter, fiber optic, receiver, connectors). The optic fiber should be matched and verified according to its applications. It should be stresses that the optimization of communication system based on fiber optics has quite a number of parameters. The only way to enhance on such system is to use a thorough designing approach and tuning it with the feed-back received from an economical analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{present state}} of {{research}} and development into optical fibre systems for applications in telecommunications is reviewed and some of the principal problems remaining are discussed. Attenuations close to the intrinsic limits of the materials available have been reached in laboratory fibres and losses in optical cables installed under normal working conditions are below 5 dB/km. Bandwidths available range from 20 MHz km, in step-index multimode fibres with light emitting diode sources, to 10 GHz km with single-mode fibres and semiconductor lasers. If a truly monochromatic laser source operating in the region of minimum material dispersion becomes available then individual fibre capacities up to, or beyond, 100 GHz km are feasible. The major problems in cabling have already been largely overcome but further improvements in fibre strength, homogeneity and reproducibility are awaited. The difficulties are technological rather than fundamental and will succumb to good innovative engineering within the next few years. The same may be said of the requirements for such mundane, but vitally important, components as <b>splices,</b> <b>connectors,</b> couplers and even the lowly jack plug. Excellent and encouraging progress is being made with all of these items. Of the major hurdles remaining, that of a suitable optical source {{is by far the most}} difficult. The lifetime and reliability of existing semiconductor lasers are improving only slowly and need to be increased by at least an order of magnitude. It would also be an advantage if their line width, coherence and beam quality could be made to approximate more closely those of an ideal laser. Fortunately light emitting diodes can also be used if adequate lasers do not become available, but at the expense of system bandwidth and repeater spacing. Technological forecasting is fraught with hazards for the unwary but it is reasonable to expect systems to be operating in the telephone network in the 1980 s at capacities from 140 Mbit/s to 500 Mbit/s at repeater spacings of at least 5 km and perhaps as high as 20 km. Serious study of the application of optical fibres to underwater cables will also have begun. If simple fibre cables can be made cheaply enough for use in installations to individual subscribers a wide range of new developments become possible, but these problems are more relevant to the 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|A sleeve {{combined}} with grout is a cylindrical connector used to join two discontinuous steel reinforcement bars without complying {{to the conventional}} lap length.

Included are a review of the choice of conductors and insulations, the wire splicing (i. e., crimping, and soldering), the wire connectors, and the fabrication of the wire harnesses. The problems in fabrication include the wires being the wrong length, the damage due to the sharp edges, the requried use of temproary protective covers and inadequate training. The problems in the wire harness installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent harnesses, connector damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective.
