40|$|Introduction The {{ability to}} move through large joint ranges of motion (ROM) is {{important}} for the successful performance of activities of daily living and athletic tasks, however the factors affecting ROM are not currently known. Two common approaches to studying these factors are to: (1) compare neuromuscular differences between 'flexible' and 'inflexible' subjects, and (2) determine which neuromuscular factors change temporally with ROM. We have compared the results obtained by these two approaches. Methods In study one, 21 healthy men were divided into two groups (flexible, n= 11; inflexible, n= 10) based on their maximum dorsiflexion ROM (median = 46 deg) measured on an isokinetic dynamometer with the knee <b>straight.</b> <b>Muscle</b> and tendon lengths, passive muscle and tendon stiffness, fascicle length, angle, strain (lengthening) and rotation, peak passive torque (i. e. stretch tolerance), gastrocnemius and soleus EMG records, and H wave amplitudes (maximum and at 10...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Esotropia is {{the most}} common manifestation form of strabism {{accompanied}} by refraction deviations and amblyopia. The aim of this prospective study was to present the outcomes of surgical treatment of esotropia in children and adolescents. Methods. Within the period from January 1 st 2006 to February 1 st 2007 at the Clinic for Ophtalmology, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade a total of 25 patients with esotropia (34 eyes) and previously corrected refraction anomaly and treated amblyopia were operated on. The patients were 4 - 19 -year of age. All of the patients were submitted to a complete ophtalmologic and orthoptic examination prior to the surgery, and a month, three months and six months after the surgery. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Out {{of the total number of}} the patients nine were operated on both eyes, while 16 patients on one eye with amblyopia or frequent esodeviation. Nine patients were submitted to retroposition of the inner <b>straight</b> <b>muscle,</b> two to myectomy of the outer <b>straight</b> <b>muscle,</b> while in 14 of the patients a combination of retroposition and myectomy was performed. The patients were divided into three groups according to the preoperative angle at the distance and followed-up accordingly after the surgery. Deviation angle at the distance in the group I was 18 - 25 DP, in the group II 26 - 35 PD, while in the group III it was 36 - 60 PD. Results. The most numerous, group I (12 patients; 48 %), a month following the surgery showed angle reduction by 55. 58 %, after three months 63. 25 %, and after six months 63. 92 %. The group II consisted of 8 patients (32 %) showed angle reduction by 70. 75 % a month following the surgery, by 76 % after three months, and by 79. 12 % after six months. The group III (5 patients; 20 %) showed angle reduction by 72. 20 % a month following the surgery, 79. 20 after three months, and 80. 12 % after six months following the surgery. Conclusion. The best postoperative outcomes after a month, three and six months were obtained in the group of patients with the highest esodeviation angle at the distance solved by the surgery on both eyes. Timely surgical treatment befell into major precondition for developing and maintaining the elements of binocular vision in the operated on patients. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Graves ophthalmopathy is an {{autoimmune}} disease, {{which is}} the consequence of thyroid dysfunction. Ocular manifestations occur in 50 % of patients with Graves disease. The changes occur due to the inflammatory cell infiltration of retrobulbar fat tissue and extraocular muscles. Ultrasonography of eye orbit provides important information {{about the condition of}} retrobulbar adipose tissue and the thickness of extraocular muscles. Objective. The aim of our study was to show the clinical significance of orbital ultrasonography in the diagnostics and follow-up of patients with Graves disease. Methods. The authors examined 154 patients with Graves ophthalmopathy at the Clinic of Ophthalmology of the Clinical Centre in Kragujevac during the period 2008 – 2010. Ophthalmological examination included visual acuity testing (Snellen chart), biomicroscopy and applanation tonometry, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, dry eye testing and exophthalmometry (Hertel). Orbital ultrasonography examination and extraorbital muscle measurement was done by ultrasound B-scan. Results. The disease was more frequent in women (79. 87 %) aged from 36 – 45 years. Most patients had hyperthyreoidism (54. 55 %). In relation to the duration of the disease, the most frequent clinical signs were bilateral ptosis, conjunctival chemosis and periorbital edema. According to our data the highest number of patients had enlarged medial <b>straight</b> <b>muscle.</b> Conclusion. Graves ophthalmopathy is the most frequent sign of thyroid disease. By orbital ultrasonography we detected extended echogram and measured the thickness of the extraocular muscle. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance scan were utilized for cases of insufficiently manifested clinical signs of the disease. The advantages of ultrasonography lie in easy handling, patients’ comfort, short time of examination and possibilities of repetition...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) quantify experimentally in vivo changes in pennation angle, fibre length and muscle thickness in the triceps surae complex in man in response to changes in ankle position and isometric plantarflexion moment and (2) compare changes in the above muscle architectural characteristics occurring in the transition from rest to a given isometric plantarflexion intensity with the estimations of a planimetric muscle model assuming constant thickness and <b>straight</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres. The gastrocnemius medialis (GM), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and soleus (SOL) muscles of six males were scanned with ultrasonography at different sites along and across the muscle belly at rest and during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) trials at ankle angles of − 15 deg (dorsiflexed direction), 0 deg (neutral position), + 15 deg (plantarflexed direction) and + 30 deg. Additional images were taken at 80, 60, 40 and 20 % of MVC at an ankle angle of 0 deg. In all three muscles and all scanned sites, as ankle angle increased from − 15 to + 30 deg, pennation increased (by 6 – 12 deg, 39 – 67 %, P 0. 05) between rest and MVC. At any given ankle angle the model underestimated changes in GL and SOL occurring in the transition from rest to MVC in pennation angle (by 9 – 12 deg, 24 – 38 %, P < 0. 01 in GL and 9 – 14 deg, 25 – 28 %, P < 0. 01 in SOL) and fibre length (by 6 – 15 mm, 22 – 39 %, P < 0. 01 in GL and 6 – 8 mm, 23 – 24 %, P < 0. 01 in SOL). The findings of the study indicate that the mechanical output of muscle as estimated by the model used may be unrealistic due to errors in estimating the changes in muscle architecture during contraction compared with rest...|$|E

40|$|Physically-based facial {{animation}} {{techniques are}} capable of producing realistic facial deformations, but have failed to find meaningful use outside the academic community because they are notoriously difficult to create, reuse, and art-direct, in comparison to other methods of facial animation. This thesis addresses these shortcomings and presents a series of methods for automatically generating a skull, the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS – a layer of fascia investing and interlinking the mimic muscle system), and mimic muscles for any given 3 D face model. This is done toward (the goal of) a production-viable framework or rig-builder for physically-based facial animation. This workflow consists of three major steps. First, a generic skull is fitted to a given head model using thin-plate splines computed from the correspondence between landmarks placed on both models. Second, the SMAS is constructed as a variational implicit or radial basis function surface in the interface between the head model and the generic skull fitted to it. Lastly, muscle fibres are generated as boundary-value <b>straightest</b> geodesics, connecting <b>muscle</b> attachment regions defined {{on the surface of}} the SMAS. Each step of this workflow is developed with speed, realism and reusability in mind. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{report on}} a patient with genetically {{confirmed}} overlapping diagnoses of CMT 1 A and FSHD. This case adds to {{the increasing number of}} unique patients presenting with atypical phenotypes, particularly in FSHD. Even if a mutation in one disease gene has been found, further genetic testing might be warranted in cases with unusual clinical presentation. Case presentation: The reported 53 years old male patient suffered from walking difficulties and foot deformities first noticed at age 20. Later on, he developed scapuloperoneal and truncal muscle weakness, along with atrophy of the intrinsic hand and foot muscles, pes cavus, claw toes and a distal symmetric hypoesthesia. Motor nerve conduction velocities were reduced to 20 m/s in the upper extremities, and not educible in the lower extremities, sensory nerve conduction velocities were not attainable. Electromyography showed both, myopathic and neurogenic changes. A muscle biopsy taken from the tibialis anterior muscle showed a mild myopathy with some neurogenic findings and hypertrophic type 1 fibers. Whole-body muscle MRI revealed severe changes in the lower leg muscles, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were highly replaced by fatty tissue. Additionally, fatty degeneration of shoulder girdle and <b>straight</b> back <b>muscles,</b> and atrophy of dorsal upper leg muscles were seen. Taken together, the presenting features suggested both, a neuropathy and a myopathy. Patient's family history suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance. Molecular testing revealed both, a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1 A (HMSN 1 A, also called Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy 1 A, CMT 1 A) due to a PMP 22 gene duplication and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) due to a partial deletion of the D 4 Z 4 locus (19 kb). Conclusion: Molecular testing in hereditary neuromuscular disorders has led to the identification of an increasing number of atypical phenotypes. Nevertheless, finding the right diagnosis is crucial for the patient in order to obtain adequate medical care and appropriate genetic counseling, especially in the background of arising curative therapies...|$|R
40|$|The body muscle {{cells of}} the {{nematode}} Ascaris lumbricoides are characterized by massive amounts of intermediate filaments (IF). These occur in all three regions of this giant cell type. They traverse the cytoplasm of the balloon-like belly, which houses the nucleus, and occur as bundles in the arm-like extensions to the nerve. The organization of IF in the third region, the contractile fiber, was analyzed further by serial sections and three-dimensional reconstruction. IF bundles traverse the glycogen-rich lumina of the fiber and reach as baskets around the sarcomeres. Together with numerous dense bodies they form the Z-band-like arrangements. IF bundles reach the plasma membrane at hemidesmosome-like specializations often situated at deep membrane invaginations filled with a fibrillar component of the extracellular matrix. The ultrastructural appearance of IF bundles {{is connected to the}} contractional state of the sarcomeres. They appear <b>straight</b> in extended <b>muscle</b> but coil up upon contraction.

40|$|In {{the context}} of back pain, great {{emphasis}} {{has been placed on}} the importance of trunk stability, especially in situations requiring compensation of repetitive, intense loading induced during high-performance activities, e. g., jumping or landing. This study aims to evaluate trunk muscle activity during drop jump in adolescent athletes with back pain (BP) compared to athletes without back pain (NBP). Eleven adolescent athletes suffering back pain (BP: m/f: n = 4 / 7; 15. 9 ± 1. 3 y; 176 ± 11 cm; 68 ± 11 kg; 12. 4 ± 10. 5 h/we training) and 11 matched athletes without back pain (NBP: m/f: n = 4 / 7; 15. 5 ± 1. 3 y; 174 ± 7 cm; 67 ± 8 kg; 14. 9 ± 9. 5 h/we training) were evaluated. Subjects conducted 3 drop jumps onto a force plate (ground reaction force). Bilateral 12 -lead SEMG (surface Electromyography) was applied to assess trunk muscle activity. Ground contact time [ms], maximum vertical jump force [N], jump time [ms] and the jump performance index [m/s] were calculated for drop jumps. SEMG amplitudes (RMS: root mean square [%]) for all 12 single muscles were normalized to MIVC (maximum isometric voluntary contraction) and analyzed in 4 time windows (100 ms pre- and 200 ms post-initial ground contact, 100 ms pre- and 200 ms post-landing) as outcome variables. In addition, muscles were grouped and analyzed in ventral and dorsal muscles, as well as straight and transverse trunk muscles. Drop jump ground reaction force variables did not differ between NBP and BP (p > 0. 05). Mm obliquus externus and internus abdominis presented higher SEMG amplitudes (1. 3 – 1. 9 -fold) for BP (p 0. 05). The muscle group analysis over the whole jumping cycle showed statistically significantly higher SEMG amplitudes for BP in the ventral (p = 0. 031) and transverse muscles (p = 0. 020) compared to NBP. Higher activity of transverse, but not <b>straight,</b> trunk <b>muscles</b> might indicate a specific compensation strategy to support trunk stability in athletes with back pain during drop jumps. Therefore, exercises favoring the transverse trunk muscles could be recommended for back pain treatment...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{with this}} Essay {{is to examine}} the two most read {{magazines}} in Sweden covering the areas of exercising, fitness, bodybuilding, diets and “wellness” –Fitness and Body. Fitness’s target group is predominantly woman, while Body is almost exclusively read by men. The analysis is first done quantitatively, by systematically categorising the contents of the magazines. Then a qualitative analysis is made. Using two different theories, Anja Hirdman’s gender concept along with her constructivistic media perspective and the theory of Symbolic Interactionism, i try to answer the following questions; Does the two magazines term of address and language differ from one and other? And if that is the case, in what way? With point of departure from contents and subject areas, how are the two magazines compounded? How can the underlying message in the different articles be interpreted?The analysis shows that both magazines followed their purpose of writing about exercising in general, diet, fitness and bodybuilding. However, the magazine Fitness writes more often then Body about matters not following the given purpose, and the language in Body is more informative and general in comparison with the language used in Fitness. Still, the messages sent out by the different articles are in majority of the respects similar. Both magazines are portraying body ideals who can be understand as extreme.

M. bulbi consists of four rectus, two oblique and two nictitating membrane muscles. These have been described in several avian species, including the ostrich. The ostrich and emu are commercially important and a description of M. bulbi would aid in diagnostics and surgery. Three sub-adult ostrich and three sub-adult emu heads were collected after slaughter in a commercial abattoir and immersion fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin. Enucleation involved removing extra-ocular tissues and incising the origins of M. bulbi in half the specimens and the insertions in the remainder. M. bulbi was described and compared. In both species M. bulbi was composed of eight thin, sheetlike muscles; with the two nictitating membrane muscles being more robust. M. rectus dorsalis / ventralis / lateralis / medialis originated peripherally to the For. optici. M. obliquus dorsalis / ventralis originated dorsally and rostrally to those above. The <b>straight</b> and oblique <b>muscles</b> inserted near the equator. Minor differences in the attachments of these muscles were noted between the species. M. quadratus / pyramidalis membranae nictitantis originated dorsally and ventro-medially on the equator, respectively.

60|$|The {{shape of}} the body varies, owing to the greater or less {{development}} of {{the lower part of}} the prosoma, the greater or less distance of the first from the second pair of cirri, and of the mouth from the adductor scutorum muscle, (Pl. IX, fig. 4, and Pl. IV, 8 a´). In all the genera, the body is much flattened. I may here mention a few particulars about the muscular system. One of the largest muscular masses is formed by the adductor scutorum, and by the muscles which surround in a double layer (the fasciæ being oblique to each other) the whole of the upper part of the prosoma. From under the adductor, a pair of delicate muscles runs to the basal edge of the labrum, so as to retract the whole mouth, and two other pair to the integument between the mouth and the adductor, so as to fold it: again, there are other delicate muscles in some (for instance in Lepas Hillii) if not in all the Lepadidæ, crossing each other in the most singular loops, and serving apparently to fold the membrane between the occludent edges of the scuta. Within the prosoma there is a strong adductor <b>muscle,</b> running <b>straight</b> from side to side, for the purpose, as it appears, of flattening the body. The thorax, on the dorsal and ventral surfaces, is well furnished with <b>straight</b> and oblique <b>muscles</b> (without striæ), which straighten and curl up this part of the body. The muscles running into the pedicels of the cirri, cross each other on the ventral surface of the thorax; the muscles within the rami are attached to the upper segments of the pedicels. Finally, I may remark that the whole of the body and the cirri are capable of many diversified movements.|$|R
