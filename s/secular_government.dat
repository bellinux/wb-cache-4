25|$|After the {{independence}} of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Morazán {{and the establishment of}} a <b>secular</b> <b>government.</b> The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms.|$|E
25|$|Since Uzbekistan's {{independence}} in 1991, Namangan {{has gained a}} reputation for Islamic revivalism, with many mosques and schools funded by organizations from Middle Eastern countries, including the extremist Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia that produced jihadist terrorists like Juma Namangani who fought and died {{in support of the}} Afghan Taliban and the Al Qaeda.

25|$|Historically the Bishop of Lichfield had {{authority}} over the city.

The same charter made Lichfield a county separate {{from the rest of}} Staffordshire. It remained so until 1888.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the {{development}} of most schools, All Hallows' School, as the first Catholic secondary school in Queensland, sought to serve those less fortunate in colonial society while operating under the same legislative framework as the more affluent grammar schools. Serving poorer, often Irish, Roman Catholic, immigrant women in the area of Fortitude Valley, the School did not raise the required subscription for government aid and, in a time of bitter sectarianism within Queensland, the school maintained fierce independence in curriculum from what was seen by many within the Catholic community as attempts by a hostile <b>secular</b> <b>government</b> at interference.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th- and 18th-century Russian Empire, {{believing in}} God's {{presence}} in every human being, these people concluded that clergy and formal rituals were unnecessary. They rejected the <b>secular</b> <b>government,</b> the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, and all church ritual, holding that the Bible was the supreme source of divine revelation. They {{believed in the}} divinity of Jesus. Their practices and emphasis on individual interpretation as well as opposition {{to the government and}} church, provoked antagonism from the government and the established Russian Orthodox church. In 1734 the government issued an edict against ikonobortsy condemning them as iconoclasts.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, the US-led Occupation Authorities (known as GHQ) {{issued the}} Shinto Directive, which ordered the {{separation}} of church and state and forced Yasukuni Shrine to become either a <b>secular</b> <b>government</b> institution or a religious institution independent from the Japanese government. Yasukuni Shrine has been privately funded and operated since 1946, when it was elected to become an individual religious corporation independent of the Association of Shinto Shrines. The GHQ planned to burn down the Yasukuni Shrine and build a dog race course in its place. However, Father Bruno Bitter of the Roman Curia and Father Patrick Byrne of Maryknoll insisted to GHQ that honoring their war dead is the right and duty of citizens everywhere, and GHQ decided not to destroy the Yasukuni shrine. Moreover, the Roman Curia reaffirmed the Instruction Pluries Instanterque in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} all the social {{institutions}} of Turkish society reorganized, but {{the social and political}} values of the state were replaced as well. This new, secular state ideology was to become known as Kemalism, and it is the basis of the democratic Turkish republic. Since the establishment of the republic the Turkish military has perceived itself as the guardian of Kemalism, and it has intervened in Turkish politics to that end on several occasions, including the overthrow of civilian governments by coup d'état. While this may seem contrary to democratic ideals, it was argued by military authorities and secularists as necessary in the light of Turkish history, ongoing efforts to maintain <b>secular</b> <b>government,</b> {{and the fact that the}} reforms were implemented at a time when the military occupied 16.9% of the professional job positions (the corresponding figure today is only 3%).|$|E
50|$|Historically, Protestants {{objected to}} the papacy's claim of {{temporal}} power over all <b>secular</b> <b>governments,</b> including territorial claims in Italy, the papacy's complex relationship with secular states such as the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and the autocratic character of the papal office. In Western Christianity these objections both contributed to and are products of the Protestant Reformation.|$|R
50|$|Increasingly, the <b>secular</b> <b>governments</b> (sometimes in {{cooperation}} or {{conflict with the}} churches they controlled) provided material relief {{for the poor and}} needy, and in return the state demanded obedience and increased taxes from its subjects.

25|$|Although little {{actually}} {{changed from}} the position that Henry took early in the dispute– he {{was still able to}} appoint his own choices as bishops, as well as enjoying many of the rights King Henry I had enjoyed in the Church– the controversy was {{one of a number of}} similar disputes between the papacy and <b>secular</b> <b>governments</b> in the 12th century.|$|R
25|$|However, it was {{not until}} the 1960s that the Syrian Brotherhood came to play a major role in politics, as part of a broad-based {{resistance}} movement, which developed into armed struggle, against the <b>secular</b> <b>government.</b> After the secular Ba'athist military coup of 8 March 1963, the new administration drastically restricted political freedoms, and concentrated power in the hands of the military and awarded prominent positions to the country's Alawite minority. Sunni Syrian Islamists – from the majority faith – did not have representation in the government. From the start, Islamic political groups, of which the Brotherhood was the most prominent, represented the strongest opposition to the government. The outlawing of Brotherhood in 1964 resulted in its radicalisation. In 1964 and 1965, strikes and mass demonstrations spread throughout Syria's major cities, especially in Hama, and were crushed by the military. In 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, seized power; in 1973 violent demonstrations broke out again in response to a proposed constitution that did not require the president to be a Muslim. Syria's intervention in the Lebanese civil war in 1976 on the side of the Maronites sparked renewed agitation in Syria, and assassinations began to target members of the Syrian government and prominent Alawites; the Muslim Brotherhood later claimed responsibility for most of these.|$|E
25|$|India's {{partition}} and independence on 15 August 1947 {{brought with it}} a scourge of violence that swept the Punjab, Bengal, Bihar, Delhi and {{many other parts of}} India. Millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled the newly created Pakistan for India, and millions of Muslims fled for West Pakistan and East Pakistan, created out of East Bengal. Violence claimed the lives of an estimated one million people. Azad took up responsibility for the safety of Muslims in India, touring affected areas in Bengal, Bihar, Assam and the Punjab, guiding the organisation of refugee camps, supplies and security. Azad gave speeches to large crowds encouraging peace and calm in the border areas and encouraging Muslims across the country to remain in India and not fear for their safety and security. Focusing on bringing the capital of Delhi back to peace, Azad organised security and relief efforts, but was drawn into a dispute with the Deputy prime minister and Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel when he demanded the dismissal of Delhi's police commissioner, who was a Sikh accused by Muslims of overlooking attacks and neglecting their safety. Patel argued that the commissioner was not biased, and if his dismissal was forced it would provoke anger amongst Hindus and Sikhs and divide the city police. In Cabinet meetings and discussions with Gandhi, Patel and Azad clashed over security issues in Delhi and Punjab, as well as the allocation of resources for relief and rehabilitation. Patel opposed Azad and Nehru's proposal to reserve the houses vacated by Muslims who had departed for Pakistan for Muslims in India displaced by the violence. Patel argued that a <b>secular</b> <b>government</b> could not offer preferential treatment for any religious community, while Azad remained anxious to assure the rehabilitation of Muslims in India, secularism, religious freedom and equality for all Indians. He supported provisions for Muslim citizens to make avail of Muslim personal law in courts.|$|E

500|$|Aflaq {{called on}} all Arabs, both Muslim and non-Muslim alike, {{to admire the}} role Islam had played in {{creating}} the Arab character. But his view on Islam was purely spiritual, and Aflaq emphasised that Islam [...] "should not be imposed" [...] on state and society. Time and again Aflaq emphasised that the Ba'ath party was against atheism, but also equally against fundamentalism. For him, any fundamentalism represented a [...] "shallow, false faith." [...] According to Ba'athist ideology, all religions were equal.

500|$|Clarke {{believed}} that <b>secular</b> <b>government</b> should peacefully coexist with religion, {{and he became}} a seminal figure in applying {{the separation of church}} and state.

[...] Its first clear, full, deliberate, organized and permanent establishment in the world can now be distinctly traced to the Colony of Rhode Island, on the island of Aquidneck, in the Narragansett Bay, under the leadership and inspiration of Dr. [...] John Clarke, the true Founder". [...] Historian Louis Asher wrote, [...] "It hardly seems arguable that Dr. Clarke was the first one to bring democracy to the New World by means of Rhode Island." [...] Bicknell also asserted that Clarke was the [...] "recognized founder and father of the Aquidneck Plantations, the author of the Compact of Portsmouth and leading spirit in the organization and administration of the island towns. [...] Historian Edward Peterson wrote that Clarke was a man [...] "whose moral character has never been surpassed, and his piety never been questioned." [...] Asher made this final assessment of Clarke: [...] "As a man, Clarke lived for others. [...] Like many men of the past, he was selfless and uncomplaining. [...] Despite his sectarian religious views, he gave more for his fellow man than he received." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} his time as abbot that Foliot wrote his reply to Brien FitzCount, one of Matilda's {{earliest}} supporters, discussing the Second Council of the Lateran's deliberations on Matilda's cause. FitzCount, in a letter now lost, had presented his reasons for supporting Matilda, and Foliot's reply set forth a defence of Matilda's claim to the throne. Foliot also wrote that Stephen had [...] "dishonoured the episcopate" [...] with his behaviour in 1139, when the king arrested Roger of Salisbury, the Bishop of Salisbury, and Roger's nephew, Alexander, who was Bishop of Lincoln, as well as attempting to arrest another of Roger's nephews, Nigel, Bishop of Ely. After the arrest Stephen forced the bishops to surrender their castles and <b>secular</b> <b>government</b> offices. Most historians see Foliot's letter as firmly supporting Matilda's cause, although one of King Stephen's recent biographers, Donald Matthew, claims that Foliot's support was lukewarm at best, motivated by the location of his abbey in one of Matilda's strongholds. Matthew points out that Gloucester Abbey owed no military service in a feudal levy, which allowed Foliot to avoid choosing sides irrevocably. Matthew {{also points out that}} after 1141 Foliot is a signatory to just one of Matilda's charters. Foliot did though address Robert of Gloucester's defence of Matilda's rights, buttressing it with arguments of his own. Robert had argued that the Bible supported female succession, and quoted from Numbers, chapter 36, which allowed women to inherit, but prohibited them marrying outside their tribe. In his reply Foliot claimed that Robert had actually used Numbers, chapter 27, which had no restrictions on the marriage of heiresses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Secular</b> <b>governments</b> {{can also}} co-exist {{with a state}} {{religion}} or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities.

50|$|During {{the years}} {{leading up to}} 1871, a key {{conflict}} within the Roman Catholic Church concerned the authority of the Pope over <b>secular</b> <b>governments.</b> The doctrine of ultramontanism asserted that the Pope held supreme authority over all matters spiritual and secular, and it was vigorously pursued by key members of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada, most notably Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal from 1840 to 1876.|$|R
