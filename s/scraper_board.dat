40|$|Impingement of {{grinding}} fluid {{deep into}} grinding zone {{is a challenge}} due to presence of air layer around the grinding wheel. This paper presents experimental observation on air boundary layer formed around a rotating grinding wheel, a rexine-cloth covered grinding wheel and a solid disc. The effect of porous and rough grinding wheel surface towards strengthening air boundary layer has been studied. Modeling {{has been done to}} estimate variation of air pressure within this boundary layer. Out of three different methods of extrapolation done, the most suitable one is suggested. Results obtained using three different wheels are compared. A <b>scraper</b> <b>board</b> is also employed to observe reduction of air pressure. Higher value of air pressure is noted in case of bare grinding wheel than that in other conditions. Use of <b>scraper</b> <b>board</b> along with rexine-covered wheel is found to reduce air pressure to a large extent such that it becomes close to air pressure noted around the solid wheel. It shows the beneficial effect of using <b>scraper</b> <b>board</b> and rexine-pasted wheel to suppress air layer effectively. Correspondingly, grinding fluid is expected to reach deep into the grinding zone thereby rendering better control of grinding temperature, and hence, better grinding performance...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Air {{temperature}} and relative humidity (RH) in the manure pits of five central Pennsylvania high-rise poultry houses were measured {{for at least}} one year to evaluate the role of the pit environment in the development of manure breeding flies and litter beetles. Pit air temperatures had weekly means ranging between 18. 1 and 22. 2 C. Seasonal temperature trends were similar at all farms, decreasing in winter and rising in summer. Maximum pit temperatures ranged from 31. 7 to 33. 3 C and minimum temperatures from. 6 to 5. 6 C, but these extremes were rare. Three houses had weekly mean RH ca 65 %, one ca 61 %, and one ca 72 %. No seasonal RH trends were evident. Daily temperature fluctuations were lowest at ca 0600 to 0700 h, peaked ca 1700 h, and varied inversely with RH. Pit air temperatures dropped below house fly reproductive thresholds for several weeks during the winter, but were adequate for their survival all year around. Manure temperatures were affected by the shape of the manure pile, depth of the manure, and seasonal air temperature patterns. Manure temperatures differed significantly between houses with either shallow (without <b>scraper</b> <b>boards,</b> x ca 16 to 19 C) or deep (with <b>scraper</b> <b>boards,</b> x ca 30 to 40 C) manure profiles. Shallow manure profile temperatures severely limit fly larvae and litter beetle development.

25|$|Yup'ik women roles {{included}} child rearing, {{food preparation}} and sewing. Skin sewing is artistic {{arena in which}} Yup'ik women and a few younger men excel. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly made today, but the elegant fancy parkas of traditional times are now rare. The proper sewing of skins requires considerable and varied traditional knowledge and an intact extended family whose members help in hunting gathering, and processing the various components in addition to sewing. Women's tools include ulu, <b>scraper,</b> scraping <b>board,</b> needle, needle case, thimble, and pattern. There are many regional differences {{in the design and}} function of these tools.|$|R
