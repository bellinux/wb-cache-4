5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> might have been ejected from the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> during a dynamical instability in the early <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 Voyager 1 was {{exiting the}} <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> {{at a speed}} of about 3.6 AU per year, while Voyager 2 is going slower, leaving the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> at 3.3 AU per year. Each year Voyager 1 {{increases}} its lead over Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> out of convenience.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> travels alone {{through the}} Milky Way in a {{circular}} orbit approximately 30,000light years from the Galactic Centre. Its speed is about 220km/s. The period required for the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the galactic year, is {{in the range of}} 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> has completed at least 20 such revolutions.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since {{the discovery of the}} Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master thesis is to {{evaluate}} the possibility of use of autonomous <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> in projects of development aid. In {{the first part of}} the thesis there is a literary review which defines the basic context of development aid, the characteristics of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> and the possibility of use for energy security. Another part describes a model project in which the attention is focused on autonomous <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> and defining the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of their use. The next step is a multi-criteria analysis using expert evaluation criteria. It also evaluates the economic effectiveness of alternative variants of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> and risk analysis.

5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> the outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E

5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, {{the two are}} not the same.

5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has the <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} 2016 {{suggested}} that Planet Nine tilted all <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> planets, including Earth's by about 6 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E

5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>system.</b> (Many cosmic rays are {{kept out of the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>system</b> by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.)
