Since most users do not need the nominal bunch train density, a fast <b>switching</b> <b>mirror</b> is a method to supply many experimental groups.

A feasibility study at DESY analyzes possible ways of permanent switching at half of FLASH’s bunch train frequency of 1 to 10 per sec-ond. A first prototype with highest demands on repetition accuracy of the position (below 1 µm) and yawing of the mirror (about 1 arcsec) has been tested.

40|$|The {{scanning}} microwave {{limb sounder}} (SMLS) is the latest instrument to probe the Earth's atmosphere {{to come out of}} the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) team. Once deployed to the upper stratosphere, it will use microwave detection to measure geo-atmospheric variables such as temperature, pressure, and chemical composition. In addition to previous missions that used vertical limb scans to observe altitudinal variations, the SMLS will rotate laterally allowing it to establish two-dimensional variable dependencies with a single run. A program was originated by a previous intern that will automatically control the movement of the two rotational axes along with a <b>switching</b> <b>mirror</b> and chopper once the instrument is in flight. However, it lacked the code essential to control system's ability to function fully and reliably. By modifying and rewriting parts of the code I sought to have a finished ready-for-flight control system that would be easy to navigate. Three of the major alterations I made including instituting a gyroscope, implementing a restart button, and instigating the automatic creation of a file log with each run to record the position and orientation of the SMLS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Active vision {{techniques}} use programmable light sources, such as projectors, whose intensities can {{be controlled}} over space and time. We present a broad framework for fast active vision using Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors. The digital micromirror array (DMD) in a DLP projector is capable of <b>switching</b> <b>mirrors</b> “on ” and “off ” at high speeds (10 6 /s). An off-the-shelf DLP projector, however, effectively operates at much lower rates (30 - 60 Hz) by emitting smaller intensities that are integrated over time by a sensor (eye or camera) to produce the desired brightness value. Our key idea is to exploit this “temporal dithering ” of illumination, as observed by a high-speed camera. The dithering encodes each brightness value uniquely and {{may be used in}} conjunction with virtually any active vision technique. We apply our approach to five well-known problems: (a) structured light-based range finding, (b) photometric stereo, (c) illumination de-multiplexing, (d) high frequency preserving motion-blur and (e) separation of direct and global scene components, achieving significant speedups in performance. In all our methods, the projector receives a single image as input whereas the camera acquires a sequence of frames. ...|$|R
40|$|Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) comb-drive {{actuators}} {{are used}} to drive many micro-optical components such as <b>switching</b> <b>mirror,</b> scanning mirror applications. These actuators are electrostatically operated to obtain a tilting or rotational actuation. They have proven their capabilities for accomplishing extended travel ranges-of-movement reliably within the stable range. These actuators are fabricated by using different state of art fabrication techniques and methods with different materials. The residual stress developed during the deposition process, influences the electromechanical behavior of the fabricated actuator. Performance-driven criteria such as analog/binary mode, unidirectional/bidirectional and expected range of actuation for the comb-drives are realized in fabrication to achieve the expected specific requirements. In this study a study has been made on the critical steps in various microfabrication sequences by adopting a fabrication scheme of the actuator which precludes the generation of residual stress. The residual stress and stiction are the important parameters they are the limiting factors; but they are used in positive way to achieve specific structural behavior of the actuators. The causes and effects of residual stress formation during the microfabrication process are studied from the literatures. This knowledge {{can be used to}} correlate the performance of MEMS actuators with the microfabrication critical parameters...|$|R
40|$|EDO Corporation, Barnes Engineering Division {{designed}} and constructed a high resolution thermal imaging system on contract to Lockheed {{for use in}} the SDI Star Lab. This employs a Pt Si CCD array which is sensitive in the spectral range of 3 to 5 microns. Star Lab will be flown in the Shuttle bay and consists basically of a large, reflecting, tracking telescope with associated sensors and electronics. The thermal imaging system is designed to operate in the focal plane of this telescope. The configuration of the system is illustrated. The telescope provides a collimated beam output which is focussed onto the detector array by a silicon objective lens. The detector array subtends a field of view of 1. 6 degrees x 1. 22 degrees. A beam <b>switching</b> <b>mirror</b> permits bypassing the large telescope to give a field of 4 degrees x 3 degrees. Two 8 position filter wheels are provided, and background radiation is minimized by Narcissus mirrors. The detector is cooled with a Joule-Thompson cryostat fed from a high pressure supply tank. This was selected instead of a more convenient closed-cycle system because of concern with vibration. The latter may couple into the extremely critical Starlab tracking telescope. The electronics produce a digitized video signal for recording. Offset and responsivity correction factors are stored for all pixels and these corrections are made to the digitized output in real time...|$|R
