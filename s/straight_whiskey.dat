25|$|If one {{of these}} whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is {{additionally}} designated as straight, e.g., straight rye whiskey. A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> without naming a grain.|$|E

His segment of the film was shot at his run-down trailer home in Austin, Texas, where Van Zandt is shown drinking <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> {{during the middle of}} the day, shooting and playing with guns, and performing the songs [...] "Waitin' Around to Die" [...] and [...] "Pancho & Lefty." [...] His soon-to-be second wife Cindy and dog Geraldine (a large, [...] "keenly intelligent" [...] half-wolf, half-husky) are also featured in the film.|$|E

60|$|The big Colonel bowed decorously, {{held out}} a great, wide hand, and thereupon {{unscrewed}} the flask. Now Stephen had never learned to like <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey,</b> but he took down his share without a face. The exploit seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with still greater ceremony, and they walked {{off down the street}} together. Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which his new friend gave unqualified praise.|$|E
6000|$|Here was the {{opportunity}} to tell him all, and vindicate the justice of his theories! But he shrank from it again; and now, adding to the confusion, was a singular sense of dread at the mental labor of explanation. He only smiled painfully, and began to move away. [...] "Look you!" [...] said Masters, peremptorily, [...] "ye want about three fingers of <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> to set you right, and you've got to take it with me. D--n it, man, {{it may be the}} last drink we take together! Don't look so skeered! I mean--I made up my mind about ten minutes ago to cut the whole d--d thing, and light out for fresh diggings. I'm sick of getting only grub wages out o' this bill. So that's what I mean by saying it's the last drink you and me'll take together. You know my ways: sayin' and doin' with me's the same thing." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> is a {{distinctly}} different product from blended whiskey. Most premium-category brands of American whiskey are <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey,</b> while the economy category is primarily blended whiskey.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{blended whiskey}} bottled at 40% alcohol by volume (80 U.S. proof), and {{formulated}} from 80% neutral grain spirits and a 20% mixture of <b>straight</b> <b>whiskeys.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{included}} are blended <b>whiskey,</b> blend of <b>straight</b> <b>whiskeys,</b> grain whisky, and spirit whiskey, {{which do not}} specify a dominant grain, {{and in the case}} of blends may include artificial color and flavorings.|$|R
50|$|Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for American whiskey, a blended American whiskey is {{required}} to contain at least 20% <b>straight</b> <b>whiskeys,</b> and Old Thompson is formulated according to this minimum requirement.|$|R
5000|$|Blended whiskey is {{a mixture}} which {{contains}} <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> or a blend of straight whiskeys containing not less than 20 percent <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> (on a proof gallon basis), and, separately or in combination, other whiskey or neutral spirits. For the blended whiskey to be labeled with a particular grain type (i.e., to be labeled as blended rye, malt, wheat, or bourbon whiskey), at least 51% of the blend must be <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> of that grain type. The part of the content that is not <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> may include un-aged grain distillates, grain neutral spirits, flavorings, and colorings.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} component of American blended whiskey. Blended whiskey made in the United States must contain at least 20% <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey.</b> The remaining portion is higher-proof spirit, often unaged neutral grain spirits, which are less expensive to produce. The <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> component adds characteristic whiskey flavor to the blend, as the higher proof spirit loses most flavoring compounds during the distillation process, and does not gain flavors from barrel aging. Blended whiskey may also contain additives for coloring and flavoring.|$|E
5000|$|American [...] "blended whiskey" [...] (alternatively labeled as [...] "whiskey - a blend") {{must contain}} {{a minimum of}} 20% <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey.</b> Blended whiskey that {{contains}} a minimum of 51% <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> of one particular grain type (i.e., rye, malt, wheat or bourbon whiskey) includes the grain type in its label description - e.g., [...] "blended rye whiskey" [...] or [...] "blended bourbon whiskey". Spirits containing less than 20% <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> but greater than 5% whiskey of any kind can be labeled [...] "spirit whiskey".|$|E
25|$|Blended whiskey—a mixture that {{contains}} a blend of <b>straight</b> <b>whiskeys</b> and neutral grain spirits (NGS), and may also contain flavourings and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis.|$|R

50|$|A <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> {{that has}} been aged less than four years is {{required}} to be labeled with an age statement describing the actual minimum age of the product, whereas if <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> is stored as prescribed for four years or more, a statement of age is optional.|$|E
50|$|Beam's Eight Star is an 80-proof (40% alcohol by volume) {{mixture of}} 75% grain neutral spirits and 25% <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey.</b> It is {{inexpensive}} {{due to its}} high proportion of neutral spirits. Neutral grain spirits {{do not have to}} be aged like <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> and can be mass-produced at a much faster rate.|$|E
5000|$|There is no aging {{requirement}} {{under the}} U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for American whiskey for the neutral grain spirits in an American blended whiskey, {{although there is}} a 2-year minimum aging requirement for <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> (and for the <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> used in the mixture from which a blended whiskey is formulated) and there is a requirement for an age statement on the label of a blended whiskey containing neutral spirits in cases where the <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> used in the blend is less than 4 years old. A labeling age statement on American blended whiskey that contains neutral spirits (per Title 27, Part 5, Subpart C, Section 5.40) ordinarily refers only to the age of the 20% content of the product that is the <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> used within the blend, and the neutral grain spirits used in the blend may not have been aged. The company web site for Old Thompson refers to it as [...] "4 Year Old Blended American Whiskey", and the picture of the label itself on the web site does not show an age statement, so Old Thompson is formulated from 20% 4 year old <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> and 80% (un-aged) neutral spirits.|$|E

5000|$|When {{at least}} 51% {{of the content}} of the mash used in the {{distillation}} of a <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> consisted of corn, rye, barley, or wheat, the designation can be coupled with a special name associated with the type of grain and whether the grain was malted. For example, a <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> may be a bourbon whiskey (using a mash of corn), malt whiskey (using a mash of malted barley), rye whiskey, rye malt whiskey, or wheat whiskey. An especially prominent variation is the labeling [...] "Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey", used to indicate a <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> made in Kentucky from a mash of at least 51% corn grain.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{web site}} for Old Thompson {{says that it is}} [...] "Blended from the finest quality bourbons available", so some of the <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> that is used in the blend is Bourbon. The picture of the label on the web site does not contain a {{reference}} to Bourbon. Possibly, not all of the <b>straight</b> <b>whiskey</b> used in the Old Thompson blend is Bourbon.|$|E
