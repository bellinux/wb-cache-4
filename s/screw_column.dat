40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a novel geometric analysis method of the singularity and kinestatic characteristics of robots. For non-redundant robots, there exist two uniquely determined Jacobians – the screw-based Jacobian and the reciprocal Jacobian. Here, it is shown that {{if some of}} the reciprocal products between the <b>column</b> <b>screws</b> of the two Jacobians are close to zero, the robot is in the vicinity of a singular configuration and the corresponding columns of the Jacobian are involved in the singularity. From this observation, an invariant measure of closeness to a singularity is presented using the reciprocal products. Furthermore, by considering the reciprocal products between the actuated joint <b>screws</b> and <b>column</b> <b>screws</b> of the Jacobian, this measure is extended so that the concept of the kinestatic characterization index is presented for parallel robots. Since it is defined as the ratio of reciprocal products from the uniqueness of the two Jacobians, it represents a unique invariant characteristic of robots. From the singularity analyses of the planar 4 -bar linkage and the 3 -DOF parallel manipulator with PRS-serial chains, the validity of the proposed index is examined and the concept of a kinestatically balanced configuration is introduced as well...|$|R

Each section includes a number of rotatably attached screws running along its length. The next inner section includes threaded lugs oriented to threadingly engage the <b>screws.</b> The <b>column</b> is extended or retracted upon rotation of the screws. The screws of each section are selectively rotated by a motor and an engagement mechanism...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The high-energy trauma mainly {{involves}} vertebral lesions and 6 % {{occur in}} the cervical region. This poses a challenge to spine surgeons in surgical decision-making, {{both in terms of}} approach as the instrumentation. International recommendations establish that the procedures performed are reproducible, safe, and effective. The techniques for placement of pedicle screws are complicated and have been based on intraoperative navigation (limited by cost) and fluoroscopy (greater exposure of health care professionals and patients to radiation). Therefore, the freehand technique is an option. The goal was to identify the level of evidence and grade of recommendation in the medical literature regarding the safety and efficacy of pedicle screw instrumentation with freehand technique in subaxial cervical spine. To this end, we carried out a systematic review with the following MeSH terms: safety, efficacy, vertebral artery. Articles were evaluated twice in a standardized and blind way by two observers skilled in systematic analysis, after CLEIS 3401 authorization in November 2014. Due {{to the nature of the}} study and the variables, articles with a high level of evidence and grade of recommendation were not found. Level of Evidence obtained on safety and efficacy in the placement of pedicle <b>screws</b> in subaxial <b>column</b> with freehand technique: 2 b. Degree of Recommendation obtained on safety and efficacy in the placement of pedicle <b>screws</b> in subaxial <b>column</b> with freehand technique: B, favorable recommendation...|$|R

40|$|Time-dependent, {{two-dimensional}} {{profiles of}} the axial flow velocity, density, electron temperature, and magnetic field components are measured at two axial locations in a <b>screw</b> pinch plasma <b>column</b> of the reconnection scaling experiment. The {{results show that the}} ion momentum flux for a given column radius is dissipated by the ion-ion Coulomb scattering viscosity due to a significant radial shear of the axial velocity. By comparing the terms of the magnetohydrodynamic momentum balance equation, radial profile of ion viscosity is determined. Chord-integrated ion temperature measurements performed at several radial locations using Doppler broadening spectroscopy show ion temperature of about 1 eV. Measured ion viscosity agrees within a factor of 2 with the classical Braginskii expectations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical mechanism of fixation systems in the most frequent T-shaped acetabular fracture using finite element method. The treatment of acetabular fractures was based on extensive clinical experience. Three commonly accepted rigid fixation methods (double column reconstruction plates (P × 2), anterior column plate combined with posterior <b>column</b> <b>screws</b> (P + PS), and anterior column plate combined with quadrilateral area screws (P + QS)) were chosen for evaluation. On {{the basis of the}} finite element model, the biomechanics of these fixation systems were assessed through effective stiffness levels, stress distributions, force transfers, and displacements along the fracture lines. All three fixation systems can be used to obtain effective functional outcomes. The third fixation system (P + QS) was the optimal method for T-shaped acetabular fracture. This fixation system may reduce many of the risks and limitations associated with other fixation systems...|$|R
40|$|Lisfranc midfoot dislocations include {{bone and}} {{ligament}} injuries to the tarsometatarsal joint complex. Rarelesion, with an incidence rate of 1 to 55, 000 patients annually, 20 % of injuries remain undiagnosed. Mechanisms ofinjury are direct and indirect, including traffic accidents and sports. Clinical {{signs and symptoms}} are: midfoot pain,inability to bear weight, leg deformity and swelling, and plantar ecchymosis. Pedal artery or deep peroneal nerve maybe compromised and the compartment syndrome may occur. Radiographic incidences reveal changes and dislocationsin tarsometatarsal interlining. Stress radiographs are helpful in unstable lesions. CT is used for diagnosis andpreoperative planning. Lisfranc injury classifications can not determine the treatment or suggest prognosis. Nonsurgicaltreatment for stable injuries (2 mm displacement). Medialand middle columns are fixed with 3. 5 mm <b>screws,</b> and lateral <b>column</b> with Kirschner pins. Postoperative care includesearly mobilization, progressive weight-bearing, and osteosynthesis material removal. Primary tarsometatarsalarthrodesis is an alternative in lesions with severe joint damage. Immediate complications are common, includingneurovascular injury and compartment syndrome, and late complications are posttraumatic midfoot arthrosis,algoneurodistrofic syndrome, chronic foot pain, implant deterioration. Patients require a long rehabilitation period. Theincidence of posttraumatic arthritis is high, due to damaged articular surfaces, comminuted fractures, or due to sidemovements, results of unstable osteosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical properties of common fixation systems for complex acetabular fractures. Methods: A finite element (FE) pelvic model with anterior column and posterior hemi-transverse acetabular fractures was created. Three common fixation systems were used to fix the posterior wall acetabular fractures: 1. Anterior column plate combined with posterior <b>column</b> <b>screws</b> (group I), 2. Anterior column plate combined with quadrilateral area screws (group II) and 3. Double-column plates (group III). And 600  N, representing the body weight, was loaded on the upper surface of the sacrum to simulate the double-limb stance. The amounts of total and relative displacements were compared between the groups. Results: The total amount of displacement was 2. 76  mm in group II, 2. 81  mm in group III, and 2. 83  mm in group I. The amount of relative displacement was 0. 0078  mm in group II, 0. 0093  mm in group III and 0. 014  mm in group I. Conclusion: Our results suggested that all fixation systems enhance biomechanical stability significantly. Anterior column plate combined with quadrilateral area screws has quite comparable results to double column plates, they were superior to anterior column plate combined with posterior screws...|$|R
40|$|Operative {{management}} of displaced acetabular fractures yields better results than nonoperative management. Over the past decade, surgical {{approaches to the}} acetabulum and the surgical tactic for repair of common fracture patterns have been advanced. Excellent outcomes after repair of these injuries can be achieved. In some cases, as in the elderly, or in those cases {{in which there is}} significant destruction of the articular cartilage, primary total hip arthroplasty may provide the best solution. Removal of the femoral head allows for excellent exposure of the acetabulum, making it possible to stabilize most fractures without the need for extensile or intrapelvic approaches. The surgical technique that has been successfully used calls for gaining primary stability of the acetabular columns by open reduction and internal fixation and then using the acetabular component to replace the articular surface. The columns need not be anatomically reduced. Multiholed acetabular shells can be used as internal fixation devices by placing <b>screws</b> into the <b>columns</b> enhancing the stability of the repair. In older individuals with severe osteoporosis, a typical fracture pattern results in intrapelvic dislocation of the femoral head with a blowout fracture of the anterior column and medial wall. Reinforcement rings with cemented acetabular fixation can be used in these cases. The femoral head can be used as bulk bone graft to replace and reinforce the reconstruction. Techniques common to revision of failed acetabular components are helpful in this setting. The results of reconstruction of severe acetabular fractures with total hip replacement have been reported to be similar to those achieved for reconstruction of osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{failure of}} nonsurgical {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} midfoot and hindfoot deformity secondary to diabetic Charcot arthropathy {{may lead to a}} rocker-bottom foot deformity with recurrent or persistent plantar ulceration. We report our experience with realignment and extended fusion with primary use of a medial <b>column</b> <b>screw</b> for this midfoot deformity. METHODS: From July 2001 through July 2005, we performed reconstructive surgery on fifteen adults with diabetes mellitus who had a severe neuropathic midfoot deformity consisting of a collapsed plantar arch with a rocker-bottom foot deformity. Thirteen had a nonhealing midfoot plantar ulcer. All underwent realignment and arthrodesis with a medial column screw; some required additional fixation techniques depending on the extent of the deformity. Outcome measures included ulcer and surgical wound-healing, radiographic results, complications, and the need for amputation. RESULTS: The mean duration of clinical follow-up was forty-two months. Fourteen patients were able to walk, and there were no recurrent plantar ulcers. Thirteen patients were able to wear custom-made extra-depth, wide-toed shoes with molded inserts. One patient without prior ulceration had development of a deep infection that necessitated an amputation. Four feet had a nonunion, one of which was symptomatic requiring a revision to obtain union. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical reconstruction of a collapsed neuropathic foot deformity is technically demanding, but a successful outcome can result in a plantigrade foot that is free of ulceration and abnormal pressure points and a patient who is able to walk. The procedure described has an acceptable degree of complications although it has a high rate of nonunion...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To present two new {{approaches}} to acetabular surgery that were established in Berne, and which aim at enhanced visualization and anatomical reconstruction of acetabular fractures. METHOD: The trochanteric flip osteotomy allows for surgical hip dislocation, and was introduced as a posterior approach for acetabular fracture management involving the posterior column and wall. For acetabular fractures predominantly involving the anterior column and the quadrilateral plate, the Pararectus approach is described. RESULTS: Full exposure of the hip joint, as provided by the trochanteric flip osteotomy, facilitates anatomical reduction of acetabular or femoral head fractures and safe positioning of the anterior <b>column</b> <b>screw</b> in transverse or T-shaped fractures. Additionally, the approach enables osteochondral transplantation as a salvage procedure for severe chondral femoral head damage and osteoplasty of an associated inadequate offset at the femoral head-neck junction. The Pararectus approach allows anatomical restoration with minimal access morbidity, and combines advantages of the ilioinguinal and modified Stoppa approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of the trochanteric flip osteotomy eases visualization of the superior aspect of the acetabulum, and enables the evaluation and treatment of chondral lesions of the femoral head or acetabulum and labral tears. Displaced fractures of the anterior column with a medialized quadrilateral plate can be addressed successfully through the Pararectus approach, in which surgical access is associated with minimal morbidity. However, long-term results following the two presented Bernese approaches are needed to confirm that {{in the treatment of}} complex acetabular fractures the rate of poor results in almost one-third of all cases (as currently yielded using traditional approaches) might be reduced by the utilization of the presented novel approaches...|$|R
