25|$|In January 1962 the {{national}} Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled {{and replaced by}} The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether {{he was in a}} wide shot or a close up. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.|$|E

500|$|Many of the tributes paid to Davies {{after his}} death {{acknowledged}} his commitment to Merthyr and the mining communities of the Welsh valleys, {{for which he was}} an unfailing advocate. The mayor of Merthyr remarked that he was [...] "an individualist who followed the teaching of 'Love thy neighbour as thyself'. He was highly respected by all, even by those who didn't agree with him". His parliamentary colleague and fellow mineworker Jim Griffiths, who had shared with Davies the leadership of the South Wales miners after the 1926 general strike, thought that had Davies cultivated an ability for compromise, he would have achieved ministerial office. But [...] "he always was a lone figure... and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> being in isolation." [...] In April 2013 a heritage plaque in Davies's honour was unveiled at Penydarren Park, Merthyr Tydfil.

In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while".

500|$|Aaron Poppleton of PopMatters {{called the}} game [...] "a {{meditation}} on privacy {{in the modern}} age" [...] and [...] "one of the more thoughtful games {{to come out in}} a long time." [...] He criticized the art direction of the game, saying that the limitation of creating the game in a month led to poor artwork and an unpolished presentation that let down the possibilities of the story. He did note that the story and writing of the game made the downsides of the game [...] "almost entirely a moot point", and that it is a very strong game. Pete Davidson of PC World, in an article about the treatment of sexuality in video games, called out the game {{as an example of a}} game that used sexual themes maturely to explore love and relationships. Emily Short of Gamasutra, in a discussion about the game, said that it was definitely worth playing and full of [...] "charming characters, colorful dialogue, and important questions", but criticized the uneven exploration of issues regarding privacy versus personal boundaries. She said that the game's lack of focus on Rook's issues with personal and professional boundaries was a weakness in the story, given that the distinction between boundaries and privacy was crucial to the plot. Love collated common criticisms and reviews of the game on her blog, summarizing that while it was less praised than Digital: A Love Story, most players <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the way she wrote the relationships and overall story. There was a consensus, however, that her portrayal of Rook was weak and that many players seemed to miss both that he was intended to be [...] "an absolutely awful teacher" [...] and that the potential relationship with Arianna was intended to be creepy and make the player feel bad. She also noted that her use of licensed artwork detracted from the game's potential in comparison to the reaction to the custom works.|$|E

He occasionally attended the local Methodist church, and sometimes ate Sunday dinner with members of the congregation. He was well-liked by the citizens of Greensboro, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> them in return. This was probably because the town respected Mantle's privacy, refusing either to talk about their famous neighbor to outsiders or to direct fans to his home.

[...] But it didn't seem right for us." [...] The song, which has a very big range, was originally written at a higher key of F. To accommodate Medley's baritone voice, this was gradually lowered, eventually down to C, which, together with slowing the song down, changed the [...] "whole vibe of the song" [...] according to Medley.|$|E

2500|$|The initial run {{lasted for}} 14 performances, {{making a profit}} for the OpÃ©ra-Comique. It became a staple part in the {{repertory}} of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took {{over the role of}} MÃ©lisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: [...] "Une autre anglaiseMon Dieu" [...] ("Another Englishwomanmy God"). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:As a teacher he was pedanticthat's the only word.

However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908.

2500|$|Producer Daniel Lanois {{says that}} the most {{progress}} on [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] was made at Melbeach, the Edge's newly purchased home in seaside Monkstown. According to Lanois, the song's performance came from a 20-minute jam that he dedicated an extensive {{amount of time to}} editing into a final arrangement, [...] "for a song that was never a song, that was only ever a jam." [...] He said, [...] "It was one of those songs that was born partially by surgery â the editing of the structure was a really big part of it." [...] Recording engineer Dave Meegan helped develop the song with a mix that he made at Melbeach. Wanting it to sound like Led Zeppelin, Meegan adjusted a monitor mix to make it [...] "really heavy sounding." [...] Lanois was inspired by what he heard, as the song up to that point was being treated softly. He quickly summoned the band, who went with the primary engineer Flood to Windmill Lane Studios. There, in a warehouse next door, the crew used a public address system to play an acoustic recording of Mullen's drums, which was then re-recorded inside the warehouse. Lanois called it a [...] "really elaborate kind of rock and roll chamber". The result, according to Meegan, [...] "made [...] sound like John Bonham", while Lanois said they sounded [...] "tankier". He added, [...] "it introduced a mid-range that the high-hat <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>like.</b> This new sonic emphasis on the high-hat made every hit more relevant... The inherent low-frequency punch of the PA also added a level of excitement to the bass drum. The overall sensation was a chestier one." ...|$|E
