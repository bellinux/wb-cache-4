40|$|Thousands of {{chemicals}} are awaiting categorization for bioaccumulation potential. An in vitro test {{was developed to}} measure the biotransformation rates of bioaccumlative commercial chemicals (benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, 9 -methylanthracene, and PCB- 209) by freshly isolated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) enterocytes. The enterocyte isolation procedure was optimized to yield 4 x 108 + 5 x 106 million cells per fish by systematically investigating pH (7. 3 - 7. 4), filtration <b>steps,</b> <b>aeration</b> (air), and DTT (1. 0 mM) and collagenase (0. 5 mg/ml for 5 min) concentrations. Immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to cytokeratin confirmed epithelial origin. Biotransformation rates of test chemicals were not different from control cells in uninduced and β-naphthoflavone-induced fish. In uninduced fish, CYP 3 A 27 and CYP 1 A 1 activity was 5 - and 40 -fold higher in hepatocytes compared to enterocytes, respectively. CYP 1 A 1 activity was 2 -fold higher versus uninduced enterocytes. The {{findings of this study}} showed that of enterocyte metabolism of CYP 1 A 1 substrates can be ignored when estimating overall bioaccumulation potential whereas CYP 3 A 27 substrates should be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Lom Pangar {{is a new}} dam under {{construction}} in Cameroun. Its aim is mainly flow regulation of the Sanaga River {{in order to improve}} and secure hydropower production of downstream facilities. To reduce impact on water quality and especially on dissolved oxygen for 25 to 100 m 3 /s discharge, an aerating weir is going to be implemented downstream of the dam for at least the 10 first years of the dam exploitation. After site selection, preliminary studies have conducted to chose a rockfill stepped weir for technical reasons including availability of materials on the dam work site and asier decommissioning. According to literature, nappe flow is the flow regime providing most effective aeration for this type of structure and application of formulae to the discharge range and geometry of the project leads to choose 50 cm high steps to create this flow regime. The proposed solution has been tested using a 1 : 1 scale physical model, with the following geometry: 3 m high and 15 ° downstream slope. Dissolved oxygen concentration has been measured in the upstream reservoir, in the downstream collecting channel and on several <b>steps.</b> <b>Aeration</b> efficiency has been measured and the physical model has been able to validate and optimize the weir design in order to reach the water aeration objectives and limit hydraulic impacts. The works are planned beginning 2017 and water aeration will be monitored. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stepped</b> cascade <b>aeration</b> {{system is}} {{commonly}} used to aerate the water and wastewater to increase the dissolved oxygen during pre and post treatment process. In the present research, experiments were conducted to evaluate {{the performance of a}} rectangular Cascade Aeration System with varying flow rates, risers and tread by maintaining constant width of the channel using water collected from reverse osmosis plant. The experiments were carried out with four different risers such as 0. 15 m, 0. 18 m, 0. 225 m and 0. 30 m. Each rise was investigated with five different tread of 0. 60 m, 0. 55 m, 0. 50 m, 0. 45 m and 0. 40 m. Comprehensive experimental investigations were carried out for different hydraulic loading rates of 0. 005 to 0. 035 m 3 /s/m 2. Results obtained from the experiments reveals that increasing dimensionless discharges promotes more aeration, attains a maximum up to dimensionless discharge= 2. 22 and beyond this there was a significant decrease in aeration. In addition, the increased in number of steps significantly enhances air entertainment and surface fall rate in the <b>Stepped</b> Cascade <b>Aeration</b> System. A regression equation was derived by keeping aeration efficiency as response with dimensionless discharge and oxygen saturation concentration as influencing parameters. The dimension less discharge is a function of critical depth of the rectangular channel and step height, whereas oxygen saturation concentration represents the ratio of oxygen deficit and oxygen saturation concentration. Based on the experimental results, the optimum design and/or results such as number of steps (12 numbers) and hydraulic loading rate (0. 025 m 3 /s/m 2) with fixed tread width of 0. 6 m were identified to achieve maximum aeration rate (0. 5 - 0. 60) in Aeration system...|$|R
25|$|For {{conventional}} {{sewage treatment}} plants, around 30 {{percent of the}} annual operating costs is usually required for energy. The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, constructed wetlands have a lower energy requirement than activated sludge plants, as less energy {{is required for the}} <b>aeration</b> <b>step.</b> Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their sewage sludge treatment process with anaerobic digestion can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{a widely}} used flood energy dissipator, the stepped {{spillway}} can significantly dissipate the kinetic or hydraulic energy {{due to the}} air-entrainment in skimming flow over the <b>steps.</b> The free-surface <b>aeration</b> involves the sharp deformation of the free surface and the complex turbulent shear flows. In this study, the volume of fluid (VOF), mixture, and Eulerian methods are utilized to simulate the air-entrainment by coupling with the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large eddy simulation (RANS/LES) turbulence models. The free surface deformation, air volume fraction, pressure, and velocity are compared for the three different numerical methods. Only the Eulerian+RANS method fails to capture the free-surface aeration. The air volume fraction predicted by the VOF+LES method best matches the experimental measurement, while the mixture+LES method predicts the inception point of the air entrainment more accurately...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the fate}} of THMs -formation. in {{seawater}} distillation process and the rates of THMs formation in the chlorinated blended distillate were examined under various experimental conditions. The following general equation was obtained empirically: Log (THM) = _A * Log (Cl 2) + B * Log (TOC) + C (THM) is the concentration of total THMs in µg/l, (Cl 2) and (TOC) are the concentration of chlorine doese and total organic carbon in mg/l, A,B, and C are estimated parameters. The results showed that THMs level increases {{with the increase of}} both chlorine and initial humic substances concentrations. Increase in temperature and contact time also increased THMs concentrations. On the other hand, pre-chlorination and <b>aeration</b> <b>step</b> of the seawater resulted in a reduction of THMs concentrations in the blended distillate...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{activated}} sludge models (ASMs) to full-scale {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) is still hampered by the problem of model calibration of these over-parameterised models. This either requires expert knowledge or global methods that explore a large parameter space. However, a better balance in structure between the submodels (ASM, hydraulic, aeration, etc.) and improved quality of influent data result in much smaller calibration efforts. In this contribution, a methodology is proposed that links data frequency and model structure to calibration quality and output uncertainty. It is composed of defining the model structure, the input data, an automated calibration, confidence interval computation and uncertainty propagation to the model output. Apart from the last step, the methodology is applied to an existing WWTP using three models differing only in the aeration submodel. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all models, allowing the ranking {{of the most important}} parameters to select in the subsequent calibration <b>step.</b> The <b>aeration</b> submodel proved very important to get good NH 4 predictions. Finally, the impact of data frequency was explored. Lowering the frequency resulted in larger deviations of parameter estimates from their default values and larger confidence intervals. Autocorrelation due to high frequency calibration data has an opposite effect on the confidence intervals. The proposed methodology opens doors to facilitate and improve calibration efforts and to design measurement campaigns...|$|R

Protection of the thiolate group with S-thiomethyl increases {{the stability of the}} ligand, desired complex of high radiochemical purity could be prepared under relatively mild labelling condition (at room temperature) omitting the <b>aeration</b> <b>step.</b> The complex prepared from the S-thiomethyl protected MAG 3 ligand were chromatographically (HPLC) and biologically compared with the corresponding complex prepared from the S-benzoylated MAG 3 precursor. This result suggests that technetium- 99 m complex of MAG 3 could be prepared from S-thiomethylated MAG 3 precursor in comparatively higher purity under relatively milder labelling condition and this method of radiolabelling could be used for the development of less cumbrous single vial MAG 3 ki...|$|R
40|$|A {{large part}} of the grain {{produced}} in the South Urals has high humidity and needs to be dried before storage. Drying is an energy-intensive process and is about 70 % of the total energy consumption for post-harvest processing of grain. Modern grain drying equip¬ment, implements high-convection drying, and heat provides cost 5 350 – 5 500 kJ per 1 kg of evaporated moisture, which is well above the theoretical calculations. Combined drying, which involves high-temperature drying <b>step</b> and <b>aeration</b> enables to reduce heat costs up to 30 %. To control the combined drying process it is necessary that final grain moisture relates to such parameters of high-temperature drying and aeration as the initial moisture content, the temperature of grain and the time subsequent aering. The paper describes the said relation as a mathematical model of the second order obtained experi¬mentally for wheat. The model has been derived from the implementation of Box-Benkin plan for three factors – the initial grain moisture, temperature and time of grain heating and aering. The experiment was conducted for a 200 mm thick fixed grain bed. We also have got a model relating energy consumption to the said parameters. The model of the final grain moisture within the variation of factors can be used to create a control algorithm for combined drying. Taking as the set parameters final moisture, initial moisture and grain heating temperature, a microcontroller calculates the time for active aering necessary to obtain final grain moisture and an unloading mechanism provides the necessary time through regulating the discharge rate. The model makes it possible to calculate the energy usage for drying at different values of initial moisture, temperature and time of grain heating and aering...|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} {{aeration system}} {{was used to}} measure the 14 CO 2 generated in the soil samples of the adaptation experiment with fluctuating soil water tension and in the liquid cultures. The soil samples, incubated in 100  ml glass flasks, were connected to a CO 2 -trapping system consisting of two wash bottles, each filled with 10  ml of a 0.1  N NaOH solution for collecting 14 CO 2 [36] (modified). The soil was aerated continuously (1.3  l h− 1) with dried air to enable drying of the soils for the fluctuating soil water tension experiment. The NaOH solution was exchanged three times per week to quantify the trapped 14 CO 2 by taking an aliquot of 2  ml, mixing it with 3  ml Ultima Flo and measuring it in a liquid scintillation counter. The liquid cultures, enriched in Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated on a shaker (75  rpm), were connected to this trapping system and aerated (1.3  l h− 1) three times per week for 1  h. After each <b>aeration</b> <b>step,</b> the NaOH was exchanged and a 2  ml aliquot was measured for radioactivity as described above.|$|R
40|$|Groundwater is {{presently}} {{the major source}} of rural domestic water supplies in Uganda. This water has excessive iron content and people use unprotected surface water instead. It is therefore important to find a user-friendly and sustainable method for removing iron from groundwater boreholes. The water quality in ten different boreholes in Rakai District was monitored focusing on iron. With earlier experiences from Uganda and other developing countries in mind, a prototype for iron removal was constructed and tested at the borehole in the village Ddwaniro. The water in this borehole had a ferrous iron content of about 10 mg/L. WHO recommends an iron content of 0. 3 mg/L. Results showed that a retention time in the filter of about 60 minutes could improve the removal of iron down to levels of about 1 mg/L. Based on the test results from the prototype a durable construction that may solve the problem with high iron content in boreholes was suggested. The suggestion for construction included an <b>aeration</b> <b>step</b> and a gravity flow sand filter. Finally a discussion concerning the institutional arrangements for the implementation of the suggested treatment unit was made. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{treatment}} of municipal wastewater prior to its disposal is important. One method used for treating wastewater {{is that of a}} constructed wetland system (CW). The use of a CW has attracted interest in developing nations due to its operational efficiency and cost effectiveness. This paper examines an existing CW in order to determine its effectiveness in the removal of pollutants from a sewer that feeds into a major river system in Nigeria. The CW, which employs hydrophytes to degrade the wastewater from a facility of nearly 10, 000 people, is comprised of six cement-block tanks. Samples were collected from the entry and exit points of the CW’s cells and analysed for dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature. The pH remained constant (6. 8 - 6. 9) at ambient temperature of 270 C. Conductivity ranged from 700 to 840 ppm. The dissolved oxygen (DO) ranged from 0. 9 mg/l at the entrance to 0. 1 mg/l at the final exit point. Analysis of the data suggests that the CW is not efficient, and <b>steps</b> [...] like <b>aeration</b> and an increase in the resident times of the wastewater in each cell of the CW [...] need to be taken to improve its performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{drinking}} water supply of Halle {{is based on}} the water treatment plant of Halle-Beesen connected with the district water supply system of the Elbaue-Ostharz. The rawwater of Halle-Beesen is bankfiltrate of the rivers Saale and Weisse Elster and recharged treated river water. The water quality decreased extremly during the 60 's and 70 's. Therefore the technology in the waterplant was not sufficient enough to guarantee {{drinking water}} quality. So in the 80 's plans were born for another waterplant at Beesen with an updated technology. They were realized with the financial support of the German ministry for research and technology during 1990 and 1993. The treatment technology includes the pretreatment of river Saale water before groundwater recharge and the treatment of the artifical recharged water and bank filtrate as well. The pretreatment <b>steps</b> are <b>aeration</b> and flocculation. Bank filtrate and artifical recharged water are collectivily pumped through raw water wells in double layer filters. In this filters iron, manganese and ammonia are removed. The first filtration step is followed by ozonation and after that by a two step filtration with preactivate and activated carbon. A decisive treatment step is the ocidation of ammonia. The use of pure oxygen for the aeration makes sure that ammonia and manganese are removed in the double layer filters. Due to the relative high bromide concentration in the raw water the formation of brominated byproducts during ozonation was specially checked. The influence of ozone on the formation of bromate, brominated trihalomethases and THM's in the following chlorination step was analyzed. The ozonation leads to a decrease of the chlorine demand. However after 24 hours the THM-formation is the same with ozonation compared to the water without ozonation. The reason is the higher formation of brominated THM after the chlorination of the ozonated and carbon filtered water. As a result of the investigation and the treatment procedure in the new plant it could be shown, {{that it is possible to}} guarantee drinking water quality. However more work is necessary to protect the water resources. (orig.)

40|$|Managed aquifer {{recharge}} (MAR) {{systems are}} an efficient barrier for many contaminants. The biotransformation of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) strongly {{depends on the}} redox conditions {{as well as on}} the dissolved organic carbon availability. Oxic and oligotrophic conditions are favored for enhanced TOrCs removal which is obtained by combining two filtration systems with an intermediate <b>aeration</b> <b>step.</b> In this study, four parallel laboratory-scale soil column experiments using different intermittent aeration techniques were selected to further optimize TOrCs transformation during MAR: no aeration, aeration with air, pure oxygen and ozone. Rapid oxygen consumption, nitrate reduction and dissolution of manganese confirmed anoxic conditions within the first filtration step, mimicking traditional bank filtration. Aeration with air led to suboxic conditions, whereas oxidation by pure oxygen and ozone led to fully oxic conditions throughout the second system. The sequential system resulted in an equal or better transformation of most TOrCs compared to the single step bank filtration system. Despite the fast oxygen consumption, acesulfame, iopromide, iomeprol and valsartan were degraded within the first infiltration step. The compounds benzotriazole, diclofenac, 4 -Formylaminoantipyrine, gabapentin, metoprolol, valsartan acid and venlafaxine revealed a significantly enhanced removal in the systems with intermittent oxidation compared to the conventional treatment without aeration. Further improvement of benzotriazole and gabapentin removal by using pure oxygen confirmed potential oxygen limitation in the second column after aeration with air. Ozonation resulted in an enhanced removal of persistent compounds (i. e., carbamazepine, candesartan, olmesartan) and further increased the attenuation of gabapentin, methylbenzotriazole, benzotriazole, and venlafaxine. Diatrizoic acid revealed little degradation in an ozone–MAR hybrid system...|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot scale}} biofilm reactor {{has been applied}} to study the {{efficacy}} of an heterotrophic denitrification process for the removal of 40 mgNO 3 /L from Milan city groundwater, characterized by contextual pollution of VOCs and pesticides. The biological submerged filter (Biofor, Degrémont) with expanded clay as biomass support (Biolite, Degrémont) was fed with a constant water inflow of 0. 6 m 3 /h, and the effluent was subjected to an <b>aeration</b> <b>step</b> (3 min HRT) and a GAC filtration (8 min EBCT). Tracer tests using LiCl were performed before and after bacterial colonization, revealing a mean residence time of 22 min and suggesting a PFR with axial dispersion (increasing with the colonizing degree), as the best interpretative model. A continuous dosage of sodium acetate (CH 3 COONa) and potassium phosphate (KH 2 PO 4) was assured, with a variable organic carbon dosage, obtained fixing the C/DO ratio (0. 94 gC/gDO for a concentration of 6. 2 ± 0. 55 mgDO/L) and varying the C/N ratio. Data observed during 70 days of stationary phase have shown that an applied C/N ratio equal to the stoichiometric value of 1. 46 gC/gN led to a stable removal efficiency higher than 88. 5 %, while lower applied C/N values presented a significant occurrence of nitrite in the effluent. Stoichiometry was used to verify the aerobic and anoxic organic carbon consumption along the biofilter, since a concomitant removal of nitrogen and dissolved oxygen was observed, and suggested that no biomass stratification was present. The observed removal efficiencies did not highlight any inhibition mechanism associated to influent micro-pollutants, and any co-metabolic removal of VOCs or other organic pollutant could be inferred...|$|R
40|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) {{have been}} {{increasingly}} employed for municipal and industrial wastewater {{treatment in the}} last decade. The efforts for modelling of such wastewater treatment systems have always targeted either the biological processes (treatment quality target) {{as well as the}} various aspects of engineering (cost effective design and operation). The development of Activated Sludge Models (ASM) was an important evolution in the modelling of Conventional Activated Sludge (CAS) processes and their use is now very well established. However, although they were initially developed to describe CAS processes, they have simply been transferred and applied to MBR processes. Recent studies on MBR biological processes have reported several crucial specificities: medium to very high sludge retention times, high mixed liquor concentration, accumulation of soluble microbial products (SMP) rejected by the membrane filtration <b>step,</b> and high <b>aeration</b> rates for scouring purposes. These aspects raise the question as to what extent the ASM framework is applicable to MBR processes. Several studies highlighting some of the aforementioned issues are scattered through the literature. Hence, through a concise and structured overview of the past developments and current state-of-the-art in biological modelling of MBR, this review explores ASM-based modelling applied to MBR processes. The work aims to synthesize previous studies and differentiates between unmodified and modified applications of ASM to MBR. Particular emphasis is placed on influent fractionation, biokinetics, and soluble microbial products (SMPs) /exo-polymeric substances (EPS) modelling, and suggestions are put forward as to good modelling practice with regard to MBR modelling both for end-users and academia. A last section highlights shortcomings and future needs for improved biological modelling of MBR processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} worldwide {{contamination of}} aquatic environment with pollutants introduced by anthropogenic sources has become of great concern. Although present at low concentration, {{many of these}} pollutants have considerable long-term impacts on the ecosystem, such that extremely challenging legislative limits on their concentration in effluents are being proposed. This {{has led to the}} examination of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for wastewater treatment, since it offers the best and most consistent treated water quality of all biotreatment processes. However, both {{a review of the literature}} and experimental study reveals that MBRs appear to offer insufficient benefit over conventional processes to make their implementation for this duty viable, given their significantly higher cost. Notwithstanding this, the fate of micropollutants in MBR processes represents the most rapidly growing research topic in the general MBR subject area. Despite the wide range of products commercially available, the majority are hollow fibre (HF) products based on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) or polyethersulfone (PES) and almost all are in the pore size range between 0. 04 and 0. 4 μm. Whilst differences in module design across the whole range of products constrains their interchangeability, the increased acceptance of and confidence in this technology is reflected in the increased rate of implementation of large installations and the overall exponential growth in the market of 11 - 13 % per year. However, there appears to be a dysfunction between the needs of the industry and the primary research area within the academic community, with practitioners identifying clogging as the main impediment to sustainable operation while 31 % of all research papers published to end 2009 were based on fouling and less than 1 % on clogging. Experimental study of operation of an MBR to treat municipal wastewater based on a new HF material has revealed that studies based on <b>aeration</b> <b>step</b> provide a more realistic indication of critical operation than classical flux step experiments, since the latter involve imposing a hydraulic shock on the membrane. Simple measured sludge fouling propensity parameters did not appear to relate to fouling rate, with a counter-intuitive relationship arising under some operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Biogas is {{produced}} when organic material is broken down in oxygen-free (anaerobic) conditions. This process is called anaerobic digestion {{and is used}} in most large and medium-sized municipal wastewater treatment plants in Sweden. In the wastewater treatment sewage sludge is obtained, from the mecanical-, biological and chemical treatment step, which contains decomposable organic material. The sludge is pumped into a digester, which is an airtight container. In the digester raw biogas, consisting of methane and carbon dioxide, {{is produced}}. The material {{that comes out of}} the digester is a nutrient rich residue (digestate) which {{can be used as a}} fertilizer or soil conditioner. The purpose of this study was to explore ways to increase the biogas production that takes place at the municipal wastewater treatment plants by either co-digestion of sewage sludge with microalgae from a possible future biological purification steps or to use two digestion stages in series with different operating temperatures, mesophilic (37 ºC) followed by a thermophilic digestion (55 ºC). The challenges with these methods, which are also taken into consideration in the studies, were changes in the dewaterability of the digestate, system efficiency regarding electricity and heat consumption, the ability to recycle nutrients, changes in the carbon footprint from the treatment plant, change of the pollution level in the digestate and the ability to create a sanitization method for the digestate. The results from the first part showed in both batch digestability tests and continuous anaerobic digestion experiment that microalgae cultivated on wastewater can be a feasible feedstock for anaerobic co-digestion with sewage sludge. Microalgae improved the biogas production in mesophilic conditions but not in thermophilic digestion. In the semi-continous experiment, with the addition of a natural mix of microalgae grown from wastewater to sewage sludge, the specific methane production was enhanced with 39 % for every gram organic matter reduced. The specific methane production for every gram added organic matter to the reactors were 9 % lower in the digester where microalgae had been added. When microalgae were added the total digestibility was reduced compared to the reference digestion with only sewage sludge. Filterability tests indicated that the addition of microalgae enhanced the dewaterability of the digested sludge. Heavy metal levels in the microalgae substrate were much higher than in the sludge which could restrict the utilization of the digestate on arable land in a possible future full scale application. The results in the second part showed that the process solution could be a self-sufficient sanitation method. The highest organic loading rates tested in this study were in the range causing an unstable process due to high ammonia levels The thermophilic digestion gave the sludge worse dewaterability. However, a subsequent <b>aeration</b> <b>step</b> could improve the properties again...|$|R
