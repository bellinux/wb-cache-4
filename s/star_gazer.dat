5000|$|The 2012 {{season of}} the {{astronomy}} TV show <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers</b> <b>starring</b> Dean Regas, James Albury, and Marlene Hidalgo, started on January 2, 2012. The show's episode numbering scheme changed several times during its run to coincide with major events in the show's history. The official <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers</b> website hosts the complete scripts {{for each of the}} shows. After February 2012, the old jackstargazer.com website discontinued the practice of archiving its own copies of scripts from the show; and starting in July 2012, links to scripts from the jackstargazer.com website were directed to the [...] "Episodes" [...] page of the newer stargazersonline.org website.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] {{said the}} small <b>star</b> <b>gazer,</b> [...] "I {{know as much}} as any of them about the style of sleeves they're going to wear next fall in Mars." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> {{perceived}} a large lake, {{and on the}} shores of the lake twelve little boats with awnings, in which were seated twelve princes, who, grasping their oars, awaited the princesses.|$|E

Wild trout and yellowfish {{are found in}} {{abundance}} in the streams and rivers in the area. Visitors wishing to fish here are advised to obtain a permit from the local fly fishing association, especially for fishing on private property, through {{which most of the}} streams flow.|$|R
60|$|The same {{evening the}} twelve sisters went {{again to the}} ball, and the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> again {{followed}} them and crossed the lake in Lina's boat. This time it was the Prince who complained that the boat seemed very heavy.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening the}} little cow-boy, {{who had been}} {{thinking}} {{a great deal about}} the advice of the lady in the golden dress, told his dream to the farm people. But, as was natural, they only laughed at the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Princess Lina did {{not become}} a gardener's wife; on the contrary, it was the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> who became a Prince: but before the {{marriage}} ceremony the Princess insisted that her lover should tell her {{how he came to}} discover the secret.|$|E

Also included is a re-arrangement of the Jerry Lee Lewis classic [...] "Great Balls of Fire." ...|$|R
5000|$|SkyWeek was {{a weekly}} {{astronomy}} television program created by Sky & Telescope magazine. [...] The show was hosted by Tony Flanders, {{associate editor of}} Sky & Telescope magazine. Each episode {{of the program was}} released in one, three, and five-minute formats; and, the show's content and format were similar to that of another weekly astronomy program called <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers.</b> SkyWeek was carried by many PBS affiliates.|$|R
5000|$|This {{minor planet}} {{was named for}} Dean Regas (born 1973), an {{astronomer}} at Cincinnati Observatory, responsible for science outreach activities and a national popularizer of astronomy. He is also a co-host of the prolific PBS show <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers</b> and author of Facts From Space. The approved naming citation was suggested by Fred N.

60|$|There {{was great}} {{excitement}} {{through all the}} village, and {{on the top of}} the hill the people stood holding their sides with laughing, as they watched the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> trudging bravely along the valley with his bundle at the end of his stick.|$|E
60|$|As {{he had a}} white skin, blue eyes, {{and hair}} that curled all over his head, the village girls used to cry after him, 'Well, <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer,</b> what are you doing?' and Michael would answer, 'Oh, nothing,' and go on his way without even turning to look at them.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> {{had another}} dream. The {{lady in the}} golden dress {{appeared}} to him once more, holding in one hand two young laurel trees, a cherry laurel and a rose laurel, {{and in the other}} hand a little golden rake, a little golden bucket, and a silken towel. She thus addressed him: ...|$|E
5000|$|Sixpenny Handley {{is located}} on the B3081 road which has been {{described}} as providing [...] "a magical driving experience", and the village is a popular stop-over for touring. Cranborne Chase hosts a number of festivals including The Great Dorset Steam Fair, Larmer Tree Festival and the Cranborne Chase AONB Woodfair; the village is always busy at these times. The village’s isolated position makes it popular with both walkers and <b>star</b> <b>gazers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The track [...] "Arabesque No. 1" [...] {{was used}} from 1976 to 2011 as the theme {{music for the}} PBS astronomy-based program Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler (later Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer); however, its use as the theme was {{discontinued}} when the show was revamped as <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers.</b> In Japan during the late 70s, parts of the track [...] "Reverie" [...] {{were used for the}} opening and closing of Fuji TV's transmissions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, Miami-Dade County {{built a new}} [...] museum {{building}} on a 3 acre site {{in an area of}} Miami called Coconut Grove. In 1966, the Space Transit Planetarium was added with a Spitz Model B Space Transit Projector. The projector was the last (of 12) of its type that was built, and the last one still in operation in 2015. The Planetarium was the home of the national astronomy show <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers</b> with Jack Horkheimer.|$|R
60|$|ONCE upon a {{time there}} lived {{in the village of}} Montignies-sur-Roc a little cow-boy, without either father or mother. His real name was Michael, but he was always called the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer,</b> because when he drove his cows over the commons to seek for pasture, he went along with his head in the air, gaping at nothing.|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} the castle, Michael went {{straight}} to the gardener and offered his services. Now it happened that the garden boy had just been sent away, and though the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> did not look very sturdy, the gardener agreed to take him, as he thought that his pretty face and golden curls would please the princesses.|$|E
60|$|Michael {{could see}} nothing from his hiding-place, but he could hear everything, and {{he listened to the}} princesses {{laughing}} and jumping with pleasure. At last the eldest said, 'Be quick, my sisters, our partners will be impatient.' At the end of an hour, when the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> heard no more noise, he peeped out and saw the twelve sisters in splendid garments, with their satin shoes on their feet, and in their hands the bouquets he had brought them.|$|E
50|$|A 1.54x0.72 m {{sculpture}} of William and Caroline, named <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers</b> by Vivien Moudell, sits against the garden wall {{close to the}} entrance to the workshop. Made of Bath stone and slate, it was unveiled in 1988 by Patrick Moore and Rod Davies. It shows William dressed in a wig, jacket and ruffled shirt, behind Caroline, in a bonnet and holding a quill pen, looking at a piece of paper showing a drawing of the solar system with Uranus at the centre. An octagonal slate panel was set above their heads, engraved with planetary orbits.|$|R

Locally produced programs that are seen exclusively on the station include Check, Please! South Florida, a restaurant review show based on the series Check, Please that originated on fellow PBS station WTTW in Chicago.|$|R

60|$|After supper, {{the dancers}} all {{went back to}} their boats, and this time the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> entered that of the eldest Princess. They crossed again the wood with the diamond-spangled leaves, the wood with gold-sprinkled leaves, and the wood whose leaves glittered with drops of silver, and as a proof of what he had seen, the boy broke a small branch from a tree in the last wood. Lina turned as she heard the noise made by the {{breaking}} of the branch.|$|E
5000|$|The 2000 {{season of}} the {{astronomy}} TV show Jack Horkheimer: <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> starring Jack Horkheimer started on January 3, 2000. The episode numbering scheme for the show changed yet again in this season. This time the [...] "SG" [...] was dropped from the episode number. This {{had been used in}} the previous three seasons to differentiate the <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> shows from the Star Hustler shows. The official <b>Star</b> <b>Gazer</b> website hosts the complete scripts for each of the shows.|$|E

5000|$|In Ghana in the 1950s, Teddy Osei (saxophone), Sol Amarfio (drums), Mamon Shareef, and Farhan Freere (flute) {{played in}} a highlife band called The <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers.</b> They left to form The Comets, with Osei's brother Mac Tontoh on trumpet, and scored a hit in West Africa with their 1958 song [...] "Pete Pete." [...] In 1962 Osei moved to London to study music on a {{scholarship}} from the Ghanaian government. In 1964 he formed Cat's Paw, an early [...] "world music" [...] band that combined highlife, rock, and soul. In 1969 he persuaded Amarfio and Tontoh {{to join him in}} London, and Osibisa was born.|$|R
5000|$|On October 3, 2011, the program's {{name was}} changed to <b>Star</b> <b>Gazers.</b> The show's new opening {{sequence}} featured a new logo and new theme music done in an alternative/progressive/space rock style (like Muse). With the name change, the program's format was also changed to include two (and later three) co-hosts who appeared together in each episode. A new website for the show was launched as well. The show still retains the old format of the show using Green Screens, and still ends with Horkeimer's closing phrase; [...] "Keep Looking Up." [...] For the show's 40th anniversary episode (Oct 31-Nov 6th) Tomita's version of Debusssy's Arabesque No. 1 was used once again briefly as the show's theme music.|$|R
60|$|But {{the rather}} spinsterish flutter {{among some of}} the old Freethinkers has put one tiny ripple of truth in it; and that affects the idea which I wish to emphasise even to monotony in these pages. I mean the idea that the new {{community}} which the capitalists are now constructing will be a very complete and absolute community; and one which will tolerate nothing really independent of itself. Now, it is true that any positive creed, true or false, would tend to be independent of itself. It might be Roman Catholicism or Mahomedanism or Materialism; but, if strongly held, it would be a thorn {{in the side of the}} Servile State. The Moslem thinks all men immortal: the Materialist thinks all men mortal. But the Moslem does not think the rich Sinbad will live forever; but the poor Sinbad will die on his deathbed. The Materialist does not think that Mr. Haeckel will go to heaven, while all the peasants will go to pot, like their chickens. In every serious doctrine of the destiny of men, there is some trace of the doctrine of the equality of men. But the capitalist really depends on some religion of inequality. The capitalist must somehow distinguish himself from human kind; he must be obviously above it--or he would be obviously below it. Take even the least attractive and popular side of the larger religions to-day; take the mere vetoes imposed by Islam on Atheism or Catholicism. The Moslem veto upon intoxicants cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist (who presides at a Licensing Committee, and also at a large dinner), it is absolutely necessary for him, to make a distinction between gin and champagne. The Atheist veto upon all miracles cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist to make a distinction between his wife (who is an aristocrat and consults crystal <b>gazers</b> and <b>star</b> <b>gazers</b> in the West End), and vulgar miracles claimed by gipsies or travelling showmen. The Catholic veto upon usury, as defined in dogmatic councils, cuts across all classes. But it is absolutely necessary to the capitalist to distinguish more delicately between two kinds of usury; the kind he finds useful and the kind he does not find useful. The religion of the Servile State must have no dogmas or definitions. It cannot afford to have any definitions. For definitions are very dreadful things: they do the two things that most men, especially comfortable men, cannot endure. They fight; and they fight fair.|$|R
