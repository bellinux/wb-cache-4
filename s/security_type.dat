50|$|A <b>security</b> <b>type</b> {{system is}} a kind of type system that can be used by {{software}} developers in order to control the information flow in their code. A <b>security</b> <b>type</b> system consists of several rules that will be used to verify a given information flow policy in a computer program, usually at compile-time. This can reveal if there is any violation of confidentiality or integrity in the program.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, a type {{system can}} be described as a syntactic framework which contains a set of rules that are used to assign a type property (int, boolean, char etc.) to various components of a computer program, such as variables or functions. A <b>security</b> <b>type</b> system works in a similar way, only with a main focus on the security of the computer program, through information flow control. Thus, the various components of the program are assigned security types, or labels. The aim of a such system is to ultimately be able to verify that a given program conforms to the type system rules and satisfies non-interference. <b>Security</b> <b>type</b> systems is one of many security techniques used in the field of language-based security, and is tightly connected to information flow and information flow policies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} {{foundations}} of informationflow security for interactive programs. Previous research assumes that the environment is total, that is, it must always be ready to feed new inputs into programs. However, programs secure under this assumption can leak the presence of input. Such leaks can be magnified to whole-secret leaks in the concurrent setting. We propose a framework that generalizes previous research along two dimensions: first, the framework breaks away from {{the totality of the}} environment and, second, the framework features fine-grained <b>security</b> <b>types</b> for communication channels, where we distinguish between the security level of message presence and message content. We show that the generalized framework features appealing compositionality properties: parallel composition of secure program results in a secure thread pool. We also show that modeling environments as strategies leads to strong compositionality: various types of composition (with and without scoping) follow from our general compositionality result. Further, we propose a type system that supports enforcement of security via fine-grained <b>security</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to analyze secure {{information}} flow in stack-based assembly languages, communicating with the external environment by means of input and output channels. The method computes for each instruction a security level for each memory variable and stack element. Instruction-level security analysis is flow-sensitive and hence is more precise than other analyses, such as standard <b>security</b> <b>typing.</b> Instruction-level <b>security</b> analysis is specified {{in the framework of}} abstract interpretation. We define concrete operational semantics which handles, in addition to execution aspects, the flow of information of the program. The basis of the approach is that each value is annotated by a security level and that the abstract domain is obtained from the concrete one by keeping the security levels and forgetting the actual values. Operand stack are abstracted as fixed-length stacks of security levels. An abstract state is a map from instructions to abstract machine. configurations, where values are substituted by security levels. The abstract semantics consists of a set of abstract rules manipulating abstract states. The instruction-level <b>security</b> <b>typing</b> can be performed by an efficient fixpoint iteration algorithm, similar to that used by bytecode verification. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
