Cherry <b>bark</b> <b>tortrix</b> is known throughout Europe, south to coastal North Africa and west to Siberia. In its native homeland, because parasitic wasps and other natural enemies keep populations low, it rarely causes economic damage or requires treatment. However, because cherry <b>bark</b> <b>tortrix</b> is an introduced pest in the Pacific Northwest, natural enemies have not yet appeared to a significant degree. Larvae tunnel into the bark and feed on phloem tissues, causing damage to trunks and major limbs. The insect infests trees in the rose family, including cherry and apple...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} climate change on the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle Model {{simulations}} show that an increased frequency in storms and drought periods may result in more frequent and shorter outbreaks of bark beetles. Warmer summers can result in two bark beetle generations per summer instead of one, giving bark beetles the opportunity to attack forests twice in a single year. By Bjørn Økland, Paal Krokene and Holger Lange In a NORKLIMA project financed by the Research Council of Norway, we have focused on how climate change can affect an important species for Norwegian forestry, namely the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle (Ips typographus). The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle {{is one of the}} few insects in Norway capable of killing trees in large numbers, and this makes it an important species in both economic and ecological terms. Recurring outbreaks over the last few centuries have had catastrophic effects on forests in Central and Northern Europe. The most recent outbreak in southern Norway in the 1970 s killed forests equivalent to five million cubic meters of lumber, which at the time was worth about 500 million kroner (about 84 million dollars). The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle is also important in ecological terms. When the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle kills entire swathes of trees, i...|$|R

This experiment is shown on particular problem of <b>Spruce</b> <b>Bark</b> Beetle in the National Park of Šumava. There are two main streams towards this issue of <b>Spruce</b> <b>Bark</b> Beetle-one of them promotes the idea of incorporating the human intervention, while reducing the disaster, the other follows the opposite attitude towards {{the outbreak of the}} <b>Spruce</b> <b>Bark</b> Beetle, and that is not to intervene at all and to leave the destructed vegetation to regenerate. The backbone of the thesis is represented by a survey that aims at finding attitudes towards the problem mentioned above. Moreover, the survey also questions the way the attitudes change depending on critical reading of distinctive texts. Two main questions are posed in this research. The results are graphically depicted and commented upon in the thesis. The research shows {{the extent to which it}} is possible to influence the students' opinion utilising quality study texts.

40|$|During {{outbreak}} periods, the European <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle and the North American {{mountain pine}} beetle {{are able to}} kill millions of coniferous trees. Throughout the 20 th century, six outbreaks have occurred in Sweden and four in British Columbia, with about 20 -year intervals in both regions. The outbreaks of the mountain pine beetles seem to grow much larger and last longer compared to the outbreaks of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetles. Over the years, the mountain pine beetle has killed about 60 million ha forest or 550 million m 3 trees in British Columbia, which {{is at least one}} hundred times more than for the <b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle in Sweden. Damages of both species have increased markedly in the last forty years. About 750 <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetles per m 2 are necessary to kill a healthy spruce, whereas seven times fewer, i. e., about 110 mountain pine beetles per m 2, are needed to kill a healthy pine. Furthermore, twice as many offspring per m 2 bark are produced by the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle compared to the mountain pine beetle. An explanation for the large differences in population dynamics between these two beetle species may spring from differences in (1) the availability of host trees, (2) number of specimens required to kill a tree, and (3) reproductive success. The latter is in turn affected by the intraspecific competition, nutrient content, and occurrence of fungi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle (Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758)) is {{our most}} serious pests, {{frequently}} invading spruce stands. The most important predators of I. typographus are two species from genus Thanasimus - Thanasimus formicarius (Linnaeus, 1758) and Thanasimus femoralis (Zetterstedt, 1828). Monitoring {{of these three}} species were carried out from April to August, using pheromone traps type Theyson with pheromone lures designed for their capture. New pheromone lure attracting beetles of genus Thanasimus has been tested. It was used a total of six traps that were placed at three locations. Two traps were always placed at one location, one with pheromone lure Pheroprax attracting <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetles and the second one with pheromone lure called Thanasiwit attracting beetles of the genus Thanasimus. All traps were checked once a week. A total of 10 291 of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetles were captured, 25 specimens of T. formicarius and 7 individuals of T. femoralis. <b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle flight activity had two generations and one sister brood.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of defensive techniques against the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle (Ips typographus L.) with a primary focus on pheromone traps and selected factors affecting their efficacy. The factors tested are the setup system of pheromone traps and type of pheromone dispenser baits, {{the effect on the}} efficacy of pheromone traps of increasing evaporated pheromones, a comparison of the biological efficacy of different types of pheromone dispensers and an assessment of their impact on the swarming curve. In addition, an evaluation of non-traditional methods of forest protection against the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle (water spraying of whole landings, efficacy of insecticidal sraying of whole landings, and the use of insecticidal nets) was conducted and the possibility of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle s sex determination was also examined. When comparing the systems of pheromone traps installation, (1) the standard way was along the stand edge with 20 m space and (2) traps concentrating in the centre of clear cut adjacent to each other with different baiting, the most effective way was found to be the standard trap arrangement and the system with traps installed in line with the dispenser in each pheromone trap. Efficacy decreased with a lower number of pheromone dispensers. The influence of increased amounts of evaporated pheromone on efficacy was tested. Pheromone traps with one, two or three dispensers were compared and it was found that a trap s efficacy was not increased with a higher amount of released pheromone. The Pheagr IT and IT Ecolure Tubus dispensers showed unchanged effectivity throughout the flight activity of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> beetle, but other dispensers need to be replaced according to the instructions since their efficacy decreases, thus affecting the swarming curve.
