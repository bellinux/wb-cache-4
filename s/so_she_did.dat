5|$|The Elector Palatine died in June 1716. His widow, Anna Maria Luisa, {{returned}} to Florence in October 1717. Dowager Grand Princess Violante Beatrice, her brother Ferdinando's widow, and Anna Maria Luisa {{did not enjoy}} an amiable relationship. Upon hearing of Anna Maria Luisa's intention to return, Violante Beatrice prepared to depart for Munich, her brother's capital, but Gian Gastone wished her to stay, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> To keep the two ladies from quarrelling over precedence, Cosimo III defined Violante Beatrice's status just before the Electress's arrival by appointing her Governess of Siena.|$|E
5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

Their friendship continued even after Price was reassigned to Fuzhou where he served as United States consul. Sun Yat-sen personally invited both Price and his wife to his inauguration ceremony staged by the Nationalist government. The United States did not recognize the Nationalist government, choosing instead to retain official ties with the rival government in Peking. Therefore, Price could not attend a Nationalist-sponsored ceremony.

500|$|When Cotton left England, Anne Hutchinson {{described}} it as a [...] "great trouble unto her," [...] and said that she [...] "could not be at rest" [...] until she followed her minister to New England.

[...] She was well into her 14th pregnancy, however, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not travel until after the baby was born. [...] With the intention of soon going to New England, the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son Edward to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage. [...] In 1634, 43-year-old Anne Hutchinson set sail from England with her 48-year-old husband William and their other ten surviving children, aged about eight months to 19 years. They sailed aboard the Griffin, the same ship that had carried Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier.|$|E
500|$|... "The F Word" [...] was {{considered}} particularly controversial, even by South Park standards {{due to the}} excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "fag". The episode received generally mixed reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said [...] "The F Word" [...] marks a return of South Parks tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing, which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes. Delgado said [...] "The F Word" [...] served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful, the word itself is not. Ramsey Isler of IGN compared [...] "The F Word" [...] to [...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson", an eleventh season episode that contained frequent use of the racial slur [...] "nigger". However, Isler said [...] "The F Word" [...] was not as skillfully crafted as the [...] "Jesse Jackson" [...] episode and, although some moments were entertaining, the episode [...] "had a habit of running some gags into the ground". James Hibberd, of The Live Feed, said he found the episode [...] "well-intended and funny", and that it forced viewers to face a difficult issue and reexamine their beliefs about it. Hibberd wrote, [...] "This is also, by the way, precisely what great art does". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said the word [...] "fag" [...] has not lost its associations with homosexuals, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not believe in the episode's statements about the changing use of the word. Koski also called the episode [...] "preachy", and said, [...] "It took too long to get going, seemed confused about what its point was, and, most egregiously, had very few laughs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mrs. Mary Wylie King {{was active}} in women's {{organizations}} of the church. She worked for many years as an enthusiastic member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

She did not like staying home while Ward travelled, a fact which she mentioned repeatedly in her letters to him. Even <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> serve as his [...] "manager" [...] under one spelling of her maiden name of [...] "M.B. Wylie". She served as the practice audience for his speeches. She edited and typed his letters, often serving as his [...] "emergency secretary". Some called her the [...] "Mother of Good Roads." [...] By all accounts, she was a very strong-willed woman, with a flair for the dramatic. Family members point to the photo she had taken of herself in [...] "widow's weeds" [...] as an example of her endearing way of dramatizing eventsâ€”in that case, the recent death of her husband. She also never lost her staunch devotion to the cause of temperance, which the repeal of Prohibition did nothing to dampen. One family member reported that {{there was a time when}} she came upon another family member having a beer. After she finished telling him in no uncertain terms what she thought about that, the two of them remained thereafter permanently estranged. However, she and Ward, the great promoter of his world changing invention, were undoubtedly the perfect pair.|$|E
2500|$|By her own admission, {{she was not}} {{a success}} at first.

[...] As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, [...] "I had no clients. And I had no money. [...] But I had great hopes." [...] However, in order to become successful, what she needed was some experience, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. [...] As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. [...] And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more {{as a result of her}} struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. [...] She became even more interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's suffrage. [...] She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. [...] During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: [...] disarmament and the quest for world peace. [...] For Allen, this was personal: [...] both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.|$|E
