5|$|During World War II PRR carried {{troops and}} matériel for the Allied war effort, and the Curve was under armed guard. The {{military}} intelligence arm of Nazi Germany, the Abwehr, plotted to sabotage important industrial {{assets in the}} United <b>States</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> project code-named Operation Pastorius. In June1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island, planning to destroy such sites as the Curve, Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River. The would-be saboteurs were quickly apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after one, George John Dasch, turned himself in.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the verification {{of a class}} of infinite-state systems called lossy channel systems, which consist of finite-state processes communicating via unbounded but lossy FIFO channels. This class is able to model several interesting protocols, such as HDLC, the Alternating Bit Protocol, and other Sliding Window protocols. In earlier papers we have considered the decidability of various temporal properties for lossy channel systems. In this paper we study simulation and bisimulation relations between lossy channel systems and finite transition systems. More precisely, we show the decidability of (1) whether <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite transition system simulates <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lossy channel system, and conversely, (2) whether <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite transition system is bisimilar to <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lossy channel system, and (3) whether <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite [...] ...|$|R

Playing Russia {{in the last}} game of the final round, Booth scored the United States' first two goals of the game. A win against Russia placed the United <b>States</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tie for the gold medal with four wins and one tie each. In order to beat Russia on the goal-differential tiebreaker, they needed to win the contest by two goals. Leading 2–1 with a minute remaining, the United States pulled their goalie and Zach Parise scored with 30 seconds left to capture the gold medal. Booth was named MVP of the gold medal game.

The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition.|$|E

While in Crete, she wrote a series of poems titled (Vietnam) Variations, a collection of poems and prose poems that she printed on the island in a book called Child, and a novel in a style resembling magical realism called Notes on Burning Boyfriend—a reference to the pacifist Norman Morrison, who had burned himself to death in protest of the Vietnam War. She also wrote several poems and dialogues which she hand-printed after returning to the United <b>States</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> book called Morning Hair.|$|E

5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those <b>states.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> report to Congress, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E
5|$|At under-17 level, Nasri, Menez and Ben Arfa {{were joined}} by Karim Benzema and tasked {{with the goal of}} winning the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship on home soil. Nasri made his debut with the team in the opening match of the season against Sweden, scoring a goal in a 5–2 victory. In the team's second {{straight}} yearly appearance at the Tournio du Val-de-Marne, Nasri scored his lone goal in the competition against the United <b>States</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 win as France were declared champions without conceding a goal. At the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, Nasri scored against Portugal in the competition's semi-finals. France {{went on to win the}} match 3–1 to earn a place in the final. In the final match, France faced Spain. In the match, Nasri scored the game-winning goal to give France its first-ever title in the competition. In total with the under-17s, he made 16 appearances and scored six goals. Due to increased playing time at his parent club Marseille, Nasri stint with the under-18 team was uneventful, appearing in only four matches.|$|E

5|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, {{takes pride in}} presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal (Posthumously) to Major General Clarence R. Edwards, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United <b>States,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> duty of great responsibility during World War I. After having organized the 26th Division, General Edwards commanded it with distinction during all but 18 days of its active service at the front. The high qualities of leadership and unfailing devotion to duty displayed by him {{were responsible for the}} marked espirit and morale of his command. To his marked tactical ability and energy are largely due the brilliant successes achieved by the 26th National Guard Division during its operations against the enemy from 4 February 1918 to 11 November 1918. General Edwards died 14 February 1931.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{land was}} {{acquired}} by the United <b>States</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of treaties and purchases negotiated with the Mdewakanton band of the Dakota and separately with European nations. England claimed the land east of the Mississippi and France, then Spain, and again France claimed the land west of the river. In 1787 land {{on the east side}} of the river became part of the Northwest Territory and in 1803 the west side became part of the Louisiana Purchase, both claimed by the United States. In 1805, Zebulon Pike purchased two tracts of land from the Dakota Indians. One tract was located at the mouth of the St. Croix River, while a second, larger tract ran from the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers to St. Anthony Falls, with a width of nine miles (14km) east and west of the river. In return, he distributed about $200 in trading goods and sixty gallons of liquor, and promised a further payment from the United States government.

5|$|The {{two teams}} first played in 1895 and met six more times through 1923. In those early matches, Johns Hopkins scored a {{combined}} sixty points to Maryland's three. In 1924, Maryland fielded its first varsity-level lacrosse team, which defeated Hopkins, 4–2, but the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Blue Jays the co-national championship (along with Syracuse). Since that season, the teams have met annually {{with the exception}} of a two-year hiatus due to World War II. Johns Hopkins won three straight national titles from 1926 to 1928, where each season culminated with a victory over Maryland. In 1928, Maryland had a perfect 9–0 record until Johns Hopkins defeated the Terps in the season finale, 6–3. At season's end, a single-elimination tournament was held to determine which team would represent the United <b>States</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trial lacrosse competition during the Summer Olympics. Maryland defeated Navy and Rutgers to advance to the final game, where they were again bested by Johns Hopkins.|$|E
