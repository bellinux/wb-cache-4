5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin. The eyes are large, circular, and green in life, with irregularly shaped pupils and a nictitating membrane (protective third eyelid). The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows {{at the corners}} and usually bears 15 tooth rows {{on either side of}} both jaws, plus 12 upper and 1 lower symphysial (jaw midline) tooth rows. Each upper tooth has a smooth to <b>serrated</b> <b>edge,</b> a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth, and 25 coarse serrations {{at the base of the}} trailing margin. The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative to those on the trailing margin as the animal grows older. The lower teeth are upright and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are rather short.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Godwin {{was living}} in Palm Springs, California, working as a {{self-employed}} tool salesman, a mechanic, and a construction worker, with no discernible criminal history. Godwin and his roommate, Frank Soto, Jr., planned to rob a drug dealer and pilot, Kim Robert LeValley, who was once a friend of theirs. Godwin and Soto lured LeValley back to their condominium where Soto held him, Godwin punched and kicked him, tried to strangle him, then ultimately stabbed LeValley 26 times with his butcher knife., however, during the trial, the prosecution said that Godwin used a <b>serrated</b> <b>edge</b> knife. A butcher's knife was not mentioned. After the murder, Godwin and Soto loaded the body into a truck and set off for the desert. Godwin tried {{to blow up the}} evidence by using homemade explosives strapped to the body. The explosion was intended to disguise the murder of LeValley. On August 3, 1980, some Eagle Mountain residents found a blown-up pickup truck with remains of a human body inside of it abandoned in the desert.|$|E
500|$|Steak {{has become}} a popular dish in many places around the world, cooked in {{domestic}} as well as professional kitchens, and is often a primary ingredient in a menu. It is used in small amounts in an hors d'oeuvre, in an entrée dish or more usually, in a larger amount as the main course. A steak knife is a specialized piece of cutlery to make cutting the steak easier. It is sharper than other knives and has a <b>serrated</b> <b>edge.</b> Steak has also been an important breakfast dish, especially for people undertaking hard outdoor work, such as farmers. [...] Diners ordering steak at a restaurant typically advise the chef or waiter of their preferences regarding the degree of cooking, using the terms [...] "rare", [...] "medium-rare", [...] "medium", [...] "medium-well", or [...] "well-done". [...] Print appearances of this use of [...] "rare" [...] are found as early as c. 1615.|$|E

60|$|Peduncle.--The most {{remarkable}} fact concerning this part, {{is that the}} outer tunic, together with the calcareous scales with which it is covered, is moulted at each successive period of exuviation and growth. I demonstrated this fact in L. dorsalis and L. truncata, by removing the old tunic and finding a new membrane with perfect calcified scales beneath; and as these two species, (I obtained, also, pretty good evidence in L. Nicobarica,) are at the opposite extremes of the genus, no doubt this fact is common to the whole genus. I know of no other instance, amongst Cirripedia, in which calcified valves or scales are moulted. I am not certain that the whole skin of the peduncle is thrown off in a single piece; though this almost certainly {{is the case with}} the uppermost and lowest portions. The animal's body is partly lodged within the peduncle, which is generally from one to three times as long as the capitulum, and in the upper part is fully as broad as it. The scales with which it is clothed, extend up in the triangular interspaces between the basal margins of the valves. The scales of the upper whorl, or of the two or three upper whorls (Pl. VIII, figs. 1 b´ and 3 d) are larger than those below; and these latter rapidly decrease in size, so as to become low down on the peduncle, almost or quite invisible to the naked eye. The scales in each whorl, are placed alternately with those in the whorls, above and below. All the upper scales are packed rather closely together; those in the uppermost row are generally nearly quadrilateral; those in the few next succeeding whorls, are triangular, with their basal margins protuberant and arched; the scales, low down on the peduncle, stand some way apart from each other, and generally consist of simple rounded calcareous beads, of which some of the smallest in L. dorsalis were only 1/400th of an inch in diameter. In the lowest part of the peduncle these scales, after each fresh exuviation, are apparently soon worn entirely away by the friction against the sides of the cavity; hence in most specimens this part of the peduncle is quite naked. This same part, however, is furnished with nail- or rather star-headed little projections of hard, yellow, horny chitine (fig. 3 e). The star on the summit seems generally to have about five irregular points; one star which I measured was 7/6000th of an inch in total width, the footstalk being only 2/6000th of an inch in diameter; the whole projected 10/6000ths of an inch above the surface of the peduncle; from the footstalk a fine tubulus runs through the membrane to the underlying corium. These star-headed little points are often much worn down; in one specimen which was on the point of exuviation, there remained, in the lower part, close above the basal calcareous cup, only some hard, smooth, yellow, little discs, on a level with the general surface of the membrane,--these being the intersected or worn down footstalks, with every trace of the calcareous beads gone. But in this same specimen, under the old peduncular membrane, there was a new one, studded with the usual circular calcareous beads, slightly unequal in size, generally about 1/400th of an inch in diameter, and each furnished with a tubulus; but as yet none of the star-headed points of chitine had been formed. I believe that these latter are developed from the tubuli leading to the calcified beads, and, therefore, are formed directly under them. In L. cauta the lowest scales on the peduncle are a little larger than in L. dorsalis, giving a frosted appearance to it, and all of them are serrated (fig. 3 d) round their entire margins. Generally only the scales in the uppermost, or in the three or four upper rows are serrated, and this only on their arched and protuberant lower margins. The state of the <b>serrated</b> <b>edge</b> varies extremely in the same species, from elongated conical teeth to mere notches, according to the amount of wear and tear the individual has suffered since the last period of exuviation; so also do the teeth or serrated margins on the valves of the capitulum. Each scale has a fine tubulus passing from the corium through the membrane of the peduncle to its bluntly-pointed imbedded fang or base. The membrane is transparent, thin, and tender, to a degree I have not seen equalled in the other Lepadidæ, except, perhaps, in Ibla. It is much wrinkled transversely.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis is to investigate and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} radar cross section (RCS) reduction by means of the geometric control of discontinuities using <b>serrated</b> <b>edges.</b> Although the use of <b>serrated</b> <b>edges</b> for RCS reduction can be clearly seen on stealth aircraft such as the Northrop B- 2, and was mentioned in several papers and references, not much data on the reduction magnitude, the associated geometry, or the design methodology are available in the open literature. Parameters of interest include the number of basic serration cells (triangles) required per wavelength, and the aspect ratio of the triangles that form the zig zags. An infinitely thin metallic plate is considered for the analysis. The RCS of such a plate with <b>serrated</b> <b>edges</b> is computed and compared against the RCS of a plate of the same sized without <b>serrated</b> <b>edges.</b> The infinitely thin assumption is valid if the wing of the aircraft, which is represented by the plate, is thin compared to the wavelength. The results obtained show significant reduction in RCS. [URL] Singapore Ministry of Defens...|$|R
