40|$|The {{diagnostics}} of malfunctions {{that can}} cause catastrophic failures {{has to be made}} in early stage in the industrial environment. Often flexible couplings are employed in industrial rotating machines when gearboxes and heavy thermal gradients are present. The hot and cold alignment of these couplings can be very different. Severe misalignments can generate cracks in the <b>stub</b> <b>shafts,</b> which can propagate in operating condition. Owing to the flexural flexibility of the load coupling, the shaft vibrations may be not noticeably affected by some typical symptoms that usually point out the presence of a crack, like twice per revolution harmonics in the vibration spectrum. Anyhow, suitable diagnostic strategies can detect clear fault symptoms, while model-based methods can confirm the occurrence of the shaft bow induced by the progressive yielding of a load coupling due to a crack. This paper shows as a model-based diagnostic methodology would have allowed a crack in a load coupling of a gas turbine to be identified before a serious failure happened by means of the shaft vibration analysis under operating conditions and rated speed. Finally, the vibrations caused by the shaft bow due to the propagation of a crack in the <b>stub</b> <b>shaft</b> of the coupling have been simulated using suitable equivalent excitations, the magnitude and phase of which have been estimated by means of a model-based identification method...|$|R

5000|$|Stephen Balzer immigrated in the 1870s {{from the}} Kingdom of Hungary to the USA. He apprenticed as a watchmaker at Tiffany's. When {{he started his}} own {{business}} in 1894, a machine shop, he already held several patents for mechanical devices, among them a device for making milling cutters and his rotary engine. In the same year, he completed his first prototype automobile, a motorized quadricyclewith a tube chassis, less than 6 ft long and 3 ft wide. It had a rotary, air-cooled, 3-cylinder engine, mounted vertically in the rear and revolving around a fixed crankshaft. Turning with the crank case was a <b>stub</b> <b>shaft.</b> It further had a 3-speed manual transmission with no reverse. One lever engaged speeds and clutch. Each front wheel had its own bicycle fork axle which were connected by a bar which was operated by a tiller) By 1897, he had built three cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus on}} {{hydropower}} development in Nepal has increased as {{consequence of the}} growing energy demand in the region. To render possible locally executed performance tests on model turbines, the Turbine Testing Laboratory (TTL) at Kathmandu University (KU) is under development. The main objective of this master s thesis is to design a complete system for the efficiency measurement of Francis turbines at TTL. The test rig is to perform tests in accordance with IEC 60193 (1), the International Standard for model testing of hydraulic turbines. The basis {{for the design of}} the Francis turbine test rig at TTL is the corresponding installation at the Waterpower Laboratory, NTNU. The rig is in comply with IEC 60193 (1) and has provided good experiences. Piping and instrumentation diagrams for the Francis rig at TTL have been developed. Open and closed loop configurations are exemplified. Calibration of the instruments is limited to principal methods in compliance with IEC 60193 (1). Differential pressure transducers that are calibrated by a deadweight manometer measure the differential pressure between the turbine inlet and outlet. An electromagnetic flowmeter calibrated by the weighing method measures the volume flow rate. In conjunction with the main shaft is an arrangement for measuring the generator torque and the rotational speed. Strain gauges mounted in T-rosette on a customised <b>stub</b> <b>shaft</b> measure the forces acting in both axial directions. A calibration procedure that involves a jig utilising the lever principle is proposed for the axial force measurements. The mechanical torque applied to the shaft by the runner is measured by strain gauges mounted on the <b>stub</b> <b>shaft</b> at a 45 º angle to the shaft centerline. Calibrated masses attached to a lever arm via a pulley applies the torque in the appurtenant calibration procedure. 3 D-drawings of TTL have been made, with components for the Francis test rig integrated into the existing piping arrangement. A bearing-shaft-housing system comprising double-row roller bearings and a back-to-back arrangement of angular contact ball bearings has been designed. The master thesis is done in relation to the NORAD-funded research program named Energize Nepal, aiming to facilitate Nepal in utilising their enormous hydropower resources...|$|R
50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened <b>stub</b> <b>shaft.</b> Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|Allison {{adopted a}} reverse-airflow engine {{configuration}} for the Model 250: although air enters the intake/compression {{system in the}} conventional fashion, the compressed air leaving the centrifugal compressor diffuser is ducted rearwards around the turbine system, before being turned through 180 degrees at entry to the combustor. The combustion products expand through the two-stage (single-stage on early engines) high-pressure turbine section, which {{is connected to the}} compressor via the HP shaft. The combustion products continue to expand through the two-stage power turbine which generates shaft horsepower for the aircraft. A coaxial <b>stub</b> <b>shaft</b> connects the power turbine to a compact reduction gearbox, located inboard, between the centrifugal compressor and the exhaust/power turbine system. The exhaust stream then turn through 90 degrees to exit the engine in a radial direction through twin exhaust ducts, which form a V-shape in elevation. An important design feature of the Model 250 engine is its modular construction which greatly simplifies maintenance and repair activity. Also the unique reverse-flow design provides for ease of hot section maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one <b>shaft</b> is short (<b>stub</b> <b>shaft)</b> with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{nowhere near}} as {{successful}} as the Pratt & Whitney JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a very advanced engine for its time (late 50's). Like the JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a turbofan derived from a turbojet. General Electric's approach {{was to take the}} single spool CJ805-3 turbojet and incorporate an aft fan/turbine system into the exhaust system. Each turbine blade {{was an integral part of}} a blucket, the outboard section of which was a fan rotor blade. Running freely on a <b>stub</b> <b>shaft,</b> a series of bluckets, mounted on a disc, made up the aft rotor assembly. The efflux from the turbojet expanded through the (inner) turbine annulus. thus providing power directly to the fan blades located in the outer annulus. A full-length cowl, an annular exhaust system and a bucket thrust-reverser were fitted for the Convair 990. A relatively short fan cowl and thrust reverser [...] was used to demonstrate the engine on the Sud Aviation Caravelle. The CJ805-23, if chosen, would have replaced the Rolls-Royce Avon. Rolls-Royce quickly built and tested an aft-fan demonstrator Avon to compete with the greater thrust and lower sfc of the CJ805-23. In the end the Caravelle was re-engined with the P&W JT8D turbofan.|$|R
