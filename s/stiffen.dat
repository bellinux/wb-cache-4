5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully <b>stiffen</b> the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E

The load bearing capability and crack growth characteristic of both types of the <b>stiffened</b> panels having same configuration subjected to distributed tensile load is examined in this paper. A fourteen-stringer <b>stiffened</b> panel is analyzed for a central skin crack propagating towards the adjacent stringers. Stress intensity factors and fatigue crack propagation rates of both types of the <b>stiffened</b> panels are then compared. The analysis results show that integral <b>stiffening</b> causes higher stress intensity factor than conventional <b>stiffened</b> panel as the crack tip passes through the stringer and the integrally <b>stiffened</b> panel has less load bearing capability than the riveted <b>stiffened</b> panel...|$|R

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland.

These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they <b>stiffen</b> their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E

40|$|The {{deflection}} of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer Reinforced Concrete (GFRP RC) {{is often}} the governing criterion for design. The lack of fundamental research particularly on the tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of GFRP RC has hindered both the development of fundamental equations to predict deflection {{and the use of}} nonlinear Finite Element (FE) analysis for predicting the structural behaviour of GFRP RC. This thesis investigates the tension <b>stiffening</b> effect of GFRP RC in an effort to improve the predictability of GFRP RC deformation behaviour. The study adopts a holistic approach for tension <b>stiffening</b> which considers the bond as the building block for tension <b>stiffening</b> modelling and tension <b>stiffening</b> as being a macroscopic representation of bond modelling. In this study tension <b>stiffening</b> is experimentally evaluated first against more generic variables like concrete strength, reinforcement ratio and bar diameter. This is followed by a detailed study on bond between concrete and GFRP which results {{in the development of a}} strain distribution function to represent bond between cracks. This formed the basis for the development of a comprehensive model to analyse the tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of direct tension tests. After evaluating the tension <b>stiffening</b> test results against existing code-based formulations, the CEB-FIP model is recalibrated to represent the tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of GFRP RC, thereby providing a simplified means to evaluate tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of GFRP RC. The successful implementation of the tension <b>stiffening</b> model is demonstrated through the prediction of deflection of flexural elements using a general nonlinear FE analysis package (ABAQUS) that uses the smeared crack approach to model the reinforced concrete behaviour.

30|$|<b>Stiffened</b> {{plates are}} {{extensively}} used in various engineering structures. The technique of <b>stiffening</b> a plate by providing beams is rather common {{and it also}} gives higher value of strength to weight ratio of the structure. This has also made the structure more attractive in practice. Further, these structures are frequently subjected to dynamic loading in their service life. Hence, the dynamic behaviour of <b>stiffened</b> plates is of much interest to the structural engineers. The resonance may occur due to undesirable vibrations due to which the <b>stiffened</b> structure may have sudden failure. It is, therefore, important to know the natural frequencies of these structures accurately. Hence, an in-depth study of free vibration behaviour of these <b>stiffened</b> plates is required to exploit their use. On the other hand, the designers have limited scope and also face difficulty in obtaining the natural frequencies of <b>stiffened</b> plates with conventional techniques. It is also tedious for designers to obtain natural frequencies of the <b>stiffened</b> plates employing numerical tools like finite element method (FEM)/finite difference method (FDM)/other approximate methods. Therefore, a user friendly design chart {{should be available to}} the designers for easy and immediate calculation of natural frequencies of <b>stiffened</b> plates of different dimensions.|$|R

By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped {{that the presence of}} his son amongst the troops would <b>stiffen</b> their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing.

The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} French troops helped <b>stiffen</b> {{resistance}} to the English, who abandoned Haddington in September 1549 and, {{after the fall of}} Protector Somerset in England, withdrew from Scotland completely. From 1554, Marie of Guise formally took over the regency, maintaining a difficult position, partly by giving limited toleration to Protestant dissent and attempting to diffuse resentment over the continued presence of French troops. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came to the throne of England in 1558, the English party and the Protestants found their positions aligned and asked for English military support to expel the French. The arrival of English troops, and particularly the English fleet, in 1560, led to the besieging of the French forces in Leith, which fell in July. By this point Mary of Guise had died and French and English troops both withdrew under the Treaty of Edinburgh, leaving the young queen in France, but pro-English and Protestant parties in the ascendant.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough most {{thin walled}} {{cylinders}} under external pressure are <b>stiffened</b> by rings {{with the same}} dimension, {{it is believed that}} the combination of large and small <b>stiffening</b> rings is helpful to the lightweight design of structures. In this paper, eigenvalue buckling analysis has been done to study the buckling pattern (BP) and critical pressure Pcr of thin walled cylinders with the combination of large and small <b>stiffening</b> rings. It is found that there is a map of buckling patterns for different ring combinations. Three BPs appear as buckling of cylinder together with both large and small <b>stiffening</b> rings (BP-I), buckling of cylinder together with small <b>stiffening</b> rings but without large <b>stiffening</b> rings (BP-II), and finally, buckling of cylinder without both large and small <b>stiffening</b> rings (BP-III). In the region of BP-I and BP-II, values of Pcr increase with the size of large and small ring, but remain constant in the region of BP-III. And it indicates a remarkable optimization space for the design of <b>stiffening</b> rings. The large ring location and sizes of both large and small rings are optimized for lightweight design of the example cylinder, which yields a reasonable result satisfying the stability requirement under external pressure...|$|R
40|$|Building codes {{consider}} the tension <b>stiffening</b> when calculating the crack {{width of the}} flexural members. A simple analytical procedure is proposed for the determination of forces, stresses and strains acting on a reinforced concrete section subjected to flexure considering the concrete contribution in tension up to tensile concrete strain corresponding to the cracking strength of concrete. This analytical method gives the minimum value (lower bound) of tension <b>stiffening.</b> Also, a commercial Finite Element Program (ABAQUS 2007) was used to perform non-linear analysis in order to evaluate the total contribution of the tensioned concrete in carrying loads which may be considered as the upper bound of tension <b>stiffening.</b> In addition, a comparison is carried out among the different codes using four reinforced concrete rectangular models to compare and evaluate the tension <b>stiffening</b> with proposed analytical lower bound tension <b>stiffening</b> and upper bound as obtained by ABAQUS. The models include different percentages of flexural steel ratio. The comparison revealed that the codes’ equations always consider tension <b>stiffening</b> lying between lower and upper bound of tension <b>stiffening</b> proposed in this study.
