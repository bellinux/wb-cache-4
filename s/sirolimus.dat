5|$|Combination therapy {{experiments}} with <b>sirolimus</b> (rapamycin) and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating Akt-positive lymphomas in mice.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiproliferative}} {{effects of}} <b>sirolimus</b> {{may have a}} role in treating cancer. When dosed appropriately, <b>sirolimus</b> can enhance the immune response to tumor targeting or otherwise promote tumor regression in clinical trials. <b>Sirolimus</b> seems to lower the cancer risk in some transplant patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme {{and is a}} {{substrate}} of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump; hence, inhibitors {{of either}} protein may increase <b>sirolimus</b> concentrations in blood plasma, whereas inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease <b>sirolimus</b> concentrations in blood plasma.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} therapy of doxorubicin and <b>sirolimus</b> {{has been shown}} to drive AKT-positive lymphomas into remission in mice. Akt signalling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. <b>Sirolimus</b> blocks Akt signalling and the cells lose their resistance to the chemotherapy. Bcl-2-positive lymphomas were completely resistant to the therapy; eIF4E-expressing lymphomas are not sensitive to <b>sirolimus.</b>|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 2015, the FDA {{approved}} <b>sirolimus</b> {{to treat}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects {{women of childbearing}} age. This made <b>sirolimus</b> the first drug approved to treat this disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. <b>Sirolimus</b> blocks this pathway.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{advantage}} <b>sirolimus</b> {{has over}} calcineurin inhibitors is its low toxicity toward kidneys. Transplant patients maintained on calcineurin inhibitors long-term tend to develop impaired kidney function or even chronic renal failure; {{this can be}} avoided by using <b>sirolimus</b> instead. It is particularly advantageous in patients with kidney transplants for hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as this disease is likely to recur in the transplanted kidney if a calcineurin-inhibitor is used. However, on 7 October 2008, the FDA approved safety labeling revisions for <b>sirolimus</b> to warn of the risk for decreased renal function associated with its use. In 2009, the FDA notified healthcare professionals that a clinical trial conducted by Wyeth showed an increased mortality in stable liver transplant patients after switching from a calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen to <b>sirolimus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of <b>sirolimus</b> treatment of LAM were investigated in clinical trials that compared <b>sirolimus</b> treatment with a placebo group in 89 patients for 12 months. The patients were observed for 12 months after the treatment had ended. The most commonly reported side effect of <b>sirolimus</b> treatment of LAM were mouth and lip ulcers, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, sore throat, acne, chest pain, leg swelling, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, muscle pain and elevated cholesterol. Serious side effects including hypersensitivity and swelling (edema) have been observed in renal transplant patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> is {{a natural}} product and macrocyclic lactone.|$|E
25|$|The Edmonton {{protocol}} uses {{a combination}} of immunosuppressive drugs, including daclizumab (Zenapax), <b>sirolimus</b> (Rapamune) and tacrolimus (Prograf). Daclizumab is given intravenously right after the transplant and then discontinued. <b>Sirolimus</b> and tacrolimus, the two main drugs that keep the immune system from destroying the transplanted islets, must be taken for life.|$|E
25|$|According to the FDA {{prescribing}} information, <b>sirolimus</b> {{may increase}} an individual's risk for contracting skin cancers {{from exposure to}} sunlight or UV radiation, and risk of developing lymphoma. In studies, the skin cancer risk under <b>sirolimus</b> was lower than under other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and calcineurin inhibitors, and lower than under placebo.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{similarly}} named tacrolimus, <b>sirolimus</b> {{is not a}} calcineurin inhibitor, but it has {{a similar}} suppressive effect on the immune system. <b>Sirolimus</b> inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Ciclosporin and tacrolimus inhibit the secretion of IL-2, by inhibiting calcineurin.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of action}} of <b>sirolimus</b> is to bind the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) {{in a manner similar}} to tacrolimus. Unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex, which {{inhibits}} calcineurin (PP2B), the sirolimus-FKBP12 complex inhibits the mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin, rapamycin being another name for <b>sirolimus)</b> pathway by directly binding to mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in individuals}} with a known hypersensitivity to the drug.|$|E
25|$|Lung {{toxicity}} is {{a serious}} complication associated with <b>sirolimus</b> therapy, {{especially in the case}} of lung transplants. The mechanism of the interstitial pneumonitis caused by <b>sirolimus</b> and other macrolide MTOR inhibitors is unclear, and may have nothing to do with the mTOR pathway. The interstitial pneumonitis is not dose-dependent, but is more common in patients with underlying lung disease.|$|E
25|$|While <b>sirolimus</b> {{inhibition}} of mTORC1 appears {{to mediate the}} drug's benefits, it also inhibits mTORC2, which results in diabetes-like symptoms. This includes decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin. <b>Sirolimus</b> treatment may additionally {{increase the risk of}} type 2 diabetes. In mouse studies, these symptoms can be avoided through the use of alternate dosing regimens or analogs such as everolimus or temsirolimus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the prevention}} of organ transplant rejection and for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).|$|E
25|$|The {{safety of}} LAM {{treatment}} by <b>sirolimus</b> in patients younger than 18 years old {{has not been}} tested.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{warnings}} {{about the use}} of <b>sirolimus</b> in transplants, where it may increase mortality due to an increased risk of infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme {{and is a}} {{substrate}} of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. It has an elimination half-life of 57–63hours.|$|E
25|$|Individuals taking <b>sirolimus</b> are at {{increased}} risk of experiencing impaired or delayed wound healing, particularly if they have a high body mass index (i.e., a BMI of ≥30kg/m2).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> {{also shows}} promise in {{treating}} {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing <b>sirolimus</b> (Wyeth's Rapamune) and everolimus (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Facial angiofibromas {{occur in}} 80% of {{patients}} with TSC, and the condition is very disfiguring. A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical <b>sirolimus</b> treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began {{during the early stages}} of the disease. <b>Sirolimus</b> treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, gel, solution, and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of perioral dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases of irritation.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} (≥20% occurrence, {{leading to a}} 11% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with <b>sirolimus</b> in clinical studies {{for the treatment of}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis are: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, stomatitis, nasopharyngitis, acne, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, and myalgia.|$|E
25|$|While <b>sirolimus</b> was {{considered}} {{for treatment of}} LAM, it received orphan product designation status because LAM is a rare condition. Development for the product was partially supported by the FDA Orphan Products Grants Program, which provides grants for clinical studies on safety and/or effectiveness of products for use in rare diseases or conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of <b>sirolimus</b> {{into the blood}} stream from the intestine varies widely between patients, with some patients having up to eight times more exposure than others for the same dose. Drug levels are, therefore, taken to make sure patients get the right dose for their condition. This is determined by taking a blood sample before the next dose, which gives the trough level. However, good correlation is noted between trough concentration levels and drug exposure, known as area under the concentration-time curve, for both <b>sirolimus</b> (SRL) and tacrolimus (TAC) (SRL: r2 = 0.83; TAC: r2 = 0.82), so only one level need be taken to know its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. PK profiles of SRL and of TAC are unaltered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected drug exposure of TAC correlates with SRL (r2 = 0.8), so patients have similar bioavailability of both.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} (≥30% occurrence, {{leading to a}} 5% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with <b>sirolimus</b> in clinical studies of organ rejection prophylaxis in individuals with kidney transplants include: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, constipation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, increased creatinine, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> {{can also}} be used alone, or in {{conjunction}} with a calcineurin inhibitor (such as tacrolimus), and/or mycophenolate mofetil, to provide steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Impaired wound healing and thrombocytopenia are a possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in immunosuppression has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|It is {{produced}} by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1972 by Surendra Nath Sehgal and colleagues from samples of Streptomyces hygroscopicus found on Easter Island. The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui. <b>Sirolimus</b> was initially developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties due to its ability to inhibit mTOR. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer (formerly by Wyeth).|$|E
500|$|... 2002: Treatment with rapamycin (<b>sirolimus)</b> {{was found}} to shrink tumours in the Eker rat (TSC2) and mouse (TSC1) models of {{tuberous}} sclerosis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{adverse effects}} occurred in 3–20% of individuals taking <b>sirolimus</b> for organ rejection prophylaxis following a kidney transplant: ...|$|E
2500|$|... mTOR {{has also}} been called FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein), RAFT (rapamycin and FKBP target), RAPT1, or SEP. [...] The earlier names FRAP and RAFT were coined to {{reflect the fact that}} <b>sirolimus</b> must bind FKBP12 first, and only the FKBP12-sirolimus complex can bind mTOR. However, mTOR is now the widely {{accepted}} name, since Tor was first discovered via genetic and molecular studies of sirolimus-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that identified FKBP12, Tor1, and Tor2 as the targets of <b>sirolimus</b> and provided robust support that the FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits Tor1 and Tor2.|$|E
2500|$|... mTOR, {{specifically}} mTOR1, {{was first}} shown to important in ageing in 2003, {{in a study}} on worms; <b>sirolimus</b> was shown to inhibit and slow aging in worms, yeast, and flies, and then to improve the condition of mouse models of various diseases of aging. [...] <b>Sirolimus</b> was first shown to extend lifespan in wild-type mice in a study published by NIH investigators in 2009; the studies have been replicated in mice of many different genetic backgrounds. The results are further supported by the finding that genetically modified mice with impaired mTOR1 signalling live longer. The known adverse effects caused by <b>sirolimus</b> and marketed analogs, especially the increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression, as well as dose-dependent metabolic impairment, make it unlikely that this could become a widely used anti-aging agent. Among the strategies that have been explored to minimize such side effects are intermittent treatment regimens and combinations with insulin sentitizers (rosiglitazone) or antidiabetics (metformin) to prevent metabolic dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{antiproliferative}} {{effect of}} <b>sirolimus</b> {{has also been}} {{used in conjunction with}} coronary stents to prevent restenosis in coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty. [...] The <b>sirolimus</b> is formulated in a polymer coating that affords controlled release through the healing period following coronary intervention. [...] Several large clinical studies have demonstrated lower restenosis rates in patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stents when compared to bare-metal stents, resulting in fewer repeat procedures. A sirolimus-eluting coronary stent was marketed by Cordis, a division of Johnson & Johnson, under the tradename Cypher. [...] However, this kind of stent may also increase the risk of vascular thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{is mainly}} to inhibit neointimal growth (due to {{proliferation}} of smooth muscle cells) which would cause restenosis. [...] Much of the neointimal hyperplasia {{seems to be}} caused by inflammation. Hence, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative drugs are used. <b>Sirolimus,</b> paclitaxel, and everolimus were previously used for other medical applications and have been included in licensed DES.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sirolimus</b> {{was shown}} to inhibit the {{progression}} of dermal Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with renal transplants. [...] Other mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus (CCI-779) or everolimus (RAD001), are being tested for use in cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme and mantle cell lymphoma. However, these drugs have {{a higher rate of}} fatal adverse events in cancer patients than control drugs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sirolimus,</b> {{also known}} as rapamycin, is a {{macrolide}} compound that is used [...] to coat coronary stents, prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat a rare lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis. It has immunosuppressant functions in humans and is especially useful in preventing the rejection of kidney transplants. It inhibits activation of T cells and B cells by reducing the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2).|$|E
