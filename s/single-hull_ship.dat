50|$|The <b>single-hull</b> <b>ship</b> was {{completed}} in February 1989 by Valmet of Turku, Finland, and measures 97.35 m by 14.23 m with a gross tonnage of 2,968 tonnes. The ship is registered in Murmansk and is operated by the Murmansk Shipping Company.|$|E
5000|$|The Hy-Con {{design was}} {{developed}} to increase safety and the efficiency of cargo handling on bulkers. [...] This design starts as a standard <b>single-hulled</b> <b>ship.</b> [...] Then, the forward and aft holds are built up to double-hull structures.|$|R
5000|$|Patuxent, {{the fifteenth}} ship of the Henry J. Kaiser class, was laid down at Avondale Shipyard, Inc., at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 16 October 1991 and {{launched}} on 23 July 1994. She {{was the first}} of three ships in the class of eighteen—the other two being [...] and —to be built with a double hull required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Hull separation is 6 ft at the sides and 6 ft at the bottom, reducing her liquid cargo capacity by about [...] from that of the 15 <b>single-hull</b> <b>ships</b> in the class.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} have embraced oil tankers {{with a double}} hull because it strengthens the hull of ships, reducing the likelihood of oil disasters in low-impact collisions and groundings over <b>single-hull</b> <b>ships.</b> They {{reduce the likelihood of}} leaks occurring at low speed impacts in port areas when the ship is under pilotage. Research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision, preventing oil from seeping out. However, for smaller tankers, U shaped tanks might be susceptible to [...] "free flooding" [...] across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank. Salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water. In the 1960s, collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated, due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents.|$|R
50|$|Although double-hulled tankers {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of ships grazing rocks and creating holes in the hull, a double hull does not protect against major, high-energy collisions or groundings which cause the majority of oil pollution, despite this being the reason that the double hull was mandated by United States legislation. Double-hulled tankers, if poorly designed, constructed, maintained and operated can be as problematic, if not more problematic than their single-hulled counterparts. Double-hulled tankers have a more complex design and structure than their single-hulled counterparts, which means that they require more maintenance and care in operating, which if not subject to responsible monitoring and policing, may cause problems. Double hulls often result in the weight of the hull increasing by at least 20%, and because the steel weight of doubled-hulled tanks should not be greater than that of <b>single-hulled</b> <b>ships,</b> the individual hull walls are typically thinner and theoretically less resistant to wear. Double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart. Due to the air space between the hulls, there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull, increasing the risk of an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|Hong Lam Marine {{was founded}} in 1981 by Lim Teck Cheng, the current Chief Executive, {{together}} with his father. Business began with two wooden barges chartered to Esso Singapore, which transported fuel within the Singapore port. In the same year, Esso Singapore awarded two more contracts to Hong Lam Marine. Hong Lam Marine expanded their fleet with the purchase of two steel bunker tankers from Japan. These were then modified to meet the local regulations for operating in the Port of Singapore. In 1989, the company started building <b>single-hull</b> <b>ships</b> of 4,000 - 6,000 DWT. [...] In 2005, Hong Lam Marine ventured into the building of double-hull vessels. In 2007, the company went on to form a joint-venture company with the Japanese trading house, Toyota Tsusho, to build and own two 22,000 DWT tankers, SPECTRUM and SPLENDOUR. These two world’s largest purpose-built bunker tankers were delivered in 2009. Hong Lam Marine works closely with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to implement green shipping practices. The company commissioned a series of 10 diesel-electric bunkering vessels, which were delivered between 2011 and 2013. They are also the first company in Singapore to use MPA approved mass flow meters on its vessels for bunker delivery. According to Mr Lim, these mass flow meters “can supply 15 to 20% more fuel” for their vessels and also save up to 3 hours per bunker delivery. The company is also involved in a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to investigate the operational feasibility of liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering in Singapore in collaboration with 22 industry partners. Currently, the use of LNG in Singapore is hindered by the high operating costs required to purchase and transport it, {{as well as a}} lack of demand for it.|$|R
50|$|Algonova was a single-hulled {{oil tanker}} laid down on 23 July 1968 by Collingwood Shipbuilding of Collingwood, Ontario, as a crane vessel for Yankcanuck Steamships Ltd. of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. In September 1968 the company {{decided not to}} build the ship, and the hull was sold to Texaco Canada Ltd., and {{redesigned}} as a <b>single-hulled</b> tanker. The <b>ship</b> was launched on 10 April 1969, and named Texaco Chief. She served on the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence River, and on the eastern coast of Canada. In 1986 the Texaco Chief was renamed A.G. Farquharson, after the former president and CEO of Texaco Canada, until laid up at Halifax in October 1996.|$|R
