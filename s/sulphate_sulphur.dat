The evaluation of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>sulphur</b> indicated a negative correlation for the coals and a positive correlation for the coal-shales. This means that as <b>sulphate</b> <b>sulphur</b> increases for the coals, the spontaneous combustion liability decreases, while for the coal-shales as the pyritic sulphur increases, the oxidation potential {{is more likely to}} increase in general. This is in-line with the study reported on coal by Singh and Demirbilek (1987).

Fusarium wilt of bananas (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense) (Foc), also known as Panama disease, has been a devastating disease throughout the world. So far, no fungicides or cultural measures have been found that control Foc sufficiently. The aim of this research was to assess whether organic-based farming systems were more resilient than inorganic farming systems to soil borne diseases, in particular Fusarium wilts. A survey was conducted comparing five organic and five conventional banana plantations at paired sites in north Queensland, Australia. Soil samples were collected and analysed for chemical, physical and biological soil health indicators. Disease development of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici in tomatoes and Foc in bananas were studied in pot trials to pursue clues for identifying Fusarium suppressive soil traits. Organic soils from the survey showed higher microbial activity and lower disease symptom expression (both with tomatoes and bananas) than conventional soils. In the survey, nematode diversity and soil sulphate content were recurring indicators in all experiments showing close correlations to pathogen growth, disease expression and plant health. Organic soils were lower in plant-parasitic nematodes and <b>sulphate</b> <b>sulphur</b> levels and higher in nematode diversity, labile soil C and microbial indicators. Soil conduciveness or suppression of Foc appeared to be largely governed by competition for carbon.

40|$|Abstract: Sulphur oxidizers are {{involved}} in oxidation of elemental sulphur to plant available <b>sulphate.</b> <b>Sulphur</b> is the key element for higher pulse production and {{plays an important role}} in the formation of proteins, vitamins and enzymes. Sulphur is a constituent of the essential amino acids cystine, cysteine and methionine. In the recent years the importance of sulphur in pulse nutrition has been well recognized because of the widespread occurrence of its deficiency in the soil world over. Majority of sulphur taken up by plant roots is in the form of sulphate (SO 4), which undergoes a series of transformation prior to its incorporation into the original compounds. The soil microbial biomass is the key driving force behind all sulphur transformations. The biomass acts as both a source and sink for inorganic sulphate. They make available sulphate from element or any reduced forms of sulphur, through oxidation process in the soil. The role of chemolithotrophic bacteria of the genus Thiobacillus in this process is usually emphasized. Use of sulphur oxidizers enhance the natural oxidation and speed up the production of sulphates. Key words: Sulphur Sulphur Oxidizing microorganisms Puls...|$|E

Dual isotope analysis of δ 34 S-SO 4 and δ 18 O-SO 4 is used to trace biogeochemical transformations of atmospheric sulphur through the cave system at Grotta di Ernesto in the Italian Alps and builds towards a framework for interpretation of speleothem sulphur archives which depends on overlying ecosystem dynamics and karst hydrological properties.

By means of chemical determinations it was possible to determine free taurine and taurine that could be liberated by acid hydrolysis. In the rat an appreciable amount of taurine is converted to sulphate, but it appears that the intestinal bacteria are responsible for this. Another portion of the injected taurine is found in the urine in the form of organic sulphur, at least partly as conjugated taurine. © 1957. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The Llanfair Pb–Zn–Cu veinfield consists of sporadic mineralization in Silurian sediments. Fluid inclusion data from both veinfields indicate mineralization took place from CaCl₂-bearing brines, up to 26 wt % NaCl equivalent, between 125 and 190 °C with cooler (< 100 °C), more dilute fluids associated with later thrusting at Llanrwst. Sulphur at both veinfields was derived during the main phases of sulphide precipitation from the host rocks, with paragenetically late sulphides and <b>sulphates</b> deriving <b>sulphur</b> from ³⁴S-enriched surface waters. Carbon and oxygen isotopic data on vein carbonates shows that both deposits formed from waters that had undergone extensive water–rock interaction. Carbon was derived from at least two sources: marine carbonate dominated at Llanfair, whereas organic matter in the host rocks was more significant at Llanrwst. These data indicate that the veins formed from evolved brines which migrated along fault systems to the loci of deposition during a phase of extensional tectonics in late Devonian to Tournasian times...|$|R
