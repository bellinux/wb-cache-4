50|$|Monitoring of {{population}} changes through genetic means {{can be done}} retrospectively, through analysis of 'historical' DNA recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It {{can also be used}} as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations. Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. heterozygosity and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for Beringian bison, Galapagos tortoise, houting, Atlantic salmon, northern pike, New Zealand snapper, steelhead trout, greater prairie chicken, Mauritius kestrel and Hector's dolphin and is the subject of many ongoing studies, including Danish and <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> trout populations. Measuring absolute population changes (e.g. effective population size (Ne)) can be carried out by measuring changes in population allele frequencies (‘Ftemporal’) or levels of linkage disequilibrium over time (‘LDNe’), while changing patterns of gene flow between populations can also be monitored by estimating differences in allele frequencies between populations over time. Subjects of such studies include grizzly bears, cod, red deer, Leopard frogs and Barrel Medic.|$|E

40|$|For society, {{there is}} a {{constant}} need for scientifically based information to successfully manage bear populations. In Sweden, the brown bear (Ursus arctos) population is increasing and expanding after that successful conservation measures was employed during the 20 th century. Two important issues in management are to understand how bears use their habitat, at different spatial- and temporal scales, and to estimate size and trend of the population at various scales. The central aim of this thesis was to provide management authorities with knowledge and methods for monitoring and managing the <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> bear population. We have used radio-marked bears to determine the use of habitats at two different spatial- and temporal scales. To obtain population trends we used bear observations and to estimate population size we identified individual bears from DNA in collected scats and calculated the total number of bears with Capture-Mark-Recapture methods. These data were obtained with the help of volunteers and covered, in principle, the total bear range in Sweden. We estimate the <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> bear population to 3, 298 (2, 968 - 3, 667) individuals in 2008, and the yearly increase in the bear population to be 4. 5 % during the period 1998 to 2007. We show that bears prefer forest habitat in rugged terrain > 10 km from towns or resorts. Bears located within 10 km of human settlements are mainly younger individuals. Bears habitat selection differs between active and resting periods. They are more active during nocturnal and crepuscular hours and rest during the daytime. My results provide management authorities with information on distribution, population size and trends of the brown bear population in Sweden, at national as well as regional scales. We have introduced and verified a method for monitoring bears, the Large Carnivore Observation Index, based on effort corrected observations of bears during hunting. We show that the bears use habitats that are further away from humans and that their use differs between sex and age groups. I recommend that the monitoring and management of bears should be carried out from an adaptive management perspective, where methods and the effects of different decisions should be continuously evaluated. For the future management of bears in Sweden, managers need good information about bear ecology, demography, and the perception of the human dimension...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{investigate}} if <b>Swedish</b> rodents, <b>brown</b> rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus musculus), wood mouse (Apodemus spp) and water vole (Arvicola terrestris) captured in pig herds and in urban areas, constitute a reservoir for pathogenic Leptospira spp. Under Swedish conditions leptospirosis gives rise to reproductive disorders in pigs and symptoms of flu in humans. It has long been established that rodents are chronic carriers of pathogenic leptospires in their kidneys, and can spread the bacteria with urine. The old nomenclature of serovoars is still in use, but a new system of genetic classification has developed and today the genus Leptospira contains 17 species. There are several diagnostic test developed for leptospirosis. Serology and culture are used today in Sweden by Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and Swedish National Veterinary Institute. Over the last decade the molecular method Polymeras Chain Reaction (PCR) has been developed. PCR was chosen as the method to detect leptospires, {{for the first time in}} Sweden. The problem was that the PCR-system available could not separate between patogenic species. Two conventional PCR-systems, Lig PCR and Adia PCR, developed to detect pathogenic Leptospira spp. in kidney tissue were used. The material were 116 kidneys from Swedish rodents that were captured in 11 places, between the years 2005 to 2007, during an ongoing PhD projekt. Adia PCR detected 15 samples that most likely were pathogenic leptospires. PCR-products were sent for sequencing to Swedish National Veterinary Institute. Sequencing of PCR-products comfirmed that nine of the 15 DNA sequences belonged to potentially pathogenic Leptospira spp. The DNA sequences were most similar to L. borgpetersenii, L. weili and L. interrogans serovar copenhageni. Among remaining PCR-products a part of the ninth house mice chromosome was identified. Lig PCR did not work satisfactorily, and no samples were sent in to Swedish National Veterinary Institute for DNA sequencing. It was concluded that Adia PCR could detect pathogenic leptospires in kidney tissue of rodents and the Swedish rodents constitute a reservoir for pathogenic Leptospira spp...|$|R

40|$|Sunlight induces {{photochemical}} mineralisation of chromophoric dissolved {{organic matter}} (CDOM) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in inland waters, resulting in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions to the atmosphere. Photochemical rate modelling is used to determine sunlight-induced CO 2 emissions on large spatial and temporal scales. A sensitive model parameter is the wavelength-specific photochemical CDOM reactivity, the apparent quantum yield (AQY). However, the temporal variability of AQY spectra within inland waters remains poorly constrained. Here, we studied a boreal brown water lake in Sweden. We measured AQY spectra for photochemical DIC production monthly between June and November 2014 and parameterised a photochemical rate model. The total AQY between 280 and 600  nm increased about 3 -fold during the open-water period, likely due to a high rainfall event with consecutive mixing in autumn that increased availability of highly photoreactive CDOM. However, the variability in AQY spectra over time was much smaller than previously reported variability in AQY spectra between lakes. Yet, using either the AQY spectrum from the least or from the most photoreactive water sample resulted in a 5 -fold difference in simulated annual DIC photoproduction (2012 – 2014), with 2. 0  ±  0. 1 and 10. 3  ±  0. 7 g C m − 2  yr − 1, respectively. This corresponded to 1 and 8  % of the mean CO 2 emissions measured from this lake. We conclude that (1) it may be recommendable to conduct repeated AQY measurements throughout the season for more accurate simulation of annual photochemical DIC production in lakes and (2), in agreement with previous studies, direct CDOM photomineralisation makes only a minor contribution to mean CO 2 emissions from <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> water lakes...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{and consequences of}} introgression can inform about numerous evolutionary processes. Biologists have therefore long been interested in hybridization. One challenge, however, lies {{in the identification of}} nonadmixed genotypes that can serve as a baseline for accurate quantification of admixture. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Cahill et al. (2015) analyse a genomic data set of 28 polar bears, eight brown bears and one American black bear. Polar bear alleles are found to be introgressed into brown bears not only near a previously identified admixture zone on the Alaskan Admiralty, Baranof and Chichagof (ABC) Islands, but also far into the North American mainland. Elegantly contrasting admixture levels at autosomal and X chromosomal markers, Cahill and colleagues infer that male-biased dispersal has spread these introgressed alleles away from the Late Pleistocene contact zone. Compared to a previous study on the ABC Island population in which an Alaskan brown bear served as a putatively admixture-free reference, Cahill et al. (2015) utilize a newly sequenced <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> bear as admixture baseline. This approach reveals that brown bears have been impacted by introgression from polar bears to a larger extent (up to 8. 8 % of their genome), than previously known, including the bear that had previously served as admixture baseline. No evidence for introgression of brown bear into polar bear is found, which the authors argue could be a consequence of selection. Besides adding new exciting pieces to the puzzle of polar/brown bear evolutionary history, the study by Cahill and colleagues highlights that wildlife genomics is moving from analysing single genomes towards a landscape genomics approach...|$|E
40|$|Species {{with small}} {{population}} sizes {{needs to be}} managed {{in order to prevent}} extinction in the long-term. Genetic monitoring of wild populations over time is important since it enables for management strategies that takes the genetic status into consideration. Non-invasive sampling techniques are useful for rare and elusive species since the organic material containing DNA is collected through, for example, hair, saliva or feces without handling or even disturbing the animal. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a molecular marker that amplifies well when using low quality or degraded DNA, as often is the case with non-invasive samples. The aim of this thesis is to genetically characterize the previously bottlenecked southern <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> bear population within the counties of Dalarna and Gävleborg. Non-invasively sampled DNA from 434 bears was genotyped on a recently developed SNP-panel with 96 loci. The analyses of genetic diversity resulted in an observed heterozygosity that was close to the heterozygosity expected under ideal conditions (Ho 0. 45, He 0. 49). There were no indications of inbreeding (mean FIS - 0. 0014). Seven males from a different population were identified and these males are likely first generation immigrants from the northern population, which indicates gene flow. No population structure within the southern population was found, possibly due to the high mobility among males. The effective population size (Ne) was 74. 4 and the Ne/NC ratio 0. 094. According to recommendations of Ne, which are set to prevent inbreeding and to ensure long-term viability, the Ne of the southern population could increase. Further gene flow from the northern population will likely enable this scenario...|$|E

Aim of {{the paper}} – to assess {{correlation}} of the quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk with non pregnancy period duration in Ltd Experimental Farm of Upytė. Objectives {{of the paper}}: to evaluate level of feeding cows of the farm. To estimate quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk during the period until insemination. To assess quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk, non pregnancy period duration and insemination index of different species and lactations cows. To assess correlation of the quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk with non pregnancy period duration. The research {{was carried out in}} district of Panevėžys - in Ltd Experimental Farm of Upytė. For the research were chosen cows of such species as <b>Swedish</b> with reddish <b>brown</b> spots, Lithuanian reddish brown and dairy Simmentals, which were calving in the period of 2008. 11. 01 – 2009. 01. 31. The level of feeding cows was analysed during the pasturable period and period in cow-house. Data of the milk composition and quality were recorded during the whole non pregancy period, but not longer than until 2009. 06. 30. More attention was paid to the number of somatic cells – thousands/ml, quantity of lactose – percents and urea mg percents, also to correlation of these indexes with non pregnancy period. Conclusions: 1. In Ltd Experimental Farm of Upytė feeding of dairy cows is well-balanced. 2. The best according to insemination index in farm are Lithuanian reddish brown and dairy Simmentals (insemination indexes 1, 7) and 5 and 6 lactation cows (1, 3; 1, 5), and cows of Simmentals species were more quickly inseminated (93 days) also 3; 4; 5 lactations cows respectively (94; 85; 78 days). 3. The composition of milk significantly changes and becomes worse, when cows are not inseminated until the 5 th month of lactation. Increases the number of somatic cells from 273 to 919 thousands/ml, decreases quantity of lactation in milk from 4, 79 to 4, 36 %, quantity of urea significantly changes just on the 7 th month of lactation. 4. Quantity of urea of the experimental group according to species is 13, 5 – 23 mg%, and from 1 to 6 lactation fluctuates from 10, 50 to 22, 5 mg%, that shows, that in respect of albumen the feeding ration of these cows is well-balanced. Just in particular cases quantity of nitrogen can be too low or quantity of energy can be too big. 5. Quantity of lactose according to species is 4, 36 – 4, 88 %, and from 1 to 6 lactation 4, 36 – 5, 01 %. In some cases concentration of lactose is lower, that is why can be stated that few cows can have mastitis or their ration is not fully balanced. However, most of cows according to this index are within the mark. 6. Quantity of somatic cells of the experimental group according to species is 104 – 1102 thousands/ml, and from 1 to 6 lactation – from 64 to 1168 thousands/ml. The number of somatic cells in this herd does not depend on the month of non pregnancy period, breed or lactation. This index shows that in farm quite a few cows have mastitis. 7. Connection between non pregnancy period duration and quantity of lactose according to species is different: LŽ (translator’s note: abbreviation of Lithuanian reddish brown) – weakly positive (0, 334), and SP (translator’s note: abbreviation of dairy Simmentals) – medium positive (0, 416). According to the number of lactations weakly positive connection was 1 and 3 lactations cows (0, 035; 0, 080), and strong positive – 6 (1). According to the number of insemination correlation was weakly positive, when cows were inseminated 1, 2 and 3 times (0, 071; 0, 014; 0, 231), other correlations were negative. 8. Correlation of non pregnancy period duration and the number of somatic cells of SP breed is weakly positive (0, 202), of other species - negative, of 1 and 3 lactations – weakly positive (0, 037 and 0, 242), and of 5 lactation is strong positive connection (0, 992). According to the number of insemination 1, 2 and 3 correlation of inseminations was weak (0, 011; 0, 013 and 0, 034) and other correlations were negative. 9. Correlation between non pregnancy period duration and quantity of urea according to species is: LŽ medium positive (0, 422), LŽ and SP weakly positive (0, 012; 0, 031). According to the number of lactations weak connection was of 1, 2 and 4 lactations (0, 375; 0, 161; 0, 359), and according 6 lactation strong positive (1). According to the number of inseminations was weak positive connection after 1, 2 and 4 inseminations (0, 049; 0, 201; 0, 254). In other cases correlation was negative...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dietary {{prevention}} {{strategies are}} increasingly recognized {{as essential to}} combat the current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the potential prebiotic effects of indigestible carbohydrates in <b>Swedish</b> <b>brown</b> beans (Phaseolus vulgaris var. nanus) in relation to cardiometabolic risk markers and appetite regulating hormones. METHODS: Brown beans, or white wheat bread (WWB, reference product) were provided as evening meals to 16 healthy young adults in a randomised crossover design. Glucose, insulin, appetite regulatory hormones, GLP- 1, GLP- 2, appetite sensations, and markers of inflammation were measured at a following standardised breakfast, that is at 11 to 14 h post the evening meals. Additionally, colonic fermentation activity was estimated from measurement of plasma short chain fatty acids (SCFA, including also branched chain fatty acids) and breath hydrogen (H 2) excretion. RESULTS: An evening meal of brown beans, in comparison with WWB, lowered blood glucose (- 15 %, p< 0. 01) - and insulin (- 16 %, p< 0. 05) responses, increased satiety hormones (PYY 51 %, p< 0. 001), suppressed hunger hormones (ghrelin - 14 %, p< 0. 05), and hunger sensations (- 15 %, p =  0. 05), increased GLP- 2 concentrations (8. 4 %, p< 0. 05) and suppressed inflammatory markers (IL- 6 - 35 %, and IL- 18 - 8. 3 %, p< 0. 05) at a subsequent standardised breakfast. Breath H 2 (141 %, p< 0. 01), propionate (16 %, p< 0. 05), and isobutyrate (18 %, P< 0. 001) were significantly increased after brown beans compared to after WWB, indicating a higher colonic fermentative activity after brown beans. CONCLUSIONS: An evening meal with brown beans beneficially affected important measures of cardiometabolic risk and appetite regulatory hormones, within a time frame of 11 - 14 h, in comparison to a WWB evening meal. Concentrations of plasma SCFA and H 2 were increased, indicating involvement of colonic fermentation. Indigestible colonic substrates from brown beans may provide a preventive tool in relation to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01706042...|$|E
