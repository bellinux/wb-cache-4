40|$|Quantum {{transition}} {{points in}} the J -Q model [...] -the test bed of the deconfined critical point theory [...] -and the SU(2) -symmetric discrete noncompact CP^ 1 representation of the deconfined critical action are directly compared by the flowgram method.

40|$|AbstractExperimentally {{determined}} diffusion constants {{are often}} used to elucidate the size and oligomeric state of membrane proteins and domains.

For small radii R, we find that the lateral diffusion coefficient D is well described by the Saffman-Delbrück relation, which predicts a logarithmic decrease of D with R. However, beyond a critical radius Rc ≈hηm/(2 ηc) (h, bilayer thickness; ηm/c, viscosity of the membrane/surrounding solvent) we <b>observe</b> <b>significant</b> <b>deviations</b> and the emergence of an asymptotic scaling D ∼ 1 /R 2.

40|$|The FUT 2 (Secretor) gene is {{responsible}} for the presence of ABO histo-blood group antigens on the gastrointestinal mucosa and in bodily secretions. Individuals lacking a functional copy of FUT 2 are known as “nonsecretors” and display an array of differences in susceptibility to infection and disease, including Crohn disease. To determine whether variation in resident microbial communities with respect to FUT 2 genotype is a potential factor contributing to susceptibility, we performed 454 -based community profiling of the intestinal microbiota in a panel of healthy subjects and Crohn disease patients and determined their genotype for the primary nonsecretor allele in Caucasian populations, W 143 X (G 428 A). Consistent with previous studies, we <b>observe</b> <b>significant</b> <b>deviations</b> in the microbial communities of individuals with Crohn disease. Furthermore, the FUT 2 genotype explains substantial differences in community composition, diversity, and structure, and we identified several bacterial species displaying disease-by-genotype associations.

40|$|We present {{detailed}} {{comparisons between}} the results of embedded atom model (EAM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations on defected Ni alloy systems. We find that the EAM interatomic potentials reproduce low-temperature structural properties in both the gamma and gamma' phases, and yield accurate atomic forces in bulk-like configurations even at temperatures as high as similar to 1200 K. However, they fail to describe more complex chemical bonding, in configurations including defects such as vacancies or dislocations, for which we <b>observe</b> <b>significant</b> <b>deviations</b> between the EAM and DFT forces, suggesting that derived properties such as (free) energy barriers to vacancy migration and dislocation glide may also be inaccurate. Testing against full DFT calculations further reveals that these deviations have a local character, and are typically severe only {{up to the first}} or second neighbours of the defect. This suggests that a QM/MM approach can be used to accurately reproduce QM observables, fully exploiting the EAM potential efficiency in the MM zone. This approach could be easily extended to ternary systems for which developing a reliable and fully transferable EAM parameterisation would be extremely challenging e. g. Ni alloy model systems with a W or Re-containing QM zone...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{continuum}} {{models that}} describe {{the formation of}} patterns on surfaces of targets undergoing ion-beam sputtering, are based on Sigmund's formula, which describes the spatial distribution of the energy deposited by the ion. For small angles of incidence and amorphous or polycrystalline materials, this description seems to be suitable, and leads to the classic BH morphological theory [R. M. Bradley and J. M. E.

Low-energy {{experiments}} {{which would}} identify departures from the Standard Model (SM) rely {{either on the}} unexpected observation of symmetry breaking, such as of CP or B, or on an <b>observed</b> <b>significant</b> <b>deviation</b> from a precise SM prediction. We discuss examples of each search strategy, and show that low-energy experiments can open windows on physics far beyond accessible collider energies.

Context Direct searches for new physics at the LHC has yielded the discovery of the Higgs boson [1, 2], but no unanticipated, new particles – as yet. On the other hand, observational cosmology, analyzed in the framework of general relativity, tells us that only 4 % of the energy density of the universe is in the matter we know [3], so that the SM of particle physics, successful though it is, is probably incomplete. The lack of evidence thus far for new physics and interactions through collider studies at the highest energies motivates broader thinking in the search for new physics. For example, the missing matter could be weakly coupled, making it more challenging if not impossible to identify in a collider environment...|$|R
