50|$|The Papagayo jet, also {{referred}} to as the Papagayo Wind or the Papagayo Wind Jet, are strong intermittent winds that blow approximately 70 km north of the Gulf of Papagayo, after which they are named. The jet winds travel southwest from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean through a pass in the Cordillera mountains at Lake Nicaragua. The jet follows the same path as the northeast trade winds in this region; however, due to a unique combination of <b>synoptic</b> scale <b>meteorology</b> and orographic phenomena, the jet winds can reach much greater speeds than their trade wind counterparts. That is to say, the winds occur when cold high-pressure systems from the North American continent meet warm moist air over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, generating winds that are then funneled through a mountain pass in the Cordillera. The Papagayo jet is also not unique to this region. There are two other breaks in the Cordillera where this same phenomenon occurs, one at the Chivela Pass in México and another at the Panama Canal, producing the Tehuano (Tehuantepecer) and the Panama jets respectively.|$|R

Median values for NO, NO(x), O 3, and CO from the flights made over the ocean in the region of 5. 8 - 7. 6 km were 10 parts per trillion by volume (pptv), 32 pptv, 46 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), and 120 ppbv, respectively. Corresponding values from two flights made over the continent at similar altitudes were 16 pptv, 38 pptv, 42 ppbv, and 111 ppbv.

No significant overall correlation occurred between NO(x) and CO for the ocean data.

Utilizing the valuable and unprecedented SAMUM 2006 field campaign dust dataset in North Africa, we assess the performance and discuss the limitations of a state-of-the-art dust regional model to reproduce the complex dust patterns encountered during the campaign. The DREAM model operational forecast version during SAMUM 2006 (OPER) and an updated model version (RESH) are run and compared. RESH reproduces the general Saharan dust pattern, whereas OPER shows limitations to quantitatively reproduce dust optical properties over sources and after long range transport simultaneously. Dust transport in RESH with enhanced number size bin distribution is proven to be more efficient and adequate. The modeled vertical extinction coefficient captures fairly well lidar observations. While particle number size distribution is consistently reproduced at surface level, we find significant underestimation in the middle troposphere for large particles.

40|$|The Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon 2014 / 5) Experiment {{was carried}} out in the environs of Manaus, Brazil, in the central region of the Amazon basin during two years from 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2015. The {{experiment}} focused on the complex interactions among vegetation, atmospheric chemistry, and aerosol production {{on the one hand and}} their connections to aerosols, clouds, and precipitation on the other. The objective was to understand and quantify these linked processes, first under natural conditions to obtain a baseline and second when altered by the effects of human activities. To this end, the pollution plume from the Manaus metropolis, superimposed on the background conditions of the central Amazon basin, served as a natural laboratory. The present paper, as the Introduction to the GoAmazon 2014 / 5 Special Issue, presents the context and motivation of the GoAmazon 2014 / 5 Experiment. The nine research sites, including the characteristics and instrumentation of each site, are presented. The sites range from time point zero (T 0) upwind of the pollution, to T 1 in the midst of the pollution, to T 2 just downwind of the pollution, to T 3 furthest downwind of the pollution (70 km). In addition to the ground sites, a low-altitude G- 159 Gulfstream I (G 1) observed the atmospheric boundary layer and low clouds, and a high-altitude Gulfstream G 550 (HALO) operated in the free troposphere. During the two-year experiment, two Intensive Operating Periods (IOP 1 and IOP 2) also took place that included additional specialized research instrumentation at the ground sites as well as flights of the two aircraft. GoAmazon 2014 / 5 IOP 1 {{was carried out}} from 1 February to 31 March 2014 in the wet season. GoAmazon 2014 / 5 IOP 2 was conducted from 15 August to 15 October 2014 in the dry season. The G 1 aircraft flew during both IOP 1 and IOP 2, and the HALO aircraft flew during IOP 2. In the context of the Amazon basin, the two IOPs also correspond to the clean and biomass burning seasons, respectively. The Manaus plume is present year round, and it is transported by prevailing northeasterly and easterly winds in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. This Introduction also organizes information relevant to many papers in the Special Issue. Information is provided on the vehicle fleet, power plants, and industrial activities of Manaus.

Levels of nitrogen oxides and O 3 were strongly modulated by the <b>synoptic</b> scale <b>meteorology</b> that brought air from various source regions to the site. Industrial pollution from the Great Lakes region of the U. S. and Canada appears to be a major source for periodic elevation of NO(x), and NO(y) and O 3. We find that NO/NO 2 ratios at this site at midday were approximately 50 % those expected from a simple photochemical steady state between NO(x) and O 3, in contrast to our earlier results from the ABLE 3 A tundra site. The difference between the taiga and tundra sites is likely due to much larger emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons (particularly isoprene) from the taiga vegetation. Hydrocarbon photooxidation leads to relatively rapid production of peroxy radicals, which convert NO to NO 2, at the taiga site. Ratios of NO(x) to NO(y) were typically 2 - 3 times higher in the PBL during ABLE 3 B than during ABLE 3 A.

The relation between particle concentration and AOT is rather weak during IMPACT. The simulated day-to-day variability of AOT follows synoptic scale advection of humidity rather than particle concentration.

The lectures are the result of ten years of research on the dynamical behaviour of the Planetary Boundary Layer that has a direct effect on the air quality and on the boundary layer parameterization schemes used in local, regional and global models. It is divided into two main parts. The first, which comprises three chapters, presents the structure of the Planetary Boundary Layer with emphasis in the region adjacent to the ground, the <b>Synoptic</b> Mesoscale <b>Meteorology</b> and Coastal Air Pollution and complex terrain Meteorology. The second, Chaps. 5 to 8, discusses on the planetary boundary-layer (PBL) parameterization that is a key issue for the definition of initial wind flow fields in diagnostic models, meteorological prognostic models (RAMS, MM 5, WRF), the estimation of the lower atmospheric turbulence parameters by remote sensing technique, the fundamentals of Air Pollution Mathematical Modelling, an analytical solution for the nonstationary two-dimensional advection–diffusion equation to simulate the pollutant dispersion in the planetary boundary layer (the GILTT solution of the advection–diffusion equation), the selected case studies of complex terrain meteorology and an estimation of the lower atmospheric turbulence parameters by remote sensing tools.

40|$|Southern Africa {{produces}} {{almost a}} third of the Earth's biomass burning (BB) aerosol particles. Particles lofted into the mid-troposphere are transported westward over the South-East (SE) Atlantic, home to one of the three permanent subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The SE Atlantic stratocumulus deck interacts with the dense layers of BB aerosols that initially overlay the cloud deck, but later subside and may mix into the clouds. These interactions include adjustments to aerosol-induced solar heating and microphysical effects, and their global representation in climate models remains one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of future climate. Hence, new observations over the SE Atlantic have significant implications for global climate change scenarios. Our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions in the SE Atlantic is hindered both by the lack of knowledge on aerosol and cloud properties, as well as the lack of knowledge about detailed physical processes involved. Most notably, we are missing knowledge on the absorptive and cloud nucleating properties of aerosols, including their vertical distribution relative to clouds, on the locations and degree of aerosol mixing into clouds, on the processes that govern cloud property adjustments, and on the importance of aerosol effects on clouds relative to co-varying <b>synoptic</b> scale <b>meteorology.</b> We discuss the current knowledge of aerosol and cloud property distributions based on satellite observations and sparse suborbital sampling.

40|$|Shift meteorologists are {{supposed}} to understand the weather situation and {{have to make a}} forecast that is consistent with the actual situation. To get grip on the weather situation in most of the weather rooms the forecaster starts an analysis of the weather by looking at surface observations. Drawing surface charts is the second activity and hereby isobars, (Norwegian) fronts and troughs are the most important features. Filling in weather symbols will be the finishing touch of the surface chart. To get a more 3 D-picture of the weather radiosondes are looked at and every 6 hours higher level isolines are analysed. Since the middle of 2000 the approach at the KNMI is different and from this time satellite images are the starting point for forecasters to analyse the weather situation. The meteorologists try to recognise the cloud patterns in these images by using the knowledge of conceptual models. Cloud tops and cloud patterns seen by satellites, are the fingerprints of physical processes in the troposphere. Conceptual models describe the physical processes trough clouds phenomena, physical parameters, life cycles and weather events. The thinking of a forecaster in terms of conceptual models is a way to get a 3 D- or even 4 D-mental weather picture. (See in this respect: “Manual of <b>Synoptic</b> satellite <b>Meteorology</b> Conceptual Models ” supported by EUMETSAT). A Regional Satrep (abbreviation of Satellite report) is a satellite image overlayed with the names of the conceptual models.

40|$|Number-size {{distribution}} {{is one of}} the important microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosols that influence aerosol life cycle, aerosol-radiation interaction as well as aerosol-cloud interactions. Making use of one-yearlong measurements of aerosol particle number-size distributions (PNSD) over a broad size spectrum similar to 15 - 15, 000 nm) from a tropical coastal semi-urban location-Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram), the size characteristics, their seasonality and response to mesoscale and <b>synoptic</b> scale <b>meteorology</b> are examined. While the accumulation mode contributed mostly to the annual mean concentration, ultrafine particles (having diameter < 100 nm) contributed as much as 45 % to the total concentration, and thus constitute a strong reservoir, that would add to the larger particles through size transformation. The size distributions were, in general, bimodal with well-defined modes in the accumulation and coarse regimes, with mode diameters lying in the range 141 to 167 nm and 1150 to 1760 nm respectively, in different seasons. Despite the contribution of the coarse sized particles to the total number concentration being meager, they contributed significantly to the surface area and volume, especially during transport of marine air mass highlighting the role of synoptic air mass changes. Significant diurnal variation occurred in the number concentrations, geometric mean diameters, which is mostly attributed to the dynamics of the local coastal atmospheric boundary layer and the effect of mesoscale land/sea breeze circulation. Bursts of ultrafine particles (UFP) occurred quite frequently, apparently during periods of land-sea breeze transitions, caused by the strong mixing of precursor-rich urban air mass with the cleaner marine air mass; the resulting turbulence along with boundary layer dynamics aiding the nucleation. These ex-situ particles were observed at the surface due to the transport associated with boundary layer dynamics. The particle growth rates from ultrafine particles to accumulation sizes varied between 1 and 15 nm h(- 1), with mean growth rate of similar to 7. 35 +/- 2. 93 nm h(- 1). (c) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|High {{temperatures}} {{during spring}} {{have long been}} recognised {{as one of the}} weather risks for grain farmers. Recent events such as 12 October 2004 and 15 November 2009 raise questions about the likelihood of this risk and the consequences on grain crops. This paper reports on work first characterising the likelihood of heat events by considering <b>meteorology</b> (<b>synoptic</b> weather patterns) and climatology (analysis of climate records) and second studying the consequences by reproducing these heat events in the field using a purpose built chamber. Spring heat events in the SA grains belt are due to a northerly flow of air associated with a passing high pressure system to the east of the region and an approaching cold front to the west. Analysing the climatology of heat events in the context of crop phenology typical of a region, it is apparent that a medium rainfall region like Roseworthy (flowering later in October) may be at a greater risk of heat events than a much warmer, low rainfall location like Minnipa (flowering in September). Preliminary results indicate that a relatively inexpensive chamber can be used to impose a single day heat event in the field (maximum temperature of 35 °C). The chamber was able to heat by up to 12 °C above ambient. Bronya Alexander, Peter Hayman, Glenn McDonald, A. S. M. Hasim Talukder and Gurjeet Gil...|$|R
