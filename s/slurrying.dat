30|$|The <b>slurrying</b> {{properties}} {{are most important}} for industrial application of the slurry fuels. The solid concentration of the slurry fuels should be increased {{as much as possible}} to reach a high level of heat value and thus ensure efficient gasification and combustion, but the viscosity should be low enough to facilitate preparation, pumping and atomization of the slurry.

40|$|AbstractPhosphate mining {{represents}} a significant {{industry in the}} State of Florida. In view of the great demand for resources, the industry is in a strong public focus. In mining and processing, the phosphate ore mining process alone is responsible for about 45 % of the total energy consumption. Slurry pumping to the processing plant accounts for {{one third of the}} energy consumption during mining. Various {{studies have shown that the}} optimum solid-water ratio for slurry pumping is approximately 60 wt%. It is difficult to achieve this value with the technology of hydraulic monitor operations applied at the present time. For operational reasons, more precise control of the solids content is almost impossible. The Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research Institute therefore funded this research project. Disaggregation and <b>slurrying</b> of phosphate matrix represents the principle problem in pumping slurry. It is still state of the art to use draglines in phosphate ore mining. The dragline dumps the phosphate matrix in the pit, where it is slurried with the help of hydraulic monitors and conveyed to a static grizzly. The grizzly is used to scalp larger rocks and roots. It requires cleaning at regular intervals. A suction pump situated behind the grizzly, pumps the slurry to the processing plant. The average solids content of the slurry is only about 25 - 35 wt%, and varies widely depending on the material properties. Under this investigation, four different types of phosphate ore were examined. In the first step the phosphate ores were analyzed and characterized. Then two different methods were evaluated to improve the <b>slurrying</b> process. First, tests were performed using high pressure water jets of up to 200 bars in order to disaggregate the phosphate matrix. In principle, it is possible to achieve disaggregation and <b>slurrying</b> using this technology, but the necessary throughput cannot be acquired due to the long retention time required. Second, selective crushing tests were carried out using a wet hammer mill. This technology was able to achieve a solids content of 60 wt%, while still producing a high degree of disaggregation of the clay agglomerates, without destroying the valuable material. A preliminary design for a mobile disaggregation and <b>slurrying</b> unit was developed on the basis of these test results. The new technology could reduce water demand from 2. 16 m 3 /t to only 0. 58 m 3 /t and energy consumption from 1. 32 kWh/t to 0. 36 kWh/t...|$|E

This work assessed the impact of the soil:water ratio on measurement of catabolic induction for ¹⁴C-isoproturon, ¹⁴C-diazinon and ¹⁴C-cypermethrin. <b>Slurrying</b> (1 : 1 and 1 : 3 soil:water) with agitation resulted in significantly higher rates and extents of mineralisation than the non-slurried system (P ≤ 0. 05; 1 : 0 soil:water), except for the mineralisation of ¹⁴C-diazinon where the greatest extent of mineralisation occurred in non-slurried soil. <b>Slurrying</b> without agitation resulted in the significant lower mineralisation in all cases (P ≤ 0. 05). There was a significant interaction between the soil:water ratio and length of contact (P ≤ 0. 05).

A completely decomposed granite was reconstituted following different methods, namely, dry deposition, moist tamping, <b>slurrying</b> and reconstituting after separating fines by washing; then it was tested in compression and shearing. The test results highlight the sensitivity of the soil behaviour to the method of preparation used for reconstitution. It was found that preparation methods involving large amounts of water, such as <b>slurrying</b> (S) or reconstitution after washing the fines (F), can lead to a release of fines, with effect to change the grading and change the mineralogy. Differences between dry-deposited (D) /moist-tamped (MT) specimens and slurried (S) /washed-reconstituted (F) specimens were observed mainly in the volumetric response. Two different normal compression and critical state lines were obtained for the two main methods of preparation (D/MT and S/F). The distance between the normal compression line and critical state line is larger for the S/F specimens than for the D/MT specimens.

Calorimetric techniques have been used to study the heats of reaction. Galena surfaces are easily oxidized to lead(II) sulfate and thiosulfate, and lead(II) carbonate is found on the galena surfaces as well. DRIFT measurements have shown that solid lead(II) ethylxanthate is formed on the surfaces of oxidized galena after treatment with a dilute, 0. 2 mM, aqueous solution of potassium ethylxanthate. The amount of lead(II) ethylxanthate on the surfaces increases with increasing concentration of potassium ethylxanthate solution. A previously proposed monolayer complex has been questioned. The mechanism for the hydrophobation of oxidized galena surfaces involves: (1) fairly soluble lead(II) salts, present or formed on the galena surface, which are dissolved from the surface during <b>slurrying</b> in water, and a concentration gradient of lead(II) species formed around the galena particles; (2) small islands of solid lead(II) ethylxanthate which are formed on the galena surface in the presence of alkylxanthate ions in the aqueous phase during <b>slurrying.</b> The degree of hydrophobicity of a galena particle depends on the amount and the degree of coverage of hydrophobic compounds on its surface.

30|$|Abundant {{reports are}} {{available}} on the influence of blending methods on the co-combustion and co-gasification characteristics of petroleum coke and lignite. As lignite has a low calorific value and petroleum coke has low reactivity due to its low number of pores and alkali species, blending the two may potentially overcome their individual drawbacks by combining their advantages (Wang et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2009; Zhan et al. 2011). Extensive studies have been carried out to determine the factors that affect their rheological properties, such as additive types, temperature, and particle-size distribution (PSD), in order to obtain slurries with high-solid concentration, good fluidity, and sufficient stability against sedimentation of the solid particles (Goudoulas et al. 2010; Zhan et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2010, 2012). Some significant studies involving co-slurrying of low-rank coal and petroleum coke have been carried out. Vitolo et al.

Most efforts in the past were directed toward enhancing the slurryability of coal by mixing it with petroleum coke. However, on further examination, {{it seems likely that the}} effect of mass ratio of petroleum coke to lignite on <b>slurrying</b> properties has not been adequately investigated. For the sake of convenience, the mass ratio of petroleum coke to the total blend of petroleum coke and lignite samples has been defined as the petroleum coke-mixing proportion (α). In the present study, the effect of variable values of α on co-slurrying of petroleum coke and lignite was studied with respect to <b>slurrying</b> ability, rheological behavior, slurry stability, and the effects of increased temperature. This study aims to obtain an optimal range of α that is suitable for industrial application, that is, to simultaneously attain the highest solid concentration and stability at a given viscosity. The findings of this study are of great importance for the promotion of industrial applications of PCLS.|$|E

Changes occurring at crystal surfaces were monitored using atomic force microscopy (AFM) : • Batches of API are most commonly prepared by solution crystallisation. • With cocrystals, however, solubility differences {{can lead to the}} coformers precipitating as separate phases rather than as a cocrystal (see figure below). • As a result, the use of solution crystallisations for identifying cocrystal forming compounds, or for screening for cocrystal polymorphs, is problematic. 10 • Cocrystallisation techniques that use less solvent, such as grinding or <b>slurrying,</b> are widely used to avoid issues with coformer solubility differences.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of ammonium-N in pig <b>slurry</b> is immobilised during microbial decomposition of organic matter in the <b>slurry</b> soon after application to soil. Immobilisation and remineralisation of N influence the fertiliser value of <b>slurry</b> N {{and the amount of}} organic N that is retained in soil. We studied the immobilisation and remineralisation of 15 N-labelled pig <b>slurry</b> NH 4 -N after application in the field through three growing seasons under temperate conditions. Effects of <b>slurry</b> distribution (incorporation, injection, surface-banding), soil type and soil tillage on the plant utilisation of labelled NH 4 -N from <b>slurry</b> were studied and compared to the utilisation of 15 N-labelled mineral fertiliser. Residual N effects of the pig <b>slurry</b> in the 2 years following the application were also measured by comparing plant N uptake in plots that initially received <b>slurry</b> or only mineral fertiliser N. The initial immobilisation of <b>slurry</b> N was significantly influenced by the <b>slurry</b> distribution in soil. More N was immobilised when the <b>slurry</b> was mixed with soil, but the remineralisation rate (% crop removal of residual 15 N) in the following years was not significantly influenced by the initial <b>slurry</b> distribution. Surface-banding of <b>slurry</b> resulted in significant volatilisation losses and less residual 15 N retained in soil. After 2. 5 years the recovery of labelled N in soil wa...|$|R
40|$|Porcine {{enterovirus}} type 2 or porcine adenovirus type 3 were seeded into {{samples of}} pig <b>slurry,</b> and a bovine enterovirus was seeded into cattle <b>slurry,</b> and {{samples of the}} <b>slurry</b> were aerated in the laboratory for 21 days. The viruses were inactivated more rapidly in the aerated <b>slurry</b> than in control <b>slurry</b> which was not aerated. The difference in inactivation rate was greatest for the porcine adenovirus and least for the bovine enterovirus. Inactivation of the porcine enterovirus in aerated distilled water and in aerated, autoclaved pig <b>slurry</b> proceeded at a similar rate as in the same materials which were not aerated. Ten samples of aerated <b>slurry</b> were collected from an aeration tank which received weekly additions of raw pig <b>slurry</b> which was sampled at the same times. Each sample yielded a porcine enterovirus after concentration with the polyelectrolyte PE- 60, but in three comparative titrations the viral infectivity titre in concentrates of the raw <b>slurry</b> was at least 1000 times greater than in the aerated <b>slurry.</b> Porcine enterovirus type 2 and porcine adenovirus type 3, which were seeded into pig <b>slurry,</b> and a bovine enterovirus seeded into cattle <b>slurry,</b> were inactivated by treatment of the <b>slurry</b> with calcium hydroxide at pH 11. 5.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes from cattle <b>slurry</b> after surface {{application}} to grassland were measured under semi-controlled environmental conditions during three periods in 1991. Three types of cattle <b>slurry</b> were examined; untreated <b>slurry</b> and <b>slurries</b> treated with nitric acid (HNO 3) to pH 6. 0 and 4. 5. Treatment with HNO 3 is a proposed technique to reduce ammonia volatilization from <b>slurry</b> during storage, and {{during and after}} surface application. N 2 O flux was determined one to {{four times a day}} for 7 to 18 days after application of 0. 64 to 3. 8 kg slurry/msuperscript 2. Slurry-derived fluxes were greater from treated <b>slurries</b> than from untreated <b>slurries.</b> Cumulative N 2 O losses ranged from < 0. 2 % of the mineral M applied via untreated <b>slurry</b> to a maximum of 3. 4 % of mineral N for treated <b>slurry</b> of pH 6. 0, which was stored for one week before application. N 2 O fluxes from <b>slurry</b> of pH 6. 0 and those from <b>slurry</b> of pH 4. 5 were similar, provided that the pH- 6. 0 <b>slurry</b> was treated one hour before application. Differences between treatments with treated <b>slurry</b> and those with calcium ammonium nitrate were small; the amount of NO 3 -N applied controlled the N 2 O flux. Regular irrigation strongly increased N 2 O fluxe...|$|R
