40|$|In {{addition}} to analog-to-digital conversion, the Agilent E 1430 A addresses {{the problems of}} gain ranging, anti-aliasing protection, frequency band selection, triggering, data buffering, and multichannel synchronization. Agilent E 1430 A analog-to-digital converter module. The E 1430 A is implemented as a single-slot, C-size VXIbus module. The primary analog connections are the three BNC connectors on the front panel, which are for the analog input signal, an external clock, and an external trigger. The four <b>SMB</b> <b>connectors</b> on the front panel provide the capability of sending synchronizing signals from one VXIbus mainframe to another mainframe containing additional E 1430 A modules. The Agilent E 1430 A is a VXIbus-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module containing a high-dynamicrange, 23 -bit-resolution, 10 MSa/s (megasample-per-second) ADC, a family of octave-spaced anti-aliasing filters, a complex frequency shifter, and a 8 Mbyte FIFO buffer memory. It {{is designed to provide}} maximum performance and flexibility for capturing a bandlimited continuous analog signal in a format compatible with digital computers. According to Nyquistâ€™s sampling theorem, any signal confined to a finite frequency bandwidth can be completely represented by a sequence of discrete samples taken at a rate of at least twice the signal bandwidth. If we are interested only in a finite time segment of the analog signal, all the necessary information is contained in a finite number of these samples taken from the appropriate segment of the sequence.

30|$|There exists various coaxial RF {{connectors}} {{suitable for}} attaching an antenna. They include the N-Type, SMA, <b>SMB,</b> and SMC <b>connectors.</b> The N-Type antenna connector was however preferred to the R-SMA antenna (Reverse Sub-Miniature version A), which was considered {{earlier in the}} design process. Experience from various deployments showed that {{it is easier to}} break the R-SMA sockets. Hence, the N-Type antenna connector was used because it is more rugged. In addition, the N-Type connectors large diameter is easier to handle and its connection is simple. These design considerations were effected in the version 1.3 of the hardware in which the antenna is printed on the circuit board.|$|R
