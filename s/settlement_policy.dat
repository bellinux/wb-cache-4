As the nomadic tribes originally wove carpets mainly for their own use, their designs have maintained much of the tribal traditions. However, during the twentieth century, the nomadic lifestyle was changed to a more sedentary way either voluntarily, or by the forced <b>settlement</b> <b>policy</b> of the last Persian emperors of the Pahlavi dynasty. By 1970, {{it was observed that}} traditional weaving had almost ceased among major nomadic tribes, but in recent years, the tradition has been revived.|$|E
25|$|<b>Settlement</b> <b>policy,</b> set by {{the federal}} government, the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Hudson's Bay Company and {{associated}} land companies encouraged immigration. The key event was the decision to emulate the American Homestead Law by offering, at no cost, 160 acres of farmland to any man over 18 (or to a woman head of family) who settled there. Dramatic advertising campaigns promoted the benefits of prairie living. Potential immigrants read leaflets information painted Canada as a veritable garden of Eden, and downplayed the need for agricultural expertise. Ads in The Nor'-West Farmer by the Commissioner of Immigration implied that western land was blessed with water, wood, gold, silver, iron, copper, and cheap coal for fuel, {{all of which were}} readily at hand. Reality was far harsher, especially for the first arrivals who lived in sod houses. However eastern money poured in and by 1913, long term mortgage loans to Saskatchewan farmers had reached $65 million.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1904 and 1914, around 40,000 Jews {{settled in}} the area now known as Israel (the Second Aliyah). In 1908 the Zionist Organisation set up the Palestine Bureau (also known as the [...] "Eretz Israel Office") in Jaffa and began to adopt a {{systematic}} Jewish <b>settlement</b> <b>policy.</b> Migrants were mainly from Russia (which then included part of Poland), escaping persecution. The first Kibbutz, Degania, was founded by nine Russian socialists in 1909. In 1909 residents of Jaffa established the first entirely Hebrew-speaking city, Ahuzat Bayit (later renamed Tel Aviv). Hebrew newspapers and books were published, Hebrew schools, Jewish political parties and workers organizations were established.|$|E
2500|$|By the 13th century, {{the city}} lay in ruins. In 1278, Andronikos II Palaiologos decided to rebuild and repopulate it, {{now to be}} renamed Andronikopolis or Palaiologopolis, {{with the aim of}} forming a bulwark against Turkish {{encroachment}} in the area. The megas domestikos Michael Tarchaneiotes was given the task: he rebuilt the walls and settled 36,000 people from the surrounding regions. 13th century Byzantine <b>settlement</b> <b>policy</b> along the Meander Valley notably involved the Turkic Cumans. [...] Nevertheless, Turkish attacks resumed soon after. The city was besieged and, lacking sufficient supplies and access to water, captured by the beylik of Menteshe in 1284. The city suffered extensive destruction and part of its inhabitants were massacred. Moreover, over 20,000 inhabitants were sold off as slaves.|$|E

Finally, <b>settlement</b> <b>policy</b> guidelines drawn up between December 1947 and February 1948, designed to handle the absorption of the anticipated first million immigrants, planned for some 150 new settlements, of which about half were located in the Negev, while the remainder were sited {{along the lines of}} the UN partition map (29 November 1947) in the north and centre of the country.|$|E

Upon announcing the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians {{at a press conference}} delivered at the U.S. State Department, Livni criticized the [...] "cynicism and pessimism" [...] surrounding Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and expressed hope that the negotiators would do everything in their power to transform a [...] "spark of hope into something real and lasting." [...] In concluding remarks praised for their poignancy, she said, [...] "I believe that history is not made by cynics. It is made by realists who are not afraid to dream. And let us be these people." [...] The process collapsed in April 2014 when internal political difficulties prevented Israel from releasing a promised fourth tranche of pre-Oslo prisoners and the Palestinians reacted by acceding to several international treaties. Indyk cited Israel's <b>settlement</b> <b>policy</b> during the talks as a critical factor leading to the collapse.|$|E
2500|$|These events {{took the}} Liberal party by {{surprise}} and caused some consternation amongst them. Their initial {{view of the}} FSA had been positive—federal member for Swan and former Premier (1890–1901), Sir John Forrest, believed the movement [...] "would be of great use to the Producers, add {{to the strength of}} Liberalism and prove advantageous in every way". The FSA's first meetings were at the Liberal League's clubrooms in Perth, and its Executive was dominated by well-established families from the established farming districts around York and Beverley, epitomising the conservative values of pre-1890s Western Australian society. The Executive was staunchly opposed to the Labor party, and was concerned about the support Labor was able to attract in the newer districts, {{but at the same time}} wished for a more considered land <b>settlement</b> <b>policy</b> than the Liberals were offering, and opposed protectionism. The emergence of a three-party contest with a new Country Party remaining [...] "entirely distinct from and not allied with any other Party" [...] and representing the political interests of farmers, a compromise that both the Executive and the membership wholeheartedly supported, resulted in sharp criticism from key Liberals such as Forrest, who engaged in a two-month correspondence with Monger until April 1914 attempting to convince him to rejoin the FSA to the Liberal cause, and State opposition leader Frank Wilson. An invitation from the Liberal League for an exchange of preferences in the Legislative Council had been rejected by the Executive on the ground that [...] "our constitution does not permit the council to comply with their request".|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} use <b>settlement</b> <b>policies</b> {{to direct}} the inflow of immigrants away from immigrant dense areas. We evaluate a reform of Swedish immigration policy that featured the dispersion of refugee immigrants, but also {{a change in the}} approach to labor market integration. We focus on how immigrants fared because of the policy. The evaluation indicates that immigrants experienced substantial long run losses. The bulk of the effect stems from a common component that affected immigrants regardless of location. We interpret the common component as being related to a shift in policy focus, from labor market assimilation to income support.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was almost}} {{an article of faith}} that urbanization and capital intensive technology are the keys to development. However, many critics now maintain that the western-inspired urban-industrial model may not be applicable to developing nations and that this is {{not simply a matter of}} differing stages of development. The way in which one views these issues has important implications for human <b>settlements</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper thus examines the positive role of cities in national development, problems of strictly economic approaches to development, and the case for greater emphasis on agriculture and rural development. The final part is a critical summary of the state-of-the-art with respect to economic development and human <b>settlements</b> <b>policies</b> for developing countries...|$|R
