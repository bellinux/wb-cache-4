5|$|The ride, though indoors, {{would close}} in {{any type of}} rain. Because of leaks in the structure, water pooled in the trough, warranting a shutdown. Typically, the ride would remain shut down {{after a period of}} rain as the crew would have to cycle several trains through the circuit in order for it to dry.

5|$|On July 5, 2009, the G {{was once}} again {{extended}} south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one <b>storage</b> <b>track</b> at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having {{to wait in the}} station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} two {{high-level}} side platforms, each eight cars long; each {{is served by}} a passenger elevator and stairs. Platform A has the station's only station house, a two-story building. The two middle tracks, not next to either platform, are used by nearly all trains except the Hempstead Branch. A non-powered <b>storage</b> <b>track</b> is south of the south platform. The Queens Village Freight Yard is located {{just west of the}} station, and consists of three tracks. It is used by the LIRR for maintenance and storage, and was sporadically by LIRR freight customers before the New York and Atlantic Railway assumed freight service operations.|$|E
5000|$|Phase One of this {{railroad}} was {{a simple}} loop with a siding running to/ from the passenger station and <b>storage</b> <b>tracks,</b> trains start at the main station, run round the loop twice and then reverse back into the main station. There is approximately 2000 ft of <b>track</b> including 2 <b>storage</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R

25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic block signal system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified <b>storage</b> <b>track</b> is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E

No turnaround is available for the Boston College/Commonwealth Avenue [...] "B" [...] Branch heading inbound. Outbound, trains can reverse direction using a <b>storage</b> <b>track</b> between the two service tracks just past Kenmore (on Commonwealth Ave. at Blandford St.) {{and return to the}} subway.|$|E
2500|$|On July 10, 1905, {{the outer}} South Ferry {{platform}} {{was the first}} of the two platforms to open and was an extension of the original trunk line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The inner track existed when the station was built, but only as a <b>storage</b> <b>track.</b> When the [...] "H" [...] system of the IRT opened on July 1, 1918, Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line trains used the outer platform while the inner platform was opened for IRT Lexington Avenue Line trains which used the original trunk line in Lower Manhattan.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first piece}} of track was {{installed}} on September 29, 2014. Within the week, the structure for the <b>storage</b> <b>track</b> was erected. By October 22, {{the majority of the}} brake run was complete; two days later the final pieces for the section were put into place. By October 26, the base of the lift hill was installed. On December 4, the lift hill and first drop were completed. [...] On January 30, 2015, the final piece of Fury 325's track was put in place. Fury 325 completed its first test run on March 4, 2015. On March 25, 2015, Carowinds held the coaster's media day.|$|E

50|$|The ATC {{system is}} derived from Deutsche Bahn's Linienzugbeeinflussung (LZB), with {{additional}} parts added for door control and other safety systems. It works by transmitting data from the train to the interlocking station through two cables installed in the track between the rails. About {{one year after the}} U3 line has entered service, it is intended to convert U2 line to full ATC operations; however, during the first year there will be mixed traffic of ATC-run driverless DT3 units on U3 courses and conventionally run DT1 and DT2 units on U2 and U21 courses between Rathenauplatz and Rothenburger Straße. This has not been done anywhere before and therefore the ATC system had to be specifically designed and developed to allow for this mixed operation mode. All train operations will be automated, including normal operation, coupling and uncoupling of two DT3 units in <b>storage</b> <b>tracks</b> as well as at platforms, moving trains from and to <b>storage</b> <b>tracks</b> as well as reversing trains at platforms and in <b>storage</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R

Another expansion of the yard was opened in 2008. This not only increased the absolute number of trains that could be stored {{at the end of}} the line, but also reduced the number of relay movements needed to position trains at the correct platform at the Trenton Transit Center. Capacity was also increased by a flying junction so that trains no longer needed to cross all 4 mainline tracks to access their <b>storage</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Phase 4, {{which also}} has no funding commitments, will provide an {{extension}} from Houston Street to a permanent terminus, with <b>storage</b> <b>tracks,</b> at Hanover Square.
