50|$|Some mass {{casualty}} buses are specially {{adapted to}} for CBRN incidents {{and can be}} used for quarantine or isolation of contaminated patients. These vehicles may have additional features such as a <b>sealed</b> <b>bulkhead</b> to separate the driver compartment from the patient compartment. The equivalent functionality of the ambulance buses may also be built into other vehicles such as lorries, trains or other large mass transit vehicles. These mass evacuation buses are well suited to being used for quarantine and containment.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{development}} of the Cox Box by Nielsen-Kellerman, a megaphone strapped {{to the head of the}} coxswain was used to make the coxswain easier to hear, and the coxswain used an analog stop watch and rate watch - quite a handful when also trying to steer a 60' long racing shell! The use of a system with multiple speakers also became much more important when racing eight construction switched to <b>sealed</b> <b>bulkhead</b> sections to ensure the boat would remain safely buoyant even when damaged. This is because sound could no longer travel down the hull as was possible with the previous open style of construction.|$|E

[...] He planned {{to go to the}} Butte, Montana, to support union {{organizing}} after the Speculator Mine Disaster on June 8, 1917, where 168 men died. A fire began in the Granite Mountain shaft of the Spectacular Mine owned by North Butte Mining Company. <b>Sealed</b> <b>bulkheads</b> prevented men from escaping the toxic fumes in the various levels of the mine[...] Afterwards, mine workers formed a new union, Metal Mine Workers’ Union (MMWU), and were joined in a strike by other trades.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Hell Bent", the TARDIS {{gives the}} Doctor {{a brand new}} sonic {{screwdriver}}. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with high-pitched sound, green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show Class, where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver ever seen before in a cup on his desk in [...] "The Pilot." [...] Nardole uses the Fifth Doctor's version when <b>sealing</b> <b>bulkhead</b> doors to keep out Daleks later in the episode.|$|R
50|$|The chosen {{method of}} {{construction}} was the immersed tube technique. In this method, a trench is dredged {{in the bed}} of the water channel. Tunnel sections are constructed in the dry, for example in a casting basin, a fabrication yard, on a ship-lift platform or in a factory unit. The ends of the section are then temporarily <b>sealed</b> with <b>bulkheads.</b> Each tunnel section is transported to the tunnel site - usually floating, occasionally on a barge, or assisted by cranes. In the Jack Lynch Tunnel, the 610 metres long reinforced concrete immersed tube tunnel is made up of five elements, each around 122 metres long, 24.5 metres wide and 8.5 metres high. The northern approach was formed by a 120 m long floated open 'boat' section - the first of its kind.|$|R

50|$|The tunnel {{is made up}} of {{separate}} elements, each prefabricated in a manageable length, then having the ends <b>sealed</b> with <b>bulkheads</b> so they can be floated. At the same time, the corresponding parts of the path of the tunnel are prepared, with a trench {{on the bottom of the}} channel being dredged and graded to fine tolerances to support the elements. The next stage is to place the elements into place, each towed to the final location, in most cases requiring some assistance to remain buoyant. Once in position, additional weight is used to sink the element into the final location, this being a critical stage to ensure each piece is aligned correctly. After being put into place the joint between the new element and the tunnel is emptied of water then made water tight, this process continuing sequentially along the tunnel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{practice}} of impounding mine water and liquid fine waste in underground mines is increasing. Often these underground impoundments {{are created by}} constructing <b>seals</b> or <b>bulkheads</b> designed to withstand the expected hydraulic pressures. Occasionally seals are built for another purpose, usually to act as explosion-resistant ventilation barriers. Due to factors such as clogged drain pipes or unexpectedly high inflow rates, these explosion-resistant seals sometimes become subjected to hydraulic pressures. The incidence of seal failures due to inadequate design and/or construction {{is also on the}} increase. Fortunately, to date, no lives have been lost by water seal failures, but a clearer understanding of the design and construction considerations specific to water seals is vital to keep this from occurring in the future. This paper presents technical considerations for the design and construction of seals which will specifically be required to withstand hydraulic pressures in underground mines...|$|R
5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink in deeper water. Cox's salvage team <b>sealed</b> her <b>bulkheads</b> and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|R
500|$|A {{failure to}} {{adequately}} <b>seal</b> the watertight <b>bulkheads</b> aboard Grosser Kurfürst caused {{the ship to}} sink rapidly, {{in the span of}} about eight minutes. Figures for the number of fatalities vary. Erich Gröner reports that out of a crew of 500 men, 269 died in the accident, while Lawrence Sondhaus states that 276 men were killed. Many of the bodies ended up in Cheriton Road Cemetery, where there is a substantial memorial. Arthur Sullivan, on his way to Paris, witnessed the incident, writing, [...] "I saw it all– saw the unfortunate vessel slowly go over and disappear under the water in clear, bright sunshine, and the water like a calm lake. [...] It was too horrible– and then we saw all the boats moving about picking up the survivors, some so exhausted they had to be lifted on to the ships." [...] Among those rescued was the ship's captain, Count Alexander von Monts.|$|R

Out of a crew of 500 men, 269 died in the accident. König Wilhelm was also badly damaged in the collision, with severe flooding forward. König Wilhelms captain initially planned on beaching the ship to prevent it from sinking, but determined that the ship's pumps could hold the flooding to an acceptable level. The ship made for Portsmouth, where temporary repairs could be effected to allow the ship to return to Germany. In the aftermath of the collision, the German navy held a court martial for Rear Admiral Batsch, the squadron commander, and Captains Monts and Kuehne, the commanders of the two ships, along with Lieutenant Clausa, the first officer aboard Grosser Kurfürst, to investigate the sinking. [...] The damage to König Wilhelm necessitated a lengthy period of repairs from 1878 to 1882. The work was carried out at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, and also included reboilering and replacement of the ship's ram. Torpedo nets were fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1897.|$|R
40|$|The new C- 5 M engine pylon was {{subjected}} to live fire testing {{as part of the}} overall C- 5 RERP Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) program. The pylon was designed, as much as possible, to physically separate the flammable fluid carrying lines from the ignition sources. This was done by routing the flammable fluid carrying lines through the structural box while the ignition sources are routed from the engine core compartment to the wing/pylon interface through the pylon leading edge. Designed into the pylon are fire resistant materials for structure, hydraulics, fuel, and bleed air lines. The pylon also provides fluid drain lines for potential flammable fluid line fitting leaks, and ventilation in flammable fluid areas. Twelve ballistic shots were performed on this unique, orthogrid construction engine pylon. The objective was to determine the ignition and sustained fire potential by impacting two dry bays within the engine pylon. The bays of interest are Zone 2 – “Wing Interface Compartment (Fire Zone) ” and Zone 3 – “Structural Box Compartment (Flammable Fluids Zone) ”. Zone 2, enclosed by Aluminum 2219 -T 81 skin, contains fuel and hydraulic lines, an ECS duct, wire bundles, fire resistant <b>bulkhead</b> <b>seals,</b> a 5 -min – 2000 ˚F fire-resistant bulkhead, and drainage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Water {{control has}} been and remains a {{fundamentally}} important aspect of underground coal mine design and operation worldwide. Mining {{in the vicinity of}} large bodies of water, below a worked out coal seam or under confined aquifer or abandoned water logged workings is always fraught with the possibility of the danger of inundation. Inrush control is now part the Fatal Hazard Protocols which is a risk based process in all operations. In modern Australian underground coal mines, in which panel layouts have been extended and production rates are approaching 10 Mtpa, there is much focus on the control of water inflows. Flooding of mine workings can cause deterioration of roadways as was evidenced at Broadmeadow Mine in 2008 soon after the water receded due to a sudden reduction or pore water pressure, mobilisation of joints/cleats and swelling of clay layers in coal measures. Ventilation seals are primarily used in underground coal mines to isolate abandoned or worked out areas.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and <b>sealed</b> with <b>bulkheads</b> against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|R
40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the United States Coast Guard, working in collaboration with an industry consultant, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated carbon monoxide (CO) exposures on ten express cruiser boats from several manufacturers. The evaluated boats were new and included several different models. These boats had gasoline-powered propulsion engines and used gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for onboard appliances. This study was performed for the U. S. Coast Guard to better understand how CO poisonings may occur on express cruisers, identify the most hazardous conditions, and {{begin the process of}} identify controls to prevent/reduce CO exposures. Boats were evaluated while stationary and at multiple speeds, ranging from 5 to 25 miles per hour. CO concentrations were measured by multiple real-time instruments, which were placed at different locations on the boats with overhead, enclosing canopies set at various configurations. Many of the evaluated boats generated hazardous CO concentrations: peak CO concentrations often exceeded 1, 100 parts per million (ppm), while average CO concentrations were well over 100 ppm at the stern (rear). Two boats with a combined exhaust system (exhausting at the sides and underwater) had dramatically lower CO concentrations {{than any of the other}} evaluated boats (about 40 % lower). Based on the results and observations made in this report, the following major findings are summarized below: 1. When the canvas is deployed and boat is underway, CO concentrations exceeded the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) level near the swim platform for many of the evaluated boats. 2. The combination of travel at low speeds into the wind with the canvas fully deployed and no forward hatches, windows or front panels opened maximized the station wagon effect, pulling significant amounts of CO into the cockpit. 3. Different exhaust configurations have a major impact on how CO concentrations are entrained into the cockpit and other occupied areas. Accordingly, boats equipped with underwater exhaust exhibited significantly lower CO concentrations than vessels equipped with other exhaust designs. 4. CO concentrations are typically higher at the stern of the boat and become gradually lower toward the front of the boat. 5. Stationary smoke tests in the engine compartment showed satisfactory <b>sealing</b> of the <b>bulkhead</b> between the engine and adjacent compartments on all boats. Based on the preceding findings, the following recommendations are made to reduce CO concentrations on express cruisers: 1. Boat manufacturers should consider underwater exhaust that will significantly reduce CO concentrations inside the cockpit and other occupied areas compared to surface exhaust. 2. Because of the station wagon effect, some canvas configurations should not be used while boat is moving or propulsion and/or generator engines are running. 3. The possibility of adding force draft blowers into the cabin, creating a positive pressure to minimize potential CO intrusions, should be studied. Auxiliary blowers can be fitted and routed to ventilate the cockpit and swim platform areas in order to minimize negative pressure areas throughout the vessel. 4. Since properly sealed cabin doors directly influenced the CO concentration in the cabin area, door suppliers should be encouraged to develop better sealing methods and designs. 5. Windshield manufacturers should be encouraged to study the possibility of maximizing ventilation of occupied areas by improving the design of the center and side wings of the windshield. 7. Due care should be exercised when designing the powered ventilation system on the engine compartment, locating the air intake on the opposite side of the generator exhaust. Also, potentially moving the intake much farther forward on the vessel would help minimize the intake of CO exhaust into the engine compartment. 8. The development of cleaner burning engines (propulsion and generators) with catalytic converters should continue since they have the potential to greatly reduce CO concentrations to safer levels. 9. The American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) should examine their standards and emphasize ventilation problems that can lead to CO intrusions, taking a strong position against surface exhaust designs for propulsion engines.
