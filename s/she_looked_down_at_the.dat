60|$|Mr. Clark {{rose and}} stood over her, {{and after a}} vain attempt to meet his gaze <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carpet.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do {{not regard}} {{you in that}} light," [...] said Lilly, with a faint smile, and then, hesitatingly, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carpet.|$|E
6000|$|She {{placed her}} hands in one another on his shoulder, and laying her rich brown cheek against them as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire, went on thoughtfully: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his deformity, and woman-like she shivered.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her dress}} half despondently, and yet with some pride.|$|R
60|$|She {{was caught}} in a strange snare. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her hands.|$|R
6000|$|Romola on {{her side}} was not unobservant; and when the second supply of milk had been drunk, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> round-headed man, and said with mild decision-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river, gleaming {{below the}} glade in a curving silver line. [...] "Dick, {{there are such}} a lot of splendid things that we might do." ...|$|E
60|$|Estella {{looked at}} her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not {{otherwise}} disturbed; when the moment was past, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} the insolent manner which he knew so well.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{she wrote}} to {{me to say that}} if I ever felt myself hurt,' <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her young mistress, 'or found myself worried,' <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her again, 'I might go to her, and be considerately treated. I was to think of it, and could speak to her by the church. So I went there to thank her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{face for}} a moment shone. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her gown. He laughed.|$|R
60|$|Geraldine {{went upstairs}} a little thoughtfully. As she drew on her gloves, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> empty space upon her third finger. For {{a moment there}} was almost a lump in her throat.|$|E
6000|$|Charlotte turned away; but {{she stood}} there a moment. Presently <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of her dress. [...] "Does n't it seem to you, somehow, as if my scarf were too long?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|Penelope {{caught her}} breath, but went on resolutely,--"or rebuke you for {{speaking}} evil of dignities." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fan, now flat in her lap, {{and tried to}} govern her head, but it trembled, and she remained looking down. Again they let the talk stray, {{and then it was}} he who brought it back to themselves, as if it had not left them.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a half pathetic, half humorous {{twitching}} of her lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} bright eyes, and a frown {{which did not}} come easily.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew then}} {{what it was}} that she had been hoping for. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him and smiled.|$|R
60|$|Marjorie {{stood on}} her throne {{watching}} the sunset while her maids of honor packed up {{the remains of}} the banquet, and her knights prepared the chariot. All the sky was gold and purple, all the world bathed in a soft, red light, and the little girl was very happy as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> subjects who had served her so faithfully that day.|$|E
60|$|They {{left the}} room {{and closed the door}} behind them. Virginia, {{breathing}} a little quickly, crossed the room and tried the desk, but it was still fast locked. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carpet and found it undisturbed. Then she stood up, and started violently. The inner door leading into the secretaries' room was open, and her uncle was standing there upon the threshold. He smiled at her benevolently.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} so comically alarmed {{in the ring}} of his tone--as of a naughty schoolboy detected {{in a piece of}} mischief--that, propriety to the contrary notwithstanding, Elma couldn't for the life of her repress a smile. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seat where the stranger pointed, and there, sure enough, coiled up in huge folds, with his glossy head in attitude to spring at her, a great banded snake lay alert and open-eyed.|$|E
60|$|Had mamma {{discovered}} her? With a despairing {{sense of}} being caught <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her tell-tale clothes and the unslept-in bed.|$|R
6000|$|Juliette {{seemed to}} wake {{as if from}} a dream. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Anne Mie with a glance of hope, almost of joy, and whispered: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him a moment, {{and then}} she shook her head. [...] "I don't think I can promise that, father. I am excited already." ...|$|R
60|$|He was too shrewd. Turning from him, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eddying mist. For {{several years}} she had chafed at her {{surroundings}} and the restraints they laid upon her, with a restless longing for something wider and better: a freer, sunnier atmosphere where her nature could expand. At times she fancied {{there was only one}} sun which could warm it to a perfect growth, but that sun had not risen and scarcely seemed likely to do so.|$|E
60|$|She {{started to}} her feet, roused to {{a frenzy of}} rage by her own recollections. Standing at the window, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{pavement}} of the courtyard--it was far enough below to kill her instantly if she fell on it. Through the heat of her anger there crept the chill and stealthy prompting of despair. She leaned over the window-sill--she was not afraid--she might have done it, but for a trifling interruption. Somebody spoke outside.|$|E
60|$|So {{we stood}} among the shafts {{of the open}} cart-shed that faced the road. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, a little sideways, and I noticed a small black frown on her brows. She seemed to brood for a moment. Then she looked {{straight}} into my eyes, so that I blinked and wanted to turn my face aside. She was searching me for something and her look was too near. The frown was still on her keen, sallow brow.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her hands--very {{beautiful}} and well-kept hands--and sighed. This young man, with his unusual imperturbability and hateful common sense, was getting on her nerves.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them, <b>she</b> {{pulled the}} lace of her sleeves over them, but {{otherwise}} {{she did not}} heed him. She was lost in unexpressed imaginings.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her apron. [...] "I {{made this}} myself. Do you know our {{business}} is increasing wonderfully? I'm busy every moment of the day till bedtime." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at the rosy arms {{interlocked}} and arched above her head. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> delicate ferns and cryptogams at her feet. Something glittered {{at the root of the}} tree. She picked it up; it was a bracelet. She examined it carefully for cipher or inscription; there was none. She could not resist a natural desire to clasp it on her arm, and to survey it from that advantageous view-point. This absorbed her attention for some moments; and when she looked up again she beheld at a little distance Culpepper Starbottle.|$|E
60|$|The {{young girl}} {{looked up at}} the first sound of my voice, and {{verified}} me as the elderly man whom she had seen before; and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water again. I understood, and I freely forgave her. If my beard had been brown instead of grey I should have been an adventure; but to the eye of girlhood adventure can never wear a grey beard. I was truly sorry for her; I could read in the pensive droop of her averted face that I was again a disappointment.|$|E
60|$|As {{he led the}} slowly {{stepping}} horse {{along the}} quiet road, Mac could not help thinking that they looked {{a little like the}} Flight into Egypt, but he did not say so, being a reverent youth only glanced back now and then at the figure above him, for Rose had taken off her hat to keep the light from baby's eyes and sat with the sunshine turning her uncovered hair to gold as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little creature resting on the saddle before her with the sweet thoughtfulness one sees in some of Correggio's young Madonnas.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{a strange}} child, Miss Jane," [...] she said, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me; [...] "a little roving, solitary thing: {{and you are}} going to school, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tessa {{was only}} more frightened, {{understanding}} nothing. Her first conjecture settled on her basket of sweets. They wanted that, these alarming angels. Oh dear, dear! <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, {{her mind}} swayed between pity and contempt. Then pity won {{the day in}} the wayward but ever gentle heart of Valentina. She bade him rise.|$|R
