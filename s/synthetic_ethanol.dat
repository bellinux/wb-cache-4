40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} produce furfural from oil palm biomass via a biomass-derived solvent (supercritical ethanol) and catalyst (formic acid). The process is 100 % biomass-based without {{the addition of}} any <b>synthetic</b> chemicals. <b>Ethanol</b> can be produced from biomass through biochemical or thermochemical conversion processes, and formic acid is a by-product of furfural production. Hence, this proposed method is self-sustainable because both can be recycled in the process. Oil palm biomass as a feedstock can {{address the issue of}} waste from the palm oil mill industries and turn it into value-added platform chemical such as furfural. In this study, various reaction parameters were evaluated including temperature (240 - 280 ̊C), reaction time (1 - 30 min), biomass solid loading (0. 4 - 0. 8 g), and alcohol: acid ratio (1 : 1 and 1 : 2), in a high-pressure and high-temperature batch reactor. The highest furfural yield of 35. 8 % was obtained in this study, comparable to other commercial and conventional methods. Although the formation of furfural is promoted by formic acid, the reaction temperature significantly impacted the outcome. The significant role of supercritical ethanol as both solvent and reactant may explain the minimal effect of formic acid as a catalyst in the reaction. The high yield of furfural under supercritical ethanol conditions proven in this study illustrates the great potential of this production method...|$|R
50|$|Vanilla essence {{occurs in}} two forms. Real seedpod extract is an {{extremely}} complicated mixture of several hundred different compounds, including vanillin, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, furfural, hexanoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, eugenol, methyl cinnamate, and isobutyric acid. Synthetic essence consists of a solution of <b>synthetic</b> vanillin in <b>ethanol.</b> The chemical compound vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is {{a major contributor to}} the characteristic flavor and aroma of real vanilla, but hundreds of compounds contribute to a complex flavor that vanillin can only approximate. Another minor component of vanilla extract is piperonal (heliotropin). Vanillin was first isolated from vanilla pods by Gobley in 1858. By 1874, it had been obtained from glycosides of pine tree sap, temporarily causing a depression in the natural vanilla industry. Vanillin can be easily synthesized from various raw materials, but the majority of food-grade (>99% pure) vanillin is made from guaiacol. Lower priced milk chocolate, cream, cookies and other desserts often use artificial vanillin in place of natural vanilla.|$|R
40|$|Extraction {{of ethanol}} was studied from both <b>synthetic</b> <b>ethanol</b> {{solution}} and fermentation broth using supercritical CO 2 in an extraction apparatus in ranges of 313 to 333 K and 80 to 160 atmospheres, for varying extraction times. The experimental system consists mainly of four parts: a CO 2 storage system, a high-pressure liquid pump, an extractor and a product collection unit. Samples {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography. Eects of temperature, pressure, extraction time, initial ethanol concentration and consecutive solvent feeding on extraction yield were investigated. It was found that increasing the initial ethanol concentration and extraction pressure and decreasing the extraction temperature increased the extraction yield.

With the Box-Wilson experimental design method, optimum extraction conditions in a batch system for 15 % (v/v) ethanol solution were found to be 313 K, 133 atmospheres and 30 minutes.

The results of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses showed that archaeal cells, detected by the ARC 915 probe, accounted for 77 %, 84 %, and 75 % in the COD/SO 42 - ratios (3. 0, 2. 0, and 1. 6, respectively). Methanosaeta sp. was the predominant acetoclastic archaea observed by optical microscopy and FISH analyses, and confirmed by sequencing of the excised bands of the DGGE gel with a similarity of 96 %. The sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (similarity of 99 %) was verified by sequencing of the DGGE band. Others identified microorganism were similar to Shewanella sp. and Desulfitobacterium hafniense, with similarities of 95 % and 99 %, respectively.

This study aimed to select and apply malolactic bacteria for the potential production of wine. Nine isolates of malolactic bacteria were selected (from the total of 70 isolates) by considering their malolactic conversion capability in a synthetic medium without sugar. When these isolates were tested for their malolactic conversion in the <b>synthetic</b> medium containing <b>ethanol,</b> it was found that only the isolate CB 5 had the highest malolactic conversion and a good growth under 15 % ethanol condition. The CB 5 could also convert L-malic acid to L-lactic acid in higher ethanol concentration than the commercial strain Oenococcus oeni CH 35 at 20 and 25 °C. Therefore, it was considered to be the best strain for malolactic fermentation at 25 °C. The CB 5 could convert L-malic acid to L-lactic in higher concentration than O. oeni CH 35 did.

40|$|Currently, {{the ethanol}} electro-oxidation {{reaction}} has attracted considerable attention in fuel cells because of new green <b>ethanol</b> <b>synthetic</b> methods based on biomass processes that have emerged. In this study, PtFe/C and Pt/C nanoparticles were synthesized by a chemical reduction method and {{tested in the}} ethanol electro-oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic effect of the PtFe bimetallic catalyst was analyzed by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled to an electrochemical cell. X-ray diffractograms showed typical face-centered cubic structures with crystallite sizes of 3. 31 and 3. 94 for Pt/C and PtFe/C, respectively. TEM micrographs revealed nanoparticle sizes of 2 ± 0. 4 nm and 3 ± 0. 6 nm for Pt/C and PtFe/C respectively. PtFe/C exhibited a Pt 90 Fe 10 composition by both X-ray fluorescence and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. A better electrocatalytic activity as function of concentration was obtained through the incorporation of {{a small amount of}} Fe into the Pt lattice and the presence of Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + (observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). According to SERS experiments, the presence of these iron species promotes the chemisorption of ethanol, the formation of formic acid as main product and renewal of the catalytic sites, resulting in current densities that were at least three fold higher than the values obtained for the Pt/C nanocatalyst...|$|R
40|$|Various reactor configurations, {{based on}} the {{principles}} of sludge immobilization and retention and on biofilm formation can be used for the anaerobic treatment of waste water. The aims of this study were to identify the most suitable reactor system for biological sulphate reduction, to determine whether an improved sulphate reduction rate could be achieved at a decreased Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) and whether the sulphide oxidation rate would improve when the reactor systems were evaluated with and without a clarifier. The results of this study indicated that the sulphate reduction rate in the packed bed reactor was 4. 9 g SO 4 /(o. d) at a feed rate of 98 o/d, feeding <b>synthetic</b> feed with <b>ethanol</b> as carbon and energy source. When feeding the same feedstock at 100 o/d, the highest sulphate reduction rate obtained was 4. 8 g SO 4 /(o. d) in a completely mixed reactor configuration, and 3. 3 g SO 4 /(o. d) in a fluidized bed reactor configuration at a feed rate of 90 o/d. Sulphate was reduced via sulphide to sulphur resulting in a low sulphide produced / sulphate removed ratio. The best sulphide removal occurred in the reactor systems with a clarifier in place as more than one third of the formed sulphide was oxidized to elemental sulphur due to air diffusion {{from the top of the}} clarifier into the reactor system...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{screening}} method {{for the evaluation}} of the major fermentation products of Saccharomyces wine yeasts was developed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and principal component factor analysis. Calibration equations for the quantification of volatile acidity, glycerol, ethanol, reducing sugar and glucose concentrations in fermented Chenin blanc and synthetic musts were derived from the Fourier transform infrared spectra of small-scale fermentations. The accuracy of quantification of volatile acidity in both Chenin blanc and synthetic must was excellent, and the standard error of prediction was 0. 07 g l⁻¹ and 0. 08 g l⁻¹, respectively. The respective standard error of prediction in Chenin blanc and <b>synthetic</b> musts for <b>ethanol</b> was 0. 32 % v/v and 0. 31 % v/v, for glycerol was 0. 38 g l⁻¹ and 0. 32 g l⁻¹, for reducing sugar in Chenin blanc must was 0. 56 g l⁻¹ and for glucose in synthetic must was 0. 39 g l⁻¹. These values were in agreement with the accuracy obtained by the respective reference methods used for the quantification of the components. The {{screening method}} was applied to quantify the fermentation products of glycerol-overproducing hybrid yeasts and commercial wine yeasts. Principal component factor analysis of the fermentation data facilitated an overall comparison of the fermentation profiles (in terms of the components tested) of the strains.

40|$|Summary Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) {{occurs when}} pregnant mothers consume alcohol, causing embryonic ethanol exposure and characteristic birth defects that include craniofacial, neural and cardiac defects. Gastrulation {{is a particularly}} sensitive developmental stage for teratogen exposure, and zebrafish is an outstanding model to study gastrulation and FASD. Epiboly (spreading blastomere cells over the yolk cell), prechordal plate migration and convergence/extension cell movements are sensitive to early ethanol exposure. Here, experiments are presented that characterize mechanisms of ethanol toxicity on epiboly and gastrulation. Epiboly mechanisms include blastomere radial intercalation cell movements and yolk cell microtubule cytoskeleton pulling the embryo to the vegetal pole. Both of these processes were disrupted by ethanol exposure. Ethanol effects on cell migration also indicated that cell adhesion was affected, which was confirmed by cell aggregation assays. E-cadherin cell adhesion molecule expression was not affected by ethanol exposure, but E-cadherin distribution, which controls epiboly and gastrulation, was changed. E-cadherin was redistributed into cytoplasmic aggregates in blastomeres and dramatically redistributed in the extraembryonic yolk cell. Gene expression microarray {{analysis was used to}} identify potential causative factors for early development defects, and expression of the cell adhesion molecule protocadherin- 18 a (pcdh 18 a), which controls epiboly, was significantly reduced in ethanol exposed embryos. Injecting pcdh 18 a <b>synthetic</b> mRNA in <b>ethanol</b> treated embryos partially rescued epiboly cell movements, including enveloping layer cell shape changes. Together, data show that epiboly and gastrulation defects induced by ethanol are multifactorial, and include yolk cell (extraembryonic tissue) microtubule cytoskeleton disruption and blastomere adhesion defects, in part caused by reduced pcdh 18 a expression...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{substrate}} removal by real activated sludge with several <b>synthetic</b> substrates (acetate, <b>ethanol,</b> glutamic acid) and wastewater (raw and filtered) was carried out. Substrate, stored compounds (polyhydroxyalkanoates, PHA and internal carbohydrates), ammonia and {{oxygen uptake rate}} (OUR) were analytically determined. Poly hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was stored when the substrate was acetate or ethanol, while no appreciable formation of storage compound was detected using glutamic acid. A low amount of PHB was also formed in tests with raw and filtered wastewater which was probably mainly due to its acetate content. As far as the sum of storage and growth (indirectly estimated through ammonia consumption) did not match the overall solids formation, other unidentified mechanisms of substrate removal were likely to occur (biosorption, accumulation and/or storage of unidentified compounds). ASM 3 and two derived models {{were used in the}} interpretation of experimental data with reference to synthetic substrates. With reference to synthetic substrates ASM 3 can well describe the experimental data only assuming a stored product formation much higher than the analytically detected one, whereas the model that assumes a parallel growth and storage on the substrate can well describe the observed stored product profile only assuming a direct contribution of growth much higher than estimated from ammonia consumption. The model that assumes an accumulation/biosorption stage as first step of substrate removal can better describe the whole experimentally observed behaviour, However as well as in ASM 3 this implies that some fraction of removed COD is still unidentified. With reference to real wastewater where the different phenomena were mixed up due to the presence of several substrates, the different models gave similar results...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an enrichment device (that is, a polyurethane bone) on the voluntary consumption of ethanol-containing gel by single-housed rats. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 5 per group) were exposed for 4 d {{to each of the}} following 3 treatments: access to a new <b>synthetic</b> bone and <b>ethanol</b> gel for 1 h daily (treatment 1); a new bone was left in the cage for 24 h, with access to ethanol gel for 1 h daily (treatment 2); and both the bone and ethanol gel remained in the cage for 24 h (treatment 3). Average alcohol consumption over 4 d was 0. 86 ± 0. 13, 0. 99 ± 0. 13, and 5. 19 ± 0. 37 g/kg {{in the absence of the}} bone for treatments 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and 1. 00 ± 0. 13, 0. 620 ± 0. 07, and 5. 55 ± 0. 38 g/kg with the bone for treatments 1, 2 and 3, respectively; none of these values differed significantly with regard to presence of the bone. During treatment 1, time spent with the synthetic bone was highest on the first 2 d, which altered the rate of ethanol consumption but not the total amount of ethanol consumed. During treatments 2 and 3, the rate and amount of ethanol consumption were comparable to basal levels. We conclude that adding an enrichment device that rats can chew and manipulate does not alter ethanol gel consumption. If used, environmental enrichment techniques should be evaluated during the research planning stages to avoid unintended alterations in the response to variables of interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the operational feasibility of nitrification and denitrification processes in a mechanically stirred sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated in batch and fed-batch mode. The reactor was equipped with a draft-tube to improve mass transfer and contained dispersed (aerobic) and granulated (anaerobic) biomass. The following reactor variables were adjusted: aeration time during the nitrification step; dissolved oxygen concentration, feed time defining batch and fed-batch phases, concentration of external carbon source used as electron donor during the denitrification stage and volumetric ammonium nitrogen load in the influent. The reactor (5 L volume) was maintained at 30 +/- 1 degrees C and treated either 1. 0 or 1. 5 L wastewater in 8 -h cycles. Ammonium nitrogen concentrations assessed were: 50 (condition 1) and 100 mgN-NH(4) (+). L(- 1) (condition 2), resulting in 29 and 67 mgN-NH(4) (+). L- 1 -d(- 1), respectively. A <b>synthetic</b> medium and <b>ethanol</b> were used as external carbon sources (ECS).

There are several alternative fuels to consider when evaluating properties such as cost of production and energy efficiency to both product and final use in a road vehicle. Thermochemical conversion via gasification and downstream synthesis of fuels as well as biochemical conversion of woody biomass to ethanol is considered in this paper. The vehicle fuels considered in this paper include methanol, <b>ethanol,</b> <b>synthetic</b> natural gas, Fischer–Tropsch diesel, dimethyl ether and synthetic gasoline from the methanol-to-gasoline process. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate all the different fuels on the same basis. The production cost of the various fuels is estimated as well as the overall investment cost. Well-to-wheel energy efficiency calculations were performed to evaluate how far a vehicle can travel on the fuel produced from a specific amount of feedstock. The production cost of the fuel as a function of distance travelled is also presented. Of the fuels considered in this study, dimethyl ether manages the highest efficiency from feedstock to travelled distance and manages to do so at the lowest cost. Ethanol produced from woody biomass is the most inefficient and expensive fuel, when considering biomass harvesting and transport, the production and road use (ignoring fuel distribution), in this study due to low yields in fuel production. Total investment cost for ethanol is considerably lower at MM$ 281 compared to the thermochemical fuels that ranges from MM$ 580 to MM$ 760.

A pair of human T-cell leukemia sister cells (CEM-C 7 - 14, GC sensitive, and CEM-Cl- 15, QC-resistant) in culture provide a system to understand the transcriptional changes associated with apoptosis. E 4 BP 4, a transcriptional repressor, is up-regulated in CEM-C 7 - 14 cells in correlation with GC-evoked apoptosis. E 4 BP 4 is either capable of repressing or activating transcription depending on its phosphorylation state and cellular context, either by binding directly to specific DNA sequences (EBPRE) or by cooperating with other transcription factors including nuclear receptors. We are examining the hypothesis that E 4 BP 4 and GR modulate each other's transcriptional activity using reporter constructs and that the phosphorylation state of E 4 BP 4 correlates with its repressive function. To evaluate GR- dependent transcription, a GRE containing luciferase reporter construct, pHHLuc, was transiently transfected in K 293 FT human embryonic kidney cells. To monitor E 4 BP 4 -dependent transcription, an EBPRE-driven luciferase reporter, pTK-EBPRE-Luc was transfected in K 293 FT cells. Cells were cotransfected with GR and/or E 4 BP 4 expressing constructs (pRShGRa and pCR 3. l- mE 4 BP 4, respectively) to study the influence of GR-E 4 BP 4 interactions on transcriptional abi lity. Cells were treated with appropriate agents, Dexamethasone (Dex, a <b>synthetic</b> GC) and <b>Ethanol,</b> for 24 hours, harvested and luciferase reporter activity was measured. To examine the dependence of the phosphorylation state of E 4 BP 4 on its repressive function, EBPRE luciferase transfected cells were treated with kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Data suggest that GR increases ligand (GC) -clependent transcriptional activity from the GRE, but E 4 BP 4 does not significantly alter GR-mediated transcription. They also suggest that E 4 BP 4 -dependent transcription represses from EBPRE, and GR may facilitate E 4 BP 4 -dependent repression from an EBPRE. Kinase inhibition, postulate to repress the phosphorylation of E 4 BP 4, increases the repressive function of E 4 BP 4.
