5|$|During {{the early}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> in-game {{dialogue}} {{was recorded in}} Los Angeles by local Asian actors, {{but much of the}} audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company. Audio design was complicated; scripting was handled in Vancouver and the recording was in Hong Kong. There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the sound design team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost translucent, and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface. The visible soft parts of the animal are of a pale subtranslucent yellow color, with different markings during distinct <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

Any future thermal power stations will also be natural gas–run, to reduce the nation's carbon footprint.|$|E

5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Christ the Lord {{was reported to}} be in the early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> in February 2012. It was reported that Chris Columbus had signed on to produce, and that Cyrus Nowrasteh had already completed the script. On November 8, 2014, during an interview with her long-time editor, Victoria Wilson, at the Chicago Humanities Festival, Rice revealed that filming had finished on the movie and was going into post-production. The film, titled The Young Messiah, was released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During the initial <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum {{is an extension of}} the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|At several <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> {{other actors}} were pursued for the film. In October 2010, Willis said that Steve Austin would reprise {{his role as}} villain Dan Paine.

In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role because he did not find it intriguing.|$|E

5|$|At {{the early}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were {{planned for the}} game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player {{to join in the}} gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA {{would be enough}} to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E

5|$|The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) {{television}} series are American superhero television shows based on characters {{that appear in}} publications by Marvel Comics.

The ABC series have averaged around 4–8 million viewers a season, with many of the MCU series receiving strong critical responses.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E
5|$|Unlike modern amphibians, many temnospondyls {{are covered}} in small, closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls {{are covered in}} rows of large ventral plates. During early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> they first have only small, rounded scales. Fossils show, as the animals grew, the scales on the undersides of their bodies {{developed}} into large, wide ventral plates. The plates overlap {{each other in a}} way that allows a wide range of flexibility. Later semiaquatic temnospondyls, such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs, have no evidence of scales. They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration, the absorption of oxygen through the skin.|$|E
