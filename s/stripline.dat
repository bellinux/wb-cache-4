5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed <b>stripline,</b> however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's <b>stripline</b> soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term <b>stripline</b> in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in <b>stripline</b> format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried <b>stripline</b> techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other <b>stripline</b> structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>stripline</b> {{directly}} coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended <b>stripline</b> and finline.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{analysis}} for coupled cylindrical <b>striplines</b> filled with multilayered dielectrics is presented that uses a variational technique in the space domain. Coupled-mode analysis is presented for {{the case of a}} pair of coupled circular arc strips arbitrarily located between cylindrical ground planes filled with multilayered dielectrics. An even- and odd-mode approach is used for the analysis of shielded cylindrically curved edge-coupled pairs of broad-side parallel strips (broad-side, edge-coupled cylindrical <b>striplines).</b> The effect of environmental changes on an otherwise planar structure is also studied by extending the present analysis to cylindrically warped coupled <b>striplines...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{responding}} to the need of the astronomical community, superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers {{have been developed to}} operate at THz frequencies. Best results are obtained by using niobium-based tunnel junctions with well-matched low-loss normal metal <b>striplines,</b> which are found to be less lossy than niobium <b>striplines</b> operated above the gap-frequency of niobium (700 GHz). Niobiumnitride tunnel junctions with a magnesiumoxide tunnel barrier, although having reasonable quality current-voltage characteristics, {{have been found to be}} unsuitable due to excess shot noise resulting from pinholes in the barrier...|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, the full-wave {{equivalent}} circuit and the discrete mode matching (DMM) method {{are applied to}} analyze dielectric waveguides and conformal <b>striplines</b> with circular and noncircular cross sections. To demonstrate the techniques, several applications will be shown. Optical fibers with different graded-index profiles are analyzed first. In this case, the variation of the index of refraction is modelled using several homogeneous layers. The second application is the computation of the propagation constants for the two fundamental modes in elliptical dielectric waveguides. Finally, conformal <b>striplines</b> with noncircular top grounds are also analyzed. The comparison of our results with commercial software and with data from other authors shows good agreement...|$|R
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as <b>stripline.</b> The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
25|$|Line {{impedance}} {{is determined}} using dielectric layer thickness, routing copper thickness and trace-width. Trace separation is also {{taken into account}} in case of differential signals. Microstrip, <b>stripline</b> or dual <b>stripline</b> can be used to route signals.|$|E
25|$|A {{dielectric}} waveguide employs a solid dielectric rod {{rather than a}} hollow pipe. An optical fibre is a dielectric guide designed to work at optical frequencies. Transmission lines such as microstrip, coplanar waveguide, <b>stripline</b> or coaxial cable may also {{be considered to be}} waveguides.|$|E
40|$|Resonator pairs {{are formed}} of {{composite}} series- or parallel-connected transmission-line elements, which are exclusively quarter-wavelength half-wave-length lines.

40|$|A {{wideband}} multilayer antenna with dual circular polarisations (CPs) is presented. The antenna {{consists of}} stacked square patches fed by <b>striplines</b> and a branch line coupler. Two orthogonally positioned H-shaped slots {{are used as}} the coupling aperture for the <b>striplines.</b> The dual-CP radiation is obtained by exciting the TM 01 and TM 10 modes of the radiating element with 90 ° phase differences. The presented dual-CP antenna has a multilayer configuration with a compact size and it is suitable {{to be applied to}} the design of array antennas. To verify this design concept, one prototype operating in the K-band is designed and fabricated. The measurement results show that the prototype has more than 13 % impedance bandwidth with good CP radiation...|$|R
25|$|Each trace {{consists}} of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching. Its resistance, determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces {{may need to be}} wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return. For microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in a planar form such as <b>stripline</b> or microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; but they {{can be used as a}} deliberate part of the circuit design, obviating the need for additional discrete components.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} form of {{directional}} coupler is a pair of coupled transmission lines. [...] They can be realised in a number of technologies including coaxial and the planar technologies (<b>stripline</b> and microstrip). [...] An implementation in <b>stripline</b> is shown in figure 4 of a quarter-wavelength (λ/4) directional coupler. [...] The power on the coupled line flows in the opposite direction to the power on the main line, hence the port arrangement {{is not the same as}} shown in figure 1, but the numbering remains the same. [...] For this reason it is sometimes called a backward coupler.Matthaei et al., pp.775–777Vizmuller, p.101 ...|$|E
500|$|Accuracy of {{coupling}} factor {{depends on the}} dimensional tolerances for the spacing of the two coupled lines. For planar printed technologies this {{comes down to the}} resolution of the printing process which determines the minimum track width that can be produced and also puts a limit on how close the lines can be placed to each other. [...] This becomes a problem when very tight coupling is required and [...] couplers often use a different design. [...] However, tightly coupled lines can be produced in air <b>stripline</b> which also permits manufacture by printed planar technology. [...] In this design the two lines are printed {{on opposite sides of the}} dielectric rather than side by side. [...] The coupling of the two lines across their width is much greater than the coupling when they are edge-on to each other.Matthaei et al., pp.585–588, 776–778 ...|$|E
50|$|A {{transmission}} {{line is the}} material medium or structure that forms {{all or part of}} a path {{from one place to another}} for directing the transmission of energy, such as electromagnetic waves or electric power transmission. Types of {{transmission line}} include wires, coaxial cables, dielectric slabs, <b>striplines,</b> optical fibers, electric power lines and waveguides.|$|R
5000|$|The {{capacitance}} of {{the load}} circuit attached to the output of op amps can reduce their bandwidth. High-frequency circuits require special design techniques such as careful separation of wires and components, guard rings, ground planes, power planes, shielding between input and output, termination of lines, and <b>striplines</b> to minimise the effects of unwanted capacitance.|$|R
40|$|Using {{conformal}} transformation, closed-form expressions for {{the even}} and odd mode impedances of inhomogeneous coupled cylindrical <b>striplines</b> are presented. It is {{shown that the}} analysis can be extended for the calculation of characteristics of coupled cylindrical microstrip lines. The analysis can also be extended to reveal the effects of warping due to environmental changes on an otherwise planar structure...|$|R
500|$|The hairpin filter {{is another}} {{structure}} that uses parallel-coupled lines. In this case, {{each pair of}} parallel-coupled lines {{is connected to the}} next pair by a short link. The [...] "U" [...] shapes so formed give rise to the name hairpin filter. In some designs the link can be longer, giving a wide hairpin with λ/4 impedance transformer action between sections. The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to <b>stripline</b> designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity. Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph {{at the top of the}} article.|$|E
500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and <b>stripline</b> {{implementations}} but does not work so well in the now popular microstrip format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] A better solution for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6. [...] This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring. [...] The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main line power making the work of the detector diode easier.Vizmuller, pp.102–103 ...|$|E

2500|$|In hollow waveguides (single conductor), TEM {{waves are}} not possible, since Maxwell's Equations will give that the {{electric}} field must then have zero divergence and zero curl and {{be equal to}} zero at boundaries, resulting in a zero field (or, equivalently, [...] with boundary conditions guaranteeing only the trivial solution). [...] This contrasts with two-conductor transmission lines used at lower frequencies; coaxial cable, parallel wire line and <b>stripline,</b> in which TEM mode is possible.

50|$|<b>Stripline</b> {{was invented}} by Robert M Barrett of the US Air Force Cambridge Research Center in the early 1950s. Air <b>stripline</b> under the {{registered}} mark <b>Stripline</b> was first manufactured commercially by Airborne Instruments Laboratory (AIL) {{in the form of}} suspended <b>stripline.</b> However, <b>stripline</b> has since become a generic term for that structure with any dielectric. The unadorned term <b>stripline</b> would now likely be assumed to be <b>stripline</b> with a solid dielectric. Early on, <b>stripline</b> was the planar technology of choice, but has now been superseded by microstrip for most general purpose applications, especially mass-produced items.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of planar technologies was driven at {{first by the}} needs of the US military, but today it can be found in household mass-produced items such as mobile phones and satellite TV receivers. [...] According to Thomas H. Lee, Harold A. Wheeler may have experimented with coplanar lines as early as the 1930s. However, the first documented planar transmission line was <b>stripline,</b> invented by Robert M. Barrett and published by Barrett and Barnes in 1951. Although publication did not occur until the 1950s, <b>stripline</b> had actually been used during World War II. According to Barrett, the first <b>stripline</b> power divider was built by V. H. and H. W. Jameison during this period. Microstrip followed soon after in 1952 due to Grieg and Englemann. However, the quality of common dielectric materials was at first not good enough for microwave circuits and consequently their use did not become widespread until the 1960s. <b>Stripline</b> and microstrip were commercial rivals. <b>Stripline</b> was the brand name of Airborne Instruments Laboratory Inc. (AIL) who made air <b>stripline.</b> Microstrip was made by ITT. Later, dielectric filled <b>stripline</b> under the brand name triplate was manufactured by Sanders Associates. <b>Stripline</b> became a generic term for dielectric filled <b>stripline</b> and air <b>stripline</b> or suspended <b>stripline</b> is now used to distinguish the original format.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stripline</b> is a strip {{conductor}} {{embedded in a}} dielectric between two ground planes. It is usually constructed as two sheets of dielectric clamped together with the <b>stripline</b> pattern {{on one side of}} one sheet. The main advantage of <b>stripline</b> over its principal rival, microstrip, is that transmission is purely in the TEM mode and is free of dispersion, at least, over the distances encountered in <b>stripline</b> applications. <b>Stripline</b> is capable of supporting TE and TM modes but these are not generally used. The main disadvantage {{is that it is not}} as easy as microstrip to incorporate discrete components. For any that are incorporated, cutouts have to be provided in the dielectric and they are not accessible once assembled.|$|E
50|$|At {{microwave}} frequencies, passive circuits such as filters, power dividers and directional couplers tend to {{be constructed}} as distributed element circuits in the same format as {{is used for the}} connecting transmission lines.
