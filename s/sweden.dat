5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war <b>Sweden</b> maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if <b>Sweden</b> believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on <b>Sweden</b> to end their neutral stance, one example being the requests to end the export of ball bearings (an important component in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that <b>Sweden</b> was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E

5|$|Charles X died in February 1660. Three months later, the Treaty of Copenhagen {{ended the}} war. Charles' son and successor, Charles XI, was only five {{when his father}} died, so a regency council—led by the queen mother Hedvig Eleonora—assumed power until he came of age. <b>Sweden</b> had come close to control over trade in the Baltic, but the war {{revealed}} the need to prevent {{the formation of a}} powerful anti-Swedish alliance that included Denmark. There were some successes in foreign policy, notably the anti-French Triple Alliance of England, <b>Sweden,</b> and the Dutch Republic. By early 1672, <b>Sweden</b> had improved its relations with France enough to form an alliance. The same year, King Louis XIV attacked the Dutch Republic, and in 1674 <b>Sweden</b> was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic's northern German allies. France promised to pay <b>Sweden</b> desperately needed war subsidies on condition that it moved in force on Brandenburg. A Swedish army of 22,000 men under Carl Gustaf Wrangel advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Swedish arms had enjoyed since the Thirty Years' War. This emboldened Sweden's enemies, and by September 1675 Denmark, the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire were at war with <b>Sweden</b> and France.|$|E

Some assimilation policies included: the ban of all books written in Danish or Norwegian, thus breaking the promise made at the Treaty of Roskilde; the use of Swedish language in the conduct of sermons; and all new priests and teachers having to come from <b>Sweden.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1590, the Russo-Swedish truce of Plussa expired and {{fighting}} resumed while the ensuing Russo-Swedish War of 1590–5 {{ended with the}} Treaty of Teusina (Tyavzino, Tyavzin), under which <b>Sweden</b> had to cede Ingria and Kexholm to Russia. The Swedish–Polish alliance began to crumble when the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III, who as son of John III of <b>Sweden</b> (died 1592) and Catherine Jagellonica, was the successor to the Swedish throne, met with resistance from a faction led by his uncle, Charles of Södermanland (later Charles IX), who claimed regency in <b>Sweden</b> for himself. <b>Sweden</b> descended into a civil war in 1597, followed by the 1598–1599 war against Sigismund, which ended with the deposition of Sigismund by the Swedish riksdag.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia {{had ended}} the Thirty Years' War, {{during which the}} Swedish Empire emerged as a major European power.

5|$|In 1949 <b>Sweden</b> {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war.

Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in <b>Sweden</b> on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when <b>Sweden</b> could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when <b>Sweden</b> was invited to join the NATO Response Force. <b>Sweden</b> have been active participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
