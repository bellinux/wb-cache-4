40|$|Is {{version of}} EUI RSCAS PP; 2015 / 01; Global Governance ProgrammeThe {{role of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) is often thought to be twofold—conducting formal rounds of {{negotiations}} and resorting to the dispute settlement system—but the third dimension of its work, which can be broadly grouped as transparency and accountability mechanisms, {{may be the most}} important. Transparency is part of the WTO’s DNA, and can be traced at least through the 1947 GATT back to a 1923 treaty <b>on</b> <b>customs</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This essential element of WTO institutional design illuminates trade policy practices to the benefit of both governments and traders. The WTO’s twentieth anniversary is an appropriate moment to describe the impressive evolution of its transparency mechanisms, assess the effectiveness of these mechanisms, and reflect on what more must be done if the WTO is to fulfill its potential as the central institution for governing the global trading system...|$|R
5000|$|Although not {{formally}} part of European Union law, several closely related treaties have been signed outside {{the framework of}} the EU and its predecessors between the member states because the EU lacked authority to act in the field. After the EU obtained such autonomy, the conventions were gradually replaced by EU instruments. Examples are the Naples Convention of 1967 (<b>on</b> <b>customs</b> <b>cooperation,</b> replaced by a new Convention in 1997 which has been ratified by all member states), Brussels Convention of 1968 (on jurisdiction in civil matters, replaced by the Brussels I Regulation in 2001), the Rome Convention on Contractual Obligations of 1980 (on choice of law in contractual matters, replaced by the Rome I Regulation in 2008 except in Denmark), and the Dublin Convention of 1990 (on asylum seekers, replaced by the Dublin II Regulation in 2003). Additionally, the Convention on the Mutual Recognition of Companies and Bodies Corporate was signed in 1968, but while 5 of the 6 then member states ratified it, it never entered into force due to the Netherlands' refusal to ratify the treaty. [...] Likewise, the Convention for the European patent for the common market of 1975, and the Agreement relating to Community patents of 1989, which amended the 1975 Convention, were signed by all member states but never entered into force due to lack of ratification by all states.|$|R
