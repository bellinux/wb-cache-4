40|$|Lighting {{is a big}} business, {{lighting}} consumes {{considerable amount}} of the electricity. These facts motivate for the search of new illumination technologies that are efficient. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes (LEDs) have huge potential to replace the traditional primary incandescent lighting sources. They are two basic types of semiconductor LEDs being explored: inorganic and organic <b>semiconductor</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes. While electroluminescence from p-n junctions was discovered {{more than a century}} ago, it is only from the 1960 s that their development has accelerated as indicated by an exponential increase of their efficiency and light output, with a doubling occurring about every 36 months, in a similar way to Moore's law in electronics. These advances are generally attributed to the parallel development of semiconductor technologies, optics and material science. Organic <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes (OLEDs) have rapidly matured during the last 30 years driven by the possibility to create large area light-emitting diodes and displays. Another driving force to specifically use semiconducting polymers is the possibility to build the OLED on conventional flexible substrates via low-cost manufacturing techniques such as printing techniques, which open the way for large area productions. This thesis deals with the demonstration and investigation of heterojunction LEDs based on p-organic semiconductor and n-ZnO nanostructures. The ZnOorganic heterojunctions are fabricated using low cost and simple solution process without the need for sophisticated vacuum equipments. Both ZnO-nanostructures and the organic materials were grown on variety of substrates (i. e. silicon, glass and plastic substrates) using low temperature methods. The growth mechanism of the ZnO nanostructures has been systematically investigated with major focus in ZnO nanorods/nanowires. Different organic semiconductor materials and device configurations are explored starting with single polymer emissive layer ending up with separate emissive and blocking layers, or even blends. Interestingly, the photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectra of the hybrid LEDs provided a broad emission band covering entirely the visible spectrum [∼ 400 -∼ 800 nm]. The hybrid <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode has a white emission attributed to ZnO intrinsic defects and impurities in combination with the electroluminescence from the conjugated polymers.

40|$|Thermo-electric heat {{exchange}} in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes (LEDs) allows these devices to emit optical power {{in excess of}} the electrical power used to drive them, with the remaining power drawn from ambient heat. In the language of semiclassical electron transport, the electrons and holes within the device absorb lattice phonons as they diffuse from their respective contacts into the LED's active region. There they undergo bimolecular radiative recombination and release energy in the form of photons. In essence the LED is acting as a thermodynamic heat pump operating between the cold reservoir of the lattice and the hot reservoir of the outgoing photon field. In this thesis we report the first known experimental evidence of an LED behaving as a heat pump. Heat pumping behavior is observed in mid-infrared LEDs at sub-thermal forward bias voltages, where electrical-to-optical power conversion at arbitrarily high efficiency is possible in the limit of low optical output power. In this regime, the basic thermal physics of an LED differs from that seen at conventional higher voltage operating points. We construct a theoretical model for entropy transport in an LED heat pump and examine its consequences both theoretically and experimentally. We use these results to propose a new design for an LED capable of very high efficiency power conversion at power densities closer to the limit imposed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We then explore the potential application of these thermo-photonic heat pumps as extremely efficient sources for low-power communication and high-temperature absorption spectroscopy. by Parthiban Santhanam.
