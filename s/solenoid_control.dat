5000|$|The {{control system}} {{included}} a pneumatic {{system and a}} solid-state electrical sequence controller packaged with spark exciters for the gas generator and the thrust chamber spark plugs, plus interconnecting electrical cabling and pneumatic lines, {{in addition to the}} flight instrumentation system. The pneumatic system consisted of a high-pressure helium gas storage tank, a regulator to reduce the pressure to a usable level, and electrical <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valves to direct the central gas to the various pneumatically controlled valves. The electrical sequence controller was a completely self-contained, solid-state system, requiring only DC power and start and stop command signals. Pre-start status of all critical engine control functions was monitored in order to provide an “engine ready" [...] signal. Upon obtaining “engine ready” and “start” signals, <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valves were energized in a precisely timed sequence to bring the engine through ignition, transition, and into main-stage operation. After shutdown, the system automatically reset for a subsequent restart.|$|E
50|$|Some {{automatic}} transmissions modified or {{designed specifically for}} drag racing may also incorporate a transbrake {{as part of a}} manual valve body. Activated by electrical <b>solenoid</b> <b>control,</b> a transbrake simultaneously engages the first and reverse gears, locking the transmission and preventing the input shaft from turning. This allows the driver of the car to raise the engine RPM against the resistance of the torque converter, then launch the car by simply releasing the transbrake switch.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} of U-matic VCRs were large devices, approximately 30 in wide, 24 in deep, and 12 in high, requiring special shelving, and had mechanical controls limited to Record, Play, Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop and Pause (with muted video on early models). Later models sported improvements such as chassis sized for EIA 19-inch rack mounting, with sliding rack rails for compressed storage in broadcast environments, <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> mechanics, jog-shuttle knob, remote controls, Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC), longitudinal time code, internal cuts-only editing controls, [...] "Slo-Mo" [...] slow-motion playback, and Dolby audio noise reduction.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the {{electronics}} side was improved greatly with the introductions of Electronic Throttle Control, electronically controlled transmissions, and transient engine and transmission controls. In addition, computing power was vastly increased. A <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valve assembly {{integrated into the}} engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed hydraulic roller lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders https://web.archive.org/web/20061029082032/http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fuel/engine.html. Unlike the first generation system, {{only half of the}} cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As anti-foaming agents in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals. Similarly engine oil viscosity and cleanliness is a factor. Use of the incorrect oil type, i.e. SAE 20W40 instead of SAE 20W50, or the failure to change engine oil at factory recommended intervals can also significantly impair system performance.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 46) The Automated Regulator Test Machine (ARTM) is {{an electronic}} test machine {{developed for the}} Southern California Gas Company to monitor the performance of self-operated diaphragm-type natural gas service regulators. The ARTM was initially designed to serve in a capacity {{similar to that of}} an existing pneumatic system and was incorporated into Southern California Gas Company quality control procedures in 1989. Up until 1994, the ARTM was the primary inspection apparatus for all standard service regulators delivering 8 inches water column (w. c.) pressure. Problems were later encountered with data entry and the existing Honeywell controller. These issues were caused by increasing digits in regulator purchase order numbers and system memory failure evident in the existing controller setup. Other problems, related to system piping, inoperable solenoid valves, and noticeable pressure losses delayed the initial repairs greatly. The objective of this project is to resolve these problems by introducing an entirely new programmable controller, human-machine interface, and software program that will allow the ARTM to perform its function seamlessly and efficiently. The ARTM system consists of various <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valves, differential pressure switches, control piping, ram operators, pressure transmitters, an electronic mass flow meter, and a PC workstation. The goal is to incorporate existing components where possible, perform a complete functionality check, and finally, implement the newly installed software and hardware to perform a series of pressure regulator tests in sequential fashion. In addition to the software and hardware integration, overall system improvements are presented. These include various upgrades in system components, including the installation of new pressure transmitters, new <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valves, a new volume bottle accumulator, and the results of a comprehensive leak assessment to eliminate pressure losses in the ARTM system. The SCADAPack 32 installation, TelePACE Ladder Logic programming, and system improvements presented are then put to the test by a series of validation tests. The regulator performance results of the ARTM are compared to those obtained by American Meter, a well known pressure regulator manufacturing company, and to the pneumatic regulator test machine (PRTM). Finally, a conclusion is presented based on the validation tests, overall perfomlance of the AR TM, and a net time savings assessment related to quality control test procedures...|$|E
30|$|Semi-active {{stiffness}} {{control devices}} are utilized {{to modify the}} stiffness and thus the natural vibration characteristics of the structure {{to which they are}} attached. The system primarily controls the stiffness of a building to establish a non-resonant condition during earthquakes. The semi-active stiffness devices are engaged or released so as to include or not include, respectively, the stiffness of the bracing system of the structure. Normally, the device is composed of a hydraulic cylinder with a normally closed <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valve inserted in the tube connecting the two cylinder chambers. The solenoid valve can either be on or off, thus opening or closing, respectively, the fluid flow path through the tube. When the valve is closed, the fluid cannot flow and effectively locks the beam to the braces below. In contrast, when the valve is open, the fluid flows freely and disengages the stiffness control devices. The system may be regarded as fail-safe {{in the sense that the}} interruption of power causes the semi-active stiffness devices to automatically engage, thus increasing the stiffness of the structure (Kamagata and Kobori 1994; Kobori et al. 1993; Yang et al. 1996).|$|E

40|$|This Dzero Engineering note {{describes}} the method {{for which the}} 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid Fast Dump and Slow Dump data are accumulated, tracked and stored. The 2 Tesla Solenoid has eleven data points {{that need to be}} tracked and then stored when a fast dump or a slow dump occur. The TI 555 (Texas Instruments) PLC(Programmable Logic Controller) which controls the DC power circuit that powers the Solenoid, also has access to all the voltage taps and other equipment in the circuit. The TI 555 constantly logs these eleven points in a rotating memory buffer. When either a fast dump(dump switch opens) or a slow dump (power supply turns off) occurs, the TI 555 organizes the respective data and will down load the data to a file on DO-CCRS 2.

See the line sketch of the system on the next page. The sketch shows the chosen line sizes, estimated lengths of piping runs, estimated steady state flow rates and pressure drops for each pipe section. The raw calculations are attached as an appendix. The estimated steady state flow rates were developed in D-Zero EN- 421, 'Helium and LN 2 Storage Requirements for the D-Zero Upgrade'. The pressure drop calculations {{take into account the}} two phase property of the fluid on the inlet piping. The outlet piping is sized for saturated vapor. These calculations supplement sizing that was done in D-Zero EN- 416, rev. 6 / 26 / 95, 'Pipe Sizing for Solenoid/VLPC Cryogenic Systems', EN- 416 only looked at the Solenoid and VLPC sections of the system. In a previous EN- 430, 'LN 2 control valve sizing', a calculation was done to address the cool down flow rate necessary. The minimum cooldown flow rate needed for a simultaneous, serial cooldown of the refrigerator, solenoid and VLPC system was 6. 4 g/s. This warm flow would get choked by an opening less than 0. 175 -inch in diameter. All the piping/tubing sizes exceed this size, so cooldown will not be a problem. The available pressure drop for the VLPC and <b>solenoid</b> <b>control</b> valves was calculated to be 5. 5 psid and 27 psid respectively. The actual delta P is expected to be larger because the conservativeness of using maximum flow rates and fluid properties that yield pressure drops on the high side...|$|E
