40|$|The genetic bi-stable <b>switch</b> (<b>toggle</b> switch) {{consists}} of two genes which repress one another through their synthesised proteins. In the stochastic bi-stable case, the toggle switch exhibits noise induced flips. Using simulation based techniques, we identified three methods for reducing the random flipping probability, namely: (i) increasing the system size, (ii) increasing the synthesis rate, and (iii) increasing the Hill coefficient. Our heat-maps showed that for large parts of parameter space the toggle switch displays extremely low noise induced flipping probability, and consequently high robustness. We also analysed the noise analytically. The area of validity of the analytical approach {{was found to be}} constrained to low Hill coefficients and high synthesis rate (both conditions within biological realistic parameters). Most importantly, we observed that increasing the synthesis rate is more efficient in reducing the noise compared to the increase in system size, for systems affected by negative feedback. © 2010 Crown...|$|E
40|$|Information {{processors}} {{process information}} {{in a variety of}} ways. The human brain processes information through a highly interconnected system of neurons and synapses, while a digital computer processes information by having a binary <b>switch</b> <b>toggle</b> on and off in response to a stream of binary bits. The “switch” is the most primitive unit of the modern computer. The better it is (faster, more energy efficient, more reliable, etc.), the more advanced is the computer hardware. Energy efficiency, however, is more important than any other attribute, not so much because energy is costly, but because too much energy dissipation prevents increasing the density of switches on a chip that is necessary to make the chip increasingly more powerful. Reducing dissipation entails radically new and often revolutionary approaches for implementing the switch. One such approach is to encode digital bit information in the spin polarization of a single electron (or ensemble of electrons) and then using two mutually antiparallel polarizations to represent the binary bits 0 and 1. Switching between the bits can be accomplished by simply flipping the polarizations of the spins, which takes very little energy. Such switches are extremely energy efficient if designed properly, but they are somewhat slower than traditional transistor-based switches and can be more error prone. This paper discusses {{the pros and cons of}} spin-based switches and introduces the reader to the most recent advancements in information processing predicated on encoding information in electron spin polarization...|$|E

40|$|The present {{paradigm}} of magnetic data storage is approaching its fundamental limits for areal storage density, {{as well as}} for speed in data processing. As a result, several magnetic recording alternatives, such as spin polarized current assisted recording, precessional <b>switching,</b> <b>toggle</b> <b>switching,</b> heat assisted recording are currently under intense research efforts. This article is aimed at providing a pertinent theoretical analysis of the spin polarized current assisted recording, emphasizing its performance with respect to minimum requirements for switching field. The first analytical derivation of the critical field curve in the presence of spin polarized currents is presented and the results are compared to the classical Stoner-Wohlfarth astroid. The analysis is performed under the framework of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation for describing the magnetization dynamics driven by external magnetic fields and spin polarized currents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Switch</b> <b>toggling</b> games such as Lights Out and the σ +-game {{are widely}} studied in {{mathematics}} and have been applied to model a variety of situations such as genetic networks and cellular automata. This paper introduces a class of toggling games where at each iteration a fixed number of switches is chosen to be toggled where the only switches changed are the switches chosen to be <b>toggled.</b> The <b>switches</b> all operate independently {{of each other and}} do not depend on the proximity or the position relative to any other switch. This paper classifies the conditions necessary and the steps taken to transition from all switches in the on state to all switches in the off state. Further results include the conditions required of the parity between the number of switches in the system and the fixed number of <b>switches</b> <b>toggled</b> at each step in order to transition from a given initial state to a specified terminal state.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Cell fate {{decisions}} during embryonic develop-ment and tumorigenesis pose a {{major research}} challenge in modern developmental and cancer biology. Binary cell fate decisions are usually regulated by gene circuits incorporating either classical <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> with two mutually inhibiting transcription factor (TF) genes or chimera <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> with a mutually inhibiting pair of microRNA (miRNA) and TF gene. These circuits can explain binary cell fate decisions. Importantly, intermediate cell types can exist during the differentiation of both stem cells and cancer cells. It {{has been shown}} that TF-TF self-activating <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> (SATS) can have coexistence of three metastable states (tristability), yet the role of chimera <b>toggle</b> <b>switches</b> in opening these additional states remains elusive. Here we present a generalized framework for both the TF-TF SATS and miRNA-TF chimera SATS, starting from the TF-promoter and miRNA-mRNA binding/unbinding dynamics. We show that the chimera SATSs can also have tristability. We demonstrate that the dynamics of miRNA-TF SATS is qualitatively {{different from that of the}} TF-TF SAT...|$|R

50|$|As {{with most}} HP calculators then and now, the HP-21 used RPN entry logic, with a four-level stack. It {{also had a}} single user-accessible memory register. As was normal at the time, memory was not {{preserved}} on power-down. A physical slider <b>switch</b> <b>toggled</b> between degrees and radians modes, which was an unusual feature. It had a 12-digit LED display, which was less than the 15 digits of the HP-35. Because of these fewer digits the HP-21 (and similar calculators such as the HP-25) could display 10-digit floating point numbers but only an 8-digit mantissa with a 2-digit exponent when scientific notation was used. A shift key provided access to functions whose legends were printed on the fronts of the tall trapezoidal keys.|$|R
