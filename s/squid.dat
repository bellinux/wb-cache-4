5|$|Many cephalopods, {{including}} at least 70 genera of <b>squid,</b> are bioluminescent. Some <b>squid</b> and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries {{in the same way}} as many <b>squid</b> use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea <b>squid</b> Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E
5|$|The bigfin reef <b>squid</b> is {{the first}} <b>squid</b> species to have been cultured {{for more than one}} generation. It is {{remarkable}} for its ability to readily adapt to being confined in tanks, {{and is one of the}} few <b>squid</b> species of which the entire life span has been observed under laboratory conditions.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for <b>squid</b> giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, <b>squid</b> axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the <b>squid</b> to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{important}} <b>squid</b> species, and are widely consumed as human food. They are usually caught in large numbers by trawling, seine fishing, or fixed net traps. In small-scale fishing, they are caught by jigging, drive-in nets, slingshot-driven spearguns, or with <b>squid</b> pots.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, <b>squid</b> such as the Caribbean reef <b>squid</b> (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef <b>squid</b> (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} <b>squid</b> {{is a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured <b>squid,</b> or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to <b>squid</b> jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a <b>squid,</b> particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool <b>squid</b> into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E

50|$|The extreme {{sensitivity}} of <b>SQUIDs</b> makes them ideal for studies in biology. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), for example, uses measurements from {{an array of}} <b>SQUIDs</b> to make inferences about neural activity inside brains. Because <b>SQUIDs</b> can operate at acquisition rates {{much higher than the}} highest temporal frequency of interest in the signals emitted by the brain (kHz), MEG achieves good temporal resolution. Another area where <b>SQUIDs</b> are used is magnetogastrography, which is concerned with recording the weak magnetic fields of the stomach. A novel application of <b>SQUIDs</b> is the magnetic marker monitoring method, which is used to trace the path of orally applied drugs. In the clinical environment <b>SQUIDs</b> are used in cardiology for magnetic field imaging (MFI), which detects the magnetic field of the heart for diagnosis and risk stratification.|$|R
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the <b>squid</b> beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the <b>squid</b> eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged <b>squid</b> may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead <b>squid</b> is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from <b>squid</b> fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after <b>squid</b> spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of <b>squid</b> that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E

5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} <b>squid.</b> The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat <b>squid,</b> but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of <b>squid,</b> such as the firefly <b>squid</b> and the midwater <b>squid.</b> The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two days of 1999, Los Angeles has become a {{dangerous}} war zone. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a <b>SQUID,</b> an illegal electronic device that records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, and when played back through a MiniDisc-like device, allows a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations. Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of <b>SQUID</b> recordings, agrees to buy the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is a friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman as she flees to the subway. Iris manages to escape on a rapid transit after her wig is pulled off by Engleman, revealing a <b>SQUID</b> recorder headset.|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of High Critical Temperature Superconductors (HTS) generated great activity to develop dc Superconductive Quantum Interference Devices (<b>SQUIDs),</b> with operating temperatures {{up to the}} boiling point of liquid nitrogen, 77. K. It was immediately apparent that small-scale devices, like <b>SQUIDs,</b> would require the development of thin-film techniques and novel Josephson junction's fabrication technologies. At present, grain-boundary junctions are {{the most widely used}} in <b>SQUIDs.</b> However, their properties are strongly affected by the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter. As a consequence the static and dynamic properties of HTS <b>SQUIDs</b> can be profoundly modified. The d-wave symmetry also offers the possibility to design π-SQUIDs showing a complementary behavior in magnetic field, compared to conventional ones, as well as dc <b>SQUIDs</b> with a double well potential. In this chapter the new Josephson phenomenology of HTS <b>SQUIDs</b> is derived, compared with experimental data available in literature, and discussed in view of future novel applications. © 2011 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef <b>squids</b> {{may be explained by}} the {{difference in}} their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef <b>squids,</b> on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the <b>squids</b> to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|R

5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as <b>squid,</b> cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant <b>squid</b> or the colossal <b>squid</b> is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales.

The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E
40|$|Forwarding {{pointers}} allow {{safe and}} efficient data migration. However, they also {{introduce a new}} source of aliasing and as a result can have a serious impact on program performance. In this paper we introduce short quasi-unique ID's (<b>squids),</b> a simple hardware mechanism for capability architectures that mitigates the problems associated with aliasing. In the common case, <b>squids</b> can be used to prove that there is no aliasing and therefore avoid any overhead. The probability of having to perform expensive dereferencing operations to check for aliasing when comparing pointers to different objects is exponentially small in the number of bits used to implement <b>squids.</b> Benchmark programs on a simulated architecture show that <b>squids</b> can, in extreme cases, reduce execution time by more than a factor of four...|$|R

40|$|Recently, it was {{observed}} that the low frequency noise of slotted <b>SQUIDs</b> is not affected when cooling them down in magnetic fields up to 0. 05 mT. This behavior is ascribed to the fact that magnetic vortices are expelled out of the narrow strips into the slots. Thus 1 /f noise by hopping of vortices in the superconducting structure is eliminated. Here we present a systematic investigation on a series of slotted high-Tc dc <b>SQUIDs.</b> The number of slots varies from zero to eight. A model is developed that provides values for the effective area and inductance of the slotted washers and the current distribution within the slotted <b>SQUIDs.</b> The model can explain the experimentally observed maximum in the effective area for four slots very well. The observed agreement with respect to the modulation depth supports the theoretical values for the inductance.
