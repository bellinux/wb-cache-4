5|$|The 747-400 Dreamlifter (originally {{called the}} 747 Large Cargo Freighter or LCF) is a Boeing-designed {{modification}} of existing 747-400s {{to a larger}} configuration to ferry 787 Dreamliner <b>sub-assemblies.</b> Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation of Taiwan was contracted to complete modifications of 747-400s into Dreamlifters in Taoyuan. The aircraft flew {{for the first time}} on September 9, 2006 in a test flight. Modification of four aircraft was completed by February 2010. The Dreamlifters have been placed into service transporting <b>sub-assemblies</b> for the 787 program to the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, for final assembly. The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers.|$|E

5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, <b>sub-assemblies</b> and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E

5|$|During November1993, {{assembly}} of the first prototype commenced at two separate locations, these being Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later on, all of the rotorcraft's <b>sub-assemblies</b> were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In the following year, the number of prototypes to be produced was reduced from four to two rotorcraft. On 25May1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4January1996, the prototype, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The first flight had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed {{by a number of}} structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its first flight, before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, the PAF and PAC {{conducted}} flight {{evaluations of}} aircraft {{fitted with a}} variant of the NRIET KLJ-10 radar developed by China's Nanjing Research Institute for Electronic Technology (NRIET), and the LETRI SD-10 active radar homing AAM. In 2005, PAC began manufacturing JF-17 components; production of <b>sub-assemblies</b> commenced on 22 January 2008. The PAF was to receive a further six pre-production aircraft in 2005, for a total of 8 out of an initial production run of 16 aircraft. Initial operating capability was to be achieved by the end of 2008. Final assembly of the JF-17 in Pakistan began on 30 June 2009; PAC expected to complete production of four to six aircraft that year. They planned to produce twelve aircraft in 2010 and fifteen to sixteen aircraft per year from 2011; this could increase to twenty-five aircraft per year. On December 29, 2015, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) announced the rollout of 16th JF-17 Thunder fighter manufactured in the calendar year 2015, taking total number of manufactured aircraft to more than 66. Later, a PAF spokesperson said that in light of the interest shown by various countries, it has been decided that production capacity of JF-17 Thunder at PAC Kamra will be expanded.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} application of damage avoidance design (DAD) philosophy to moment-resisting frames with particular emphasis on detailing of rocking interfaces. An 80 % scale three-dimensional rocking beam-column joint <b>sub-assembly</b> designed and detailed based on damage avoidance principles is constructed and tested. Incremental dynamic analysis is used for selecting ground motion records {{to be applied to}} the <b>sub-assembly</b> for conducting a multi-level seismic performance assessment (MSPA). Analyses are conducted to obtain displacement demands due to the selected near- and medium-field ground motions that represent different levels of seismic hazard. Thus, predicted displacement time histories are applied to the <b>sub-assembly</b> for conducting quasi-earthquake displacement tests. The <b>sub-assembly</b> performed well reaching drifts up to 4. 7 % with only minor spalling occurring at rocking beam interfaces and minor flexural cracks in beams. Yielding of post-tensioning threaded bars occurred, but the <b>sub-assembly</b> did not collapse. The externally attached energy dissipators provided large hysteretic dissipation during large drift cycles. The <b>sub-assembly</b> satisfied all three seismic performance requirements, thereby verifying the superior performance of the DAD philosoph...|$|R

25|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Bulletin Reports, the Russian Navy expected to buy the Mikoyan MiG-29K aircraft for Admiral Kuznetsov by 2011; this intent was confirmed by the general designer {{of one of the}} defence enterprises which produces <b>sub-assemblies</b> for these aircraft. These would replace the 19 carrier-based Su-33 fighters, a resource set to expire by 2015. Producing more Su-33s is possible but not cost-effective for such small volumes; the MiG-29K is more convenient as the Indian Navy placed an order a total for 45, reducing development and manufacture costs. India paid $730 million for the development and delivery of 16 MiG-29Ks; 24 more for the Russian Navy would cost about $1 billion.|$|E

25|$|Fairchild {{estimated}} {{orders of}} 260-460 aircraft for the US market and 600-800 Internationally. The first <b>sub-assemblies</b> were shipped to Hagerstown, Maryland in 1967 with two prototype aircraft assembled for testing. The first order was placed by West Coast Airlines of Seattle, Washington. Tests of the F.28 aircraft's short field performance {{was better than}} expected with simpler flap construction. The Trent engines performance uncertainty and delayed certification of the 228 compared to the F.28 led to the 1968 announcement that the project would be halted. Fairchild wrote off nearly $30 million in expenses in 1968 relating to canceling the F-228 program. The losses contributed to Fairchild's canceled plan to acquire Douglas aircraft. The tail sections were shipped back to Fokker and used in production F.28 aircraft.|$|E
