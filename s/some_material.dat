5|$|Written by Neil Penswick, {{this was}} a three-part futuristic thriller in which a group of {{soldiers}} are hunting down two shape-changing criminals called Butler and Swarfe. The cliffhanger to part one had Swarfe changing into a monster who then went on the hunt in part two. Penswick later adapted <b>some</b> <b>material</b> from this for his Virgin New Adventures novel The Pit in March 1993.|$|E
5|$|African-American {{history and}} culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was a {{consultant}} on the film, and researcher David Fiske, co-author of Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave, provided <b>some</b> <b>material</b> used to market the film. Nevertheless, news and magazine articles {{around the time of}} the film's release described a scholar alleging some license that Northup could have taken with his book, and liberties that McQueen definitely took with Northup's original, for dramatic, modernizing, or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during his}} time in Africa, after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes, he learned to speak several native languages, and wrote the first {{dictionary}} of the (Chichewa) (Kiniassa) language, as well as completing a dictionary (started by his colleague Ludwig Krapf) of the Nika (Mijikenda) language, and a dictionary of Swahili (now lost, but of which <b>some</b> <b>material</b> may have been incorporated into Krapf's Dictionary of the Suaheli Language (1882)).

5|$|Director David Yates {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he had originally shot a three-hour film of Order of the Phoenix. However, <b>some</b> <b>material</b> had to be cut out in the final edit, as the movie was 45 minutes too long. Therefore, several locations which were used for various scenes do not appear in the final cut of the film. In Virginia Water, scenes were shot where Professor McGonagall recovers from Stunning Spells, and Burnham Beeches was used for filming the scene where Hagrid introduces his fifth-year Care of Magical Creatures class to Thestrals. Harry skips stones in front of the Glenfinnan Monument in Glenfinnan in another cut scene.|$|E
5|$|E. Koken named Plesiosaurus limnophilus in 1887 {{based on}} {{isolated}} cervical vertebrae from outcrops of the Bückeberg Group in Lower Saxony. From the same locality, Koken subsequently named two further species of Plesiosaurus, P. degenhardti and P. kanzleri, and also referred <b>some</b> <b>material</b> to P. valdensis. All {{of this material}} is not particularly diagnostic, and has been partially lost; thus, they have been considered nomina dubia. Sachs et al. considered all of these to represent remains of Brancasaurus, {{with the exception of}} P. degenhardti, which was retained as a nomen dubium on account of lacking the distinctive cervical neural spines of Brancasaurus.|$|E
5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. <b>Some</b> <b>material</b> which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.|$|E

5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered <b>some</b> <b>material</b> benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic representatives of the Baltic states in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying Baltic flags. By establishing a non-recognition policy, it allowed some 120,000 postwar displaced persons from the Baltic states to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E
5|$|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is {{a science}} fiction comedy radio series written by Douglas Adams (with <b>some</b> <b>material</b> in the first series {{provided}} by John Lloyd). It was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom by BBC Radio 4 in 1978, and afterwards the BBC World Service, National Public Radio in the U.S. and CBC Radio in Canada. The series was the first radio comedy programme to be produced in stereo, and was innovative in its use of music and sound effects, winning a number of awards.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce <b>some</b> <b>material</b> or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E

Moreover that the material will be taught is about hortatory exposition where students can share and argue their opinion relating with some recent issues. That is why there are so many beneficial in conducting this project. In the end of process, we will know that they will increase their comprehension and it will be shown an improvement in their attitude toward what hortatory exposition is...|$|R

5|$|Hipposideros besaoka is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Hipposideros. It is known from {{numerous}} jaws and teeth, which {{were collected in}} a cave at Anjohibe in 1996 and described as a new species in 2007. The site where H.besaoka was found is at most 10,000 years old; {{other parts of the}} cave have yielded H. commersoni, a living species of Hipposideros from Madagascar, and <b>some</b> <b>material</b> that is distinct from both species. H.besaoka was larger than H.commersoni, making it the largest insectivorous bat of Madagascar, and had broader molars and a more robust lower jaw. As usual in Hipposideros, the second upper premolar is small and displaced from the toothrow, and the second lower premolar is large.|$|E
5|$|Josce de Dinan (died 1166) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman {{who lived}} {{during and after}} the civil war between King Stephen of England and his cousin Matilda over the throne of England. He was a landholder in the Welsh Marches when he was married by Stephen to the widow of Pain fitzJohn, a union that gave Josce control of Ludlow Castle. Control of the castle was contested by other noblemen, and the {{resulting}} warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval romance known as Fouke le Fitz Waryn, which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes <b>some</b> <b>material</b> on Josce's lifetime. Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by Matilda and her son, King Henry II of England, who succeeded Stephen in 1154.|$|E
5|$|The authorship of the Urantia papers is disputed. Journalist Brad Gooch {{argues in}} his 2002 {{profile of the}} Urantia {{movement}} that Sadler {{was the author of}} The Urantia Book, citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of Sadler's earlier writings. Gardner believes that Sadler wrote part of the papers, but heavily edited and revised most of them. He also contends that Sadler refused to include <b>some</b> <b>material</b> provided to him for inclusion in the book, and that he plagiarized from other works. Ken Glasziou, a supporter of the Urantia Foundation, contends that statistical evidence of the text and Sadler's other works indicates that he did not write, or extensively edit, The Urantia Book.|$|E

5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so <b>some</b> <b>material</b> may have been lost.|$|E
5|$|To Lenin's {{embarrassment and}} horror, in April 1920 the Bolsheviks held {{a party to}} {{celebrate}} his fiftieth birthday, which was also marked by widespread celebrations across Russia and the publication of poems and biographies dedicated to him. Between 1920 and 1926, twenty volumes of Lenin's Collected Works were published; <b>some</b> <b>material</b> was omitted. During 1920, several prominent Western figures visited Lenin in Russia; these included the author H. G. Wells and the philosopher Bertrand Russell, {{as well as the}} anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Lenin was also visited at the Kremlin by Armand, who was in increasingly poor health. He sent her to a sanatorium in Kislovodsk in the Northern Caucasus to recover, but she died there in September 1920 during a cholera epidemic. Her body was transported to Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath the Kremlin Wall.|$|E
5|$|During the Jin–Song wars, {{the invading}} Jurchens sacked the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng in 1126 AD, and an {{enormous}} amount of prized literature found in the Imperial Library was lost, including the original copy of the Wujing Zongyao. After the original was lost, only a few manuscripts survived {{as a result of its}} secretive nature. Only a few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands. A remaining copy of the Wujing Zongyao was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the Southern Song dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the Wujing Zongyao of 1231 while omitting <b>some</b> <b>material</b> and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin. The entire Wujing Zongyao was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available. However, the historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material.|$|E
