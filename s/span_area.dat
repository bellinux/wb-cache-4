40|$|A new {{technique}} is demonstrated for the realisation of air bridges using one lithographic step. Gray scale lithography {{is used for}} the formation of 3 D profiles on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) where a variable dose exposure is applied to create a trapezoid profile for the air bridge. In previous 3 D electron beam lithography (EBL) methods the <b>span</b> <b>area</b> was exposed to a low dose or a low acceleration voltage [1, 2, 3]. Thus, the required discontinuity with the surrounding area for the lift-off process was created. In this technique, no exposure of the <b>span</b> <b>area</b> is needed. Another exposure of a gradient dose is applied to the sides of the highest part of the air bridge. The created profile, after developing the resist, is depicted in Figure 1. The surfaces with red and blue colour represent the metal to form the air bridge and the metal to lift-off, respectively. Using this configuration, the deposited metal at the sides of the top part of the air bridge is connected to the surrounding metal to lift-off and disconnect from the air bridge. The electron dose used in this area has to be smaller than the minimum dose that penetrates the total resist layer, so that the deposited metal does not reach the substrate. This method takes maximum advantage of the resist thickness for the fabrication of high structures, as no part of the resist is sacrifice...|$|E

40|$|Seven {{demersal}} shark species {{belonging to}} six families, {{obtained from the}} southern Mediterranean Sea, were selected as representative of different putative swimming modes, inhabited depths and trophic levels. Caudal fin morphometrics (caudal fin <b>span,</b> <b>area</b> and aspect ratio), hepatosomatic index and muscular-skeletal amount per unit length were estimated and compared within and among species by means of both parametric and non-parametric multivariate and univariate statistical procedures. Intra-specific variation was related to size and, for one species only, also to sex. Two inter-specific patterns of variation were observed: the first pattern was interpreted as a swimming ability gradient between slow benthic and more pelagic species, {{as a function of}} caudal morphometry and body characteristics; the second pattern is related to the depth the species inhabit and/or their trophic level. These two hypotheses were tested with the current data and literature information, and discussed in the context of shark swimming modes, habit and environment. Based on observed differences in caudal fin morphometrics, liver and muscular masses, this paper is the first to provide a quantitative and comparative dataset for demersal sharks as a group, and attempts to describe sample variability as a function of expected swimming ability and occupied niche (depth inhabited and/or trophic level) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Data mining is a {{powerful}} emerging technology that helps to extract hidden information from a huge volume of historical data. This paper is concerned with finding the frequent trajectories of moving objects in spatio-temporal data by a novel method adopting the concepts of clustering and sequential pattern mining. The algorithms used logically split the trajectory <b>span</b> <b>area</b> into clusters and then apply the k-means algorithm over this clusters until the squared error minimizes. The new method applies the threshold to obtain active clusters and arranges them in descending order based on number of trajectories passing through. From these active clusters, inter cluster patterns are found by a sequential pattern mining technique. The process is repeated until all the active clusters are linked. The clusters thus linked in sequence are the frequent trajectories. A set of experiments conducted using real datasets shows that the proposed method is relatively five times better than the existing ones. A comparison is made {{with the results of}} other algorithms and their variation is analyzed by statistical methods. Further, tests of significance are conducted with ANOVA to find the efficient threshold value for the optimum plot of frequent trajectories. The results are analyzed and found to be superior than the existing ones. This approach may be of relevance in finding alternate paths in busy networks (congestion control), finding the frequent paths of migratory birds, or even to predict the next level of pattern characteristics in case of time series data with minor alterations and finding the frequent path of balls in certain games...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{exhibit a}} wide variety in traits at {{different}} organizational levels. Intraspecific and interspecific studies have potential to demonstrate functional relationships and trade-offs amongst traits, with potential consequences for growth. However, {{the distinction between the}} correlative and functional nature of trait covariation presents a challenge because traits interact in complex ways. We present an intraspecific study on Scots pine branches and use functional multi-trait concepts to organize and understand trait interactions and their impacts on growth. Branch-level traits were assessed for 97 branches from 12 Scots pine sites across Europe. To test alternative hypotheses on cause-effect relationships between anatomical traits, hydraulic traits and branch growth, we measured for each branch: the tracheid hydraulic diameter, double cell wall thickness, cell lumen <b>span</b> <b>area,</b> wood density, cavitation vulnerability, wood-specific hydraulic conductivity, the leaf area to sapwood area ratio and branch growth. We used mixed linear effect models and path models to show how anatomical traits determine hydraulic traits and, in turn, how those traits influence growth. Tracheid hydraulic diameter was the best predictor of cavitation vulnerability (R 2 = 0 · 09 explained by path model) and specific conductivity (R 2 = 0 · 19) amongst anatomical traits. Leaf area to sapwood area ratio had the strongest direct effect on branch growth (R 2 = 0 · 19) and was positively associated with the tracheid hydraulic diameter (R 2 = 0 · 22). A number of bivariate correlations between traits could be explained by these functional relationships amongst traits. The plasticity in tracheid hydraulic diameter (10. 0 - 15. 1 μm) and leaf area to sapwood area ratio (600 - 6051 cm 2 cm - 2) and the maintenance of a minimum leaf water potential (between - 2 and - 2 · 5 MPa) appear to drive the anatomical and hydraulic traits of Scots pine across Europe. These properties are major drivers of the functional trait network underlying the growth variation amongst pine branches and thus possibly contribute to the ecological success of pines at a local and continental scale...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) is a {{parametric}} geometry {{modeling tool}} that {{is intended for}} use in the conceptual design of aircraft. The intent of this software is to rapidly model aircraft configurations without expending the expertise and time that is typically required for modeling with traditional Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages. VSP accomplishes this by using parametrically defined components, such as a wing that is defined by <b>span,</b> <b>area,</b> sweep, taper ratio, thickness to cord, and so on. During this phase of frequent design builds, changes to the model can be rapidly visualized along with the internal volumetric layout. Using this geometry-based approach, parameters such as wetted areas and cord lengths can be easily extracted for rapid external performance analyses, such as a parasite drag buildup. At the completion of the conceptual design phase, VSP can export its geometry to higher fidelity tools. This geometry tool was developed by NASA and is freely available to U. S. companies and universities. It has become integral to conceptual design in the Aeronautics Systems Analysis Branch (ASAB) here at NASA Langley Research Center and is currently being used at over 100 universities, aerospace companies, and other government agencies. This paper focuses on the use of VSP in recent NASA conceptual design studies to facilitate geometry-centered design methodology. Such a process is shown to promote greater levels of creativity, more rapid assessment of critical design issues, and improved ability to quickly interact with higher order analyses. A number of VSP vehicle model examples are compared to CAD-based conceptual design, from a designer perspective; comparisons are also made of the time and expertise required to build the geometry representations as well.
