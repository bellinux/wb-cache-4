40|$|AbstractMany {{channels}} exist {{through which}} monetary policy decisions affect the economy. This paper examines the bank lending channel, which reflects the central bank's actions that affect loan supply and real spending. The main variable that affects loan supply is the monetary policy indicator {{as it is}} proxied by the real short-term interest rate. This paper examines how the bank lending channel operates when this <b>short-term</b> <b>indicator</b> is endogenously determined by the target rate the central bank sets through a monetary policy rule. Furthermore, it examines whether different bank-specific characteristics affect the way banks react to a monetary shock. We investigate the effect of such a rule on the bank lending channel in European banking institutions spanning 2000 through 2009.

Although the causal relationship between chronic hyperglycaemia and microvascular disease have been established, {{the relationship between}} chronic hyperglycaemia and macrovascular disease (including cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is not yet well defined. A possible causal mechanism {{may be related to}} the glycation of haernostatic proteins such as fibrinogen. Hyperglycaemia causes non-enzymatic glycation of proteins through direct binding of carbohydrates (glucose and to a minor extent fructose) to proteins. The results of this study indicated that uncontrolled African type 2 diabetic subjects had a significantly higher level of fibrinogen glycation than non-diabetic subjects and that achievement of glycaemic control indeed resulted in a significant decrease in fibrinogen glycation. Glycated fibrinogen also correlates with and compares well with HbAlc in monitoring glycaemic control. By correlating end fibrinogen glycation levels with the average fasting capillary glucose of different 4 -day time- intervals (fibrinogen has a half-life of 4 days) the study indicated that fibrinogen could be used as a <b>short-term</b> <b>indicator</b> of glycaemic control. Because fibrinogen is involved in vascular disease itself, glycated fibrinogen may be a better long-term predictor of CVD than current markers of glycaemic control.

The results of this study showed that fibrinogen glycation is indeed sensitive to fluctuations in glycaemic control. Master...|$|E

Il a été testé sur le {{cantonnement}} de Florenville, sur deux territoires à la pression de gibier contrastée. During {{the last}} decades, populations of large ungulate herbivores have increased and {{their influence on}} forest vegetation have been clearly highlighted. Therefore, monitoring game pressure have become unavoidable for sustainable forest management. Such monitoring require a rigorous approach in order to evaluate objectively the forest-game balance. Under these conditions, the use of exclosure experiment has appeared an interesting solution. They enable to observe the ecosystem evolution due to forest-game imbalance {{as well as to}} detect any early deterioration of a situation that was initially considered acceptable. The enclosure-exclosure devices compare, on the one hand, the real environment (exclosure) fully accessible by wildlife and, secondly, a “control” fenced habitat (enclosures) inaccessible to all populations of large ungulates (e. g. wild boar, red deer, roe deer and mouflon). In 2006, enclosure-exclosure devices (4 x 4 m) were installed within forest gaps in order to monitore the understory dynamic in Wallonia. Observations were collected until 2012 and we computed a set of indicators characterizing the ecological changes due to large herbivores pressure on forest ecosystems. Such devices played a key educational role as it provide a visual comparison of two contrasted situations. Additionally, quantitative information were collected to perform further analysis (floristic survey, as well as height, number of stems and the cover of vegetation). We identified indicators of the ecological changes that responded within two years whereas other indicators required at least 4 monitoring years in order to quantify correctly herbivore pressure. <b>Short-term</b> <b>indicators</b> allow a rapid detection, but they have the disadvantage of being very sensitive to exogenous factors (climate changes, site conditions).

40|$|The private {{pension pillar}} {{established}} in 1998 has generated equally important short-, medium- and long-term effects. This article addresses the short- and medium-term time horizons, which differ from one another. In the short term, the government lost contribution revenues, while its pension expenditures did not decrease. However, since this shortfall in state revenues did not influence the consumption and savings decisions of households, {{in this analysis}} the short-term indicators of fiscal impact on demand disregard the impact of lost revenues. In the medium term, however, the rechanneling of contributions increased public debt and household savings. Consequently, similarly to official statistics, our household indicators and our medium-term fiscal indicator (augmented SNA deficit) {{take into account the}} effect of lost revenues. As the vast majority of members returned to the state pension pillar in 2011, for the purposes of our analysis, we could well assume that the private pension pillar never existed. Accordingly, the difference between our medium-term fiscal indicator and the <b>short-term</b> <b>indicator</b> disappears. As a result, we have changed our household indicators retroactively {{in such a way as}} if the contributions and the returns they yielded had always belonged to the state. This was necessary because the official statistics do not spread this amount over time, but account for it in full for 2011 as a capital transfer between households and the general government, which renders evaluation of the developments extremely difficult. pension reform, savings, pension funds, statistical correction, net lending, deficit. ...|$|E

In the same year, growth in consumer prices peaked at 3. 3 % — the highest level in four years. In early February 2005, the U. S. Fed raised its key interest rates by 25 basis points for the sixth time since mid- 2004. Whereas Japan slipped back into a period of recession, other Asian economies continued growing apace in 2004. The {{second half of the}} year 2004 saw a slowdown in GDP growth momentum in the euro area. Despite positive stimuli from investments, growth rates declined, due to weaker net exports and still very subdued private consumption demand. Consumer restraint can partly be explained by the sluggish growth in real disposable income as a result of higher energy prices, which are also responsible for the rise in inflation. In the first three quarters of 2004, most new Central European EU Member States expanded at a faster pace than in 2003 as a whole.

40|$|Since {{neonates}} {{are often}} the age-class most susceptible to predation, there should be strong selective pressure on prey for the early development of successful antipredator behaviour. The ability to assess predation risk {{as early as the}} embryonic stages may increase an individual’s survival, as it would allow young individuals to be better adapted to current predation risk, since present conditions are often a good <b>short-term</b> <b>indicator</b> of future conditions. I exposed embryonic cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to the odour of a predator and tested both the responses of the embryos to this stimulus, and the latent effects of both long (approximately 3 weeks) - and short (a few days) - exposure on the behaviour of newly-hatched juveniles, in particular the efficiency of cryptic behaviour on uniform and sandy substrates. Exposure to novel odours, whether they were predators or non-predators, increased the ventilation rate of embryos. This may be adaptive, because it helps an individual survive first encounters with unknown potential dangers before they have opportunity to collect information about a novel stimulus. Long-term exposure to predator odour increased the camouflage efficiencies of juveniles on uniform substrates. On sandy substrate, the exposure did not affect camouflage, but increased the extent of sand digging behaviour. Juveniles were also larger in size at hatching when exposed to predators compared to those that were not. These results were not seen in individuals with only short-term exposure to predator. Short-term exposure also had no effect on camouflage efficiencies on uniform or sandy substrates, or on sand digging behaviour. The results of my thesis indicate that high predation risk during embryonic development induces behavioural and morphological changes in camouflage expression and body size in cuttlefish hatchlings. The behavioural plasticity may provide survival benefits for newly hatched individuals, but may come at a cost in terms of body size. Such behavioural and morphological plasticity may have an impact on predator-prey dynamics and organization of communities...|$|E

40|$|The metal-inducible protein, {{metallothionein}} (MT), {{plays an}} important role in metal homeostasis and detoxification in fish and is a good biomarker candidate of metal impact. Long Island Sound (LIS) winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) contain elevated levels of potentially toxic metals. A new PCR-based technique was developed which identified differential MT mRNA responses between adult and juvenile winter flounder exposed to water-borne CdCl 2. Subcutaneous exposure of juveniles to NaAs 3 + ranging from sublethal doses to the LD 40 significantly elevated MT regardless of baseline variation in liver MT and metal content. The reduced variance associated with MT measurements makes it a more sensitive indicator of sublethal NaAs 3 + exposure than liver As accumulation. ^ Saturation of the MT response was linked to mortality by correlating the MT dose response maximum to total liver As content. The upper limit of this response (∼ 200 ug/g liver) provides a framework for evaluating metal-induced stress among juvenile winter flounder. Fish with high levels of pre-existing MT (3 ̆e 100 ug/g) exhibited a narrower MT response window such that MT reached a maximum faster than fish with lower levels of pre-existing MT (3 ̆c 75 ug/g). Pre-existing MT correlated with liver Zn content while metal-induced MT correlated with the exposed metal (Cd or As). This suggests that stress effects may be separated from metal-induced MT in the field by measuring both liver MT and Zn. ^ The potency of MT induction reflects metal toxicity and this was demonstrated by the stronger MT protein response to CdCl 2, than NaAs 3 +. The continued rise in MT mRNA after the MT protein reached a maximum suggests this parameter is a better <b>short-term</b> <b>indicator</b> of high NaAs 3 + exposure. Exposure to sublethal doses of NaAs 3 + did not significantly elevate liver As content and even very high levels of exposure caused only a transient liver As accumulation. More work is needed to determine whether MT protein remains elevated after liver As returns to baseline. The environmental relevance of MT induction by NaAs 3 + and its associations with liver As content can not be determined until liver As is speciated in both baseline and metal-exposed LIS winter flounder. ...|$|E
40|$|The global {{slowdown}} {{appears to}} have {{come to an end}} during the summer of 2009. Most countries saw a smaller decline in economic activity in the second quarter, with some economies even recording positive growth rates once again. In the U. S. A., the economic contraction moderated {{in the second quarter of}} 2009, with the government’s economic stimulus packages and net exports making positive contributions to GDP growth, and the negative contribution from investment decreasing significantly vis-à-vis the previous quarter. With the household saving rate rising sharply, private consumption is making a negative contribution to growth. Although this development may help to reduce global imbalances, it could dampen the recovery in the U. S. A. In the euro area, too, there are signs of a gradual improvement, with GDP declining by a mere 0. 1 % quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2009. This growth was underpinned not only by a strong positive contribution from net exports, but also consumption. The likelihood of a further increase in consumption, however, is uncertain, as the labor market situation is set to deteriorate and because consumer demand has recently been bolstered by fiscal stimulus packages that were only temporary. Investment remained weak, as capacity utilization was extremely low. Current forecasts predict a gradual recovery in the euro area economy. In the summer of 2009, euro area inflation bottomed out, with the HICP falling by 0. 7 % in July. This was due primarily to base effects stemming from commodity prices. The latest forecasts predict that there will be no risks to price stability until the end of 2010. The Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries also recorded considerable declines in GDP growth in the first half of 2009. However, the stabilization of the financial markets, as well as leading indicators, suggest that there will be an improvement over the rest of the year. In many countries, the recession brought about reductions in current account deficits. After posting negative growth rates for four consecutive quarters, the Austrian economy is set to pick up again in the second half of 2009, mainly on the back of improved external conditions, fiscal stimulus packages and inventory cycle developments. The OeNB’s latest <b>short-term</b> <b>indicator</b> results show real GDP growth at 0. 4 % in both the third and fourth quarters of 2009 (seasonally and working day-adjusted, on a quarterly basis).

Other objectives were to create {{a better understanding of the}} multidimensional nature of traffic safety problems, to find out how to allocate resources and traffic safety measures, and to identify changes in traffic safety problems over time. The study was based on one year of traffic casualties, 1991 / 92, in the admittance areas of five hospitals, in Karlshamn, Karlskrona, Lidköping, Lund and Umeå. The hospital data set held 2, 915 casualties, while the police reported 1, 722 killed and injured. Data were collected with an incidence approach, and in a public health perspective, i. e. including pedestrians injured in single accidents. On several occasions up to three years and five months after the accident, the injured answered postal questionnaires about the health situation and their care received. All analyses involved both the police and the hospital data sets. The traffic safety problems were expressed in following indicators: killed and injured, hospital care, ISS (Injury Severity Score), length of hospital stay, and visits to a doctor or physiotherapist/nurse, length of sick leave and health loss (Rosser Index), and described in terms of average severities, total consequences, and distributions of total consequences.

A monthly ISP is only available for the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Korea (Korea). Canada and Finland publish monthly estimates for service production activity as a part of their monthly GDP. Japan produces monthly indicators for tertiary industry, which cover both industry and services sectors. Many EU member countries such as France collect 1 The present documentation has been {{submitted by}} the Statistical Division after the official deadline due to resourc...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] 2001 Labour Overview {{appears at}} a {{difficult}} {{time in the world}} economic situation, aggravated by the events of last 11 September. As <b>short-term</b> <b>indicators</b> have shown, these have had marked repercussions on the economy and employment of most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The present labour situation shows a large and growing deficit in Decent Work, understood as productive jobs in good conditions, with freedom, equality, security and human dignity. In this respect, the present report is making a first effort to calculate the decent work development index, and raises some proposals for reducing the deficit. Moreover, future editions of this publication will increase the indicators in order to make in-depth observations on other aspects related {{to the idea of a}} decent work, as enunciated by the Director General of the ILO in 1999. Finally, analyses indicate that labour prospects are not very encouraging for the coming year. This forces governments, social protagonists and the ILO itself to make a special effort to advance in generating more employment with better labour conditions for everyone...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{influence}} of the measurement time on the measurement uncertainty of environmental noise is explored. An original procedure based on a bootstrap method is introduced to determine the minimum measurement time, which takes into account the statistical variability of the acquired sound pressure levels. The experimental verification against real data about three different environmental noise sources shows the reliability of the algorithm for the prediction of the <b>short-term</b> noise <b>indicator</b> corresponding to longer time window...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To use <b>short-term</b> <b>indicators</b> (hospital {{internship}} choice, {{and interest}} in a future rural career) to assess how the University of Queensland rural clinical school is meeting its program objectives. Design: Cross-sectional quantitative data collected through self-report questionnaires. Setting: University of Queensland rural clinical school (UQRCS). Participants: Year 4 students who attended the UQRCS for their entire clinical year in 2006. Results: Most students were from an urban background. Over the year, interest in a future rural medical career increased measurably across the cohort. The most important factors in choosing to study at the UQRCS were the quality of teaching, level of student contact with clinical teachers, increased patient access, and accommodation facilities. Comparison of graduates’ choice of internship location for 2006 compared with 2005 showed a trend away from urban or metropolitan toward regional or rural hospitals. Conclusions: Our {{results suggest that the}} primary attraction of UQRCS is the quality of education, and rural undergraduate training is a popular choice for urban students. Although the long-term effect on rural medical workforce remains to be determined, the trend at UQRCS of new graduates choosing non-urban internships is encouragin...|$|R
40|$|Most of the Euro-zone {{economic}} <b>short-term</b> <b>indicators</b> are computed through aggregation from Member States data. The {{seasonally adjusted}} figures {{can be calculated}} by seasonally adjusting the aggregate (direct approach) or aggregating the seasonally adjusted national data (indirect approach). Statistical and practical considerations to choose the right strategy are given in the paper. An application to the Euro-zone GDP is presented. The same aggregation problem encountered {{in the case of}} seasonal adjustment will persist when extracting the business cycle. Moreover, since raw figures imply problems in terms of excessive noise of the series, analysts generally prefer the use of seasonally adjusted time series. As a consequence, the problem of choosing between direct and indirect both in seasonal adjustment and in business cycle extraction appears to be closely linked. In fact, the approach chosen to seasonally adjust the data can in theory lead to different results when the cyclical component has to be extracted from sea-sonally adjusted data. After a review of different filters widely used in the literature, we extracted the cycle indicator for the Euro-zone employing the Baxter-King filter to data coming from both direct and indirect seasonally adjustment approach and then compared the relative results. ...|$|R
