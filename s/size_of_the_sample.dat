25|$|To empirically {{estimate}} the expected {{value of a}} random variable, one repeatedly measures observations of the variable and computes the arithmetic mean of the results. If the expected value exists, this procedure estimates the true expected value in an unbiased manner and has the property of minimizing {{the sum of the}} squares of the residuals (the sum of the squared differences between the observations and the estimate). The law of large numbers demonstrates (under fairly mild conditions) that, as the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> gets larger, the variance of this estimate gets smaller.|$|E
25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population mean of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided {{by the total number of}} individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample,</b> the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.|$|E

25|$|Controversy over {{significance}} testing, and {{its effects}} on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its statistical reporting requirements after review, medical journal publishers have recognized the obligation to publish some results that are not statistically significant to combat publication bias and a journal (Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis) has been created to publish such results exclusively. Textbooks have added some cautions and increased coverage of the tools necessary to estimate the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> required to produce significant results. Major organizations have not abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so.|$|E
25|$|The best {{possible}} prediction method would yield {{a point in}} the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E

40|$|Probability of {{coincidental}} clustering among <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> comets, asteroids and meteoroids {{depends on}} many factors like: <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital <b>sample</b> searched for clusters or <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identified group, {{it is different}} for groups of 2, 3, 4, [...] . members.

For a given <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital <b>sample</b> we have assessed probability of random pairing among several orbital populations <b>of</b> different <b>sizes.</b> We have found how these probabilities vary with <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital <b>samples.</b> Finally, keeping fixed <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital <b>sample</b> we have shown that <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> random pairing can be significantly different for <b>the</b> orbital <b>samples</b> obtained by different observation techniques.

2500|$|Another {{constraint}} of {{the method}} is the requirement of a very high stability of the setup; the alignment of the crystals must be very precise and the path length difference between the beams should be smaller than the wavelength of the X-rays; to achieve this the interferometer is usually made out of a highly perfect single block of silicon by cutting out two grooves. By the monolithic production the very important spatial lattice coherence between all three crystals can be maintained relatively well but it limits {{the field of view}} to a small size,(e.g. [...] 5cm x 5cm for a 6-inch ingot) and because the sample is normally placed in one of the beam paths the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> itself is also constrained {{by the size of the}} silicon block.|$|E
