25|$|In an EPR machine the {{magnetic}} assembly includes {{the magnetic}} with a dedicated power supply {{as well as}} a field sensor or regulator such as a Hall probe. EPR machines use one of two types of magnet which is determined by the operating microwave frequency (which determine the range of magnetic field strengths required). The first is an electromagnet which are generally capable of generating field strengths of up to 1.5 T making them suitable for measurements using the Q-band frequency. In order to generate field strengths appropriate for W-band and higher frequency operation superconducting magnets are employed. The magnetic field is homogeneous across the <b>sample</b> <b>volume</b> and has a high stability at static field.|$|E

2500|$|To {{detect the}} very small {{frequency}} shifts due to nuclear magnetic resonance, the applied magnetic field must be constant throughout the <b>sample</b> <b>volume.</b> High resolution NMR spectrometers use shims to adjust the homogeneity of the magnetic field to parts per billion (ppb) in a volume of a few cubic centimeters. In order to detect and compensate for inhomogeneity and drift in the magnetic field, the spectrometer maintains a [...] "lock" [...] on the solvent deuterium frequency with a separate lock unit. In modern NMR spectrometers shimming is adjusted automatically, though {{in some cases the}} operator has to optimize the shim parameters manually to obtain the best possible resolution.|$|E

The incoherent <b>sampling</b> <b>volume</b> of the infrared laser Doppler velocimeter was found to be heavily dependent upon the configuration of the outgoing laser beam. In general when only half the beam is allowed to focus at the focal plane, the x, y traverses indicate a broader beam with nominal side lobes. However, if the total beam is permitted to impinge on the focal plane there is substantial narrowing of the beam with increased maximum intensity and an increase in side lobes.
