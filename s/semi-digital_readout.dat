40|$|International audienceThe highly {{granular}} calorimeters {{developed and}} {{tested by the}} CALICE collaboration have provided large data samples with precise three-dimensional information on hadronic showers with steel and tungsten absorbers and silicon, scintillator and gas detector readout. The calorimeters have been operated in extensive test beam campaigns at DESY, CERN and FNAL in the energy range from 1 GeV to 300 GeV. The selected results are presented obtained with the highly granular hadron calorimeter prototypes with <b>semi-digital</b> and analogue <b>readout.</b> The performance of the RPC-based semi-digital hadron calorimeter in terms of pattern recognition and the comparison with GEANT 4 simulations including a detailed modelling of the RPC response are discussed. We also present the results of spatial shower development studies in the scintillator-steel analogue hadron calorimeter. The component of hadronic showers related to π 0 production is analysed using the shower decomposition technique. The influence of granularity on the resolution obtained with digital, semi-digital and analogue reconstruction methods is demonstrated based on the analogue hadron calorimeter data and simulations. We also show {{the results of the}} performance studies of the combined scintillator-based calorimeter system (scintillator electromagnetic, hadronic and tail catcher calorimeters), including the study of the single hadron energy resolution using both classical energy reconstruction and software compensation techniques in comparison with the predictions of GEANT 4 simulations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} {{calorimeter}} systems for a detector at a future Linear Collider (ILC, CLIC) is largely {{driven by the}} requirements of jet reconstruction. The particle flow technique {{has been shown to}} be capable of achieving an energy resolution ~ 30 %/sqrtE, permitting the discrimination of W and Z bosons in their hadronic decays. Such performance requires the separation of neutral and charged energy deposits in the calorimeters, which in turn demands that they have high spatial granularity both transversely and longitudinally, and be placed within the magnet coil. CALICE has been developing prototype calorimeters to meet these requirements. The electromagnetic calorimeter is based on tungsten absorber read out using either silicon pads of ~ 5 x 5 mm^ 2 and/or crossed short scintillator strips of ~ 5 x 45 mm^ 2. The hadronic calorimeter could use iron or tungsten absorber, sampled using either scintillator tiles of ~ 3 x 3 cm^ 2 or gaseous detectors with ~ 1 x 1 cm^ 2 readout. The scintillator option uses analogue readout, while the gas detectors (RPCs, Micromegas or GEMs) use either digital (1 bit) or <b>semi-digital</b> (2 bit) <b>readout.</b> All these options are being pursued in CALICE. Key issues include: extreme compactness (so that the calorimeters can be located inside the magnet), hermeticity and scalability, power cycling (exploiting the time structure of the accelerator to minimise the need for cooling), and precise timing (especially for CLIC applications). We report on recent R&D and test beam activities from CALICE which address all these key questions...|$|R
