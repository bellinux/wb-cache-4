40|$|Are {{economic}} <b>sanctions</b> {{costly for}} the <b>sanctioning</b> state? Some {{scholars argue that}} <b>sanctions</b> are costly tools used to achieve foreign policy goals, while others argue that <b>sanctions</b> are relatively costless tools leaders use to generate domestic political support. These arguments cannot be true at the same time. This dissertation examines this contradiction and evaluates the costs of <b>sanctions</b> at the national, firm, and individual levels of analysis. Economic <b>sanctions</b> have domestic economic and political consequences. Economic <b>sanctions</b> interrupt otherwise profitable commercial activities. These interventions create winners and losers. Like other forms of economic intervention, winners will {{support the use of}} <b>sanctions</b> and losers will oppose them. But the consequences of <b>sanctions</b> can be difficult to predict. <b>Sanctions</b> are heterogenous and have heterogenous effects. <b>Sanctions</b> don't lead to major changes in sender trade volumes or unemployment levels because the costs of <b>sanctions</b> are not evenly distributed throughout senders' economies. Economic <b>sanctions</b> are only costly for firms that have commercial interests in targeted states. On average, <b>sanctions</b> are economically costly and politically unpopular, but there are exceptions. How the public responds to <b>sanctions</b> depends on the features of the individual episodes. I use a variety of time series techniques and a laboratory experiment to test these arguments. The results from this dissertation suggest a need to rethink the way <b>sanctions</b> scholars conceptualize the economic and political costs of <b>sanctions</b> for the <b>sanctioning</b> state...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies <b>sanctions</b> and South Africa to {{show that}} <b>sanctions</b> can be an {{effective}} instrument of foreign policy. It provides a general study on <b>sanctions</b> and South Africa that is not limited to economic factors alone. It develops a framework for analysis using legal, economic and political factors that form the components of <b>sanctions</b> such as the legality of <b>sanctions,</b> the actors which impose <b>sanctions,</b> types of <b>sanctions,</b> the purposes and targets of <b>sanctions,</b> and the response of targets. The effectiveness of <b>sanctions</b> as an instrument of foreign policy is assessed, and factors that limit or enhance their effectiveness are identified. The investigation is in two parts. The first part uses the framework to examine international cases other than South Africa. The second part uses the same framework to examine <b>sanctions</b> against South Africa. Fundamental to the study is the fact that although <b>sanctions</b> are widely used in the conduct of international relations, the research on them is meagre in comparison with the available literature on other instruments of foreign policy such as diplomacy and war. The study finds that from a legal viewpoint there is no apparent rule in international law that prohibits the imposition of <b>sanctions.</b> For <b>sanctions</b> to succeed, sanctioners must commit themselves to making the <b>sanctions</b> work from the point of implementation and enforcement. Different types of <b>sanctions</b> achieve different levels of effectiveness. Even if <b>sanctions</b> do not fulfil their stated purpose, they do often fulfil other purposes which may, in fact, be more important. When faced with <b>sanctions,</b> targets invariably react to their imposition. The effectiveness of <b>sanctions</b> cannot be measured by economic and stated objectives alone. When additional criteria are used, it is found that contrary to conventional wisdom, <b>sanctions</b> are an effective instrument of foreign policy. </p...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{international}} community has increasingly come to abandon the use of comprehensive <b>sanctions</b> in favour of targeted <b>sanctions.</b> Unlike adopting a coercive strategy on entire states, actors like the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) have come to resort to measures that are aimed at individuals, groups and government members. Targeted <b>sanctions</b> involve adopting measures such as asset freezes, travel bans, commodity <b>sanctions,</b> as well as arms embargoes. Eriksson argues that recent changes in the practice of <b>sanctions</b> from comprehensive to targeted <b>sanctions</b> requires a new way of understanding international <b>sanctions</b> practice. Not only do we need to rethink our methodology to assess recent practice, but also to rethink the very theory of <b>sanctions.</b> This valuable new perspective provides recent thinking on targeted <b>sanctions,</b> trends in practice and unique case studies for evaluation.

40|$|When {{a country}} is <b>sanctioned</b> for violating {{international}} rules today, {{it is usually}} targeted by several different entities. The degree to which <b>sanctions</b> by different senders overlap remains a largely unexplored phenomenon. In this paper, we examine the extent of <b>sanctions</b> cooperation, i. e. joint action among major <b>sanctions</b> senders (the US, the EU, and regional organizations) against identical targets. We then map regional patterns and evaluate one potential explanation for them. Our analysis leads to three major findings. First, <b>sanctions</b> overlap is predominant and has consistently increased {{over the last three}} decades. Twothirds of <b>sanctions</b> involve more than a single sender. Targets today are usually subject to punishment by at least three different <b>sanctions</b> senders (up from one in 1980) and sometimes up to six different senders. Second, world regions vary widely in the extent of <b>sanctions</b> cooperation, the profile of <b>sanctions</b> senders, and their interactions. Third, to explain variation in <b>sanctions</b> cooperation, we find that hegemonic stability theory does not provide much leverage. We conclude by outlining avenues for future research on <b>sanctions</b> cooperation relating to <b>sanctions</b> onset and effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|International {{economic}} <b>sanctions</b> {{have become}} increasingly important as alternatives to military conflict {{since the end of}} the Cold War. This chapter surveys various approaches to the study of economic <b>sanctions</b> in both the economics and international relations literatures. <b>Sanctions</b> may be imposed not to bring about maximum economic damage to the target, but for expressive or demonstrative purposes. Moreover, the political effects of <b>sanctions</b> on the target nation are sometimes perverse, generating increased levels of political resistance to the sanctioners' demands. The economic impacts of trade <b>sanctions</b> on the target country are reflected in their terms-of-trade effects, which are larger in the case of multilateral <b>sanctions</b> than unilateral. Investment <b>sanctions</b> initially raise the rate of return to capital in the target country, but eventually the decrease in the inflow of new capital from abroad constrains the target's growth. Using an interest group model of endogenous policy, the level of <b>sanctions</b> imposed is shown to depend on the relative influences of competing interest groups within the <b>sanctioning</b> country. In the target country, normally only those <b>sanctions</b> that have differential effects on supporters and opponents of the ruling regime will induce the regime to alter its objectionable policy. Game-theoretic models suggest that the success of <b>sanctions</b> depends on conflict expectations and levels of commitment. Many <b>sanctions</b> strategies end at the threat stage, without <b>sanctions</b> being implemented. Consequently, empirical studies using data on actually applied <b>sanctions</b> may exhibit selection bias. In general, the processes generating <b>sanctions</b> and the processes determining their outcome are intrinsically linked. Empirical work on <b>sanctions</b> has attempted to address this problem through the use of simultaneous equations methods. The empirical literature has also investigated the role of political regime type, specifically, democracy or the absence thereof, in determining nations' proclivities to impose <b>sanctions</b> and the success of the <b>sanctions.</b> Defense in a Globalized World...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between United Nations <b>sanctions</b> {{and the rule of}} law. Its primary contention is that <b>sanctions</b> have been applied {{in such a way that}} they have undermined the rule of law, thus weakening the authority and legitimacy of the U. N. Security Council and the U. N. <b>sanctions</b> system. As a consequence, States are less likely to comply with their <b>sanctions</b> obligations to the extent necessary to ensure that <b>sanctions</b> are effective. The challenge is therefore how to modify the Security Council's <b>sanctions</b> practice so that <b>sanctions</b> command such respect and inspire such confidence that States both desire and feel compelled to implement <b>sanctions</b> fully and effectively. The thesis proceeds in four Parts. Part I sets the stage for analysis, introducing U. N. <b>sanctions</b> and proposing a basic accountability-based model of the rule of law, according to which the central aim of the rule of law is to prevent the abuse of power. Part II explores the origins of the Security Council's <b>sanctions</b> powers, tracing the path leading to the enshrinement of the Security Council's <b>sanctions</b> powers in the U. N. Charter and describing the legal basis for the application of <b>sanctions.</b> Part III illustrates how the Security Council has acted upon its <b>sanctions</b> powers in practice, charting the manner in which the Council's sanctions-related decisions have shaped the contours of the U. N. <b>sanctions</b> system. Part IV then operationalises the theoretical framework for analysis developed in Part I, critically evaluating the extent to which <b>sanctions</b> have strengthened the rule of law. It concludes that the U. N. <b>sanctions</b> system exhibits shortcomings in respect of each of the key elements of the rule of law and makes proposals for reforming the Security Council's <b>sanctions</b> practice so that <b>sanctions</b> can strengthen, rather than undermine, the rule of law...|$|R

5|$|One {{factor in}} William's favour was his {{marriage}} to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope Leo IX forbade the marriage at the Council of Rheims in October 1049. The marriage nevertheless went ahead {{some time in the}} early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal <b>sanction</b> was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal <b>sanction</b> of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen– one by William and one by Matilda. The marriage was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.|$|E
