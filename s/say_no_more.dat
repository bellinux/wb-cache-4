25|$|Mark Easterbrook, {{the hero}} of the book and its {{principal}} narrator, sees a fight between two girls in a Chelsea coffee bar during which one pulls out some of the other's hair at the roots. Soon afterwards he learns that this second girl, Thomasina Tuckerton, has died. At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions something called the Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

After {{a brief period}} touring with David Bowie during 1975–76 he is {{featured}} on the 1990 and 2010 CD editions of Station to station album live bonus tracks, Kaye joined Detective with singer Michael Des Barres, releasing two albums: Detective (1977) and It Takes One To Know One (1977), {{as well as the}} promo-only Live From The Atlantic Studios (1978). Kaye then moved on to join Badfinger in 1979, playing on their 1979 tour and their 1981 album <b>Say</b> <b>No</b> <b>More.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dellaconda {{itself is}} the next destination, as Chase and Alex {{continue}} their hunt for Hugh Scott. Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will not say anything about theTenandrome mission, except {{to confirm that the}} survey ship found something and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the Tenadrome had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

For {{the first time}} in the history of the competition, this took place on the Tideway on part of the Championship Course. [...] The two Cambridge boats were named Nudge Nudge and Wink Wink (with a third reserve boat called <b>Say</b> <b>No</b> <b>More),</b> while Oxford's trialists rowed in Cleopatra and Boudicca. [...] Both trials were overseen by Olympic bronze medallist Sarah Winckless.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Sifton's {{political}} {{style was}} to remain aloof and detached, and to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than necessary; this cemented {{his reputation as}} [...] "the Sphinx". [...] He was authoritarian and, while he inspired respect, he was not loved; historian L. G. Thomas credits him with holding the Liberal Party together through his strength, but blames him for failing to heal its underlying divisions. [...] Sifton was originally selected as Premier {{in the hopes that}} he would lead the Liberal Party to continued dominance of provincial politics in Alberta. [...] His success in this regard was mixed: although he led the party to victory in the 1913 and 1917 elections, its majorities declined each time. Moreover, his victories were marred by accusations of unethical electoral tactics.|$|E
500|$|The same comment, on the {{function}} of any translation, is cited by Hugh Magennis in his book Translating Beowulf: Modern Versions in English Verse, along with Tolkien's opening remark that translating a poem into [...] "plain prose", [...] "a work of skilled and close-wrought metre (to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more)</b> needs defence." [...] Magennis writes that Tolkien [...] "goes on to provide such a defence" [...] by insisting that [...] "Clark Hall" [...] was offered not to enable people to judge the original poem or to substitute for it, but [...] "to provide an aid to study." [...] He also cites Tolkien's insistence that [...] "the Modern English of prose Beowulf translations should be 'harmonious' and should avoid 'colloquialism and false modernity'."

500|$|Wilson had {{stated that}} the 1920 {{election}} would be a [...] "great and solemn referendum" [...] on the League of Nations, {{making it difficult for}} Cox to maneuver on the issue—although Roosevelt strongly supported the League, Cox was less enthusiastic. Harding opposed entry into the League of Nations as negotiated by Wilson, but favored an [...] "association of nations", based on the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. This was general enough to satisfy most Republicans, and only a few bolted the party over this issue. By October, Cox had realized there was widespread public opposition to Article X, and stated that reservations to the treaty might be necessary; this shift allowed Harding to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> on the subject.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} South African [...] "Freedom Songs" [...] had musical origins in makwaya, or choir music, which {{combined}} elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a [...] "call-and-response" [...] structure. The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or Zulu, {{as well as}} in English. Melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward. Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid. This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Groups affiliated with the Black Consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group Malombo, for example, used traditional rhythms of the Venda people to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political. While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. Vusi Mahlasela would write in 1991: [...] "So who are they who <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> love poems now? I want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child." ...|$|E

In 1982, Evans teamed with pre-1975 Badfinger members Jackson and Gibbins, first adding guitarist Adam Allen, and then, {{in the fall of}} 1982, adding guitarists Reed Kailing of The Grass Roots and (Chicago's) Donnie Dacus.|$|E

On 26 June 1874 the second act was fully scored, and less than five months later, on 21 November 1874, the full score of the entire opera was ready. On the very last page Wagner wrote: [...] "Vollendet in Wahnfried am 21. November 1874. Ich sage nichts weiter!! RW" [...] ("Completed in Wahnfried on 21 November 1874.

He said [...] "If it were legally possible, I'd <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> Muslims will get in here", claiming that the influx of Muslims would threaten freedoms in the liberal Dutch society. He thought Muslim culture had never undergone a process of modernisation and therefore still lacked acceptance of democracy and women's, gays', lesbians' and minorities' rights. He feared Muslims would try to replace the Dutch legal system with the shari'a law.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2016, {{there are}} at least 30 brands available. Many of these avoid the FDA {{restriction}} by not having any appreciable monacolin content.

[...] The labeling on these products often says nothing about cholesterol. If they do not contain lovastatin, do not claim to contain lovastatin, and do not make a claim to lower cholesterol, they are not subject to FDA action. Two reviews confirm that the monacolin content of red yeast rice dietary supplements can vary over a wide range, with some containing negligible monacolins.|$|E

Twelve hundred seats in slightly offset arcs ascend the original hillside, giving an excellent view of the stage from each seat.

[...] The Badfinger albums Airwaves (1979) and <b>Say</b> <b>No</b> <b>More</b> (1981) (both of which excluded both Gibbins and Jackson) foundered, as Molland and Evans see-sawed between cooperation and conflict in their attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Having seen Ham's body after Ham's wife had called him immediately after Ham's death, Evans reportedly never got over his friend's suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, [...] "I wanna be where he is."
