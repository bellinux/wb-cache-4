The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E

The interior has a large courtyard which contains gardens.|$|E

25|$|After {{a fire in}} 1858 {{destroyed}} around 50 {{buildings in}} High Street and Shortland Street, the commercial district began to shift towards Queen Street instead, and the first brick and plaster buildings of the 1860s started to cement this move, with the Bank of New Zealand building (only the façade extant today) {{being one of the}} first examples. Fires however still continued to plague the new town, with one in 1873 wiping out another 54 buildings in the Queen Street area between Wellesley Street West and Grey <b>Street</b> (<b>today</b> Greys Avenue). The fires, amongst other things, led to the establishment of the Auckland Volunteer Fire Service.|$|E
25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game. Originally, these were closed rehearsals that the band {{eventually}} opened up to friends and family members. Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the <b>street.</b> <b>Today,</b> upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. Many of these people do not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours just for a chance to see and hear the band.|$|E

25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy <b>street.</b> <b>Today</b> the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
25|$|The Simeon {{family with}} five children, a housekeeper, a governess, a lady's maid, a housemaide, a nurse, a cook and a footman left England from the East India Docks on 18 June 1851 {{on the ship}} Canterbury and arrived on 21 October in Lyttelton. Lyttelton {{inhabitants}} were amazed {{about the size of}} the party. The children and servants were put up at the Mitre in Lyttelton at a cost of £4 10s per day until he had found a town house to rent on the Bridle Path. He bought town section 102 in Lyttelton's Coleridge <b>Street</b> (<b>today</b> Coleridge Terrace), not far from the rented house, and built a substantial house with eight rooms near where the Bridle Path goes over the hill to Christchurch. This latter house is still standing and is registered as a Category II historic place by Heritage New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|O'Connell Street {{was again}} {{the scene of}} a pitched battle in July 1922, on the {{outbreak}} of the Irish Civil War, when anti-treaty fighters under Oscar Traynor occupied the street after pro-treaty Irish National Army troops attacked the republican garrison in the nearby Four Courts. Fighting lasted from 28 June until 5 July, when the National Army troops brought artillery up to point blank range, under the cover of armoured cars, to bombard the republican-held buildings. Among the casualties was Cathal Brugha. Luckily, none of the post-1916 reconstructed buildings were seriously damaged during the civil war. The effects of the week's fighting were largely confined to the northern end of the street, with {{the vast majority of the}} terrace north of Cathedral Street to Parnell Square being destroyed, as well as a few buildings on the north-western side. As a result, only one Georgian townhouse remains on the <b>street</b> <b>today,</b> though there are still some other Georgian buildings extant on the corner with Henry Street, as well as some masked behind Victorian façades on the lower end of the street.|$|E

500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} as a stone arch bridge of [...] in length and [...] in width, supported by five elliptical arches of varying heights. The tall [...] wide central span was designed to allow shipping to pass, giving Richmond Bridge a distinctive humpbacked appearance. It was built in Portland stone, and ran between Ferry Hill (Bridge <b>Street</b> <b>today)</b> on the Surrey side and Richmond Road on the Middlesex side; sharp curves in the approach roads on the Middlesex side (still in existence today) were needed to avoid the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle's land at Twickenham Park. Palladian toll houses were built in alcoves at each end.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of March 5, Private Hugh White, a British soldier, stood on guard duty outside the Custom house on King <b>Street,</b> <b>today</b> known as State Street. A young wigmaker's {{apprentice}} named Edward Garrick called out to a British officer, Captain-Lieutenant John Goldfinch, that Goldfinch had not paid a bill due to Garrick's master. Goldfinch had in fact settled his account and ignored the insult. Private White called out to Garrick {{that he should be}} more respectful of the officer. Garrick exchanged insults with Private White. Then, after Garrick started poking the officer in the chest with his finger, the officer left his post, challenged the boy, and struck him {{on the side of the}} head with his musket. As Garrick cried in pain, one of his companions, Bartholomew Broaders, began to argue with White. This attracted a larger crowd. Henry Knox, a 19-year-old bookseller (who would later serve as a general in the revolution), came upon the scene and warned White, [...] "if he fired he must die for it." ...|$|E
