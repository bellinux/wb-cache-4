Immediately after accepting the check, Sheriff Truman, Deputy Hawk, and Agent Cooper enter Horne's office. Truman arrests Horne for murder. Horne attempts to flee but is restrained and handcuffed.

5|$|Lewis Hamilton did {{go out on}} {{the softer}} tyres in Q2, setting the fastest time of the session, the first to lap in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen went out on the harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come.

5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{theoretically}} the electron <b>spin</b> relaxation <b>in</b> semiconductor quantum dots via interaction with nuclear spins. The relaxation {{is shown to}} be determined by three processes: (i) – the precession of the electron <b>spin</b> <b>in</b> the hyperfine field of the frozen fluctuation of the nuclear spins; (ii) – the precession of the nuclear <b>spins</b> <b>in</b> the hyperfine field of the electron; and (iii) – the precession of the nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>in</b> the dipole field of its nuclear neighbors. In external magnetic fields the relaxation of electron spins directed along the magnetic field is suppressed. Electron spins directed transverse to the magnetic field relax completely in a time on the order of the precession period of its <b>spin</b> <b>in</b> the field of the frozen fluctuation of the nuclear spins. Comparison with experiment shows that the hyperfine interaction with nuclei may be the dominant mechanism of electron <b>spin</b> relaxation <b>in</b> quantum dots...|$|R
5|$|Oldham's {{townscape}} {{was dominated}} by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton <b>spinning.</b> <b>In</b> spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{physicists}} were {{rocked by}} the news that Wu and Tsung-Dao Lee had demonstrated in the Wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. This inspired Ward to consider particle physics again. Along with many others, he consider how gauge theory {{could be applied to}} Fermi's theory of beta decay. Ward became {{one of the authors of}} the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions; his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. Ward wrote a note to Abdus, informing him that Albert Einstein would be <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> his grave, presumably clockwise.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit a wall {{and went on to}} crash into the safety barriers, burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz was taken {{out of the car and}} transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg before the accident remained the fastest lap of the session. He was more than seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> the final corner.|$|E
5000|$|This {{explains}} why, due to friction, most rattlebacks {{appear to}} exhibit spin-reversal motion only when <b>spun</b> <b>in</b> the pitching-unstable direction, {{also known as}} the strong reversal direction. When the rattleback is <b>spun</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "stable direction", {{also known as the}} weak reversal direction, friction and damping often slow the rattleback to a stop before the rolling instability has time to fully build. Some rattlebacks, however, exhibit [...] "unstable behavior" [...] when <b>spun</b> <b>in</b> either direction, and incur several successive spin reversals per spin.|$|R

40|$|Controlling {{decoherence}} is {{the most}} challenging task in realizing quantum information hardware. Single electron <b>spins</b> <b>in</b> gallium arsenide are a leading candidate among solid- state implementations, however strong coupling to nuclear <b>spins</b> <b>in</b> the substrate hinders this approach. To realize <b>spin</b> qubits <b>in</b> a nuclear-spin-free system, intensive studies based on group-IV semiconductor are being pursued. In this case, the challenge is primarily control of materials and interfaces, and device nanofabrication. We report important steps toward implementing <b>spin</b> qubits <b>in</b> a predominantly nuclear-spin-free system by demonstrating state preparation, pulsed gate control, and charge-sensing spin readout of confined hole <b>spins</b> <b>in</b> a one-dimensional Ge/Si nanowire. With fast gating, we measure T 1 <b>spin</b> relaxation times <b>in</b> coupled quantum dots approaching 1 ms, increasing with lower magnetic field, consistent with a spin-orbit mechanism that is usually masked by hyperfine contributions...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
5|$|While Marco {{was still}} <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> the western Caribbean, the Government of Honduras allotted 70million HNL ($5.6million 1996USD) in {{emergency}} assistance. Following the storm, several countries contributed cash toward {{the recovery of}} Honduras, including: Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States; cash donations collectively totaled slightly more than $438,000. In addition, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs contributed an emergency grant, worth $10,000. Japan donated 40tents, 10water purifiers, 480soaps, and 3emergency health kits in lieu of money. Norway donated almost $71,000 worth of food, medicines, and clothing. Spain also contributed medicine and transportation, costing $156,250. The United States donated plastic sheeting, water containers, and family food bags. The primary contributor of non-government aid was the Red Cross. After the storm, the Red Cross set up temporary shelters in San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cortés, and El Progreso. Additionally, they distributed 3,000pounds of milk, clothing, 500sheets, chlorine boxes, 14,000pounds of rice, 15,000pounds of beans and 9,000pounds of maize, sugar, and butter.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton <b>spinning</b> <b>in</b> the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E
