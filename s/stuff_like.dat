500|$|After Lourdes's birth, Madonna became {{involved}} in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, introduced to her by actress Sandra Bernhard. Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and {{wanted to create a}} sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit [...] "was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave was happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> Aphex Twin. There was party <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that." ...|$|E

The best I could do would be to describe it like this— they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter! That's Paris–Roubaix.

[...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe. <b>Stuff</b> <b>like,</b> 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed Graduation a [...] "minor success" [...] in which [...] "every single track offers up its momentary pleasures—choruses {{that make you}} say yeah on songs you've already found wanting, confessional details and emotional [...] on an album that still reduces to quality product when they're over".

500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little while {{to get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that.

There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
