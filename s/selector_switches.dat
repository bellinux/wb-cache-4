25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the Panel system was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type senders stored dialed digits on rotary <b>selector</b> <b>switches.</b> The senders employed translators {{to convert the}} dialed digits into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel senders were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster call completion.|$|E
25|$|During the war years, the C-46 {{was noted}} for an {{abnormal}} number of unexplained airborne explosions (31 between May 1943 and May 1945) that were initially attributed to various causes. In particular, the fuel system, which was quickly designed, then modified for the new, thirstier Pratt & Whitney engines, was criticized. The {{cause of the}} explosions was eventually traced to pooled gasoline from small leaks in the tanks and fuel system, combined with a spark, usually originating from open-contact electrical components. Though many service aircraft suffered small fuel leaks in use, the C-46's wings were unvented; if a leak occurred, the gasoline had nowhere to drain, but rather pooled at the wing root. Any spark or fire could set off an explosion. After the war, all C-46 aircraft received a wing vent modification to vent pooled gasoline, and an explosion-proof fuel booster pump was installed with shielded electrical <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> {{in lieu of the}} open-contact type used originally.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} styling, the NAIT, priced in the UK at £253, was {{housed in a}} small black {{aluminium}} [...] "chrome bumper" [...] case shared by other [...] "half-size" [...] Naim components at the time. On {{the left side of}} the front panel, a plastic volume knob is adjacent to a small-diameter rotating potentiometer that controls the balance. Then follows a bank of three press-button <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> [...] for each of phono, tuner, tape [...] then a power on–off button. On the right side is a light-emitting diode (LED) indicating activity status. Sam Tellig of Stereophile said that the NAIT was [...] "a profoundly anarchistic, almost subversive product".|$|E
2500|$|Access to {{the control}} panel was poor, as it was partly {{obstructed}} by an emergency pump for the aircraft's hydraulic equipment. The fire extinguisher control panel included <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> for the co-pilot to select which of the four engines to douse with CO2. Investigators found that aboard KG867 the selector switch for the port engines was in the [...] "off" [...] position and the selector for the starboard engines was switched to extinguish the inner starboard engine. This suggested that in the emergency, Warrant Officer Brož may have selected to extinguish the wrong engine by mistake.|$|E
50|$|Tap changers {{typically}} use numerous tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> {{which may}} not be switched under load, broken into even and odd banks, and switch between the banks with a heavy-duty diverter switch which can switch between them under load. The result operates like a dual-clutch transmission, with the tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> taking the place of the gearbox and the diverter switch taking the place of the clutch.|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{switches}} for audio and video, from simple <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> to sophisticated production switchers.

50|$|Some arcing is unavoidable, {{and both}} the tap changer oil and the switch {{contacts}} will slowly deteriorate with use. To prevent contamination of the tank oil and facilitate maintenance operations, the diverter switch usually operates in a separate compartment from the main transformer tank, and often the tap <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> will {{be located in the}} compartment as well. All of the winding taps will then be routed into the tap changer compartment through a terminal array.|$|E
50|$|Rosen built {{a replica}} of PURPLE which turned out (when a machine was found years later) to use exactly the same {{telephone}} <b>selector</b> <b>switches</b> in common use {{at that time in}} the U.S. This machine was used to decode the Japanese diplomatic messages, sometimes before the Japanese ambassadors had themselves. Rosen also contributed his engineering talents during and after the war at Arlington Hall, after the S.I.S. became the Army Security Agency, later to become AFSA and finally the present National Security Agency.|$|E
50|$|Assume {{a failure}} free state for a path from a node B to a node A. Node B bridges the signal destined to A from other nodes on the ring, both on working and {{protecting}} routes.
