5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over {{the truth of the}} allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E

25|$|By 2004, it was {{observed}} that since the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad movie choices, agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April 2006 a Dutch {{judge ruled}} that Hirsi Ali had to abandon her current secure house at a secret address in the Netherlands. Her neighbors had complained that she created an {{unacceptable}} security risk, but the police had testified that this neighborhood {{was one of the}} safest places in the country, as they had many personnel assigned to it for the politician's protection. In an interview in early 2007, Hirsi Ali noted that the Dutch state had spent about €3.5 million on her protection; threats against her produced fear, but she believed it important to speak her mind. While regretting van Gogh's death, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> proud of their work together.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 Sister Lucia {{reported}} an apparition of the Virgin Mary at the Convent of Saint Dorothea at Pontevedra, Galicia. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> asked {{to convey the}} message of the First Saturday Devotions.

In 1930, she wrote to her confessor that in 1929 she had a vision of both Mary and the Holy Trinity in which God had asked for the Consecration of Russia to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary by the Pope in communion with all the bishops of the world. The message regarding the establishment of the Devotion of the Five First Saturdays is reminiscent of that reported by Margaret Mary Alacoque in the seventeenth century, which led to the First Friday Devotion.|$|E

25|$|Rains argued {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing that Mehserle lacked the malice necessary for a murder charge and {{that he intended to}} tase Grant. A BART officer testified, saying that Grant and his friends had yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fearful when she heard taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train. After the seven days of testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands, but he was trained to use just his left if he was firing a Taser. Mehserle faced up to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.|$|E

25|$|Wenceslao Retana, a {{political}} commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in La Epoca, {{a newspaper in}} Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother, Teodora, tried to poison {{the wife of a}} cousin, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down.|$|E

5000|$|Strickland cites {{her work}} ethic and her [...] "active imagination" [...] as sources of {{inspiration}} when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> required to convey certain emotions, particularly negative ones. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> does not practise method acting, but that actors can bring to a role elements that are, in her words, [...] "an extension of their life experience". According to her, she hopes to have her experience {{of growing up in}} an emotionally warm environment incorporated into her work. Strickland has spoken of her difficulty conveying different [...] "versions" [...] of emotions such as fear to different members of a worldwide film-watching audience, saying [...] "what really kept me going was trying to communicate something universal." [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> extremely flattered when people, particularly her fans, genuinely relate to her when her [...] "version of storytelling" [...] and work as an actress communicates to them. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> believed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "here" [...] to act, and that she could not live without it: [...] "It's my joy, it's what I love, and there's no feeling like being able to do what you love in life, and really fully doing it", <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> Strickland called her life as an actress [...] "a crazy existence" [...] and [...] "completely unstable" [...] because of the frequency with which she has to look for new jobs, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> [...] " [...] with it" [...] and continue to act until her death.|$|R

25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E
