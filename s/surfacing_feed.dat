5000|$|Hybrid {{striped bass}} {{are known for}} {{aggressive}} feeding habits which makes them highly sought-after by anglers. Often schooling by the thousands, these stocked fish <b>surface</b> <b>feed</b> on baitfish such as shad. Often called [...] "breaking", this <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> makes the fish visible and easy to catch on {{a wide array of}} lures and baits. Popular lures include casting spoons, buck-tail jigs, soft-body plastic fish replicas, and inline spinners.|$|R
50|$|Bubble-net feeding is {{a unique}} and complex feeding {{behavior}} engaged in by Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Bryde's whales in Gulf of Tosa, Japan. It {{is one of the}} few <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviors that humpback whales are known to engage in. This type of feeding is often done in groups. The group size can range from a minimum of two or three whales participating and up to sixty at one time. Whales can also perform a similar method of <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> called lunge feeding but is done solo.|$|R
50|$|This {{family of}} snails {{consists}} of herbivores, grazing with their radulae on rocky <b>surfaces,</b> <b>feeding</b> on algae and vegetable detritus, and more rarely by filter-feeding, as {{observed in the}} genus Umbonium.|$|R
500|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>feeding</b> {{itself can}} be broken up into two {{different}} approaches, <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> while flying (for example as practiced by gadfly petrels, frigatebirds and storm petrels), and <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> while swimming (examples of which are practiced by fulmars, gulls, many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels). Surface feeders in flight include {{some of the most}} acrobatic of seabirds, which either snatch morsels from the water (as do frigate-birds and some terns), or [...] "walk", pattering and hovering on the water's surface, as some of the storm-petrels do. Many of these do not ever land in the water, and some, such as the frigatebirds, have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so. Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the skimmer, which has a unique fishing method: flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the waterâ€”this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water. The skimmer's bill reflects its unusual lifestyle, with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one.|$|R
5000|$|Sowley Pond (...) is a 47.97 hectare {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), {{in southwest}} Hampshire, notified in 1971. It {{is an important}} refuge for both <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> and diving ducks and functions {{as an integral part}} of the marshland system of the west Solent.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of milling machines use an up-cut setup {{which means that}} the drum rotates in the direction opposite that of the drive wheel or tracks, (i.e. work <b>surface</b> <b>feeds</b> into the cut).The speed of the rotating drum should be slower than the forward speed of the machine for a suitable finished surface.|$|R
5|$|Like many seabirds storm petrels will {{associate}} with {{other species of}} seabird and marine mammal species {{in order to help}} obtain food. It is theorised that they benefit from the actions of diving predators such as seals and penguins which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> storm petrels to reach them.|$|R
50|$|Offshore kite {{fishing is}} a sport fishing {{technique}} {{used to keep}} live bait {{on the surface of}} the water to attract and catch <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> predators. It is used in Florida along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean for sailfish. It is also used for blackfin and yellowfin tuna, dolphin or mahi-mahi, wahoo, black grouper, and yellowtail snapper.|$|R

50|$|The {{life history}} of this species is not well {{understood}} {{and is based on}} a very limited number of observations. They live in the deep, moist, undisturbed soils of riparian forests. They tunnel deep into the soil and are known to dig permanent burrows fifteen feet below the surface. However during the wetter seasons, they are found closer to the soil <b>surface,</b> <b>feeding</b> on the rich layers of accumulated organic material.|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} mainly planktonic crustaceans, with a {{preference}} of larvae of spiny lobster. It will also take small fish and offal. It feeds using several techniques, including plunge diving to 1 m below the water's <b>surface</b> from flight, <b>feeding</b> while swimming on the <b>surface,</b> and <b>feeding</b> while flying. At sea it usually forages singly.|$|R
30|$|The {{precipitates}} {{formed in}} aluminum <b>surfaces</b> of <b>feed</b> water samples were observed individually for every recovery percentage using optical microscope.|$|R
50|$|A lineatus {{and similar}} <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> fish (e.g. Pantadon bucholzi) use a {{slightly}} modified lateral line organ called a neuromast to detect surface waves. A lineatus has 18 neuromasts (specialized vibration-sensitive lateral line organs) on the dorsal {{surface of the}} head of A lineatus. These are organized into three groups by longitudinal position, and each group is bilaterally symmetric. The groups are, caudal to rostral: nasal/infraorbital (I), supraorbital (II), and supratemporal/post-orbital (III).|$|R
50|$|The nymphs of the {{periodical}} cicadas live underground, usually within 2 ft of the <b>surface,</b> <b>feeding</b> on {{the juices}} of plant roots. The nymphs of the periodical cicada undergo five instar stages in their development underground. It {{has been suggested}} that the difference in the 13- and 17-year lifecycle is the time it takes for the second instar to mature. While underground, the nymphs move deeper below ground, feeding on larger roots.|$|R
5000|$|Species of Cerberilla live on and {{in sandy}} {{substrates}} where they burrow beneath the <b>surface</b> and <b>feed</b> on burrowing sea anemones.|$|R
50|$|Humpback {{whales are}} solitary creatures {{and do not}} always feed in large groups. They are able to perform a similar method of <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> but it is {{referred}} to as lunge feeding. It is similarly executed as the whale dives down beneath a school of fish and rises to the surface with its mouth wide open. Once it reaches the surface it will swallow and separate the fish from the saltwater and exhales the excess water.|$|R
40|$|There are {{developed}} mathematical model {{of physical and}} chemical processes of polymerization adhesive coating stranded cable. There are shown difference in the temperature distribution along the radius of the finished product {{in the presence of}} an air gap between the conductor and the rubber sheath. Also, due to the need to change process parameters with possible loose contacts inside the cable. Such as the temperature of the heating <b>surface,</b> <b>feeding</b> speed and dwell time in the oven...|$|R
50|$|Some seabird species utilize <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> or plunge diving during {{foraging}} {{in which}} gravity and/or momentum {{is used to}} counteract buoyancy effects {{for a short period}} of time. Other species can remain submerged for longer periods of time and practice pursuit diving in which they actively produce thrust to remain submerged and chase after prey. Because birds have decoupled locomotor modules, pursuit divers can produce thrust using either their wings, feet, or some combination of the two.|$|R
40|$|Under a data {{purchase}} agreement with Goddard Space Flight Center, Orbital Sciences Corporation {{has been able}} to contract building of the Sea-Viewing Wide-Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS). Orbital Sciences was then able commercialized the data that the satellite produces. These data are used to create daily fish finding maps, allowing fishing fleets to focus on locations where many commercially important <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> fish, like tuna and swordfish, congregate. In agriculture and forestry, SeaWIFS' images offer an alternative to direct on-site inspection or expensive serial photography...|$|R
50|$|It {{is a small}} fish, up to 8 cm in length, that shoals at {{the water}} <b>surface.</b> It <b>feeds</b> on pelagic {{crustaceans}} and fish eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Many seabirds {{feed on the}} ocean's surface, as {{the action}} of marine {{currents}} often concentrates food such as krill, forage fish, squid or other prey items within reach of a dipped head.Surface feeding itself can be broken up into two different approaches, <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> while flying (for example as practiced by gadfly petrels, frigatebirds and storm petrels), and <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> while swimming (examples of which are practiced by fulmars, gulls, many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels).

50|$|Clithon oualaniense is an eurybiotic species. It inhabits soft {{bottoms of}} interdidal habitats. It {{can occur in}} high density, for example 347 snails per mÂ² was recorded, that {{correspond}} to the biomass of 30.6 g per mÂ². It also inhabits sea grass bed with Zostera japonica. The activity of Clithon oualaniense is diurnal; snails are active during the daytime and inactive at night. It bury itself into the mud, when the tide is high, probably to avoid water predators. They are on the <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> and mating when the tide is low.|$|R
40|$|Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) {{brooding}} young chicks at Scullin Monolith (67 Â° 7 â€²S, 66 Â° 42 â€²E), Antarctica, fed {{fish and}} crustaceans (87 % and 13 %, respectively, on a mass basis) to their young. Amounts of solids fed were equivalent to 6. 6 % of the body mass of adult birds with an empty stomach. The prey comprised species known {{to occur in the}} surface layers of the Antarctic ocean in the east wind drift, such as Pleuragramma antarcticum, Notolepis coatsi and Euphausia superba, consistent with the <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of Antarctic petrels...|$|R
40|$|The full MHD {{problem of}} the flow and heat {{transfer}} due to a linearly stretching sheet {{in the presence of}} a transverse magnetic field is put in a self-similar form. Traditionally ignored physical processes such as induced magnetic field, viscous dissipation, Joule heating, and work shear are included and their importance is established. Cases of prescribed surface temperature, prescribed heat flux, <b>surface</b> <b>feed</b> (injection or suction), velocity slip, and thermal slip are also considered. The problem is shown to admit self similarity. Sample numerical solutions are obtained for chosen combinations of the flow parameters...|$|R
50|$|In July 2007, a {{minke whale}} with what {{appeared}} to be a rope injury was observed <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> on capelin in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The long, linear laceration extended around the ventral pleats, restricting their distention. This individual performed a number of oblique lunges on its right side and then rotated in mid-air to the left, landing upright on its rostrum. This was not observed in any of the other feeding whales. This may have been done to avoid landing on the injured portion of its ventral pleats.|$|R
50|$|Located at , {{this site}} {{consists}} of mature flooded gravel workings surrounded by dense fringing vegetation, trees and scrub, affording {{a variety of}} habitats for breeding birds and a refuge for wildfowl. The irregular shoreline, with islands, promontories, shelteredeutrophic pools and narrow lagoons provides undisturbed habitat for many water birds including <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> ducks such as teal (Anas crecca) and shoveler (Anas clypeata). The surrounding marsh and scrub are important for numerous birds including nine breeding species of warblers, water rails (Rallus aquaticus), kingfishers (Alcedoa atthis) and an important breeding colony of nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos).|$|R
50|$|The wave-detection {{system of}} A lineatus and other <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> fish is tuned {{to match the}} waves that signal prey in their environment. A lineatus feeds on aquatic, {{semi-aquatic}} and terrestrial insects, often insects that have just touched {{the surface of the}} water or have fallen in and are struggling at the surface. Abiotic sources give off capillary waves of frequency 8-14 Hz, while biotic sources give off much higher frequencies, anywhere from 12-45 Hz and above. This correlates well with A lineatusâ€™ peak sensitivity at higher frequencies.|$|R
50|$|There are 13-15 rays on a banded killifish's {{dorsal fin}} and 10-12 on the anal fin. The homocercal tail is {{slightly}} convex or rounded. It {{also has a}} small pelvic fin along the abdomen. The body is slender and elongated, with a flattish side and flattened head and small terminal mouth positioned for <b>surface</b> <b>feeding.</b> The banded killifish has a row of small sharp teeth lining their upper and lower jaws. It {{does not have a}} lateral line along the side but does have 39 to 43 cycloid scales in the lateral series.|$|R
25|$|Sea birds {{sometimes}} pick symbiotic crustaceans {{from the}} jellyfish bells near the sea's <b>surface,</b> inevitably <b>feeding</b> {{also on the}} jellyfish hosts of these amphipods or young crabs and shrimp.|$|R
40|$|Waterbird use of two moderately-sized {{reservoirs}} {{in northwest}} Arkansas was {{studied in the}} autumns of 1993 and 1995. In addition to waterbird counts; surface area, water temperature, conductivity, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, macrophyte presences, number of total macroin vertebrates and degree of human activity were evaluated. Lake Fayetteville supported a greater overall waterbird species richness and species abundance than Lake Wedington. The observed number of ducks per hectare showed {{a significant difference between}} the lakes in both 1993 and 1995. <b>Surface</b> <b>feeding</b> birds were significantly more abundant at Lake Fayetteville in both 1993 and 1995, whereas diving birds, which feed on fish and invertebrates, showed no significant difference between the two lakes. Water temperature, pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen were not significantly different, but conductivity was consistently higher in Lake Fayetteville. However, total biomass for standing crop of macrophytes was higher for Lake Wedington. The number of macroinvertebrates at various depths was slightly higher for Lake Wedington, and human activity due to boating and fishing was not significantly different between the two lakes. Many characteristics may influence waterbird abundance of these lakes, but siltation of Lake Fayetteville is occurring at a faster rate than Lake Wedington. This has resulted in extensive shallow areas which probably enhances availability of food for <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> birds at Lake Fayetteville...|$|R
5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for <b>feeding</b> at sea: <b>surface</b> <b>feeding,</b> pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|R
25|$|Some {{species may}} show {{morphological}} adaptations, {{such as a}} flat head and an upturned mouth, {{that allow them to}} perform ASR without breaking the water surface (which would make them more visible to aerial predators). One example is the mummichog, whose upturned mouth suggests <b>surface</b> <b>feeding,</b> but whose feeding habits are not particularly restricted to the surface. In the tambaqui, a South American species, exposure to hypoxia induces within hours the development of additional blood vessels inside the lower lip, enhancing its ability to take up oxygen during ASR. Swimming upside down may also help fishes perform ASR, as in some upside-down catfish.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} communications (Bhimachar, 1935, 1937) it {{was pointed}} out that the <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> cyprinoids such as the species of Rasbora, Chela, Danio and Esomus and Cyprinodontsâ€”Gambusia, Lebistis, Haplochilus and Panchax possess a remarkably well-developed central acoustic lobe in their brain. It was argued that the better development of the acoustic centre in these forms over other fishes which habitually five under water at the ground eve], {{is due to the fact}} that these fishes am constantly exposed to the external sounds at the surface of water and thus come to possess a keen sense of hearing...|$|R
