Many species of bird show intraspecific vocal variation due to age, sex, geographical variation and individuality. Consistent individuality of voice may exist in most {{species of birds}} and may provide a useful tool {{in the study and}} management of species that should not be caught (e. g. rare or endangered species). Individuals of an island population of the Sacred Kingfisher Halcyon sancta were recorded over three breeding seasons to demonstrate that individuals can be recognised and censuses of individuals conducted by comparisons of <b>sonagraph</b> tracings. The simplicity and efficiency of this technique for use with rare species is discussed...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} the microevolutionary and ontogenetic processes that modify the behaviour of grassfinches variation in the structure, function and frequency of call‐notes was studied in captive and free‐living birds. 94 wild‐caught birds and 149 aviary‐reared offspring of the Poephila subgenus were studied; they belonged to three species each of which consisted of two races which together exhibit a spectrum of evolving forms. The calls were analyzed on a <b>sonagraph.</b> The size of the repertoire differed between the species and within one of them. Variation in the contact calls correlated with variation in colours of beak and plumage. The adult calls developed from the juvenile begging calls. 1975 Blackwell Verlag Gmb...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince the vocalisations of {{passerine}} {{birds are}} in general a good means to separate taxa when external morphological differences are few, song and call recordings of 33 treecreeper (Certhia) taxa were <b>sonagraphed</b> and their parameters analysed. The vocalisations show low intra-individual and intra-population variation. Phylogenetic evolutionary units at the population level were delimited by time, frequency and syntax parameters {{by means of}} principal-component and discriminant analyses. Traits of territorial song were traced on a phylogenetic tree based on cytochrome b sequences, and a mean acoustic character difference was calculated. All presently recognised nine species could be distinguished clearly from one another by their vocalisations. Subspecies {{not included in the}} molecular phylogeny are affiliated with the correct species based on statistical analysis. The obvious subdivision of Certhia species into two groups according to the syntax of their song verses, trill and motif singers, is corroborated by different findings: a high phylogenetic signal in the characters concerned (highest homoplasy index values for trill characters), discriminant analyses for song and call measurements, and a cladistic analysis based on song characters. Innate calls turned out to be less suitable for studies at a low taxonomic level than learnt territorial songs, which require social interactions for their species-specific formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} {{components of}} natural electromagnetic noises of ELF were observed {{by using a}} ball antenna, and the power spectra of the earth-ionosphere cavity resonances were produced by using a <b>sonagraph.</b> The peak frequencies and the band widths of 3 db down from the peak were read from over 2000 spectra thus produced in the period from February 1967 to January 1968, and Q factors of the resonances were estimated to be 3. 30, 4. 52, and 4. 92 for the fundamental, second, and third modes respectively. Comparing these values with the previous experimental and theoretical values it is concluded that {{the greater part of}} resonant energy is dissipated in the region of ionic conductivity below 56 km. An inverse relation between Q factors and solar activity was found and it is concluded from this that the effective height of the upper boundary of the cavity decreases as the sun becomes active. It is suggested that the sun may have some effect in modifying the conductivity profile below 56 km of the atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 60 - 63) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the vocal communication system of the California ground squirrel, Spermophilus beecheyi. Tape recordings of the sounds of marked squirrels were made in the field, while concurrent notes were taken on the behavior of the animals; feeding boxes were used for intensifying interactions among individuals. Supplementary data were collected from captive squirrels. The recordings were analyzed with a <b>sonagraph.</b> On the basis of their physical properties, vocalizations fell into six distinct groups: chatters, squeals, grunts, whistles, screams and tooth chatter. By combination and repetition of these sounds, the use of the same sounds in different contexts, and the use of graded signals, the number of messages used for communication was increased. Two types of alarm calls were given in response to predators: squeal indicated an immediate alarm; a long call (chatters followed by repeated signals) served as an alerting signal for less immediate danger. Females were found to be more alert than males and gave most of the long alarm calls. A whistle was emitted during sexual chases. During agonistic encounters, grunts and chatters were used in association with dominance and a tendency to attack, while a squeal was used to indicate subordination and a tendency to flee. Some sounds (grunts, screams and tooth chatter) were found to be associated with territorial defense...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThere is a {{requirement}} to digitize certain wide-band analog signals in telemetry applications. Typically, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with eight or more bits of resolution is used. The resulting signal requires a much larger transmission bandwidth than the original analog signal. The frequency domain information is of primary interest for many applications. In these cases, there are several methods for minimizing the transmitted bandwidth. One method is to perform fast fourier transforms (FFTs) on the signals and only transmit information about the largest signals. The disadvantages of this approach include: relatively long time delay before transmission, resolution bandwidth fixed when FFT performed (unless phase information is also transmitted), and extra complexity in the telemeter. This paper will discuss some effects of minimizing the transmitted bandwidth by quantizing to {{a small number of}} bits. The performance will also be compared with analog frequency modulation (FM). Measured performance will be presented for four different input signals and one-, three-, and eight-bit quantization. These signals are amplitude modulation, angle modulation, sum of sine waves, and frequency sweep. The test setup is shown in figure 1. The analyses presented in this paper were performed using either fast fourier transforms (FFTs) or a Kay DSP <b>Sonagraph.</b> The FFT length was 1024 points and a Hann (cosine) window was used. The analysis hardware used for these tests has an analog input, therefore, all digitized signals were converted to analog signals before analysis. The signals were low pass filtered before analysis to minimize aliasing in the analysis and display process...|$|E
40|$|Guinea pig vocalizations were investigated. The {{behaviour}} of the {{guinea pig}} {{was observed in}} a wide variety of situations, and from these samples of vocalizations were recorded, analysed on a <b>sonagraph</b> and classified on the basis of their physical structure. Eleven basic calls were isolated, these were the chut, chutter, whine, low whistle, whistle, squeal, tweet, scream, chirrup, purr and drrr. A series of playback experiments was conducted; from this, general observations and a detailed study of mother-infant interactions, five functional categories of calls were suggested. These were: calls increasing physical proximity, greeting and proximity-maintaining calls, proximity-regaining calls, distress calls and alarm calls. Within the context of maternal behaviour it was found that lactating females, unlike virgin females, responded vocally to proximity-regaining calls of infants and showed searching behaviour. Females did not appear to respond preferentially to the calls of their own young but the possibility that females recognized their own young, entirely by voice, could not be excluded. An exmaination of the ways in which vocalizations are used in mother-infant interactions indicated that the incidence of most calls made by both mothers and infants changed over the post-partum period, and in this situation specific calls were found to be associated with particular forms of behaviour. In general, vocal responsiveness of the female towards her young declined as the suckling period waned, and this paralleled a decline in other forms of maternal responsiveness. Infant animals showed no similar decrease in vocal responsiveness to the mother during the observation period. The part played by exteroceptive stimuli in controlling maternal behaviour in the guinea pig was considered and discussed in relation to other rodents...|$|E
40|$|Recently, in {{the western}} coasts cf Japan, the {{structure}} of purse seiners was changed from wooden hull to steel one. It has been stated by some fishermen that the shipborne noise of steel boats has become louder than that of wooden boats and it maight disturb fishing effects. Many reports have been published on the shipborne noise by Hashimoto, Maniwa, Nishimura, E. J. Skudrzyk, and J. H. Janssen, on the orditory sense of fish by Yoshino and others, and on the reaction of fish to the shipborne noise by E. V. Shishkova and by a working group in Norway. G. Freytagl stated that the frequency range of the shipborne noise (10 - 5, 000 cps) covered {{the whole range of}} biological sound; and that the sound pressure of a trawler's noise which depend to some extent on the motor revolution, is still more than 1 μ bar in a distance of 200 meters. On June 18, 1955, an experimental study on the shipborne noise of purse seiners was carried out in the norther waters off Hirado Island (Figs. 1, 2) to solve the above mentioned fishermen's question. The instruments principally used were a Hydrophone (OKI 57 TA), Pre-Amp (57 TA- 2), Tape-Recorders (SONY TC- 802 and FT- 2), Son-agraph (RION Soundspectrograph) used by Shibata, and Panoramic-Analyser (Panoramic Radio Products Inc.) used by Maniwa. Character-istics of those instruments are shown in Fig. 3. The acoustic pattern and section of shipborne noise analysed by means of <b>Sonagraph</b> and sound spectrum by Panoramic-Analyser are shown in Figs. 4 to 19. By those figures, it was assumed that in case of purse seiners, there are some correlation between the shipborne noise, especially singing noise, and fishing effects. It is intended to continue to persuit this problem furthermore...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} surface phonetic contrasts are actually present in the acoustic stage of the speech chain, and to define the acoustic nature of such contrasts. This is mainly a spectrographic study of the three "extreme" vowels, (/i/, /a/ and /u/) to determine some of the acoustic effects on vowels of vowel and consonant gemination in two related languages, Eskimo (Labrador Inuttut) and French (St. Pierre et Miquelon dialect). The phonological status of vowel and consonant gemination in French is quite different from their status in Eskimo. In French these processes occur across word boundaries, whereas in Eskimo they are word internal. [...] Minimal pairs in sequences of the types CVC, CVVC, CVCC, and CVVCC were recorded by two informants (one of each sex) for each dialect. The various displays available from a modified Kay <b>Sonagraph</b> provided the relevant data on vowel quantity and quality. [...] The main conclusions concerning vowel quantity are as follows: [...] (a) The vowels in the above four types of sequences are not always different in absolute duration but they always contrast in relative duration (i. e., as fractions of the duration of the total sequence). [...] (b) The gemination of a following consonant is found to have a more reducing effect on the duration of a preceding vowel in Eskimo (a language which has gemination within word boundaries) than in French (a language which has gemination across word boundaries). [...] (c) Gemination of a following consonant is found to have a greater effect on the duration of a preceding single vowel on a preceding double vowel. [...] The concepts of co-articulation effects and language-specific neutral tongue positions provided bases for tentative explanations for some of variations in duration. [...] Measurements of formant frequencies and intensities suggested the following generalizations about vowel quality: [...] (a) Whereas all three single vowels in Eskimo are more mid-central than their corresponding double correlates, this is not true for the French high-back vowel. [...] (b) The effect on its quality of the doubling of a vowel is greater than the effect of the gemination of the following consonant. [...] (c) Formant intensities provide more consistent cues than do formant frequencies for the single/double vowel distinction. [...] The final conclusion of this research is that vowel doubling has a greater effect on both vowel quantity and quality in both languages than has the gemination of the following consonant...|$|E
