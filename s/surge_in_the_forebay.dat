Migration rates decreased significantly as fish approachedthe dam. Median migration rates in 1995 were 26. 0 km/d through the 45. 9 -km reach immediatelybelow Lower Granite Dam, 14. 9 km/d through the next 14. 4 km, and 0. 8 km/d <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Little GooseDam <b>forebay</b> (0. 6 km). Median migration rates through the same reaches were consistent amongyears: 24. 8, 13. 4, and 0. 8 km/d in 1996 and 20. 2, 10. 2, and 1. 0 km/d in 1997. Most fish migratedthrough the upper 45. 9 km within 5 d and through the lower two reaches (15. 0 km) within anadditional 5 d. However, 10 % to 20 % of the fish spent {{a week or more}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> and lowerreservoir.

40|$|High summer water {{temperatures}} have caused increased juvenile fish stress in fish passage facilities at McNary Dam. The need {{to better understand}} the main mechanisms that generate high temperatures and result in subsequent harmful stress to downstream migrating fish motivates this study. Most numerical studies of temperature dynamics in reservoirs are based on one- or two-dimensional models. McNary Dam forebay is characterized by complex three-dimensional flow patterns and unsteady heat exchange between the atmosphere and water. An unsteady three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model is used in this paper to predict the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> and turbine intakes of McNary Dam. This model is based on the Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes equations, using a Boussinesq approach, with a standard k- model to solve the flow field. The thermal model takes into account the short and long wave radiation and heat convection at the free surface, which is function of air temperature and wind velocity. The predicted temperature is compared against a 24 h field data set for a warm day in 2004. Simulated and measured temperature profiles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> and within <b>the</b> gatewells show reasonable agreement. An additional simulation studies the inclusion of a thermal curtain upstream of the turbine intakes. Numerical results indicate that the thermal curtain reduces gatewell temperatures potentially increasing survival for migratory salmonids at the dam. 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|During 1983, the {{research}} program had three separate but complementary phases - monitoring current patterns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay,</b> defining fish distribution with purse seine sampling, and describing the migration routes of salmonid smolts using radio tracking techniques. Preliminary {{results from the}} radio-tracking and purse seining operations in FY 83 suggest that the discharge from the John Day River and the turbid plume it forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> may have a pronounced effect {{on the distribution of}} smolts, especially chinook and sockeye salmon, as they approach the dam. The implication of these data is that the plume may be shunting salmon toward the Washington (spill) side of the river where they would be more susceptible to spill passage. This resulted in higher spill passage of tagged chinook salmon than the proportion of water being spilled. In contrast, spillway passage of steelhead not influenced by the plume is approximately the same as the proportion of water being spilled. These findings are based on limited data and must be considered preliminary at this time. Data describing the current patterns have just recently been reduced to a usable format and have not yet been correlated with findings from radio tracking and purse seining. Such data will be incorporated into an overall analysis of the relations of current patterns and John Day River discharge to fish migration patterns.

40|$|Abstract: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last decade, CFD with {{agent-based}} models {{has emerged}} as a useful methodology to design and evaluate fishway efficiency. However, despite using sophisticated modeling approaches, actual fishway performance varies widely. For certain species, expensive operational or structural changes of the bypasses are needed after biological information became available. Understanding the behavior of targeted fish species is therefore essential in locating and designing fishway entrances. This study presents a methodology that integrates biology and engineering to link fish behavior to hydrodynamics using an inverse problem approach. Chinook and steelhead swim paths were measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> of Rocky Reach and Priest Rapids dams. 3 D CFD simulations of hydropower forebays were performed to model and fully understand the hydraulics of the system.

There are three existing power generating units, each of which is fed by an 18 -ft-diameter penstock. Provisions have been made for an additional unit to be installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future. Water is taken from Mayfield Lake, conveyed through a 37 -ft-diameter tunnel, and discharged into a forebay. There are four intake structures, one for each penstock, at the downstream end of <b>the</b> <b>forebay.</b> Presently, <b>the</b> operation is hampered at high loading conditions. It is generally believed that unstable hydraulic conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> are <b>the</b> cause of the present poor operating conditions. Strong vortices at the intakes have been observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. <b>The</b> flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forebay</b> is rough and turbulent. There are large shock waves at the pier noses, causing the water surface to fluctuate and become higher at units 42 and 43 and lower at unit 44. It is planned to add <b>the</b> fourth unit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate future. Because an additional unit would mean an increased flow requirement, it is probable that the problems stated above would worsen. For this reason, a model study has been conducted to assess the problems for the expanded operation and find means of alleviating them. A 1 : 36 scale model was constructed and tested. After calibration, the model satisfactorily reproduced the existing flow conditions. The model indicated an increase in flow distortion and in water surface instability for the planned expansion. Air-entraining vortices were observed for all flows tested without modification of the existing facilities. On the basis of the experiments with various alternatives, the following schemes are recommended to provide good flow conditions: (a) two 18 -ft-wide submerged guide vanes to be installed near the tunnel portal to redistribute the flow and improve the water surface profile and (b) a V-shaped vortex suppressor to be installed at each intake bay to eliminate the air-entraining vortices.

40|$|Abstract. —While large, {{permanent}} {{dams and}} reservoirs {{are known to}} impede smolt movements, investigations of small, temporary impoundments are scarce. Inflatable rubber bladder dams are used to create temporary impoundments worldwide, yet downstream fish passage at these structures has not been evaluated. To examine smolt emigration in a seasonal water supply reservoir and passage at a rubber dam, we tracked 110 radio-tagged steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss smolts through a 4. 5 -km free-flowing reach and an adjacent 5. 1 -km-long impoundment on the Russian River, California, during 2001, 2002, and 2004. Unlike the results of studies in other impoundments, median travel rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> free-flowing (0. 6 – 0. 8 km/h) and reservoir (1. 0 – 1. 4 km/h) reaches {{did not differ significantly}} within or among years. Smolts slowed significantly, however, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dam <b>forebay.</b> Forebay travel rates (0. 02 – 0. 1 km/h) were more than an order of magnitude lower than rates in free-flowing and reservoir reaches.

We collected acoustic imaging (Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar; DIDSON) data from February 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011 to evaluate juvenile salmonid behavior year-round <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>forebay</b> surface layer of the WTC tower (within 20 m, depth 0 - 5 m). From October 28, 2010 through January 31, 2011 a BlueView acoustic camera was also deployed in an attempt to determine its usefulness for future studies as well as augment the DIDSON data. For the DIDSON data, we processed a total of 35 separate 24 -h periods systematically covering every other week <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 -month study. Two different 24 -hour periods were processed for the BlueView data for the feasibility study. Juvenile salmonids were present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>forebay</b> of <b>the</b> WTC tower throughout 2010. The juvenile salmonid abundance index was low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring ( 50 % of total fish events). The next most common movement patterns were fish traversing along the front of the tower, east-to-west and west-to-east. The proportion of fish events seen moving into (forebay to tower) or out of (tower to <b>forebay)</b> <b>the</b> tower was generally low throughout the spring, summer, and early fall for both directions combined. From mid-December 2010 through the end of the study, the combined proportions of fish moving into and out of the tower were higher than previous months of this study. Schooling behavior was most distinct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring from late April through mid-June. Schooling events were present in 30 - 96 % of the fish events during that period, with a peak in mid-May. Schooling events were also present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer, but at lower numbers.
