5|$|A {{language}} {{which was}} the ancestor of Pochutec split from Proto-Nahuan (or Proto-Aztecan) possibly as early as AD 400, arriving in Mesoamerica a few centuries earlier than the main bulk of speakers of Nahuan languages. Some Nahuan groups migrated <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Central American isthmus, reaching as far as Nicaragua.

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{settlement}} {{period of the}} Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Civil War, Philadelphia's population continued to grow. The population grew from 565,529 in 1860 to 674,022 in 1870.

The dense population areas were not only growing north and <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River, but also moving westward across the Schuylkill River. A {{large portion of the}} growth came from immigrants, still mostly Irish and German. In 1870, twenty-seven percent of Philadelphia's population was born outside the United States.|$|E

5|$|Two roads {{ran through}} the regimental sector from the Naktong River to Changnyong.

5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There {{is evidence that}} Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E

At the intersection with West Angelsea Drive, Route 147 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues past more developments, turning to the southeast. Route 147 heads through a mix or residential and commercial establishments before ending at the intersection with New York Avenue. From here, County Route 621 continues <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> roadway as New Jersey Avenue. Route 147, along with County Route 618, provide an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47.|$|E
5|$|Bureaucratic affairs were {{completed}} during Diocletian's stay: a census took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, {{lost the ability}} to mint independently. Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of Septimius Severus, brought Egyptian administrative practices much closer to Roman standards. Diocletian travelled <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Nile the following summer, where he visited Oxyrhynchus and Elephantine. In Nubia, he made peace with the Nobatae and Blemmyes tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to Philae and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa quickly after the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met with Galerius in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|David Hudson (February 17, 1761– March 17, 1836) was an American {{businessman}} {{noted for}} founding Hudson Township, the present-day Hudson, Ohio. Hudson {{was born in}} Branford, Connecticut and lived there until the age four when {{his family moved to}} Goshen, Connecticut. He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Cuyahoga River to reach his land.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran {{east to the}} Euphrates where it {{connected}} at the city of Hīt. The route then ran <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> river toward the port of Charax Spasinu on the Persian Gulf, where Palmyrene ships traveled {{back and forth to}} India. Goods were imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, probably {{as a result of the}} Roman–Parthian Wars. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the date}} of first {{settlement}} in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The Ojibwe made {{some of the first}} maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{plans were}} made to {{construct}} a freeway, the Washington National Pike (now I-270), parallel to US 240. In 1953, the US 240 freeway was completed between MD 121 in Clarksburg and US 15 (now MD 85) in Frederick. The former alignment of US 240 between Clarksburg and Frederick was designated as US 240 Alt. A year later, the freeway was extended down to MD 118 in Germantown. At this time, the original alignment between Germantown and Frederick was designated MD 355, replacing what was US 240 between Germantown and Clarksburg and {{the entire length of}} US 240 Alt. between Clarksburg and Frederick. The US 240 freeway was extended south to MD 28 in Rockville in 1956, and MD 355 was subsequently extended <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> former alignment to the MD 28 intersection in Rockville. Also, the US 240 freeway was completed from US 15 north to US 40. In 1957, US 240 was upgraded to a divided highway between Bethesda and Rockville. The US 240 freeway was extended south to Montrose Road in 1958, resulting in MD 355 being extended <b>south</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> former alignment to Montrose Road. I-70S was designated onto the US 240 freeway in 1959. In addition, MD 355 was extended north to US 15 north of Frederick, passing through the city on Market Street, the one-way pair of Market Street northbound and Bentz Street southbound in the downtown, and Market Street to the north of downtown. The route replaced US 15/US 240 south of downtown Fredrick and US 15 north of downtown Frederick, with US 15 shifted to a bypass west of the city. In 1960, I-70S/US 240 was extended south to the Capital Beltway, and MD 355 was extended south along former US 240 between Montrose Road and the Capital Beltway.|$|E
