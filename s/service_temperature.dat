40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{pertaining to the}} creep behavior of slender pultruded fiber-reinforced polymeric (FRP) columns subjected to sustained concentric axial loading at elevated <b>service</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Six creep tests were performed on columns having a slenderness ratio of 49 at different combinations of axial load and temperature for a duration of at least 1, 000 hours. The axial loads used represented 33 %, 67 %, and 90 % of the critical buckling load for the column selected. For each load level, one test was performed at 22. 8 ℃ (73 ℉) and one test was performed at 65. 5 ℃ (150 ℉) Knife-edge end supports were utilized to simulate pinned-pinned boundary conditions. Midheight lateral deflection and axial shortening were recorded incrementally {{for the duration of}} the testing.
