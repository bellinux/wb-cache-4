5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its <b>Servo</b> <b>Drive</b> Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
50|$|A <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> {{receives}} a command signal from a control system, amplifies the signal, and transmits electric current to a servo motor {{in order to}} produce motion proportional to the command signal. Typically, the command signal represents a desired velocity, but can also represent a desired torque or position. A sensor attached to the servo motor reports the motor's actual status back to the <b>servo</b> <b>drive.</b> The <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> then compares the actual motor status with the commanded motor status. It then alters the voltage frequency or pulse width to the motor so as to correct for any deviation from the commanded status.|$|E

40|$|International audienceToday's Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) {{systems are}} {{performing}} NC programming with insufficient consideration of real machine capabilities and resulting workpiece characteristics. Computer Numerical Controls (CNCs) receive {{no information about}} actual workpiece characteristics and applied manufacturing processes. Machine and process observation are not closely coupled to the actual executed machining workingstep. STEP-NC addresses these problems by aiming at the availability of higher information content in CNCs. In this paper, a generic approach to preprocess and feed back process data from <b>servo</b> <b>drives</b> to CNCs and CAPP systems is presented. This approach rests on the application of open digital <b>servo</b> <b>drives</b> in machine tools and the design of application-dependent algorithms to process and exchange drive signals for both, online and offline optimisation of machining processes. The effects of the proposed methodology on design characteristics of open <b>servo</b> <b>drives</b> and CNC kernels {{as well as on}} the data interfaces and communication protocols between their modules and CAPP systems are focussed in this paper. The methodologies in this paper are exemplified by their application to drive-spanning process force reconstruction...|$|R

50|$|PRO {{models are}} {{high-resolution}} systems equipped with non-contact optical sensors as well, but also incorporate continuous grayscale shutters on each hammer to measure their speed and distance. The addition of continuous grayscale shutters for each hammer allows for even greater recording and performance accuracy allowing {{the user to}} natively record and playback high-resolution performances with 1024 levels of key and hammer velocity as well as 256 increments of positional pedaling using Yamaha’s proprietary XP format. ENSPIRE PRO models also utilize Yamaha’s AccuPlay technology, an advanced DSP <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> system that monitors the important mechanical elements of the piano during performance reproduction. In PRO type models, AccuPlay will monitor {{the movements of the}} keys, hammers, pedals and solenoids. Like the ST type, data fed back to the playback processor from the instrument’s sensing system is used to ensure accurate reproduction of the original performance. Currently, no other system on the market utilizes this type of technology.|$|E

The Air Force Akash launcher consists of a detachable trailer which is towed by an Ashok Leyland truck, and which can be positioned autonomously. Both the Army and Air Force launchers have three ready-to-fire Akash missiles each. The launchers can slew in both elevation and azimuth. The Army Self-Propelled Launcher (ASPL) is 360 degrees slewable and its arc in elevation is from 6 to 60 degrees. The Akash Air Force Launcher (AAFL) is 360 degree slewable, in elevation it can fire from 8 to 75 degrees in all directions depending on the mode of deployment. Akash Air force launcher features an All electro <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> system for fully automated and remote operation.|$|E
50|$|ST models {{include a}} {{non-contact}} optical sensing system, featuring continuous grayscale shutters for each key and optical window style shutters on each hammer. Optical sensors {{are also used}} for the damper, soft and sostenuto pedals. This sensor system allows the user to natively capture their own performance in standard MIDI format, {{without the need for}} external or special software. In addition, a “Silent System” that does not require special installation or instrument modification is added to allow for headphone connectivity and access to the instrument’s digital sounds, which include a special binaurally captured CFX Concert Grand sample. Because piano components and solenoids can be affected by environmental changes, a patented DSP <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> system that monitors and controls key and pedal movement to ensure accurate performance reproduction is active during playback. This DSP system provides feedback to the instrument’s processor effectively making the system a “closed-loop”. If the system detects any physical movement that does not correlate with the provided performance data, it will automatically adjust itself to correct any deviation in real-time.|$|E
