25|$|North Korea's {{relationships}} with the international community, especially South Korea, have sometimes been shaped by <b>sports</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> In the 1966 World Cup, North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team. Kim Jong-il believed that successful athletics increases {{the strength of a}} country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation. For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the 2010 World Cup. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during 2006 World Cup qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in Thailand without any fans.|$|E

40|$|To date, the {{relationship}} between <b>diplomacy</b> and international <b>sport</b> has been relatively under-theorized. This paper seeks to redress the deficiency by proposing an analytical taxonomy of the multiple convergences between international <b>sport</b> and <b>diplomacy.</b> The principal analytical distinction to be drawn is between (1) international sport consciously employed by governments {{as an instrument of}} diplomacy and (2) international-sport-as-diplomacy, the diplomatic representation, communication and negotiation between non-state actors that take place as a result of ongoing international sporting competition. By increasing understanding of the roˆles of <b>sport</b> in <b>diplomacy</b> and <b>diplomacy</b> in <b>sport,</b> the paper seeks to promote the adoption of best practices to facilitate effective use of <b>sport</b> in <b>diplomacy</b> by governments and effective use of <b>diplomacy</b> by international <b>sporting</b> bodies, and to instigate a debate between theorists and practitioners from both realms.

40|$|Has cricket {{diplomacy}} between India and Pakistan been successful? That is {{the point}} of departure for this thesis. The aim this work is three-pronged. First, it discusses the connection between sport and politics, and the relationship between <b>sport</b> and <b>diplomacy.</b> Second, it situates the case of cricket diplomacy in relation to other cases of <b>sport</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> And, finally, it identifies and discusses the particularities of the relationship between India and Pakistan and cricket <b>diplomacy.</b> <b>Sport’s</b> potential for peace has achieved an increasing amount of attention in recent years. It is considered as having ‘the power to bring people together, bridge differences, and promote communication and understanding,’ and not the least contribute to ‘lasting peace,’ in the United Nations Secretary-General’s 2006 report Sport for Development and Peace: the way forward. Sport then, or certain sports such as cricket at certain times, clearly has a significant place in contemporary social life. Cricket is a sport that permeates practically every layer of South Asian societies, and the game has occupied ‘a central place in a range of emerging positions and identities’ in the years after the countries achieved independence in the late 1940 s. The term cricket diplomacy was born in 1987 as Pakistani president Zia-ul Haq made an unexpected visit to India to watch cricket, which helped defuse a potentially explosive situation. 20 years on, cricket diplomacy is more relevant than ever, and it has played an important part in the peace process between India and Pakistan starting in 2003...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} gymnasium {{in which}} varzesh-e bastani is practiced {{is known as}} the zurkhaneh (زورخانه, also spelled zoorkhāneh and zourkhāneh), literally the [...] "house of strength". These gyms are covered structures with a single opening in the ceiling, with a sunken 1m-deep octagonal or circular pit in the center (gaud). Around the gaud is a section for the audience, one for the musicians, and one for the athletes. A portrait of Ali is hung on the wall of every zurkhāneh. An aspiring member may be a male from any social class or religion, but they must first spend at least a month watching from the audience before they can join. Traditionally, the zurkhānehs demanded no payment from their athletes, and depended instead on public donations. In return, the zurkhāneh provided community services and protection. One example is the [...] "casting of flowers" [...] ceremony in which athletes held koshti matches and other displays of strength to raise funds for the needy.

Subsequently Perry tried fix the match with Stefani. He wanted to lose as a noble thus offering his Italian opponent [...] "an honourable victory" [...] if they avoid long, wide rallies that would damage his ankle more.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the first}} time in its fifteen years of {{brilliant}} yet unsuccessful candidacies to host the Olympic Games (OG) and the Football European Championships (Euro), Turkey was admitted into the elite group of countries capable of staging sports mega-events. Although it failed in the last round for the 2020 OG (beaten by Tokyo in 2013), and for the Euro 2016 (beaten by France in 2010), it has since been tipped as the strong favourite to host Euro 2024. International matches have been simultaneously utilized by the Turkish government as an opportunity to publicly demonstrate its willingness to resolve historically problematic issues with other countries. In this paper, it will be argued that Turkey’s ambitions to host sports mega-events and its politicization of specific matches can be interpreted as a strategy of the state to diffuse a positive image at home and abroad, and consolidate its role in the region. A distinction will be made between the use of sport, more accurately football matches, as a tool of diplomacy (in which the state remains the main actor of the process in the context of bilateral relationships) and the use of sports events, which includes also the involvement of sports actors for more diffuse ends. Rather than referring to the concept of soft power, the notion of <b>sport</b> <b>diplomacy</b> will be utilised to analyse Turkey’s influence through the strategic use of sport. Specifically, through the comparative analysis of successive bid proposals to host the Istanbul Games, the AKP’s strategy to promote Turkey’s new power will be critically appraised...|$|R
