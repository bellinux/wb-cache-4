Typical major signal tones are dial tone, ringing tone, busy tone, and number unavailable tone.

In many cases, the enemies move in a {{straight}} line along a pre-determined, pseudo-three-dimensional path. Waves of enemies also often come in pairs: one group will come from the left in the distance or foreground, followed by the same type and same number of enemies coming in from the right. Due to the inability of the Mega Drive to scale sprites, enemy, landscape, and shadow sprites are pre-rendered at different sizes.|$|E

Also called synchronous radar bombing or buddy bombing, this method required the EB-66 navigator {{to use his}} K-5 radar bombing navigation system to detect the target and send a <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> to the F-105s to drop their bombs. Throughout the bombing run, the Pathfinder employed its S-band jammers to suppress radar-controlled anti-aircraft guns. Radar film coverage from Pathfinder missions was accumulated by the USAF for more sophisticated and refined targeting, bomb damage assessment and photographic reconnaissance of North Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a lineman {{tests the}} {{terminal}} equipment (telephone set) ringer by calling a ringback telephone number or a vertical service code, and then hanging up {{and waiting for}} the telephone to ring. When answering, the switch may play a low frequency <b>signal</b> <b>tone,</b> at which point the technician flashes the line (hangs up briefly) one or more times. A higher pitched tone then indicates ringback is engaged, and the technician hangs up. The phone will then ring, answering only with a verification tone when picked up. The verification tone is added so that telephone subscribers cannot easily use the ringback system as an intercom, to call other extensions of their own phone line by simply initiating a ringback test {{and waiting for the}} phone to stop ringing and converse when someone else on their own line has answered the extension.|$|E

This type of squeezing is also in principle a reversible amplification of the signal which can be undone if both the signal and idler are applied to another identical nonlinear resonator with an appropriately phase-shifted pump. The reversibility of the process implies that it can be performed without added noise.|$|E

For touchtone service, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> <b>tone</b> consisting of two simultaneous pure tone sinusoidal frequencies. The row in which the key appears determines the low-frequency component, and the column determines the high-frequency component.

This dissertation presents two experiments (an isolated word perception experiment, and a dictation experiment) aimed at discovering how Mandarin listeners deal with these reduced cues under everyday conversational conditions. It is found that detailed spectral information is far more useful {{in the perception of}} Mandarin tones—both in isolated words and in the perception of full conversational utterances—than pitch contours, and that the removal of pitch from the recordings does not greatly influence perception of the tone categories...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} channel fading of multitone {{interference}} {{on the performance}} of multiple hops per symbol fast frequency-hopped (FFH), M-ary orthogonal frequency-shift keyed (MFSK) noncoherent systems are analytically investigated. The multiple equal-power interference tones are assumed to correspond to some of the possible FFH/M-ary orthogonal signaling tones. It is also assumed that the channel fading characteristics are independent for the <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> and interference tone. We evaluate how the effect of the multitone interference fading on system performance is changed by various parameters, such as the number of interference tones, the number of hops per symbol and the modulation order.

A detailed theory of the cavity parametric amplifier perturbed by a Kerr nonlineary has been worked out by Yurke and Buks [9] and extended to the two port system measured here [18]. When comparing our measurements to this theory we could produce excellent agreement between the theory and experiment by adjusting {{the parameters of the}} theory [19, 20]. Here we extend this analysis to measurements of noise. We also present measurements of higher order intermodulation products forming a frequency comb of response near resonance. These products are typically not looked for in experiments on parametric amplification, but we found significant power at these frequencies, especially when measuring de-amplification of a <b>signal</b> <b>tone.</b> We speculate that this higher order intermodulation is responsible {{for not being able to}} efficiently squeeze with our amplifier.|$|E

40|$|In {{the program}} {{controlled}} exchange technology college course, the signal transmission and voice data {{exchange for the}} communication system were usually achieved by utilizing the program controlled telephone exchange equipment choosing MT 8980 series chip as the processing core which {{was limited to the}} numbers of communication channels and inflexibility of information interchange manners. A variety of extern circuits, taking time slice generation circuit and tone signal generation circuit as examples, will even be required which directly causes the complexity of the whole structure.

40|$|Neuronal {{plasticity}} {{that develops}} in the cortex during learning {{is assumed to}} represent memory content, but the functions of such plasticity are actually unknown. The shift in spectral tuning in primary auditory cortex (A 1) to the frequency of a tone signal is a compelling candidate for a substrate of memory because it has all of the cardinal attributes of associative memory: associativity, specificity, rapid induction, consolidation, and long-term retention. Tuning shifts increase the representational area of the signal in A 1, as an increasing function of performance level, suggesting that area encodes the magnitude of acquired stimulus significance. The present study addresses {{the question of the}} specific function of learning-induced associative representational plasticity. We tested the hypothesis that specific increases in A 1 representational area for an auditory signal serve the mnemonic function of enhancing memory strength for that signal. Rats were trained to bar-press for reward contingent on the presence of a <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> (5. 0 kHz), and assessed for memory strength during extinction. The amount of representational area gain for the signal frequency band was significantly positively correlated with resistance to extinction to the signal frequency in two studies that spanned the range of task difficulty. These findings indicate that specific gain in cortical representational area underlies the strength of the behaviorally-relevant contents of memory. Thus, mnemonic functions of cortical plasticity are determinable...|$|E

40|$|Harmonic {{complexes}} with identical component {{frequencies and}} amplitudes but different phase spectra may be differentially effective as maskers. Such harmonic waveforms, constructed with {{positive or negative}} Schroeder phases, have similar envelopes and identical long-term power spectra, but the positive Schroeder-phase waveform is typically a less effective masker than the negative Schroeder-phase waveform. These masking differences {{have been attributed to}} an interaction between the masker phase spectrum and the phase characteristic of the basilar membrane. To explore this relationship, the gradient of stimulus phase change across masker bandwidth was varied by systematically altering the Schroeder-phase algorithm. Observers detected a <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> added in-phase to a single component of a masker whose frequencies ranged from 200 to 5000 Hz, with a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz. For signal frequencies of 1000 - 4000 Hz, differences in masking across the harmonic complexes could be as large as 5 - 10 dB for phase gradients changing by only 10 %. The phase gradient that resulted in a minimum amount of masking varied with signal frequency, with low frequencies masked least effectively by stimuli with rapidly changing component phases and high frequencies masked by stimuli with more shallow phase gradients. A gammachirp filter was implemented to model these results, predicting the qualitative changes in curvature of the phase-by-frequency function estimated from the empirical data. In some cases, small modifications to the gammachirp filter produced better quantitative predictions of curvature changes across frequency, but this filter, as implemented here, was unable to accurately represent all the data...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to propose and test an {{experimental}} design enabling to synchronize simultaneously both signal- and movement-related processes in a simple sensorimotor task. Seventeen healthy volunteers were asked to flex their right wrist after the presentation of an auditory <b>signal</b> (<b>tone</b> burst of 1 kHz, 200 ms duration; intersignal interval be-tween 7 - 9 s). In total, 2179 collected records were divided according to the same length of the signal-movement interval into 38 time groups and the average curve for each time group was calculated. The event-related potential from all these time groups exhibited two prominent negative waves over the frontocentral region. The first one, with a mean peak laten-cy of 110 ms, exhibited characteristics of the N 1 component of cortical auditory evoked potential. Analysis of data con-cerning the second negative wave pointed to its dependence on both sensory and motor underlying processes. The in-creasing slope of the wave represented its sensory part. It started in all the time groups approximately at the same time points and was not influenced by variations of S-R interval. An estimate of its peak latency was approximately 400 ms. In time groups with S-R intervals shorter than 300 ms this N 400 component was located on the time axis after the move-ment, i. e. when the instructed task had already been accomplished.

40|$|Observers deteeted unidireetional {{motion of}} isotropie dot {{patterns}} following exposure to (1) broadband noise eontaining all direetions of motion, or (2) noise from whieh eertain sets of direetion had been filtered. The amount of masking varied with {{the set of}} directions filtered from the noise, yielding broad directional tuning functions. The breadth of an observers's tuning funetion corresponded to the precision with which the observer could recognize small differenees in direction of motion. Many studies of sensory function require an observer to detect signals {{in the presence of}} noise injected into his sensory system by the experimenter. With properly controlled variation in the noise's characteristies, this technique assumes great analytie power. For example, in audition, Fleteher (1940) developed the critical band concept from his demonstration that only those components of broadband noise which were spectrally proximate to the frequency of some test tone were effective in masking that tone. More recently, Patterson (1976) extended Fletcher's approach by centering a notch in the broadband noise spectrum on the <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> frequency and measuring the tone's threshold as a function of notch width. Armed with certain reasonable assumptions, Patterson was able to refine previous estimates of the frequency-selectivity of auditory mechanisms responsible for the detection of various test frequencies. Since this approach has such proven power, we decided to apply it to the study of visual, directionally selective mechanisms. Our basie analytic tool was broadband visual noise composed either of all directions of motion or of some limited set of directions. We compared the ability of these two types of noise to mask or reduce the visibility of motion in a partieular test direction. This allowed us to define the directional selectivity of the visual mechanisms whieh detected the test motion. Recent human psychophysical experiments converge on a unified model of motion detection in which mechanisms, each sensitive to a limited range of directions, play a key role. The psychophysical experiments contributing to the model have used...|$|E

The maskers consisted of eight 30 ms bursts of random-frequency <b>tones.</b> The <b>signal,</b> when present, occupied the central six bursts and was centered at 1000 Hz.

The total number of tones in each burst, m, was varied to determine detection threshold. The detectability of the signal pattern declined as the frequency range of the signal pattern increased, and when the signal was random. Relative weights {{as a function of}} time and frequency, interpreted as listeners’ internal templates, depended systematically on the properties of the signal pattern tested.
