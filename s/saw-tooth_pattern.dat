40|$|Here {{we would}} like to {{introduce}} a new model for proteins which is based on their geometrical features. We consider a chain of solid planar peptide units that can rotate around two axes as it has been suggested by Ramachandran. This can be done simply by fine-graining the Freely Rotating Chain model {{in a way that it}} also includes also C and N atoms but Cα atoms remain the only points of rotations. However this is a general model that can be applied on many problems of protein folding, in this work we only intend to study the stretching of Titin in order to test our model. The advantage of this model is that there is no need to any unphysical fitting parameter, although it still very simple. The results of our Monte Carlo simulations fit well to the experimental data without any further manipulation. Furthermore, we produce the correct <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>patterns</b> only by assuming that peak to peak distance shows the difference between size of an unfolded domain with the folded one. Then we approximate the end-to-end distance of folded Ig 27 domain of Titin (about 5. 0 nm) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of a Cooper Pair Box (CPB) that is coupled to charge fluctuators that reside in the dielectric barrier layer in the box's ultra-small tunnel junction. We derive the Hamiltonian of the combined system and find the coupling between the CPB and the fluctuators as well as a coupling between the fluctuators that is due to the CPB. We then find the energy levels and transition spectrum numerically for the case of a CPB coupled to a single charge fluctuator, where we treat the fluctuator as a two-level system that tunnels between two sites. The resulting spectra show the usual transition spectra of the CPB plus distinctive transitions due to excitation of the fluctuator; the fluctuator transitions are 2 -e periodic and resemble <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>patterns</b> when plotted {{as a function of the}} gate voltage applied to the box. The combined CPB fluctuator spectra show small second-order avoided crossings with a size that depends on the gate voltage. Finally, we discuss how the microscopic parameters of the model, such as the charge times the hopping distance, the tunneling rate between the hopping sites, and the energy difference between the hopping sites, can be extracted from CPB spectra, and why this yields more information than can be found from similar spectra from phase qubits...|$|R

When expressed in non-dimensional form, the structure duration probability distribution for the maize canopy was about a decade larger than for the forest canopy, with the orchard canopy intermediate. The mean eddy duration versus wind shear relation falls on a narrow band for all three canopies, indicating that wind shear at the canopy top is the determining factor for the scale of the coherent eddies. The inverse of duration and intermittency of coherent structures exhibits a tendency of independence from wind shear at higher wind shear values. Coherent structures transport heat in a more efficient way than do smaller scale, less coherent motions.

40|$|Accurate {{age control}} of the late Tortonian to early Messinian (8. 3 - 6. 0 Ma) is {{essential}} to ascertain the origin of benthic foraminiferal d 18 O trends and the late Miocene carbon isotope shift (LMCIS), and to examine temporal relationships between the deep-sea, terrasphere and cryosphere. The current Tortonian-Messinian Geological Time Scale (GTS 2012) is based on astronomically calibrated Mediterranean sections; however, no comparable non-Mediterranean stratigraphies exist for 8 - 6 Ma suitable for testing the GTS 2012. Here, we present the first high-resolution, astronomically tuned benthic stable isotope stratigraphy (1. 5 kyr resolution) and magnetostratigraphy from a single deep-sea location (IODP Site U 1337, equatorial Pacific Ocean), which provides unprecedented insight into climate evolution from 8. 3 - 6. 0 Ma. The astronomically calibrated magnetostratigraphy provides robust ages, which differ by 2 - 50 kyr relative to the GTS 2012 for polarity Chrons C 3 An. 1 n to C 4 r. 1 r, and eliminates the exceptionally high South Atlantic spreading rates based on the GTS 2012 during Chron C 3 Bn. We show that the LMCIS was globally synchronous within 2 kyr, and provide astronomically calibrated ages anchored to the GPTS for its onset (7. 537 Ma; 50 % from base Chron C 4 n. 1 n) and termination (6. 727 Ma; 11 % from base Chron C 3 An. 2 n), confirming that the terrestrial C 3 :C 4 shift could not have driven the LMCIS. The benthic records show that the transition into the 41 -kyr world, when obliquity strongly influenced climate variability, already occurred at 7. 7 Ma and further strengthened at 6. 4 Ma.

Electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation were performed. A total of 3 sustained ATs (AT 1 –AT 3) were induced.

Accuracy of CARTO 3 in three-dimensional reconstruction was sufficient to elucidate anatomical features (including catheter sites, incision, and low voltage areas) and macroreentrant circuits. However, conventional mapping techniques were also necessary to identify the mechanism of the tachycardias, and therefore to eliminate all of them successfully.

40|$|Basin {{management}} {{demands a}} sound understanding of sediment dynamics, particularly in Mediterranean mountain catchments with badlands, which affect water bodies and freshwater ecosystems. Connectivity {{has emerged as}} a framework for understanding how sediments move between geomorphic zones. We analyse the feasibility of excess lead- 210 (210 Pbex) to study sediment connectivity in a 4 -km 2 Mediterranean mountain basin with badlands (Vallcebre research catchments, Eastern Pyrenees) by applying mass-balance models for hypothesis generation and experimental testing. Badlands in the area are weathered by freezing during the winter and are eroded in summer by high-intensity showers. The eroded sediments may remain deposited within the streams from months to years. Application of 210 Pbex balance models in our basin suggests: (i) a <b>saw-tooth</b> seasonal <b>pattern</b> of badland surface 210 Pbex activities (increasing from October to May, and depleted in summer) and (ii) a downstream increase in sediment activity due to fallout lead- 210 accumulation in stream-bed sediment deposits. Our experimental results (obtained during 2013 and 2014) showed low sediment 210 Pbex concentrations, illustrating the fresh-rock origin of sediments, but also hampering their study due to high measurement uncertainty (especially for sediments with d 50 > 20 μm) and dependence on sampling methods. Suspended sediment 210 Pbex activity reproduced the simulated seasonal activity patterns for the badland surfaces. However, sediment activity decreased downstream, suggesting that flushing of fine sediments by flooding prevents fallout lead- 210 accumulation on the stream bed. Overall, high sediment connectivity was revealed between the badlands, streams and outlet of the basin, as well as the fast transmission of 210 Pbex by the finest sediment fraction. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this work, we have studied the magnetic properties of Fe 1 -xGax epitaxial films deposited onto ZnSe/GaAs (100) {{as a function of}} both the film thickness and the Ga concentration, by means of Brillouin Ligth Scattering (BLS) and Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM). Thinnest fi lms show an in-plane magnetic anisotropy resulting from the superposition of a biaxial term, typical of the bulk Fe, and a uniaxial anisotropy with the easy axis along the [1 - 10] direction. We found the intensity of the in-plane anisotropy decreases on increasing both the film thickness and the Ga concentration. In particular, for a Fe 0. 80 Ga 0. 20 72 nm thick we observed an in-plane isotropic behaviour. MFM measurements have pointed out the presence of stripe domain patterns at remanence for films with Gallium concentration greater than 14 % and a thickness of 72 nm. In-field MFM has been employed to perform experiments of domains rotation: after the induction of stripes by the application of a field (up to 3 kOe) along a preferred orientation of the crystal, the rotation process has been produced by the application of another field placed at 45 or 90 degrees from the first one and followed by detecting the MFM signal at different field intensities. Depending on the specific orientations considered, we have observed coherent rotation of linear stripes together with transitions from stripes to labyrinth domain <b>patterns</b> or <b>saw-tooth</b> zig-zag periodic <b>patterns.</b> The stripes period was on the average of 120 nm.

40|$|DoctorIn early 2001, the {{superconductivity}} {{was discovered}} in magnesium diboride (MgB 2). This compound was paid much attention because it had transition temperature as high as 40 K although it has very simple structure. This magnesium diboride also has a relatively high upper critical field up to 50 T and a very high critical current density (Jc ~ 107 A/cm 2). Due to the high Jc, Hc and Tc, MgB 2 attracts much attention for the industrial application. But ironically, such high critical current density makes an unexpected phenomenon called by the vortex avalanche which reduce its Jc and generate unexpected noise in low temperature (T < 15 K) and low magnetic field (H < 2000 Oe) region. This {{may be caused by}} its high Jc, which in turn produces high Joule heating coupled with an induced electric field. A stable high Jc under the various external conditions is essential for practical applications of superconducting thin films. Therefore, the removal of the dendritic avalanche is important to recover the high critical current density. In this thesis, I studied the vortex avalanche while changing the various external parameters for four different categories and investigated its origin. First subject was about the demagnetization effect. While I changed the width of MgB 2 thin film, the appearance of a vortex avalanche showed also different behaviors. As the sample’s width becomes smaller, the avalanche behavior is also reduced and disappears below threshold width. And I also investigated the microscopic features of the vortex avalanche having the dendritic shape in various widths of samples. These results showed that the vortex avalanche strongly depends on the demagnetization effect. Secondly, I considered the gold coating effect on the film to eliminate the vortex avalanche. It is known that a metal coating on a superconducting film can suppress such instability while dissipating the thermal energy to metal layer. I also found that the eddy current shielding can suppress the vortex avalanche. For this study, I checked the eddy current effect by designing the special geometry and found that it can be also another reason to suppress the vortex avalanche. Next, I studied the vortex avalanche for the MgB 2 thin films prepared by different methods. One was produced by using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system and another MgB 2 thin film was synthesized by using the hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) method in which the avalanche behavior did not appear. To find the origin of such difference, I compared the two cases and confirmed that their microstructure which can induce the vortex avalanche differs to each other. Lastly, I studied the effect of the sweeping rate of an applied magnetic field in vortex avalanche. As the sweeping rate goes to fast, the stronger vortex avalanche behavior was appeared and showed <b>saw-tooth</b> like <b>patterns</b> of the flux jumps observed in a very slow sweeping rate. Using these results, I could obtain the phase diagram which distinguishes the stable and the vortex avalanche phase in magnetic field and temperature (H-T) axis...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the mineralogical {{controls}} on radiogenic chronometers {{is a fundamental}} aspect of all geochronological tools. As with other common dating tools, {{it has become increasingly}} clear that the Re-Os system can be impacted by multiple mineral formation events. The accessory and micrometric nature of the Re-Os-bearing minerals has made assessing this influence complex. This is especially evident in cratonic peridotites, where long residence times and multiple metasomatic events have created a complex melting and re-enrichment history. Here we investigate a harzburgitic peridotite from the Bultfontein kimberlite (South Africa) which contains sub-micron Pt-Fe-alloy inclusions within base metal sulphides (BMS). Through the combination of the focused ion beam lift-out technique and low blank mass spectrometry we were able to remove and analyse the Pt-Fe-alloy inclusions for their Re-Os composition and highly siderophile element (HSE) systematics. Six repeats of the whole-rock yield 187 Os/ 188 Os compositions of 0. 10893 - 0. 10965, which correspond to Re depletion model ages (TRD) of 2. 69 - 2. 79 Ga. The Os, Ir and Pt concentrations are slightly variable across the different digestions, whilst Pd and Re remain constant. The resulting HSE pattern is typical of cratonic peridotites displaying depleted Pt and Pd. The Pt-Fe-alloys have PUM-like 187 Os/ 188 Os compositions of 0. 1294 ± 24 (2 -s. d.) and 0. 1342 ± 38, and exhibit a <b>saw-tooth</b> HSE <b>pattern</b> with enriched Re and Pt. In contrast, their BMS hosts have unradiogenic 187 Os/ 188 Os of 0. 1084 ± 6 and 0. 1066 ± 3, with TRD ages of 2. 86 and 3. 09 Ga, similar to the whole-rock systematics. The metasomatic origin of the BMS is supported by (i) the highly depleted nature of the mantle peridotite and (ii) their Ni-rich sulphide assemblage. Occurrence of Pt-Fe-alloys as inclusions within BMS grains demonstrates the genetic link between the BMS and Pt-Fe-alloys and argues for formation during a single but continuous event of silicate melt percolation. While the high solubility of HSE within sulphide mattes rules out early formation of the alloys from a S-undersaturated silicate melt and subsequent scavenging in a sulphide matte, the alignment of the Pt-Fe-alloy inclusions attests that they are exsolutions formed during the sub-solidus re-equilibration of the high temperature sulphide phases. The significant difference in 187 Os/ 188 Os composition between the included Pt-Fe-alloys and their BMS host can only be accounted for by different Re/Os. This suggests that the formation of Pt-Fe-alloy inclusions within a BMS can result in the fractionation of Re from Os. A survey experiment examining the partitioning of Re and Os confirmed this observation, with the Re/Os of the Pt-Fe-alloy inclusion up to ten times higher than the co-existing BMS. This fractionation implies that, when Re is present in the sulphide melt, the TRD ages of BMS containing alloy inclusions do not date the loss of Re due to partial melting, but rather its fractionation into the Pt-Fe-alloys. As such, BMS ages should be used with caution when dating ancient partial melting events. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Uniquely in the Southern Hemisphere the New Zealand micro-continent {{spans the}} {{interface}} between a subtropical gyre and the Subantarctic Circumpolar Current. Its 20 ° latitudinal extent includes a complex of submerged plateaux, ridges, saddles and basins which, in the present interglacial, are partial barriers to circulation and steer the Subtropical (STF) and Subantarctic (SAF) fronts. This configuration offers a singular opportunity to assess the influence of bottom topography on oceanic circulation through Pleistocene glacial - interglacial (G/I) cycles, {{its effect on the}} location and strength of the fronts, and its ability to generate significant differences in mixed layer thermal history over short distances. For this study we use new planktic foraminiferal based sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates spanning the past 1 million years from a latitudinal transect of four deep ocean drilling sites. We conclude that: 1. the effect of the New Zealand landmass was to deflect the water masses south around the bathymetric impediments; 2. the effect of a shallow submerged ridge on the down-current side (Chatham Rise), was to dynamically trap the STF along its crest, {{in stark contrast to the}} usual glacial-interglacial (G-I) meridional migration that occurs in the open ocean; 3. the effect of more deeply submerged, downstream plateaux (Campbell, Bounty) was to dynamically trap the SAF along its steep southeastern margin; 4. the effects of saddles across the submarine plateaux was to facilitate the development of jets of subtropical and subantarctic surface water through the fronts, forming localized downstream gyres or eddies during different phases in the G-I climate cycles; 5. the deep Pukaki Saddle across the Campbell-Bounty Plateaux guided a branch of the SAF to flow northwards during each glacial, to form a strong gyre of circumpolar surface water in the Bounty Trough, especially during the mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MIS 22 - 16) when exceptionally high SST gradients existed across the STF; 6. the shallower Mernoo Saddle, at the western end of the Chatham Rise, provided a conduit for subtropical water to jet southwards across the STF in the warmest interglacial peaks (MIS 11, 5. 5) and for subantarctic water to flow northwards during glacials; 7. although subtropical or subantarctic drivers can prevail at a particular phase of a G-I cycles, it appears that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the main influence on the regional hydrography. Thus complex submarine topography can affect distinct differences in the climate records over short distances with implications for using such records in interpreting global or regional trends. Conversely, the local topography can amplify the paleoclimate record in different ways in different places, thus enhancing its value for the study of more minor paleoceanographic influences that elsewhere are more difficult to detect.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the dynamic model and motion simulation for propeller-driven USM underwater glider with independently controllable wings and rudder. The underwater glider {{is a highly}} efficient autonomous underwater vehicle which glides through the ocean water column in <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern.</b> It uses buoyancy for propulsion by controlling ballast pump and internal moving mass. However, in our research work, we attempt to design an underwater glider which can be driven by buoyancy or propeller, and the external actuators (wings and rudder) can be controlled independently. We have designed the mathematical model and studied the dynamic characteristics of USM underwater glider. The simulation results demonstrate the motion of propeller-driven USM underwater glider based on different angles of wings and rudder. The results show the position of glider, linear and angular velocities of the glider, angle of attack and glider speed. With the resulting glider behavior in this open loop control output, we will extend the control approach {{in order to create}} an efficient biologically inspired control algorithm for an optimized hybrid-driven USM underwater glider...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} the clinical and radiographic joint phenotype in erosive hand osteoarthritis (EHOA) and non-EHOA. METHODS: A total of 446 patients with HOA (233 with EHOA and 213 with non-EHOA) were evaluated. Demographic (sex and age at disease onset), clinical (body mass index {{and distribution of}} nodes), and radiographic features (Kellgren/Lawrence and Kallman's scores obtained from radiographs of both hands) from all patients were recorded. RESULTS: Patients with EHOA had a significantly earlier disease onset. Clinical and radiographic distribution of structural damage in the distal interphalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and first carpometacarpal joints was similar in EHOA and non-EHOA. EHOA patients showed higher percentages of nodes and more severe radiographic scores; the more severe radiographic score of joints with nodes was due to both osteophytes and joint space narrowing (JSN). A direct correlation between osteophytes and JSN scores was observed. Central erosions (CE) were more prevalent in the DIP joints than in the PIP joints. Gull-wing pattern of CE was prevalent in the DIP joints, whereas <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern</b> was prevalent in the PIP joints. Marginal erosions (ME) were present in 100...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{adhesive}} {{and mechanical}} properties of a cell-substratum adhesive secreted by live diatom cells {{were examined in}} situ using atomic force microscopy. The resulting force curves have a regular <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern,</b> the characteristic fingerprint of modular proteins, and when bridged between tip and surface can repeatedly be stretched and relaxed resulting in precisely overlaying saw-tooth curves (up to ∼ 600 successive cycles). The average rupture force of the peaks is 0. 794 ± 0. 007 (mean±SE) nN at a loading rate of 0. 8 μm/s and the average persistence length is 0. 026 ±< 0. 001 (mean±SE) nm (fit using the worm-like chain model). We propose that we are pulling on single adhesive nanofibers, each a cohesive unit composed of a set number of modular proteins aligned in register. Furthermore, we can observe and differentiate when up to three adhesive nanofibers are pulled based upon multimodal distributions of force and persistence length. The high force required for bond rupture, high extensibility (∼ 1. 2 μm), and the accurate and rapid refolding upon relaxation, together provide strong and flexible properties ideally suited for the cell-substratum adhesion of this fouling diatom and allow us to understand the mechanism responsible for the strength of adhesion...|$|E

40|$|The RecA {{filament}} {{formed on}} double-stranded (ds) DNA is proposed to be a functional state analogous to that generated {{during the process}} of DNA strand exchange. RecA polymerization and de-polymerization on dsDNA is governed by multiple physiological factors. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these factors regulate the processes of polymerization and de-polymerization of RecA filament on dsDNA is still evolving. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature, pH, tensile force, and DNA ends (in particular ssDNA overhang) on the polymerization and de-polymerization dynamics of the E. coli RecA filament at a single-molecule level. Our results identified the optimal conditions that permitted spontaneous RecA nucleation and polymerization, as well as conditions that could maintain the stability of a preformed RecA filament. Further examination at a nano-meter spatial resolution, by stretching short DNA constructs, revealed a striking dynamic RecA polymerization and de-polymerization induced <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern</b> in DNA extension fluctuation. In addition, we show that RecA does not polymerize on S-DNA, a recently identified novel base-paired elongated DNA structure that was previously proposed to be a possible binding substrate for RecA. Overall, our studies have helped to resolve several previous single-molecule studies that reported contradictory and inconsistent results on RecA nucleation, polymerization and stability. Furthermore, our findings also provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms of Rec...|$|E
40|$|During {{demanding}} voluntary contractions (e. g., high {{force or}} fatigue), activation is {{not restricted to}} the target muscle but extends to other ipsilateral muscles; even contralateral muscles become activated. The contralateral "irradiation" of activity was measured in five subjects during submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) (index finger abduction) and during unfatigued and fatigued conditions. All subjects were tested five times {{with at least one}} week between tests. Unilateral MVCs were associated with a substantial amount of contralateral FDI activation [mean = 7. 9 +/- 6. 7 % (SD) MVC prior to fatigue]. The amount of such contralateral irradiation was significantly different between different individuals and was positively correlated between dominant and nondominant hands. During fatigue tests, the contractile activity of the contralateral "nontarget" index finger showed progressive increase (force, electromyogram) as was measured during both the submaximal task and interspersed MVCs of the target finger. In addition, a superimposed <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern</b> of intermittently waxing and waning contractions commonly appeared contralaterally. The expression of contralateral irradiation force was itself fatigue-sensitive: less irradiation was seen in a recently fatigued muscle than was seen before the fatigue test. These fatigue effects could not be explained as having been caused by changes in muscle properties. Possible anatomical sites of contralateral irradiation are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tidal bars in {{estuaries}} {{are poorly}} understood compared to fluvial bars. There is limited theory that predicts tidal bar dimensions. Moreover, where fluvial channels bifurcate around bars, tidal channels around bars often develop either flood- or ebb-dominance which remains unexplained. Tidal experiments are rare {{and have not}} reproduced these phenomena to date because these are usually highly ebb-dominated. Here we report preliminary experiments in a novel setup that produce tidal bars from an initial situation with flat bed and exactly symmetrical ebb- and flood-related sediment mobility. The bars initially develop in a <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern</b> with mutually evasive ebb- and flood channels. The tips of the bars evolve further into lobate bars built up from sediment from excavating channels. The bar tips form steep and high obstructions for the opposing flow direction, which then diverges into evasive channels. The bars develop into a diamond shape as channels bifurcate and deepen around it. We further found that bar height correlates well to bar width but not with bar length, whilst bar length correlates well to the tidal excursion length. As the experiment progressed scour holes developed that affected the channel and bar pattern and are considered artifacts of the experiment. We conclude that the mutually evasive ebb- and flood-dominance of channels emerges simultaneously {{with the onset of}} tidal bar formation, and that these preliminary data confirm results from linear stability analyses. The results are proof of principle for the novel experimental setup for tidal systems...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{forces in}} sarcomeres are mainly {{related to the}} giant protein titin. Titin's {{extensible}} region consists of spring-like elements acting in series. In skeletal muscles these elements are the PEVK segment, two distinct immunoglobulin (Ig) domain regions (proximal and distal), and a N 2 A portion. While distal Ig domains are thought to form inextensible end filaments in intact sarcomeres, proximal Ig domains unfold in a force- and time-dependent manner. In length-ramp experiments of single titin strands, sequential unfolding of Ig domains leads to a typical <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern</b> in force-elongation curves which can be simulated by Monte Carlo simulations. In sarcomeres, where {{more than a thousand}} titin strands are arranged in parallel, numerous Monte Carlo simulations are required to estimate the resultant force of all titin filaments based on the non-uniform titin elongations. To simplify calculations, the stochastic model of passive forces is often replaced by linear or non-linear deterministic and phenomenological functions. However, new theories of muscle contraction are based on the hypothesized binding of titin to the actin filament upon activation, and thereby on a prominent role of the structural properties of titin. Therefore, these theories necessitate a detailed analysis of titin forces in length-ramp experiments. In our study we present a simple and efficient alternative to Monte Carlo simulations. Based on a structural titin model, we calculate the exact probability distributions of unfolded Ig domains under length-ramp conditions needed for rigorous analysis of expected forces, distribution of unfolding forces, etc. Due to the generality of our model, the approach is applicable {{to a wide range of}} stochastic protein unfolding problems...|$|E
40|$|Astronomically tuned {{high-resolution}} climatic proxy records across marine oxygen isotope stage 100 (MIS 100) {{from the}} Italian Monte San Nicola section and ODP Leg 160 Hole 967 A are presented. These records reveal a complex pattern of climate fluctuations on both Milankovitch and sub-Milankovitch timescales that oppose or reinforce one another. Planktonic and benthic foraminiferal d 18 O records of San Nicola depict distinct stadial and interstadial phases superimposed on the <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern</b> of this glacial stage. The {{duration of the}} stadial–interstadial alterations closely resembles that of the Late Pleistocene Bond cycles. In addition, both isotopic and foraminiferal records of San Nicola reflect rapid changes on timescales {{comparable to that of}} the Dansgard–Oeschger (D–O) cycles of the Late Pleistocene. During stadial intervals winter surface cooling and deep convection in the Mediterranean appeared to be more intense, probably as a consequence of very cold winds entering the Mediterranean from the Atlantic or the European continent. The high-frequency climate variability is less clear at Site 967, indicating that the eastern Mediterranean was probably less sensitive to surface water cooling and the influence of the Atlantic climate system. Concomitant changes in the colour reflectance of ODP Site 967 and the calcium carbonate record of San Nicola probably indicate that part of the high-frequency climate variability (3 – 5 kyr) in the eastern Mediterranean is related to changes in Saharan dust supply. Evidently, enhanced dust deposition in the Mediterranean correlates with the cold intervals of the millennial-scale D–O oscillations suggesting that the Atlantic pressure system may have {{played a critical role in}} varying the wind strength and/or aridification of northern Africa...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of the {{atmospheric}} refractivity {{is important for}} the prediction of radar performance. Surface or elevated trapping layers formed by the outflow of relatively dry and warm air over a cooler body of water often result in the refractive structure-supporting–convergence-zone-like behavior and multimodal effects. The propagation under such conditions can be very sensitive to even small changes in the vertical and horizontal structure of refractivity. Obtaining in situ measurements of sufficient fidelity to estimate where intensifications in the electromagnetic field will occur is difficult. The authors previously have demonstrated the ability to infer refractivity parameters from grazing-incidence radar sea-clutter data. The radar system was the 2. 8 -GHz space range radar that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of Wallops Island, VA. The forward modeling consisted of the mapping of an 11 -parameter environmental model via an electromagnetic propagation model into the space of the radar clutter observations. A genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the objective function. Ground truth data were atmospheric soundings obtained by a helicopter flying a <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>pattern.</b> The overall result was that the ability to estimate the propagation within the duct itself was comparable to that of in situ measurements. However, the ability to characterize the region above the duct was quite poor. Modern three—dimensional radars, however, have relatively narrow beams. Using these narrow beams at multiple elevations might resolve the ambiguity leading to the poor characterization in the region above the duct. Using radar data from the SPANDAR radar, it is demonstrated that such an approach is feasible and that more-robust estimates can be obtained by using two elevation angles and/or by constraining the solution to contain realistic refractivity profiles...|$|E
