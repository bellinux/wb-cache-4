50|$|The {{scrubland}} {{is formed}} mainly of autochthonous species, like gorse, broom, <b>spurge</b> <b>flax</b> (Thymelaea), rockrose (Cistaceae), sea pink (Armeria maritima), spiny thrift (Armeria pungens), Corema album, etc.Typically the marshland flora like rushes and other {{grow in the}} area of the lagoon and the ponds.|$|E
50|$|The plants {{found in}} the coastal zone are mostly {{herbaceous}} with abundance of grasses. The most recorded species are the asphodel (a herb of family of lily), Jabule, bougainvillea and oleander. There are also many plants under cultivation such as citrus and olive. There is a narrow buffer zone along the coast where agriculture is practiced. This zone also has grass lands. Moving away from the coast, the topography changes to the Green Mountains (Libya), which rises to a height of about 800 m. Influenced by the Mediterranean climate, the region has dense forest or maquis of juniper and lentisc trees, and also brome grass, canary grass, bluegrass, and rye grass. Since rainfall in the area is scanty, the cultivated trees consists of figs and olives. In the Nafusah Plateau, grasslands form the dominant vegetation. Moving towards south of the mountain range, Sahara desert environment dominates the region with limited cultivation of palm and fig trees around springs and natural oases. Date palms (near the oases), saltwort (used for making soda ash), <b>spurge</b> <b>flax</b> shrub, goosefoot, wormwood, and asphodel, cyrenaica are also reported in the wild. Sea grass meadows are reported to cover 1500 km between the Gulf of Sirte in Libya and the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spurge</b> <b>flax</b> (Daphne gnidium L., Thymelaeaceae) is an {{evergreen}} shrub {{typical of}} the Mediterranean flora. It has been traditionally used for centuries in Spain as a control agent of invertebrate pests of crops and cattle. Previuos bioassays performed in our laboratory demonstrated that leaves and ethanolic extracts of D. gnidium showed antifeedant activity on pest species belonging to the orders Heteroptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. The elm leaf beetle, Galerucella luteola Müller (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), in Spain {{represents one of the}} most important pests of elms (Ulmus spp.) in both river bank forests and urban areas, being responsible for partial or total defoliation of the tree tops. In order to study the effects of <b>spurge</b> <b>flax</b> on G. luteola, different doses of an ethanolic extract of D. gnidium were added to the natural diet (elm leaves) of young larvae. During the development, weight changes, phase durations and mortality rates of each stage were recorded. Results showed that the addition of <b>spurge</b> <b>flax</b> extract to the diet of G. luteola induced: a) a significant increase in the duration of the larval period; b) greater mortality rates for all stages; c) weight reduction of individuals of all stages, including imagoes...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} has been {{performed on the}} activity of <b>spurge</b> <b>flax</b> (Daphne gnidium L., Thymelaeaceae), a typical component of the Mediterranean vegetation, {{on the development of}} the elm leaf beetle (Xanthogaleruca luteola Muller; Col., Chrysomelidae), one of the most serious defoliators of urban forests. Different concentrations of ethanolic extracts of D. gnidium leaves were added to the natural diet (elm leaf discs) of X. luteola, starting with L 2 larvae, and the effects induced on the vitality, growth and phase duration of the different stages have been evaluated. A significant reduction of larval survival and adult emergence, together with an increased length of the larval period, heavy reduction of weight gain and appearance of malformations in emerged imagines were observed in presence of <b>spurge</b> <b>flax</b> extracts. These findings agree to ascribe to D. gnidium leaf extracts a growth inhibitory activity and allowed identifying what should be the optimal concentration to be applied on elm leaves to prevent heavy damages by X. luteola...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Proteção das Plantas - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThis thesis {{constitutes}} {{a summary of}} my work {{for the past eight}} years. Given the different subjects that I have been involved, I selected three major lines of work to expose in this thesis, which are subdivided in four Chapters: Chapter I: “Descriptive Curriculum vitae” containing a brief presentation of the work developed, constituting a more descriptive cv, with a clear description of the projects I have been involved, techniques that I have become acquainted and a brief explanation of my responsibilities during this period. In Chapter II, entitled “Preliminary analysis of the antimicrobial protein content of the <b>Spurge</b> <b>flax</b> plant”, the antimicrobial content from the aqueous extract of the <b>Spurge</b> <b>flax</b> plant proved to be proteinaceous in nature, peptidic in size (< 3 kDa) and resistant to denaturant treatments. In Chapter III, “Agrobacterium sp. mediated transformation of four Rosa hybrida cultivars with antifungal polypeptide BLAD”, the attempt towards the genetic modification of the rose plant with a BLAD potent antifungal polypeptide, is described. The final chapter, Chapter IV, “Optimization of the heterologous expression in E. coli of the antifungal polypeptide BLAD,” describes the different approaches applied towards the soluble over-expression in E. coli of the antifungal polypeptide BLAD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Wool sample {{collected}} from thirteen Arraiolos tapestries from the 17 th – 19 th century {{belonging to the}} National Museum of Ancient Art (Lisboa, Portugal) collection were analysed to identify the natural dyes and mordants used in their making. Weld, indigo, <b>spurge</b> <b>flax,</b> brazilwood, madder and cochineal were identified in the fibres. Alum was {{the most commonly used}} mordant, but the presence of iron and zinc was also detected in some samples. Contemporary dyed fibres were used to evaluate the available methodologies for dye extraction from wool fibres. A procedure with Na 2 EDTA in water /DMF (1. 1, v/v) proved to be the most efficient for recovering the different choromophores. The Influence of mordant metal ion (aluminium, iron and cooper) and dyeing technique on the fibre hue and photodegradation was studied in contemporary wool samples dyed with madder r brazillwood. Colour hue was strongly influenced by deying methodology and alum mordanted fibres showed the poorest lightfastness...|$|E
40|$|Wool samples {{collected}} from thirteen Arraiolos carpets from the 17 th– 19 th century belonging to theNational Museum of Ancient Art (NMAA, Lisboa, Portugal) collection were analysed {{to identify the}} naturaldyes and mordants employed in the traditional dyeing process, {{in a way to}} complement and improveactual knowledge on this rugs. Natural dyes were extracted from Arraiolos historical wool fibres using amild extraction method, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array and massspectrometry detection (HPLC-DAD-MS) for compound identification. Colourimetry was used to measurecolour parameters in all historical samples. Quantification of mordants in the historical fibres was carriedout by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Weld, indigo, <b>spurge</b> <b>flax,</b> brazilwood,madder and cochineal were identified as dye sources in the fibres. Alum was the most commonly usedmordant, but the presence of iron and zinc was also detected in some darker samples. The use of madderand cochineal is not referred in the available historical dyeing recipes. This study also proved that theactual visual perception of these carpets is strongly affected by the natural dyes photodegradation, whichwas mostly unaccounted for before...|$|E
