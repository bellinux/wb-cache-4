5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever <b>seen</b> <b>for</b> an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be <b>seen</b> <b>for</b> instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E

Epistles were also written during all three dynasties of the New Kingdom.

30|$|Fractional integro-differential {{equations}} {{have been}} studied by many researchers from {{different points of view}} during the last decades (<b>see</b> <b>for</b> example, [5, 10] and [15 – 19]). In 2015, a new fractional derivation without singular kernel was introduced by Caputo and Fabrizio ([8]). Some researchers tried to use it for solving different equations (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [2, 9] and [14]). Recently, approximate solutions of some fractional differential equations have been reviewed (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [3, 4, 6, 12, 13] and [7]). Also, one is finding some new applications <b>for</b> fractional derivations (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [3]).|$|R
30|$|As we know, diverse {{classes of}} {{fractional}} differential equations {{have been studied}} by researchers (<b>see</b> <b>for</b> example, [1 – 15] and the references therein).

30|$|Nonlinear {{difference}} equations {{and systems}} have been studied {{a lot in the}} last few decades (see, e.g., [1 – 29]). Two of the topics of recent interest are symmetric and closely related systems (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [3, 6 – 12, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26 – 29]), whose investigation was considerably influenced by some papers by Papaschinopoulos and Schinas (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [8 – 10]), and the solvable difference equations and systems (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [3, 14, 18 – 22, 24 – 29] and the references therein). For some classical methods for solving the equations and systems <b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [1, 30 – 33]. It has been shown recently that many nonlinear equations and systems can be solved by transforming them to linear ones (<b>see,</b> <b>for</b> example, [3, 14, 18, 21, 24, 25] and the related references therein).|$|R

5|$|Society {{became more}} liberal (as <b>seen,</b> <b>for</b> instance, in the {{achievements}} of the Polish Film School and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a civil society started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomułka's thaw would be long over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent would end up removing Gomułka from power in 1970ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.|$|E
5|$|This process {{explains}} the accurate conservation of toolkit gene sequences, which {{has resulted in}} deep homology and functional equivalence of toolkit proteins in dissimilar animals (<b>seen,</b> <b>for</b> example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between {{two people who are}} in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses may be considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern <b>seen</b> <b>for</b> centuries among European rulers.|$|E

It was the same flag Ellsworth had <b>seen</b> <b>for</b> weeks from the White House during his visits with Lincoln. Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs.

5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts are inconsistent {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been <b>seen</b> <b>for</b> several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Baryonyx had a {{rudimentary}} secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests {{the presence of}} a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those <b>seen,</b> <b>for</b> example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.|$|E
