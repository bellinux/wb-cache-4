5|$|Al-Mansur in the {{meantime}} used his time more effectively: he mobilized troops in <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran</b> and brought them to Iraq, and recalled Isa ibn Musa from Medina to lead them. Finally, Ibrahim decided to march on Kufa, but on the way he abandoned this plan and turned back. Instead of returning to Basra, however, he encamped at Bakhamra, a location on the road between the two cities. There, on 21 January, Ibrahim with his troops, reduced by defections to some 15,000 men, confronted the Abbasid army under Isa ibn Musa. Isa's vanguard was at first beaten, but the battle ended in a crushing Abbasid victory. Ibrahim himself was heavily wounded and escaped {{with a handful of}} supporters. He died of his wounds on 14 February 763, signalling the end of the rebellion.|$|E

25|$|The {{release of}} the report {{garnered}} swift and sometimes contentious reaction from across the political spectrum.

25|$|The {{end of the}} ED is {{not defined}} archaeologically, but {{political}}ly. The conquests of Sargon and his successors upset the political equilibrium throughout Iraq, <b>Syria,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran.</b> The conquests lasted many years into the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad and built on ongoing conquests during the ED.

25|$|Cumin is a drought-tolerant, tropical, or {{subtropical}} crop. It has {{a growth}} season of 100 – 120 days. The optimum growth temperature ranges are between 25 and 30° C.

High temperature might reduce growth period and induce early ripening. In India, cumin is sown from October {{until the beginning of}} December, and harvesting starts in February. In <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran,</b> cumin is sown from mid-November until mid-December (extensions up to mid-January are possible) and harvested in June/July.|$|E

From Turkey's perspective the KDP was trying to push PKK out of North Iraq and the KUP was getting support from the PKK which was supported by <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran.</b> Turkey intervened {{on the side of}} the KDP and saw it as an opportunity to attack the PKK.

25|$|The next {{development}} was on August 23, 1994, when Syria officially linked the water {{issue to the}} PKK in the summit between Turkey, <b>Syria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Iran.</b> During this summit another interesting {{development was}} the Hatay issue, which was brought to table. While the summit was going at Damascus, the PKK was building its structure in Hatay; in July 1995, it performed its first activity there, later using this province as a base to extend its activities to Adana and Mersin; the PKK was extending to the East Mediterranean. This region {{was one of the}} centers of immigration from the southeast, and also is a temporary summer work area for the southeast region. For Turkey the region was sensitive, not because of the Kurds, but because of the Arab population. Beginning late 1995, Syrian backing of PKK operations at Hatay was perceived by Turkish governments as an active hostile threat from Syria more than the PKK. The PKK's Hatay operations ended with the undeclared war with Syria.|$|E
