30|$|In Fig.  13, {{the natural}} current {{crossing}} {{point of the}} inverter fault current appeared at 1.0018  s. The progress of the DC circuit breaker included detection, looking up the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> database, and the auxiliary switching action. Therefore, the waiting time for the DC breaker to act is the setting time minus the delay times caused by detection and looking up the database. The simulation, detection, looking-up the database and {{the action of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> were treated as instantaneous, namely, they were completed within one simulation step that ranged from 10  μs to 50  μs. In this model, the setting time was 0.0018  s. Thus, a delay of 0.0018  s tripped the fast DC breaker. At the same time, the hybrid DC breaker was also tripped. After 1.2  s, the system reached a stable state again.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to use a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> for the {{improvement}} of transient stability margin. Long distance AC transmission is often subject to stability problems, which limits the transmission capability. Interconnected power systems suffer from weakly damped swings between synchronous generator and sub systems. The development of modern power system has lead to an increasing complexity in the study of power system and also presents new challenges to power system stability and in particular to the aspects of transient stability and small signal stability. Transient stability control plays a significant role in ensuring the stable operation of power systems in the event of large disturbances and faults and is thus a significant area of research. This study investigates the improvement of transient stability of a two area system, using <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> which is capable of fast switching in case of faults and thus controlling the real and reactive power flows in a faulted transmission line. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment for two area system model with <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> to analyze the effects of SSCB on transient stability performance of the system. From the simulation results, swing curves of the three phase faulted power system without SSCB gets increases monotonically and thus the system can be considered as unstable whereas the swing curves of the system with an SSCB reaches to a steady state...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} implementation of <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> in power system using MOSFET. The high power semiconductor switches {{can be used to}} separate the faulty portions {{from the rest of the}} power system in case of abnormal conditions. The <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> is a topology made in the form of module, can protect power system and its components from faults. Existing mechanical circuit breakers are based on the principle of magnetically latching a pair of mechanical contacts shrouded by an arc chute for arc extinction. Very often unnecessary tripping results from a phenomenon known as, “rapid rise” which subsequently results in the demand for frequent maintenance. Due to the long turn-off delay of the present mechanical circuit breaker, significant voltage sag is experienced in the grid which affects the sensible loads. The distortions caused by the three phase short circuit can be reduced to 100 µs in the system with SSCB, in contrast to 100 ms achieved by the present technology and hence it improves the power quality. The SSCB uses high power anti parallel switches to carry bidirectional current. The load voltage is sensed and it is used to turn on and turn off the SSCB. The Eight bus system with SSCB is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The hardware model is developed for implementation of SSCB using MOSFETand it is tested in the laboratory...|$|E

30|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>state</b> DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> cut off {{the fault}} current at the current {{zero-crossing}} point, and then they disconnect the two auxiliary switches. Using this method, DC faults can be quickly removed. In addition, fast <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> operate at the zero-crossing point, thus the short circuit capacity is small. As such, few IGBT devices are needed and additional energy consuming devices are not necessary. This has great application prospects.|$|R
30|$|When a DC fault occurs, from (6), {{the voltage}} in the current-limiting {{inductor}} suddenly changes. The peak {{value of the}} voltage {{is related to the}} length of the fault cable and the zero-crossing time. Thus, it can be realized through detecting sudden changes in the voltage to determine the fault time and the current zero-crossing time. The sequences of actions of the DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> based on this method are as follows: 1) Initially, an off-line relationship database between the sudden change in the voltage and the current zero-crossing time is established. 2) Secondly, the sudden change in the voltage in the current-limiting inductor is detected; determining whether a fault has occurred in the external cables. 3) The corresponding zero-crossing time is then obtained, according to the relationship database. 4) Then the breaking delay time through the zero-crossing time is obtained by subtracting the times consumed by the detection devices and switches. 5) The given time is then delayed, causing the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> to operate. 6) Finally, the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> interrupt the current and the auxiliary switch cuts off the fault cable.|$|R

30|$|Reference [32] {{investigated}} the technical parameters such as reliability, power losses and relative investment costs of different DC breakers {{and concluded that}} the solid-state <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> shows the best overall performance. Hybrid mechanical and <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> have not been available in practice. Mechanical passive or active resonance <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are specifically applied in CSC HVDC [33]. Therefore, SSCB is available and technically feasible for MVDC applications, the SSCB and hybrid solid-state DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are appropriate for the DC microgrids. The relatively high conducting loss remains a major drawback of SSCB, thus selection of SSCB semiconductors are an important design factor [34]. Since 2011, SiC JFET/SIT were identified and implemented in building LV and MV SSCBs and the conducting losses were significantly reduced [35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. The hybrid solid-state DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> with mechanical disconnector provides an ultra-fast and efficient protection solution [40]. With the improved topology, a 2 ms, 10 kV class hybrid DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> prototype based on a single 15 kV SiC ETO device is presented in [41]. Meanwhile, the development of semiconductor technology pushes hybrid DC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> to a new level.

40|$|Exciting {{high voltage}} direct current (HVDC) {{transmission}} systems are mainly point-to-point connections. A multi-terminal HVDC grid consisting {{of three or}} more inter connected converter stations is suggested {{in order to increase}} the reliability, redundancy and flexibility in long distant bulk power transmission. Similar to AC (alternating current) grids, a protection system of HVDC-grids must be able to clear faults without affecting the remaining healthy parts of the grid. Thus, {{there is a need for}} HVDC <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> in which development is challenging: The <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> must interrupt the current typically within 5 ms. The <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> itself must provide the zero current crossing, as no natural zero crossing is exciting in DC grids. The <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> must dissipate the magnetic energy provided by the line inductance The <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> must withstand residual overvoltages after current interruption This master thesis describes the development of a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> dc <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> for the DC grid in the NTNU/SINTEF Smart Grid and Renewable Energy Systems Laboratory. The DC breaker main components are Insulated bipolar gate transistors (IGBT) and metal oxide varistors (MOV). Under normal operation the IGBTs are placed in series with the DCline. The current commutates the current into a parallelMOV if current interruption is demanded. The MOV provides subsequently a counter voltage and forces the current to zero. A test model was assembled initially and corresponding simplified PSCAD simulation model was developed in order to gain a deeply understanding of the operation of a DC breaker and facilitate the selection of components and the design of the DC breaker for the SINTEF/NTNU laboratory. The selection of components for the DC breaker was based on the results from the experimental activities. In addition, corresponding ratings were obtained in an adjusted PSCAD model, which included an electro thermal equivalent circuit for temperature calculations. A developed theoretical background including the components used in the DC breaker and general techniques of DC current interruption supported the work.
