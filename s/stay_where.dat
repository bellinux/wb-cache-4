5|$|In 1124, {{just before}} the final conquest of the Liao dynasty, a group of Khitans led by Yelü Dashi fled {{northwest}} to the border area and military garrison of Kedun (Zhenzhou), in modern-day northern Mongolia. Yelü Dashi convinced the people there, around 20,000 Liao cavalry and their families, to follow him and attempt to restore the Liao dynasty. Yelü Dashi proclaimed himself emperor in 1131, after which he moved further west into modern Kazakhstan and then occupied the Karakhanid city of Balasaghun (in modern Kyrgyzstan). After a failed attempt in 1134 to reclaim the territory formerly held by the Liao, Dashi decided instead to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was and establish a permanent Khitan state in Central Asia. The state, known as the Qara Khitai or the Western Liao dynasty, controlled several key trading cities, was multicultural, and showed evidence of religious tolerance. The state survived {{for nearly a century}} before being conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1218.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1990s the {{proportion}} of cricketers who move from one county club to another during their playing career has been rising sharply, and many players who do so never receive a benefit. However, salaries have risen sharply in recent years, and many players prefer to hunt for a better salary rather than <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> {{they are in the}} hope of being awarded a benefit at some point. A conventional pension scheme for cricketers has also been introduced to complement the benefit system.|$|E

25|$|When {{the monastic}} Elders {{living in the}} desert heard about Simeon, who had chosen a new and strange form of asceticism, they wanted to test him to {{determine}} whether his extreme feats were founded in humility or pride. They decided to order Simeon under obedience to {{come down from the}} pillar. They decided that if he disobeyed, they would forcibly drag him to the ground, but if he was willing to submit, they were to leave him on his pillar. St Simeon displayed complete obedience and humility, and the monks told him to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of the expulsion, most Acadian exiles were {{assigned}} to rural communities in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and South Carolina. In general, they refused to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> they were put and large numbers migrated to the colonial port cities where they gathered in isolated, impoverished French-speaking Catholic neighbourhoods, the sort of communities Britain's colonial officials tried to discourage. More worryingly for the British authorities, some Acadians threatened to migrate north to French-controlled regions, including the Saint John River, Île Royale, the coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Canada. Because the British believed their policy of sending the Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies had failed, they deported the Acadians to France during the second wave of the Expulsion.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant General Arthur Wellesley, {{the future}} Duke of Wellington was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Portuguese expedition in March 1809, and received his letter of service on 2 April. He {{made his way to}} Portsmouth where he was received by the frigate assigned for his transportation, which was subsequently delayed from 3 to 14 April, nearly two weeks, waiting for a fair wind. That frigate was Surveillante. She was able to set sail on 14 April 1809 allowing Wellesley to embark upon his second voyage to Lisbon during the Peninsula War; however, Wellesley, troubled by bad weather, was subjected to a storm during his first night at sea; it was remarked that the frigate narrowly escaped shipwreck off the coast of the Isle of Wight. His aide-de-camp was sent by Captain Collier to request that Wellesley put his boots on and join him on deck, to which he replied he could swim better without his boots and would <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> he was.|$|E

When the weather permitted, {{attempts were made to}} rig the wireless aerials that would enable communication with the shore parties and later, it was hoped, with Australia and New Zealand. The remaining sledging rations for the depots were put ashore, but much of the shore parties' personal supplies, fuel and equipment remained on board, as it was assumed that the ship would <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> it was throughout the winter.|$|E

[...] On Sunday 24th, shortly after a truce to allow the evacuation of casualties, Cain was alerted to the approach of a Tiger tank. Together with a Royal Artillery gunner he raced for a 6 pounder anti-tank gun, manoeuvred it into position, fired and disabled the tank. [...] He wanted to continue using the gun, but the recoil mechanism was destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} a single crash cymbal {{followed}} by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound of}} thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. He is saying he will always wait for her, but he does not think that she should <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> she is any longer. The lyrics emphasize: [...] "But I wait for you/if you go, if you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you." [...] The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, we {{find that}} more severe {{negative}} attitudes towards immigration {{are associated with a}} lower probability that a refugee <b>stays</b> <b>where</b> he or she has been placed as well as lower income, while a larger network is associated with a higher probability that a refugee <b>stays</b> <b>where</b> he or she has been placed but lower income. We would a priori expect larger networks to be associated with higher income, as refugees provide each other information and references that can help in the labour market, but this argument relies on networks that are established in the labour market already.|$|R

500|$|Nansen {{called this}} first land [...] "Hvidtenland" [...] ("White Island"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was {{apparent}} {{that they were in}} an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land. They could only continue south in the hopes of finding a geographical feature they could pinpoint with certainty. On 16 August Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder, marked on Payer's maps as on the western coast of Franz Josef Land. Nansen's objective was now to reach a hut and supplies that had been left by an earlier expedition at a location known as Eira Harbour, {{at the southern end of}} the islands. However, contrary winds and loose ice made further progress in the kayak hazardous, and on 28 August Nansen decided that, with another polar winter drawing near, they should <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> they were and await the following spring.|$|E
500|$|Skinner and Tyrawley {{agreed that}} the most {{pressing}} threat {{was that of a}} combined land and sea assault focusing on the weakest part of the defences, the open ground between the South Front of the town and Europa Point {{at the end of the}} peninsula. However, they disagreed vehemently over where and how to construct the defences. Tyrawley put a great deal of energy into constructing new earthworks, batteries and a series of retrenched lines between the South Bastion and the New Mole, called the Prince of Wales Lines. It was said of him that he would never let a day pass [...] "without visiting the works once or twice during his <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> there was a possibility of going out." [...] Skinner disagreed with the placement of the new fortifications and criticised the use of compacted earth and sun-baked bricks, which had enabled them to be built at great speed and minimum cost, rather than stone. Skinner perhaps had a point, as most of Tyrawley's works were washed away by rain within only a few years.|$|E

On March 27, Kalomoira arrived in Romania for a three-day <b>stay,</b> <b>where</b> she again appeared on television and gave interviews.

By April 17, Kalomoira had reached Bosnia and Herzegovina; in addition to hosting a show on PINK TV, she appeared on television shows, gave many interviews, and met with Elvir Laković Laka and his sister Mirella, Bosnia and Herzegovina's entrants in the contest. Kalomoira then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where she was a guest star on a morning television show, performed [...] "Secret Combination" [...] live on Radio Television of Serbia, and had an interview with FOX TV.
