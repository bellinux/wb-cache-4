Three experimental diets with partial replacement of FM (diets: RW + FM, SWP + FM and RW + SWP + FM) were formulated. All diets were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous, iso-lipidic and iso-energetic. Growth performance and feed utilization indices were assessed, and the feeding trial concluded with the analysis of haematological parameters to provide an indication of carp physiological and health status. Mean weight gain was greatest in mirror carp fed RW + FM (60. 83 fish− 1 day− 1; P < 0. 05 vs. all other diets) followed by SWP + FM (40. 62 g fish− 1 day− 1; P < 0. 05 vs. all other diets).
