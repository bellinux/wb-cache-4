5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA.</b> For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
40|$|<b>Single-stranded</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{interact}} with {{components of the}} RNA interference pathway to reduce the expression of target mRNAs. Now, Lima et al. and Yu et al. show that, with extensive chemical modifications, small <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNAs</b> can robustly induce gene silencing with efficacy similar to their double-stranded counterparts...|$|R

5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA,</b> but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E

25|$|In virology, {{the term}} {{may also be}} used when {{referring}} to mRNA synthesis from an RNA molecule (i.e., RNA replication). For instance, the genome of a negative-sense <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (ssRNA -) virus may be template for a positive-sense <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> (ssRNA +). This is because the positive-sense strand contains the information needed to translate the viral proteins for viral replication afterwards. This process is catalyzed by a viral RNA replicase.|$|E
25|$|TERT is {{a reverse}} transcriptase, {{which is a}} class of enzyme that creates {{single-stranded}} DNA using <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> as a template.|$|E
25|$|Flaviviruses share several common aspects: common size (40–65nm), {{symmetry}} (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), {{nucleic acid}} (positive-sense, <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> around 10,000–11,000 bases), and {{appearance in the}} electron microscope.|$|E

5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral <b>single-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.|$|R

25|$|In biochemistry, {{a reverse}} transcriptase, {{also known as}} RNA-dependent DNA {{polymerase}}, is a DNA polymerase enzyme that transcribes <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> into double-stranded DNA. It was discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and independently by David Baltimore in 1970 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|E
50|$|WSMV is a flexible, {{rod-shaped}} virus {{composed of}} a positive-sense <b>single-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> genome approximately 8.5 to 12 kilobases in length, and can be either mono- or bipartite. The RNA serves as both the genome and viral messenger. The genomic RNA (or its segments) is translated into polyprotein(s) which are transformed by virus-encoded proteases into functional products.|$|R
40|$|When Semliki Forest virus (SFV) -infected BHK {{cells were}} {{disrupted}} 4 h after infection, 75 to 90 % {{of the total}} virus-specific RNA synthesizing enzyme {{was found in the}} large particle fraction, along with 75 to 90 % of the in vivo-synthesized double-stranded RNAs. The RNA products of this enzyme-template complex in an in vitro system were double-stranded RNAs sedimenting predominantly at 18 S, and <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNAs</b> sedimenting at 42 S, 26 S, and 22 S. The various virus-specific SFV RNAs synthesized in vitro were associated with different sized structures, and thus each was separable by differential centrifugation. Kinetic and pulse-chase experiments showed that the double-stranded RNAs were the precursors to the <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNAs.</b> There were several double-stranded RNAs identified both in the in vitro product and also in extracts from infected cells.

25|$|Rinderpest virus (RPV), {{a member}} of the genus Morbillivirus, is closely related to the measles and canine {{distemper}} viruses. Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae family, it produces enveloped virions, and is a negative-sense <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> virus. The virus was particularly fragile and is quickly inactivated by heat, desiccation and sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{distemper}} {{is caused}} by a <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> virus of the family Paramyxoviridae (the same family of the viruses that causes measles, mumps, and bronchiolitis in humans). The disease is highly contagious via inhalation and fatal 50% of the time. Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease of dogs, and was the leading cause of infectious disease death in dogs, prior to a vaccine becoming available.|$|E
25|$|Hantaviruses are Bunyaviruses. The Bunyaviridae {{family is}} divided into five genera: Orthobunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, Tospovirus, and Hantavirus. Like all members of this family, hantaviruses have genomes {{comprising}} three negative-sense, <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> segments, and so are classified as negative sense RNA viruses. Members of other Bunyaviridae family genera are generally arthropod-borne viruses, but hantaviruses {{are thought to be}} transmitted to humans mainly through inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta or rodent bites.|$|E

25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus has}} a {{positive}} sense <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> genome. The genome consists of a single open reading frame that is 9600 nucleotide bases long. This single open reading frame is translated to produce a single protein product, which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins. This is why on publicly available databases, such as the European Bioinformatic Institute, the viral proteome only consists of 2 proteins.|$|E
25|$|Hepatovirus A is a picornavirus; {{it is not}} enveloped and {{contains}} a <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> packaged in a protein shell. Only one serotype of the virus has been found, but multiple genotypes exist. Codon use within the genome is biased and unusually distinct from its host. It also has a poor internal ribosome entry site. In the region that codes for the HAV capsid, highly conserved clusters of rare codons restrict antigenic variability.|$|E
25|$|Middle East {{respiratory}} {{syndrome is}} caused by the newly identified MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a species with <b>single-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> belonging to the genus betacoronavirus which is distinct from SARS coronavirus and the common-cold coronavirus. Its genomes are phylogenetically classified into two clades, Clades A and B. Early cases of MERS were of Clade A clusters (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) while new cases are genetically different in general (Clade B). The virus grows readily on Vero cells and LLC-MK2 cells.|$|E
