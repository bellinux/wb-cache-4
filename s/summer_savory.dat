40|$|Background : <b>Summer</b> <b>savory</b> is {{an annual}} grass plant, with a {{branched}} stem with {{the length of}} 10 to 30 cm that is distinguishable from the similar species due to having grayish green appearance and its leaves are narrow and long. In recent years, the anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antispasmodic, stomach invigorator and digestion facilitator characteristics of this species have been proved. Materials and Methods: This study aimed to examine the type and amount of essence compounds in the <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> was performed in two vegetative and reproductive phonological stages. To identify the amount of plant essence components a total of 30 samples were randomly taken from Shater Abad heights in two vegetative and flowering phonological stages and its essence was produced by Clevenger apparatus. GC/MS was used to identify essence constituents. In all spectra given by GC/MS, the Kovats index was calculated for each peak by the pattern of exiting the normal alkenes and spectrum inhibition index. Results: The total amount of plant essence in two phonological stages before flowering (vegetative stage) and after flowering (reproductive stage) was 0 / 5 and 0 / 4 percent (w/v), respectively. The number of compounds identified in the vegetative stage was 27 compounds and for reproductive stages was 19 compounds upon which nearly 98 % of plant essence were identified. Conclusion: The results {{show that there is}} no significant difference in both vegetative and reproductive stages in terms of the type of main compounds of the <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> essence, although the relatively large changes are seen in two phonological stages listed in terms of the numbers of identified compounds. Also the results obtained from this study showed that three main compounds of the <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> essence are Thymol, gamma- Terpinene and Carvacrol, respectively, which their anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and antioxidant characteristics completely confirm the medicinal property and therapeutic effects of essence of this plant...|$|E

Bacterial treatments include suspension of three species of rhizobacteria namely Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Pseudomonas suspension in single and combination application of these bacteria include Azotobacter- Azospirillum, Azotobacter –Pseudomonas, Azospirillum-Pseudomonas, Azotobacter- Azosperillium-Pseudomonas and control (without inoculation of any bacteria), which applied as root inoculation on <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> plants. Results revealed that inoculation of plants with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria had significant effect on all of assessed parameters such as vegetative growth criteria and essential oil yield and quality. The highest value for traits such as plant height (45. 67 cm), canopy diameter (40. 54 cm), dry weight of shoot(33. 82 g/p), aerial part yield(3578 kg/ha), leaf yield (451 kg/ha), inflorescence yield(1398 kg/ha), essential oil weight percentage(2. 33 %) essential oil efficiency (2. 43 %) and essential oil yield (76. 8 %) were obtained by application of Azotobacter- Azosperillium-Pseudomonas combination and the lowest amount for all of mentioned traits were achieved in control treatment. The highest amount for α-terpinene(53 mg/l) thymole (48. 5 mg/l) were obtained by inoculation ith Azotobacter –Pseudomonas combination and Azotobacter respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of ethanol and essential oils of three medicinal plants namely Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), <b>Summer</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja hortensis L.) and Ajwain (Carum copticum L.) on extending carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus) vase-life. For this purpose three individual trials were conducted using a completely randomized block design with three replications. In the first trial, the effect of 4 % ethanol (v/v) as a continuous or pulse treatment was determined. The results showed that although both application methods increased vase-life and marketability of carnation, it was statistically non significant. In the second trial, the effects of selected essential oils at the concentration of 100, 150 and 200 ppm were investigated. All essential oils prolonged carnation vase-life. <b>Summer</b> <b>savory</b> essential oil (100 ppm) showed the highest effect (increasing 4. 4 days) in comparison to the control. In the third trial, the interaction between ethanol and the essential oils was studied.
