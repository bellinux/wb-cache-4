This was caused by the ground conditions with lots of clay that the factory was built on and the shaft bearing supports moved some fractions of millimeters from time to time, hardly measurable, inducing enormous extra forces in the [...] "stiff" [...] bearings that was available at that time. Wingqvist spent more and more time on the development of bearings in general, collecting all sorts of technical achievements and new ideas that was presented continuously on the ball bearing concepts around Europe. In particular he carefully studied the report presented in 1902 by professor Richard Stribeck working at the Institute of Technology in Dresden, Germany, where he had compared ball bearings versus plain bearings from a scientific point of view. Wingqvist soon realized that the ball bearing techniques had a future and that there was room for innovations. On his initiative a small workshop was set up within the premises of Gamlestadens factory where they could carry out tests with different designs and steel materials. In 1906 he was granted a patent for a Single-row self-aligning ball bearing (Swedish patent reg. No. 24160) but this type of bearing had the disadvantage that it could not stand very much axial loads. His work continued in order to find the solution for a <b>self-aligning</b> <b>bearing</b> that also could carry some axial loads.|$|E

40|$|Journal {{bearings}} are {{a fundamental}} component in many pieces of machinery. A properly designed bearing {{is capable of}} supporting large loads in rotating systems with minimal frictional energy losses and virtually no wear even after years of services. These benefits make an understanding of dynamic behavior of these devices very valuable. In applications where journal bearings are subject to misalignment (conditions where the journal and sleeve axes are not parallel), {{it has long been}} understood that bearing performance can be compromised. To eliminate this problem, self-aligning bearings have been designed. The sleeves of these bearings are capable of moving freely to accommodate misalignment. The aligning motion of these bearings under dynamic loading is, however, largely unexplored. Additionally, the impact of misalignment on journal midplane motion is unknown. Currently, finite element and finite difference analyses are the only available tools for this kind of work. This requires a unique and computationally costly mathematical solution for every possible bearing configuration. It is the goal of this thesis to develop a computationally efficient means of predicting journal motion within a <b>self-aligning</b> <b>bearing.</b> This is done by creating a set of 2 ̆ 2 mobility 2 ̆ 2 mapping functions from finite element bearing models that relate the velocity of the journal to the applied load.

The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the <b>self-aligning</b> ball <b>bearings</b> is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius).

It can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, {{as in the case of}} the detecting bearing faults when vibration signals of machinery are collected under low-frequency noise condition. In combination with AANC, statistical analysis, enveloping spectrum analysis techniques are used for detection of bearing fault and diagnosis.

To undertake this task, a purpose-built test rig was employed for collecting AE signals from the journal bearings. Then, the collected data was processed using time domain and frequency domain analysis methods which are of the most common techniques used for monitoring in AE applications. The results shown that the data analysis method applied in this work is effective for characterising complicated AE signals. Based on obtained results, it is concluded that the AE energy levels in high frequency range higher for the higher radial load and speed condition. For different lubricant cases AE energy becomes high when the viscosity is lower, which means that AE can be used to detect lubrication degradation in journal bearings...|$|R
50|$|Sven Wingqvist, at {{the time}} a thirty-year-old plant {{engineer}} responsible for repairs and maintenance at Gamlestadens Fabriker, was dissatisfied with the performance of the ball bearings then in use. These were rigid ball bearings, imported from Germany, and if the long shafts on the machinery in a textile mill were the least bit misaligned, the ball bearings would become overheated and break down, bringing production to a costly halt. In spring 1907, Wingquist presented a breakthrough - a double row <b>self-aligning</b> ball <b>bearing</b> with a spherical raceway in the outer ring, shared by both rows of balls. This allowed the inner ring to align freely in relation to the outer ring, with no negative impact on the function of the bearing. The new bearing solved the problem associated with misalignment of the shafts and thus did away with the frequent production stops. Self-alignment was particularly useful in the less-than-perfect machinery of the times and in buildings with subsidence problems, which was the case at Gamlestadens Fabriker, since much of the land on which Gothenburg has been built is clay.|$|R

40|$|High power {{machinery}} such as steam turbines, large {{pumps and}} motors often use journal bearings as rotor supports. This {{type of bearing}} is simple, low cost and with high load carrying capacity. However, abnormal operating conditions in the journal bearings will degrade machine performance, increase operating cost and may cause unexpected sudden failure which is dangerous in both engineering and safety terms. Bearing condition monitoring can detect faults {{at an early stage}} and prevent the occurrence of such failures which can be catastrophic. Monitoring techniques that have been used for monitoring of journal bearing are lubricant analysis, vibration analysis, noise and acoustic emission analysis. Lubricant analysis has been used effectively for condition monitoring for a long time but cannot be implemented in real time. Many researchers have studied the use of the vibration and sound signals and acoustic emissions generated by the hydrodynamic journal bearing for detecting and diagnosing faults. The studies give relatively little information regarding surface vibration and airborne sound characteristics for <b>self-aligning</b> spherical journal <b>bearings,</b> nor has comprehensive condition monitoring been implemented for a particular <b>self-aligning</b> spherical <b>bearing</b> journal. Surface vibration, airborne sound analysis and acoustic emission monitoring can be used simultaneously to detect any signal emitted from the bearing at very wide frequency range. Sound vibration occurs in solid structure, liquid and gases transmitted to air surrounding create airborne sound. This study has conducted a thorough review of theoretical and experimental studies. The research began with designing and building a test rig consisting of a drive system, radial loading system, torsion loading system, the bearing testing system itself and control, data acquisition and measurement instrumentation systems include encoder, pressure transducers, thermocouples, load cells, vibration transducer, acoustic and acoustic emission sensors. Preliminary experiments were conducted to ensure all equipment and instrumentation worked well and also to test measurement repeatability. Preliminary experiment results showed that all the equipment either driving, loading, data acquisition and measurement system works well. Experimental analysis of the surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission analysis responses in time domain and frequency domain analysis include RMS value, Kurtosis and mean value showed good repeatability. The AE measurement response showed the best repeatability, followed by surface vibration and airborne response. Theoretical study shows that the <b>self-aligning</b> spherical journal <b>bearing</b> system under radial load generated surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission responses that originated from external force excitation such as fluctuating loads due to system misalignment or unbalance and internal excitation such as asperity in boundary or mixed operation. These excitations generate structure-borne vibration and acoustic emission. The structure-borne vibration dynamic responses then radiated airborne sound. Airborne sound also originated from oil pressure fluctuation and flow turbulence. The surface vibration and airborne sound frequency responses occur at frequencies 100 kHz. The amplitude and frequency of surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission is influence by radial load, shaft speed and surface quality of journal and bearing components themselves. The quality of asperity contact between journal and bearing may be due to manufacturing defect, lubricant and surface deterioration over time during operation. The experiments and analysis of the surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission characteristics of the <b>self-aligning</b> spherical journal <b>bearing</b> indicate that there is a positive correlation between the spectrum mean value of surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission with radial load and speed. Meanwhile, when use higher lubricant viscosity creates lower surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission mean amplitude. Investigation of lubricant deterioration due to water contaminant indicated that when use higher concentration contaminant in the lubricant generates higher spectrum mean value of surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission responses. The surface deterioration experiment showed that there is a clear significant different in the frequency domain of surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission between a scratched surface and a normal surface journal bearing. The surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission frequency characteristic for scratches and lubricant deterioration creates different peak amplitudes and different frequency. The larger the scratch generate the greater the amplitude and higher frequency. From of the three measurement systems used, acoustic emission is the most sensitive and a better detect of the bearing fault than followed by vibration and air-born sound measurement system. Therefore the acoustic emission measurement technique can be integrated with surface vibration, airborne sound for rotating machinery/engine condition monitoring. Using surface vibration, airborne sound and acoustic emission monitoring the symptoms of early damage at low, medium or high frequency can be detected and more severe and catastrophic failure can be prevented, and finally very high maintenance costs can be eliminated...|$|R

This research investigates into vibration responses of such bearings using a clustering technique for identifying different lubrication regimes, and consequently for assessing bearing lubrication conditions.

These excitations together with complicated vibration paths are difficult to be characterized in a linear way {{for the purpose of}} condition monitoring. Therefore, a clustering analysis technique is adopted to classify the vibration spectrum in high frequency ranges around 10 kHz into different representative responses that corresponds to different bearing modulus values and lubrication characteristics. In particular, the analysis allows sensitive signal components and sensor positions to be determined for monitoring the journal bearing effectively.

40|$|High power {{industrial}} machinery such as steam turbines and large pumps use journal bearings as rotor supports because {{this type of}} bearing is a high load carrying capacity. However, abnormal operating conditions in the journal bearings will degrade machine performance, shorten life time and {{increase the risk of}} operation. Bearing condition monitoring can detect faults at early stage and hence minimise the occurrence of catastrophic failures. Vibration measurement from an accelerometer is an effective method for monitoring journal bearing. However, due to frequency limitation, it cannot give accurate monitoring results when the bearing produces high frequency excitations such as asperity contacts. For overcoming the limits, acoustic emission (AE) is required for detecting early faults in self aligning journal bearings in high frequency ranges. AE source in journal bearings may originate from sliding friction. The friction in sliding bearings depends on lubricated regions which are influenced by load, speed, lubricant viscosity and bearing conditions. When bearing is operated in boundary lubricated region more asperity contact occurs and generates large AE responses. Hydrodynamic lubrication means that the bearing surfaces are completely separated by oil film, almost there is not severity contact and hence creates very small AE signal. Mixed lubrication occurs between boundary and hydrodynamic lubrication range and creates medium of AE value. The result of AE experiment for <b>self-aligning</b> spherical journal <b>bearing</b> indicates that AE can detect bearing fault in high frequency range till 15000 Hz. For addition there is a positive correlation between speed, load and AE RMS value. For lubricant, if the lubricant has higher viscosity, it generates smaller AE amplitude. The AE characteristic also shows that AE RMS value relates to the friction curve...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a rotary percussive coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The carriage slides along rails using <b>self-aligning</b> linear <b>bearings</b> that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf rotary percussive drill, which uses a custom carbide-tipped coring bit. By using rotary percussive drilling, the drill time is greatly reduced. The percussive action fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts. At the time of this reporting, it is the first instrument to be demonstrated using microspine anchors, and is the first self-contained drill/anchor system to be demonstrated that is capable of drilling in inverted configurations and would be capable of drilling in microgravity...|$|R
