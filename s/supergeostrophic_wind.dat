40|$|Limitations in {{skill of}} wind speed {{forecasts}} lead to conservative bids of wind-plant {{production in the}} dayahead energy market and usually to an underutilization of wind resources. Improvements are needed in understanding wind characteristics in the turbine-rotor layer (40 – 120 m) for developing refined forecast models. The seasonal and diurnal behavior of wind speed, wind direction, and temperature were analyzed from data taken on five tall meteorological towers across Iowa. Several significant high-shear events, which would {{have the potential to}} cause problems by inducing substantial stress on the infrastructure of the wind turbine, were observed, with vertical shear up to 15 ms- 1 accompanied by 30 o of directional shear between 50 and 200 m. These events exhibited <b>supergeostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds by 50 % through the night followed by a collapse of shear through midday, indicating the influence of an inertial oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Reverse tip jets {{are strong}} {{low-level}} winds with easterly component that form near {{the southern tip}} of Greenland. In the present study, a reverse tip jet case which occurred from 21 to 22 December 2000 was examined to clarify its fine structure using a numerical model with a horizontal resolution of 3 km. The reverse tip jet, showing the <b>supergeostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speed with a maximum wind speed in excess of 45 m s− 1, extended from the east coast of Greenland to the west of Cape Farewell with anticyclonic curvature. A cloud free region coincided with the jet indicated that there was a mesoscale downdraft. Along {{the eastern edge of the}} jet, a banded cloud formed between the upstream easterly wind and the colder northerly wind that is a part of the jet and is located along the east coast. This cloud was associated with large gradients in surface wind speed, temperature, moisture, and heat flux. A maximum surface total heat flux of 300 W m− 2 coincided with the location of the jet. It is suggested that the orographic deflection by Greenland’s large-scale topography as well as small-scale downslope winds behind mountains with fiords causes the reverse tip jet. 1...|$|E
40|$|The nocturnal {{low-level}} jet (LLJ) is a well-documented phenomenon world-wide, {{especially in}} the southern Great Plains of the United States (Bonner 1968, Whiteman et al. 1997, Banta et al., 2002) where it contributes to severe weather. In the canonical rural case, the nocturnal LLJ forms as the release of daytime convective turbulent stresses allow nighttime winds above a stable boundary layer to accelerate to <b>supergeostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds. In situations with surface winds of less than 5 m/s, wind speeds at altitudes of 100 m due to the nocturnal LLJ can be greater than 20 m/s. The turbulence generated by this wind shear can induce nocturnal mixing events and control surface-atmosphere exchange, thereby affecting atmospheric transport and dispersion. The Joint URBAN 2003 urban dispersion dataset, collected in Oklahoma City in July, 2003, includes several occurrences of strong LLJs, thereby providing {{a unique opportunity to}} document how the LLJ interacts with the complexity of urban geometries and to explore the significance of LLJs for transport and dispersion in urban environments. Based on this dataset, we will answer the following questions: (1) How often do LLJs occur during the experiment? (2) How does the increase in surface roughness represented by the city center, as compared to the rural environment, affect the altitude and speed of the jet, based on data from upwind and downwind wind profiles? (3) How often do LLJs contribute to nocturnal mixing events within the Oklahoma City urban area, as observed in profiles of turbulence quantities at an 80 m pseudo-tower located 750 m downwind of Oklahoma City center? (4) Can the effect of these LLJ-induced mixing events be identified in the dispersion datasets...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{experiments}} reveal key {{processes that}} organize a hydrostatic environment conducive to severe turbulence. The paradigm requires juxtaposition {{of the entrance}} region of a curved jet stream, which is highly subgeostrophic, with the entrance region of a straight jet stream, which is highly <b>supergeostrophic.</b> The <b>wind</b> and mass fields become misphased as the entrance regions converge resulting in the significant spatial variation of inertial forcing, centripetal forcing, and along- and cross-stream pressure gradient forcing over a mesobeta scale region. This results in frontogenesis and the along-stream divergence of cyclonic and convergence of cyclonic ageostrophic vertical vorticity. The centripetally forced mesoscale front becomes the locus of large gradients of ageostrophic vertical vorticity along an overturning isentrope. This region becomes favorable for streamwise vorticity gradient formation enhancing the environment for organization of horizontal vortex tubes {{in the presence of}} buoyant forcing...|$|R
