25|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 October, Rael sat mesmerized and listened to a 3 hour lecture from Yahweh Elohim about his {{religions}} and philosophers, the need for geniocracy, Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism, and about the ideas of God and Soul, and later traveled to the Planet of the Eternals. The planet orbited around a very large star and had a climate similar to the rain forests of Earth. He later <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Eloha and had a meal with the major prophets including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. A guide showed him installations that housed machines for creating biological robots. He gave {{a picture of his}} mother to a machine which created similarly-appearing biological robot. That night, he received an introduction to build his future home at the Planet of the Eternals and was presented young, mature female biological robots. He said that before reaching a climax, he wore a helmet which played music controlled by his thoughts, which the females danced to. Then the climax happens.|$|E

She liked to play dice and I really didn't know much about it, but I got it off her and managed to make the song out of that." [...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E
500|$|Fichtner {{was cast}} as Alexander Mahone {{one day before}} filming began for the second season. After acting the {{previous}} year in the series Invasion, Fichtner {{did not intend to}} return to network television. When approached with the scripts for the first two episodes of the second season Fichtner was uncertain of his character's background, but attracted to [...] "the potential of who this guy is." [...] Fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and, although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile, he later said that he was glad to have accepted the role. Fichtner has praised the quality of writing on the series, saying [...] "Television shows live or die on writing. The joy of Prison Break has been the writers. They're great and they forever challenged me, which makes the journey worth it." [...] Fichtner has also had several concerns with the scripts written for him, and talks to the writers {{to make sure that the}} character stays consistent. On at least one occasion, he has <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> writer and tweaked the entire script.|$|E

500|$|The sixth track, [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] {{features}} Robyn rapping, {{which was}} compared to the rapping style of musician Peaches. The song is about Robyn getting arrested for [...] "freaky dancing" [...] to her own song. Ben Norman of About.com called it [...] "a darker version of [...] previous rap songs". Comparisons were also drawn towards [...] "Fembot" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] by Britney Spears. [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album's highlight by several critics. It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering [...] "quotable, ridiculous lines", such as [...] "You know when in Rome I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Romans. Said we need a black Pope and she'd better be a woman." [...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features [...] "the teen-pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping louche quips over a relentless, grimy electro stomp." [...] The acoustic [...] "Indestructible" [...] reflects [...] "the downside of needing someone". Norman said that it [...] "is sweeping and symphonic and has so much vulnerability and strength in it that you believe she really will love {{as if she is}} indestructible." ...|$|E
