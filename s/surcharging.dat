5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of <b>surcharging</b> users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} relationship between partitioned pricing (Morwitz, Greenleaf, and Johnson 1998) and dependent variables such as demand, preference, and attention. The first essay proposes a theoretical framework to examine extant and new moderators of partitioned pricing, classifying moderators based on {{the source of their}} impact as presentational, evaluative, or attentional. A meta-analysis of 17 years of research on partitioned pricing examines 149 observations from 43 studies in 27 papers (N = 12, 878). The perceived benefit of the <b>surcharge</b> and the typicality of partitioning the <b>surcharge</b> in the category emerge as robust moderators of the effect of partitioned pricing on consumer demand. <b>Surcharges</b> for components perceived to provide high benefit and highly typical <b>surcharges</b> make partitioned prices more attractive. Replicating the meta-analytic effects of typicality, a follow-up experiment shows a more positive effect of partitioning on preference for typical <b>surcharges</b> than for atypical <b>surcharges,</b> and an eye-tracking experiment offers insight into the underlying mechanism by showing that people pay more attention to atypical <b>surcharges</b> than to typical <b>surcharges.</b> Different pricing strategies in the same market suggest different beliefs about the efficacy of partitioning prices on consumers' preferences. The second essay in this dissertation explores the impact of two countervailing theoretical influences that may predict how the numerical magnitude of <b>surcharges</b> can affect preferences. "Base price anchoring" suggests that as the magnitude of the <b>surcharge</b> increases (holding the total price constant), consumers may anchor on a lower base price, leading them to evaluate partitioned prices more favorably. In contrast, "surcharge salience" suggests that as the magnitude of the <b>surcharge</b> increases, attention to the <b>surcharge</b> increases, and evaluations of partitioned prices decrease. An analysis of eBay auction data reveals support for the influence of base price anchoring, and a follow-up experiment suggests that this mechanism dominates at lower levels of <b>surcharge</b> magnitude whereas <b>surcharge</b> salience dominates at higher levels of <b>surcharge</b> magnitude. Finally, an eye-tracking study demonstrates the influence of <b>surcharge</b> salience on preference and attention...|$|R

25|$|In 1961, the {{government}} decided to introduce decimal currency into the country. This necessitated the <b>surcharging</b> of stamps to reflect this change.

Their printing was divided between two local printers, both based in Karachi: Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Time Press, Karachi. Times Press used many plates for printing which resulted in varieties and shifts. Service stamps with decimal surcharges were also printed by the same printers.

2500|$|Merchants {{are charged}} several fees for {{accepting}} credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a commission of around 1 to 4 {{percent of the}} value of each transaction paid for by credit card. The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction. In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the profit margin or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a [...] "credit card supplement" [...] (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment by credit card. This practice was prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and credit card companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges. Most retailers have not started using credit card surcharges, however, for fear of losing customers. <b>Surcharging</b> is actually illegal in 10 states.|$|E

40|$|Expansive clayey soils produce heaving and {{cracking}} of floor slabs and walls. Expansive soils owe their characteristics {{to the presence}} of swelling clay minerals. This soil expands and contracts due to changes in the moisture content of the soil. In this study the <b>surcharge</b> required to counteract soil expansion was measured in natural expansive soils (untreated soils) and lime treated soils starting at 19. 61  kPa (2  Ton/m 2) and continuing with increments of 19. 61  kPa. Additionaly in lime treated soils the amount of lime was determined under different <b>surcharges</b> {{in order to reduce the}} expansion. The test results indicated that the <b>surcharges</b> applied to untreated soils were not proportional to the decrease of expansion which is probably due to the increase of soil density. In fact, only the initial <b>surcharge</b> of 19. 61  kPa significantly decreased the expansion. According to the results, the soil expansion was considerably reduced (1. 54 %) with the <b>surcharge</b> of 78. 45  kPa, therefore this <b>surcharge</b> can be considered as the Swelling pressure. On the other hand the soil tested (high compressibility clay) was stabilized with 6 % of lime (without <b>surcharges)</b> which was determined with the lowest value of liquid limit and plastic index as well as expansion test. After the application of <b>surcharges</b> and lime treatment to expansive soil, the <b>surcharges</b> of 39. 22  kPa and 58. 84  kPa decreased expansion and increased their resistance. This was concluded by similar low values of expansion (without settlements) under both <b>surcharges</b> of each treated soil tested (2, 4 and 6 % of lime). It can be concluded that the <b>surcharge</b> contributed to the decrease of soil expansion due to the decrease of the amount of lime required (6 %) without <b>surcharge.</b> So, 4 % of lime was enough for the <b>surcharge</b> of 19. 61  kPa and 2 % of lime required the <b>surcharge</b> minimum of 39. 22  kPa. This shows that the <b>surcharge</b> of a house on expansive soil reduces soil expansion and therefore reduces costs of any method of soil improvement and special foundation...|$|R
