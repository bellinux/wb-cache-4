2500|$|In 1994, {{geneticist}} Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford University divided {{a principal}} coordinant map of 42 Asian populations into three groupings: Asian Caucasoids, Northeast and East Asian and Southeast Asian. Along Southeast Asia, Cavalli-Sforza {{said that there}} is a separation between northern and southern Mongoloids. To the West, Cavalli-Sforza said there is an approximate boundary between Caucasoids and Mongoloids from the Urals to the eastern part of India. Along this boundary there has been hybridization, causing a Caucasoid-Mongoloid gradient. More specifically, the ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said that were in the Northeast and East Asian cluster were the Koryak, Chukchi, Reindeer Chukchi, Nganasan <b>Samoyed,</b> Northern Tungus, Nentsy, N. Chinese, Tibetan, Bhutanese, Ainu, Mongol, Japanese and Korean. Moving south, the ethnic groups Cavalli-Sforza said that were in the Southeast Asian cluster were the Indonesian, Malaysian, Taiwan aborigines, S.

They set off on May, and on June discovered Bear Island and Spitsbergen, sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called Raudfjorden and entered Magdalenefjorden, which they named Tusk Bay, sailing into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, which they called Keerwyck, but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of Prins Karls Forland, which they named Vogelhoek, on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing Isfjorden and Bellsund, which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as Grooten Inwyck and Inwyck.|$|E

Information and notification duties were the theme of a contract law workshop during the 19 th Ius Commune Conference in Edinburgh in November 2014.

2500|$|He {{advocated}} {{the theory of}} close Turkic-Hungarian linguistic and ethnic relationship, and his publications on the subject provoked a harsh scientific and public debate in Hungary, remembered as the [...] "Ugric-Turk War". Vámbéry argued that {{the large number of}} similarities between Turkic languages and Hungarian pointed to a shared origin of these languages and peoples in Northern Asia. His strongest evidences were the large corpus of ancient Turkish words in Hungarian word-stock (300-400 for a minimum, and even more with good alternative Turkic etymologies), and the strong typological similarity of Hungarian and Turkic languages. In his opinion Hungarian is a contact language, more precisely a mixed language, and a fruit of the intermingling of early Hungarians with Turkic peoples; {{as a result of this}} merger, the Hungarian language got a unique, distinctly dual (Ugric AND Turkic) character. (The intriguing problem of Turkic-Hungarian language relations is far from settled even after centuries of research.) Vámbéry was not the first to suggest such mixed origin; the German linguist and Orientalist Wilhelm Schott (1802-1889) was a proponent of Finn-Turk-Hungarian kinship, and considered the Hungarians (and their language) a mixture of Turkic and Hyperborean / i.e. Saami, <b>Samoyed</b> etc. / elements. Nonetheless, Vámbéry's theory was opposed by proponents of the Finno-Ugric theory of the origins of Hungarian, who gradually triumphed in Hungary but not in Turkey. In Turkey, Hungarian and Turkish are still considered as two branches of the same language family, the Ural–Altaic.|$|E

50|$|However, Alauddin Jauhar ul-Alam Syah {{returned}} to Aceh in 1816 {{and began to}} rally forces against Syarif Saiful Alam Syah. No party was powerful enough to defeat the other. The Acehnese chiefs did not give a very enthusiastic support to Syarif Saiful Alam in spite of earlier promises. The sultan did not feel too secure in the palace in Kutaraja but moved his residence to {{a place at the}} coast, Telok <b>Samoy.</b> The sultan had to trust his father's financial resources. 200 armed men were recruited in Penang, but the British were not interested in direct interference. To make things worse, Sayyid Husain was arrested by the colonial authorities for piratical activities in 1816, as a consequence of attacks against ships trading in areas which supported Alauddin Jauhar ul-Alam Syah. He was soon released, however. Meanwhile, the end of the Napoleonic Wars meant that the British became interested in finding a solution in Aceh that would favour the important pepper trade. A mission under John Coombs visited Aceh in 1818 and found Syarif Saiful Alam to be the rightful claimant. Coombs offered him a treaty with Great Britain which the sultan eagerly endorsed. A new mission was dispatched in the next year under Coombs and Thomas Stamford Raffles. On his way Raffles founded the Singapore colony in February. Arriving to Aceh in March, he took another position than Coombs last year. The sultan's claim to the throne was deemed spurious and Alauddin Jauhar ul-Alam Syah considered the best alternative. The British now made a treaty with him in April 1819. By this time Sayyid Husain had lost large sums on the adventure and his son saw no possibility to maintain his position without British support. The sultan left Aceh in early 1820 and sailed to Calcutta to plead his case. He found no support with the colonial authorities and {{returned to}} Penang in July 1820, leaving Aceh to its fate.
