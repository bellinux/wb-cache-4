40|$|The role of {{terrestrial}} sources of biogenic S and {{their effect on}} atmospheric chemistry remain as major unanswered questions {{in our understanding of}} the natural S cycle. The role of northern wetlands as sources and sinks of gaseous S was investigated by measuring rates of S gas exchange as a function of season, hydrologic conditions, and gradients in trophic status. Experiments were conducted in wetlands in New Hampshire (NH), and in Mire 239, a poor fen at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in Ontario. Emissions were determined using Teflon enclosures, gas cryotrapping methods, and GC with flame photometric detection. Emissions of DMS dominated fluxes. In NH, DMS fluxes were greater than 1. 6 micromol/m(sup - 2) d(sup - 1) in early summer, 1989 when temperatures were warm and the water table was approximately 5 cm below the surface. These rates are several-fold faster than average oceanic rates of DMS emission. A rapid drop in the water table resulted in a 6 -fold decrease in DMS emissions in late July. In 1990, a new beaver dam kept water levels above the surface and S emissions were much lower than during 1989. The elimination of the beaver and a drop in the water table in August produced a rapid increase in S gas emissions. Emissions of DMS were highest in the most oligotrophic areas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to {{determine}} the effect of various petroleum amendments on the migration rate of Cu. The petroleum amendments used in this research are frequently added to the soil surface in petroleum landfarming. Such petroleum wastes often contain significant amounts of Cu and other metals. Soil columns were amended with citric acid, used crankcase oil and Illinois crude oil. Each amendment was spiked (treated) with three different concentrations of Cu and each treatment was replicated three times. The columns were leached once per week, for ten weeks, with distilled water acidified to pH 4. 5 to <b>simulate</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain.</b> Leachate from the soil columns was analyzed weekly for total Cu. At the end of the ten week period, the soil was analyzed for Cu and TOC content at 7 cm intervals to determine the amount of migration by Cu and the organic amendments, resectively. The soil (a Glynwood silt loam) and the organic amendments were each analyzed for total Cu to determine background levels. The soil was analyzed for pH, TOC, electrical conductivity and soil texture. Analysis of the leachate and soil showed differential migration of Cu through the soil columns. Significant levels of Cu leached in the columns amended with citric acid (as high as 85. 3 mg/L) in the first 3 weeks of the study. The Cu content of the leachate from columns amended with crude petroleum were at approximately background levels (5. 5 mg/L) as was the leachate from columns amended with crankcase oil (0. 2 mg/L). In the later weeks of the research, as the petroleum amendments were broken down by microorganisms, some Cu was chelated to small fragments of the petroleum and leached through the soil columns. Most of the Cu appeared to remain {{on the surface of the}} columns, bound to the petroleum amendments. Analysis of the soil, for total Cu content with depth, showed very little Cu accumulation at any depth in the soil column, beyond the soil surface. In most cases Cu levels remained near the background levels found in the control columns. Moderate correlation was found (r 2 =. 59 for crude oil; r 2 = -. 54 for crankcase oil; r 2 =. 85 for citric acid) between Cu levels and TOC levels in the soil columns with depth. From the results of the current study it can be inferred that practices such as petroleum landfarming and land disposal of some hazardous materials may allow for the migration of both the applied petroleum wastes and any metals which may be contained within.

Different effects of <b>simulated</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> (SAR) were found at all stages {{of the development of}} three AMF studied in model systems, including spore germination, colonization of host roots, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and NADH diaphorase activity of the extraradical mycelium. No ALP activity was found in hyphae germinating from the spores without plants whereas it was detected in all hyphae linked to a functioning intraradical mycelium. <b>Simulated</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> also affected the mycorrhizal growth response and belowground competition of the two grasses. Disturbance of the ERM between the two plant species significantly reduced the growth of C. villosa but not D. flexuosa.

D. flexuosa appeared less dependent on the mycorrhizal state, for shoot and root growth, than C. villosa under the experimental conditions. The ability, therefore, of C. villosa to thrive in forest stands suffering from acid rain pollution may be related to this dependence on its mycorrhizal hyphal links to D. flexuosa under the environmental conditions produced by the pollution including higher light levels...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} geopolymerization {{involves}} {{the reaction of}} solid aluminosilicate materials with highly alkaline silicate solution yielding an aluminosilicate inorganic polymer named geopolymer, which may be successfully applied in civil engineering {{as a replacement for}} cement. In this paper we have investigated the influence of synthesis parameters: solid to liquid ratio, NaOH concentration and the ratio of Na 2 SiO 3 /NaOH, on the mechanical properties and hydrolytic stability of fly ash based geopolymers in distilled water, sea water and <b>simulated</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain.</b> The highest value of compressive strength was obtained using 10 mol dm- 3 NaOH and at the Na 2 SiO 3 /NaOH ratio of 1. 5. Moreover, the results have shown that mechanical properties of fly ash based geopolymers are in correlation with their hydrolytic stability. Factors that increase the compressive strength also increase the hydrolytic stability of fly ash based geopolymers. The best hydrolytic stability of fly ash based geopolymers was shown in sea water while the lowest stability was recorded in <b>simulated</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain.</b> [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 172054 i Nanotechnology and Functional Materials Center, funded by the European FP 7 project No. 245916...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Corrosion inhibitors {{are widely}} used in {{concrete}} industry to reduce the corrosion rate of steel rebar which is present in contact with aggressive environments. The present work aims to using Zamzam water from well located within the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia 20 m (66 ft) east of the Kaaba, the holiest place in Islam as corrosion inhibitor for steel in rain water and <b>simulated</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain.</b> The effect of Zamzam water was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Potentiodynami...|$|E
40|$|This study {{uses the}} Canada-United States borderlands (as defined by its {{sensitivity}} to cross-border <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> pollution) to establish patterns of identity that transcend political borders. Along these lines, <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> scientists from Canada and the United States were surveyed {{to determine the}} degree of their agreement with government claims of substantial reductions in the pollutants that cause <b>acid</b> <b>rain.</b> The survey results indicate that despite the successful reduction of certain pollutants, {{the vast majority of}} Canadian and United States scientists believe that <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> pollution continues to adversely affect lakes and streams and that present emissions targets are not protecting sensitive ecosystems. Furthermore, the survey results show that scientists from both countries view the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> issue from similar perspectives, and that national sympathies do not play a decisive role in scientists’ perceptions of the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> issue. In essence, it appears that more and more scientists from Canada and the United States are viewing the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> issue from a shared (or bilateral) perspective...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Here, {{statistical}} analysis {{was carried out}} to investigate monitoring data of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> in Heshan during the past nine years. HeShan city had suffered severe <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> pollution 2004 - 2008, which showed obvious difference {{in time and space}} distribution, summer and autumn is more serious than winter and spring, suburb was significantly higher than the urban area. The <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> pollution of HeShan city mainly comes from industrial air emissions of pollutants. In recent years, as the pollution prevention and waste reduction work in the city and its surrounding cities, <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> appear rate reduced significantly, and has even less than the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> monitoring. 1...|$|R
