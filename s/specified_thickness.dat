Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base.

5000|$|Rolled glass (sometimes called [...] "table glass") is {{produced}} by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling {{can be done by}} hand or by machine. Glass can be [...] "double rolled", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a <b>specified</b> <b>thickness</b> (typically about 1/8" [...] or 3 mm). Glass made this way is never fully transparent, but does not necessarily have much texture. It can be pushed and tugged while molten to create certain effects. For distinct textures the metal cylinder can be imprinted with a pattern that is pressed into the molten glass as it passes through the rollers. The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called cathedral glass, but {{this has nothing to do}} with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.|$|E

40|$|The {{thin layer}} of liquid at the surface of airway epithelium, the airway surface liquid (ASL), is {{important}} in normal airway physiology and in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. At present, the best method to measure ASL depth involves scanning confocal microscopy after staining with an aqueous-phase fluorescent dye. We describe here a simple, noninvasive imaging method to measure ASL depth by reflectance imaging of an epithelial mucosa in which the surface is illuminated at a 45 -degree angle by an elongated 13 -µm wide rectangular beam produced by a 670 -nm micro-focus laser. The principle of the method is that air–liquid, liquid–liquid, and liquid–cell interfaces produce distinct specular or diffuse reflections that can be imaged to give a micron-resolution replica of the mucosal surface. The method was validated using fluid layers of <b>specified</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and applied to measure ASL depth in cell cultures and ex vivo fragments of pig trachea. In addition, the method was adapted to measure transepithelial fluid transport from the dynamics of fluid layer depth. Compared with confocal imaging, ASL depth measurement by surface laser reflectance microscopy does not require dye staining or costly instrumentation, and can potentially be adapted for in vivo measurements using fiberoptics...|$|R
