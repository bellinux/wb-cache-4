5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Kobayashi and his editors {{collaborated on}} the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic {{illustrations}} for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish. As the series' manga artist, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's front cover was to feature Akira Takano, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since {{much of its}} plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima {{on the cover of}} volume six. Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of School Rumble Z.|$|E

5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|A {{support wall}} was built at Sørlia, {{just south of}} Steinkjer, after there was a clay landslide. Construction of the bridge over Figgja, just south of Steinkjer, was {{performed}} in 1904. The superstructure was built by Kværner of Oslo and installed between 11 November and 21 December 1904. The bridge over Steinkjerelva took up {{a significant portion of}} the old river port in Steinkjer, resulting in a spur being built to a new port location. The railway ran right through the town center, forcing 20 houses to be demolished and splitting the town in two. The arrival and route of the railway was described by some locals as vandalism. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen—and thus avoid the town itself—was discarded because it would wreck the military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port. There was also a major debate as to whether the station <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side or north side of the river. The municipal council voted for the south side with the mayor's double vote being decisive. Construction of the bridge over Steinkjerelva started in August 1902 and was completed on 7 May 1904. A proposal to build the bridge as a swing bridge was dropped, forcing the railways to pay NOK45,402 in compensation to companies with facilities upstream.|$|E
5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never {{be used as the}} covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Armenia occupied Bahram {{immediately after the}} conclusion of peace with Rome. Armenia had been without a king since Bahram's brother Shapur IV had vacated the country in 418. Bahram now desired that a descendant of the royal line of kings, a scion of the Arsacids, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne of Armenia. With this intention in mind, he selected an Arsacid named Artaxias IV (Artashir IV), a son of Vramshapuh, and made him king of Armenia.|$|E

Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the keriah in a small black ribbon that is pinned to the lapel rather than in the lapel per se.|$|E
25|$|Philidor's defense {{can also}} be used with the black rook on the fourth rank, if White's king and pawn have not reached that rank. If this defense is used, the black king <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second rank. The {{principle}} is the same: Black keeps his rook on the fourth rank, keeping the white king from advancing to that rank. If the pawn advances to that rank, Black moves the rook to the eighth rank and checks the king from behind.|$|E
25|$|The last {{maneuver}} {{requires that}} the health care provider face the woman's feet, {{as he or she}} will attempt to locate the fetus' brow. The fingers of both hands are moved gently down the sides of the uterus toward the pubis. The side where there is resistance to the descent of the fingers toward the pubis is greatest is where the brow is located. If the head of the fetus is well-flexed, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite side from the fetal back. If the fetal head is extended though, the occiput is instead felt and is located on the same side as the back.|$|E

25|$|Human {{security}} can {{be defined}} as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most vulnerable. It makes sense that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E
25|$|Ghulam Ahmad went to Delhi, {{which was}} at the time {{considered}} a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding {{the life and death of}} Isa (Jesus), particularly Maulana Syed Nazeer Husain (1805–1901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and that the debate <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of the death of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Excavations {{of ancient}} synagogues show that their design {{generally}} conformed with the Talmudic and traditional rule on prayer direction. The synagogues excavated west of Eretz Israel in Miletus, Priene, and Aegina all show an eastern orientation. Josephus, {{in his work}} Against Apion, recorded that the same {{was the case for}} Egyptian synagogues. Synagogues north of Jerusalem and west of the Jordan River, as in Bet Alfa, Capernaum, Hammath, and Khorazin, all face southward, whereas houses of worship east of the Jordan all face west. In the south, the synagogue excavated at Masada faces northwest to Jerusalem. The Tosefta's regulation that the entrance to the synagogue <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern side, while the orientation of the building should be toward the west was followed only in the synagogue in Irbid.|$|E

25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lookout for these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a number}} of {{important}} feather mosaic pieces remain in Mexico. San Pedro is a work from the 16th century, found at the archbishopric of Puebla and shows Roman influence in the style. Another piece in Puebla is a portrait of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, who protected the Indians in Puebla. La Piedad is from the 17th century at the Franz Mayer Museum. It depicts Mary with Jesus dead on her lap. Another piece in this museum is the Virgen del Rosario, from the 17th century, with the imagery of the Rosary important to counter Islam and Protestantism. One important 16th century image is Salvator Mundi at the Museum of Tepotzotlan. It shows influence from Byzantine iconography including Asian features. In the four corners there are Cyrillic characters repeated that have not been deciphered. The inscription FILIUS appears on the right when it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee {{had only}} agreed (28 December 1915) with some {{reluctance}} to make {{preparations for the}} Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Somme, although Robertson and the War Committee were not pleased at Joffre’s suggestion that the British engage in “wearing out” attacks prior to the main offensive. For three months, {{against a backdrop of}} Russia planning to attack earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to attack at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of Battle of Verdun, Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig “would not make a fool of himself” (he told Repington that Haig was “a shrewd Scot who would not do anything rash”), the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).|$|E
