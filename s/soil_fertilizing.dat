40|$|Abstract: One of {{the methods}} of sewage sludge disposal, {{which is based on}} its {{fertilizing}} properties, is its use in nature, e. g. in farming (if all the permissible standards are met). However, the sludge used for soil fertilization might also contain heavy metals, pathogenic microorganisms, thus causing contamination in soil foundation and deterioration of the conditions for development of indigenous organisms. Particular threat is posed by the exi st ence of drug-resistant microorganisms in sewage sludge. This problem has not been researched in detail yet.

Prehistoric arable topsoils were preserved in archaeological pit fillings, whereas adjacent subsoils served as controls. One Early Weichselian humic zone represented the soil status before the introduction of agriculture. Recent topsoils served as an additional reference. The applied multi-proxy approach comprised total P and micronutrient contents, stable N isotope ratios, amino acid, steroid, and black carbon analyses as well as soil color measurements. Total contents of P and selected micronutrients (I, Cu, Mn, Mo, Se, Zn) of the arable soil relicts were above the limits for which nutrient deficiencies could be assumed. All pit fillings exhibited elevated d 15 N values close to those of recent topsoils (d 15 N. 6 to 7 %), giving first hints for prehistoric organic N-input. Ancient legume cultivation as a potential source for N input could not be verified by means of amino acid analysis. In contrast, bile acids as markers for faecal input exhibited larger concentrations in the pit fillings compared with the reference and control soils indicating faeces (i. e. manure) input to Neolithic arable topsoils.

40|$|International audiencePerchlorate (ClO 4 -) is {{a stable}} {{energetic}} oxyanion of chlorine forming high water-soluble salts. Chronic exposure to perchlorate distrub thyroïdic functions. During 2011 - 2015, ClO 4 -has been detected {{in drinking water}} with concentrations above french recommanded levels, in the northeast of France, along frontlines of World War I (WWI), and outside, in agricultural environment. For time, there are no scientifical large scale researchs focusing on the real perchlorate sources in France and theirs relationships with the observed contamination. Moreover, the extent, the time and space fates of the contamination of groundwater have not been studied yet. This desktop study aims to highlight the origins and possible ClO 4 -sources in the speficic historical frame of France. Detailled archivistic researchs have been conducted in France, in London and in the USA. Furthermore, high explosives (HE) loading shells of Great War, discovered near Verdun have been sampled by the BRGM and analyzed for perchlorate, chlorate (ClO 3 -), nitrate, ammonium and NitroAromatic Compounds (NAC). Two origins of perchlorate have been identified: natural ClO 4 -as impurity of chilean nitrates and (electro) synthetic perchlorate. Chilean nitrates had been massively imported in France before the WWII as fertilizers for intensive agriculture of beet and wheat and to supply the industry in nitrogen to produce nitric acid, synthetic fertilizers and NAC. ClO 4 -has thus polluted " conversion salpeter " (KNO 3), entering the composition of traditionnal black powder, ammonium nitrate and TNT of artillery shells, increasing dangerously the sensitivity to detonation when firing the projectiles. The presence of ClO 4 -impurites had been measured by the BRGM in sampled NAC HE as well in black powder by german chemists {{at the end of}} the XIX th century. Premature blastings of shells during firing due to ClO 4 -impurities were described by the gunners since 1880. During Trench War (1915 - 1917), enormous needs of HE for trench artillery and grenades motivated the development and large scale production of 4 types of synthetic (per) chlorated HE compositions, based on mixes of ClO 3 -or ClO 4 -energetic oxidizer with paraffinic fuels colored by methylen blue. 130 900 tons of (per) chlorate HE have been produced in France during WWI in France. The paraffin coating the salts may drasticaly hindered the dissolution rates of the explosives. The perchlorate could be introduced in the soil by old <b>soil</b> <b>fertilizing,</b> sparsed low-order detonation of projectiles, corrosion of the thin steel bodies of unexplosed ordnances, or by massiv ammunition surpluses breaking-down operations during the interwar period. Further researches are needed to define the kinetic dissolution of ClO 4 -in HE, to develop analytical and isotopic tools to fingerprint the origin of perchlorate. Specific methodologies are required too to define the sources, agricultural and/or military, of perchlorate in the specific case of France. Projects aiming these objectives are currently starting in the Vosges Mountain, in the region of Verdun, and in the Champagne area...|$|E
40|$|According to {{estimates}} of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), more than 1. 8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. The pressure on water resources is increased not only in arid and semiarid regions, but also in fast growing megacities {{around the world as}} a result of, amongst other factors, the changing nutritional and consumer behavior (rising living standards). Over 90 % of the annual water consumption of the newly industrializing and developing countries in the arid and semiarid climate zone is used for agricultural irrigation to ensure the nutrition of the population. Thus, {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the planned/controlled reuse of wastewater has developed into a central task of the sustainable water resources management. Wastewater represents a valuable resource in view of its composition (e. g. nutrients P, N for <b>soil</b> <b>fertilizing)</b> and its reliable, weather-independent availability in every household. The establishment of a closed-loop water management can enhance the efficiency of water usage. Therefore, activities in research and development are currently focused on decentralized and semi-centralized concepts, since their structures offer better conditions for the establishment of closed-loop systems and innovations in wastewater technology can be implemented more easily. In general, the hygienic quality requirements for wastewater reuse are predominantly oriented towards the planned usage. These are, in turn, regulated by thresholds and guidance values, e. g. for faecal indicator bacteria (e. g. faecal coliforms: E. coli), in widely differing norms and legal provisions specific to the respective countries. In Germany since 2005, small wastewater treatment plants can obtain the discharge class +H by the German Institute for Civil Engineering (DIBt: Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik) if secondary effluents contain less than 100 faecal coliforms (E. coli) per 100 mL. This ensures a safe effluent seepage in karst and water protection areas. Due to the infectious risk caused by a multitude of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, worm eggs, protozoa) which are still contained in wastewater after mechanical-biological treatment, specific disinfection methods are indispensable for their satisfactory reduction. Demands on disinfection methods for wastewater reclamation are quite complex. They should be characterized by a high and constant disinfection efficiency at low or moderate formation of disinfection by-products. The reclaimed wastewater should be able to be stored safely. Moreover, the disinfection method should be technically simple, scaleable, space-saving, subjected to low maintenance and realized at moderate investment and operating costs without applying external toxic chemicals. Established methods in decentralized wastewater disinfection are mainly based on membrane and UV technologies. However, these methods are currently working under high operating costs (high maintenance and cleaning efforts). Furthermore, the high investment costs of the membrane filtration are disadvantageous. In addition, both methods do not provide a disinfection residual. Thus, further research is required for the development and testing of alternative disinfection technologies. Against this background, the applicability of the electrolysis and UV/electrolysis hybrid technology for the decentralized wastewater reclamation was investigated and assessed in this dissertation. Results have shown that the electrochemical disinfection of biologically treated wastewater represents an efficient method at temperatures of > 6 °C, pH values of 400 J m- 1, no complete removal of E. coli bacteria can be achieved at TSS concentrations of > 17 mg L- 1. Therefore, it is indispensable to prevent bacterial reactivation caused by photo and dark repair processes. This topic was studied in the current work by electrochemically produced oxidants using an electrolysis cell positioned downstream of the UV unit. Results have shown that photo and dark reactivation were completely prevented by oxidants in a total concentration of 0. 5 [...] . 0. 6 mg L- 1 at a TSS concentration of 8 [...] . 11 mg L- 1, at pH values ranging from 5. 7 to 8. 1 and at temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C (t = 24 [...] 72 h). Even at a high TSS concentration of 75 mg L- 1, the reactivation of E. coli (ctotal oxidants = 1. 8 mg L- 1) and, up to a TSS concentration of 32 mg L- 1, the reactivation of total coliforms (except E. coli, ctotal oxidants = 1. 0 mg L- 1) can be prevented at a high initial germ concentration of 2 … 3 105 per 100 mL. The lowest energy consumption could be observed when mixed oxide electrodes (MOX electrodes) were applied. This result and the fact that no chlorate and perchlorate were observed at MOX electrodes argue for the application of these electrodes in practice. All in all, the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology represents an energy-efficient method for reclamation of biologically treated wastewater with TSS concentrations ranging from 6 months). The undesired formation of coverings caused by biofouling processes on quartz glass surfaces could be prevented by electrochemically produced oxidants in a total concentration of 1 mg L- 1 within an experimental duration of 5. 5 months. However, the application of the UV/electrolysis hybrid technology is limited by increased particle concentrations and faecal loadings (initial E. coli concentration). The resulting enhanced demand of electrochemically produced oxidants for the prevention of bacterial reactivation results in a considerable increase of the electric charge input and energy consumption...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Biyokimyasal olarak zor ayrışan, arıtmaya karşı dirençli, toksik ve/veya mutajenik etkileri olan bazı endüstriyel kirleticilerin su kaynaklarımızdaki varlığı ekosistemleri tehdit etmektedir. Endokrin bozucu özellikleri olduğu bilinen ve noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerin bileşiminde bulunan alkil fenol polietoksilat metabolitlerinin konvansiyonel fiziksel, biyolojik ve kimyasal arıtma yöntemleri ile giderimleri yetersiz kalmaktadır. Bu nedenle alkil fenol polietoksilatların ve alkil fenollerin ileri oksidasyon prosesleri gibi ileri arıtma yöntemleri ile giderim çalışmaları ve uygulamaları son yıllarda önem kazanmıştır. İleri oksidasyon prosesleri arasında hızları ve yüksek giderim verimleri nedeniyle Fenton, Fenton-benzeri ve Foto-Fenton proseslerinin atıksu ve su arıtımında sorunlu kirleticilerin oksidasyonu için tercih edilmektedir. Son yıllarda ekonomik, kolay uygulanabilir ve etkin olması nedeniyle hidrojen peroksit ve persülfat gibi oksidanlarla aktive edilebilen sıfır değerlikli demir ile arıtma prosesleri dikkat çekmektedir.   Yukarıdaki bilgiler ışığında bu tez kapsamında, bir oktil fenol polietoksilat bileşiği olan noniyonik bir yüzey aktif maddenin (ticari ismi: Triton X- 45), persülfat (S 2 O 82 -) iyonları ile aktive edilmiş sıfır değerlikli demir kullanılarak arıtımı incelenmiştir. Yüzey aktif maddenin Persülfat/Sıfır değerlikli demir ileri oksidasyon sistemi ile arıtılabilirliği üç aşamada çalışılmıştır. Birinci aşamada, prosesi etkileyen parametrelerin (katalizör konsantrayonu, oksidan konsantrasyonu, pH, arıtma süresi) oksidasyon verimi üzerindeki etkileri araştırılmış, yüzey aktif madde (20 mg/L sulu çözelti) ve TOK giderimi bazında {{optimize}} edilmiştir. En uygun pH değeri 5, optimum persülfat konsantrasyonu 2. 5 mM, optimum katalizör konsantrasyonu 1 g/L, optimum arıtma süresi 60 dk. olarak belirlenmiştir. Çalışmanın ikinci aşamasında arıtma sisteminin ekotoksikolojik etkilerini incelemek üzere seçilen deneysel koşullarda arıtılmış numunelerde akut toksisite testleri gerçekleştirilmiştir. Toksisite biyodeneylerinde test organizmaları olarak Vibrio fischeri fotobakterileri ve bir tatlısu mikroalgi olan Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata kullanılmıştır. Yapılan deneysel çalışmalar neticesinde, belirlenen en uygun arıtma koşullarında OPEO’ nun % 95 TOK’un ise % 40 oranında giderimi sağlanmıştır. Vibrio fischeri ve Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ile yürütülen akut toksisite deneyleri ile 120 dakikalık reaksiyon süresi sonucunda % bağıl toksisite değerleri Vibrio fischeri için % 66 ’dan % 20 ’ye düşürülmüş, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata için ise % 16 olan bağıl toksisite tamamen giderilmiştir. Surfactants are {{organic chemicals}} that reduce surface tension {{in water and}} other liquids. The most familiar use for surfactants are soaps, laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids and shampoos. They are {{a diverse group of}} chemicals with unique cleaning and/or solubilisation properties. They usually consist of a polar (hydrophilic) and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) group. Due to their amphiphilic nature they are widely used in household cleaning agents (detergents), personal care products, textiles, paints, inks, polymers, pesticide formulations, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil recovery as well as pulp and paper industries. Surfactants enter the environment mainly through the discharge of sewage effluents into natural water and the application sewage sludge on land for <b>soil</b> <b>fertilizing</b> purposes. Most of the commercial surfactants used today by different industries are only partially and slowly biodegradable; they tend to sorb and accumulate on sludge and soil  sediments. causing a potential ecotoxicological and pollution risk in the environment. Moreover, the metabolites of some alkyl phenol ethoxylates have recently been declared as hormone mimicking/endocrine disrupting compounds. Therefore, the efficient management and treatment of surfactants remains a serious challenge. In this respect, more effective {{and at the same time}} economically feasible abatement processes have to be developed to alleviate the problem of surfactants/surfactant metabolites in the environment. Alkylphenol polyethoxylates are industrial compounds belonging to the class of nonionic surfactants that are designed to have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Among them, octylphenol polyethoxylates have been widely used in cleaning products, paints, ink dispersants, textile preparation and leather processing, manufacture of pulp and paper, metalworking, cosmetics and personal care products. However, many of these applications are now restricted by the European Commission due to the raising concerns regarding the environmental safety of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates and its metabolites. It has been reported that their aerobic / anaerobic transformation products (alkylphenols such as nonylphenol and octylphenol) are much more inhibitory and estrogenic than the original surfactants. Despite the above-mentioned concerns regarding the use of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates, these products still appear in several industrial applications where they cannot not be replaced by alternative chemicals due to technical and economic reasons. Consequently, the presence of these nonionic surfactants and their degradation products have been reported in water bodies, sediments and sludge associated with the continuing discharges from industrial and sewage treatment plants.   The scientific literature on the biodergadability and fate of alkylphenol polyethoxylates in the aquatic as well as terrestrial environment reinforces the idea that more efficient, alternative treatment processes are needed for their effective elimination. Besides conventional biochemical, chemical and physical treatment methods, chemical oxidation (ozonation, advanced oxidation) has been extensively studied as an alternative for the treatment of nonionic surfactants and their metabolites. Among the existing hydroxyl radicals (HO•) -induced advanced oxidation processes, TiO 2 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, O 3 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes have attracted considerable interest since these exhibit relatively high treatment efficiencies and kinetics. More recently, sulfate radicals (SO 4 •-) -driven advanced oxidation processes have been investigated to treat pollutants found in water and wastewater. The reduction potential of SO 4 •- is lower than that of HO• (2. 6 versus 2. 9 eV); however, SO 4 •- are also capable of non-selectively and rapidly reacting with pollutants in a series of free radical chain reactions being similar to those established for HO•-based advanced oxidation processes. SO 4 •- can be produced from persulfate ions via chemical, radiolytic, thermal or photochemical activation; or alternatively by redox reactions with transition metals as in the case of the Fenton’s reagent. An alternative to iron-based (Fenton-like) advanced oxidation processes are zero valent iron (ZVI; Fe 0) catalyzed treatment systems. They have received global interest and promising results have been reported so far for the removal of chlorinated organics, nitroaromatic compounds, arsenic, heavy metals, nitrate, industrial dyes and phenols by micro-and nanoscale ZVI. ZVI is reactive (redox potential = - 0. 44 eV), non-toxic, abundant, cheap, relatively easy to produce and its treatment applications require little maintenance. ZVI is capable of oxidizing organic as well as inorganic pollutants by an electron transfer mechanism. However, for harsher conditions, ZVI treatment has to be enhanced chemical or thermally by the involvement of oxidants (for example, hydrogen peroxide or persulfate). Besides, the extensive follow-up of toxicity is critical to ensure economically and ecologically safe applications of advanced oxidation processes. The ecotoxicological characterization of sulfate radical-based treatment systems during their application to treat industrial pollutants is an untouched area in this research field. For this purpose, bioassays employing the marine photobacterium Vibrio fischeri remain the most popular test protocols since these enable easy and rapid measurement of cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples being subjected to advanced oxidation. Although V. fischeri is very sensitive and hence useful for obtaining a preliminary idea about the inhibitory effect of pollutants and their degradation products, it is more appropriate to support toxicity results with other types of test organisms preferably from different trophic levels. For example, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are important freshwater microalage being routinely used as primary producers ito assess the acute and chronic toxicity of surfactants.   Considering the above facts, the motivation of the present work was to study the treatability and acute toxicity of the commercially important nonionic surfactant octylphenol polyethoxylate (known as “Triton X- 45 ”) in aqueous solution with the ZVI/S 2 O 82 - advanced oxidation system. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the treatability of a nonionic surfactant with persulfate activated ZVI nanoparticles. Within the scope of this experimental study, firstly, preliminary optimization tests were performed under varying reaction conditions (ZVI and persulfate concentrations, pH’s and treatment time) together with control runs (ZVI only and persulfte only expeirments). Thereafter, time dependent changes in the surfactant, TOC, persulfate concentrations and pH were followed for the optimized treatment system. Then, the acute toxicity of the nonionic surfactant and its degradation products was also followed by employing two different bioassays with V. fischeri and P. subcapitata. It can be said that, OPEO has corrosive and toxic effects on people and other organisms. Results indicated that the nonionic surfactant solution (20 mg/L original concentration) could be degraded in less than 1 hour (40 - 60) by 95 % accompanied with up to 40 % TOC removal by 1 g/L ZVI nanoparticles activated with 2. 5 mM (480 mg/L) persulfate at an initial reaction pH of 5. 0. The acute toxicities (percent relative inhibition rates) decreased significantly from originally 66 % to 21 % and originally 16 % to non-toxic for V. fischeri and P. subcapitata, respectively. The photobacterium V. fischeri appeared to be more sensitive to octylphenol polyethoxylate and its degradation products than the microalgae P. subcapitata. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Therefore, the long-term effect of both mineral (NH 4 NO 3) and organic (manure and GFT-compost) fertilizer applications on the soil methanotrophic community activity and structure were investigated. Both high and low affinity methane oxidation rates were lower in the soil treated with mineral fertilizer compared to the other soils. An enhanced nitrate concentration was observed in the mineral <b>fertilized</b> <b>soil</b> but nitrate did not show a direct affect on the high affinity methane oxidation. In contrast, the low affinity methane oxidation was slowed down by increased nitrate concentrations, which suggests a direct effect of nitrate on low affinity methane oxidation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16 S rRNA gene fragments specific for methanotrophs revealed a distinct community between the mineral and organic <b>fertilized</b> <b>soils</b> as extra Type I methanotrophic bands (phylotypes) became visible in the organic <b>fertilized</b> <b>soils.</b> These phylotypes were not visible in the patterns of the added organic fertilizers suggesting an indirect effect of the organic fertilizers on the methanotrophic community.

A functional nitrogen (N) cycle within mine spoils is necessary for successful long-term revegetation. To initiate successful revegetation of mined lands, large inputs of N fertilizers are required. Urea is gaining worldwide popularity as an N source due to its high N content (47. 0 %) and economical price. Since {{little is known about the}} behavior of urea in the mixed overburden mine spoils of east Texas, a two-year study was conducted to determine rates of urea hydrolysis, and its subsequent nitrification and effects on microbial activity, at reclaimed sites of varied ages. Newly-leveled, I-, 4 -, and 8 -year-old spoil and an unmined soil at the Big Brown Mine in Fairfield, TX, were fertilized with 244 kg N ha-' of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 or urea. After fertilization, soils were periodically analyzed for microbial activity (arginine ammonification, AA; substrate induced respiration, SIR), ability to hydrolyze urea (UH), numbers of nitrifying bacteria, and nitrification potentials (Nps). Only soils from the unmined and newly- leveled sites failed to show increased AA rates. Vegetated mine spoils showed AA rates ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 3 mg NH 4 N kg-I soil h- 1 within seven days. Rates of AA were similar in <b>soils</b> <b>fertilized</b> with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 or urea. Rates of SIR showed a similar pattern, being maximal in the 8 -yr spoil and rates were similar in <b>soils</b> <b>fertilized</b> with (NH 4) 2 SOl or urea. Rates of AA and SIR were highly correlated (r = 0. 59 to 0. 93). Revegetated mine spoils (4 to 8 yrs) showed UH rates as high, or higher than those of the unmined soil. Rates of UH were greatest at the 8 -yr site (ranging from 3. 0 to 3. 5 mg urea-N hydrolyzed kg-' soil h- 1) and lowest at the newly-leveled site (maxi-mum rate of 0. 5 mg urea-N kg-' soil h-'). Rates of UH were similar in <b>soils</b> <b>fertilized</b> with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 or urea.

The newly-leveled site showed NPs below 2 mg N 03 [...] N kg-' soil d- 1. Peak NPs were observed two weeks after fertilization and the (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and urea treatments showed similar rates. Nitrifying bacteria regained pre-mining levels within one year in revegetated mine spoil. Numbers ranged from loglo MPN 3 to 6.

However, <b>soil</b> <b>fertilized</b> two seasons with cow manure or P-compost at 30 t ha− 1 showed a decreasing on EC to 3.76 and 2.25 mS cm− 1, respectively (Table  2). It has been confirmed that the application of organic matter to soils affected by salinity can increase sodium chloride (NaCl) leaching, reduce the exchangeable sodium rate and electrical conductivity, and increase water infiltration, water-holding capacity, and aggregate stability (El-Shakweer et al. 1998).|$|R
