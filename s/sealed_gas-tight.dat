The conical receptacle of the first spacecraft constitutes an exterior portion of a <b>sealed</b> <b>gas-tight</b> compartment. Pressurization of the sealed compartment causes the conical receptacle to extend toward the incoming conical projection of the second spacecraft. When the mating conical portions are latched together, the docking energy is absorbed by the compressed gas in the sealed compartment.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of the work {{described}} in this dissertation is the coupling of PEBBLE (Photonic Explorers for Biomedical use by Biologically Localized Embedding) nanosensors with new sensing technologies. Included in this body of work is the application of fluorescence anisotropy based measurements to PEBBLE nanosensors, {{in order to measure}} analyte concentrations. The advantage of the fluorescence anisotropy technique {{is that it is a}} self-referencing measurement; therefore the process of designing fluorescence based nanosensors is streamlined. Separate measurements were performed on poly (acrylamide) PEBBLEs with embedded Calcium Green and Newport Green indicator dyes in order to sense Ca 2 +(aq.) and Zn 2 +(aq.), respectively. A sol-gel PEBBLE with the embedded [Ru(dpp) 3] 2 + indicator dye was used to make O 2 measurements in a <b>sealed</b> <b>gas-tight</b> optical cell. A second sensing technique investigated utilizes a new photoacoustic based sensing method that utilizes the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye SNARF- 5 F. In the experiment, the photoacoustic response of a series of solutions, with the indicator dye dissolved in buffers that ranged in pH from 6 to 9, was consistent with the trend that one would expect based on the absorption of the SNARF- 5 F dye as a function of pH. This proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates the possibility of creating an in vivo nanoplatform for sensing analyte concentrations in whole, intact tissue using photoacoustic detection. A silver nanoprism colloid was investigated as a potential Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) substrate, with the analyte 4 -mercaptopyridine (4 -MPy). This analyte was chosen as a test molecule because it could be utilized to develop a SERS based pH nanosensor with the nanoprism colloid. It had been discovered that, while the poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) organic capping agent interfered with the acquisition of the SERS signal on the nanoprism colloid, this approach is feasible...|$|E

30|$|A gas supplier, {{comprised}} of inert gas and vacuum supply ports, {{is mounted on}} a second pneumatic z-axis actuator affixed near the vial gripper (Figure  3). In the previous prototype to the ELIXYS [21], the cassettes each had multiple inputs on their bottom surface for inert gas and vacuum that mated with corresponding ports on the synthesizer.

The cassettes contain a rubber gasket around each port to form a <b>gas-tight</b> <b>seal</b> with the port on the robot. The vacuum port is mounted at a height above the inert gas port and on a spring-loaded mechanism to ensure proper sealing of both ports when needed and to avoid collision of the vacuum portion of the gas supplier when vacuum is not needed.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{determining}} the d 13 C of TDIC (Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) in natural waters was developed and tested. The proposed method is based on chemical and physical stripping of CO 2 from water samples. The sampling apparatus consists of a glass bottle (ca 100 ml) totally filled with water sample {{in the field and}} <b>sealed</b> by <b>gas-tight</b> rubber/teflon plug. In the laboratory, we introduce 10 ml of pure Ar as host gas into the bottles and draw out an equal volume of water. About 0. 5 ml of 37 % extra-pure HCl is then injected into the bottle. Water pH decreases to values close to 1 and, therefore, the only carbon species present is CO 2 both as dissolved and gaseous phase. Then the bottle is connected to a vacuum line to extract CO 2 gas and to purify it by means of standard techniques for CO 2 purification. In order to test this method, several sea water samples were prepared and analysed, as well as a series of standard solutions of Na 2 CO 3 at known isotopic composition of carbon.

Secondly, while breaking in newly installed piston rings, a minute amount of wear must occur between rings and cylinder wall in order to seat the rings properly, and ensure a <b>gas-tight</b> <b>seal.</b> If the cylinder walls are too smooth, this wear will not occur, with the rings [...] "skating" [...] over the polished surface.|$|R

5000|$|The early [...] "screw" [...] {{mechanisms}} for sealing the breech consisted of threaded blocks which were screwed tightly into the breech after loading, but the threads themselves were insufficient {{to provide a}} <b>gas-tight</b> <b>seal.</b> This was further complicated {{by the need to}} screw and unscrew the breech as quickly as possible; this was met by the [...] "interrupted thread" [...] breech block, where the block circumference was alternately threaded and left unthreaded at a slightly smaller diameter to allow the whole block to be fully inserted and rotated a fraction to lock it. Hence if the block circumference was divided into two sets of threads and gaps, the block only needed to be rotated ¼ turn to lock it instead of several turns.

The present review aims at reporting the systematic procedures put forward developing a novel concept of diopside-based bilayer GC seal, which contains a rigid GC and a self-healing (SH) GC. The concept behind the bilayer GCs is (i) a small gradient in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) will lead to lower thermal expansion mismatch between the sealing layers and other SOFC components, thus providing enhanced mechanical reliability for the stack; and (ii) cracks produced due to minor thermal stresses in the rigid GC layer can be healed by the SH GC layer due to sufficient amorphous content. In general, at high temperature, highly crystallized glass behaves as a rigid glass. On the other hand, due to low viscosity behavior, partially crystallized glass provides a SH behavior. Various glasses in the field of diopside crystalline materials have been systematically designed by varying the chemical composition of glass to achieve desired combination of functional properties for the rigid and SH GC layers. The glass Sr- 0. 3 where Sr replaced 30 % of Ca was revealed as a highly reliable rigid GC seal for high-temperature electrochemical applications. On the other hand, SH features have been achieved in 30 % Sr-containing diopside-based glass with Gd 2 O 3 for MgO + SiO 2 substitution (denoted as Gd- 0. 3). These GCs exhibit similar thermal properties and excellent thermal stability along a period of 1000 h, while differing in their amorphous fractions, and revealed excellent thermal stability along a period of 1000 h.

40|$|Among {{different}} {{designs of}} solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), planar design {{is the most}} promising due to easier fabrication, improved performance and relatively high power density. In planar SOFCs and other solid-electrolyte devices, <b>gas-tight</b> <b>seals</b> must be formed {{along the edges of}} each cell and between the stack and gas manifolds. For a sealant to work effectively in high-temperature SOFC environment, equilibrium needs to be achieved amid its mechanical properties and flow behavior so that it does not only maintain its hermeticity at high temperature but is also able to reduce mechanical stresses generated in the seal during thermal cycling. The most common sealants based on glass or glass-ceramic materials have been shown to operate in fuel cells for more than 1000 h with no significant degradation. Analysis of the current literature sources demonstrated that from thermal and chemical stability points of view, silicate based glass systems are more suitable than borate and borosilicate glass systems. In this work, different glass-ceramic (GC) compositions based on alkaline- and alkaline-earth aluminosilicate-based glass systems are reviewed with a special emphasis on their thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties. Based on these considerations, glass composition design approaches are provided that aid in search of the best seal glasses satisfying the rigid functional requirements. Among all the glass systems studied, a pyroxene based CaO-MgO-SrO-BaO-La 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 seal GC compositions have been specifically discussed because those have achieved appropriate thermal and chemical properties along with high stability.

40|$|Our {{long term}} goal {{has been to}} make {{detached}} solidification reproducible, which requires {{a full understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying it. Our Moving Meniscus Model of steady-state detachment predicts that it depends strongly on the surface tension of the melt and the advancing contact angle with the ampoule wall. Thus, the objective of the current project was to determine the influence of residual gases on the surface tension and contact angle of molten semiconductors on typical ampoule materials. Our focus was on the influence of oxygen on indium antimonide on clean silica ("quartz"). The research was performed by three chemical engineering graduate students, the third of whom will complete his research in the summer of 2005. Originally, we had planned to use a sealed silica cell containing a zirconia electrochemical element to control the oxygen partial pressure. However, zirconia requires an operating temperature above the 530 C melting point of InSb and is difficult to form a <b>gas-tight</b> <b>seal</b> with silica. Thus, we decided instead to flow an oxygen-containing gas through the cell. A special apparatus was designed, built and perfected. A piece of InSb was placed on a horizontal silica plate in a quartz cell. High purity argon, helium or hydrogen-containing gas is passed continuously through the cell while the oxygen concentration in the effluent gas is measured. The shape of the resulting drop was used to determine contact angle and surface tension of Ga-doped and high purity InSb. Oxygen appeared to decrease the contact angle, and definitely did not increase it. The following section gives the background for the research. Section 2 summarizes the results obtained on Ga-doped InSb with relatively high oxygen concentrations. Section 3 describes recent improvements made to the apparatus and methods of analysis. Section 4 gives recent results for high-purity InSb at low oxygen concentrations. Final results will be obtained only this summer (2005). Each section has its own references...|$|R
40|$|Both ammonia {{oxidizing}} Bacteria (AOB) and ammonia oxidizing Archaea (AOA) {{are abundant}} in soil, but, their relative contributions to soil nitrification are still debated and different {{studies have reported}} contrasting results. It is therefore still unclear under which soil conditions AOB or AOA dominate nitrification. Zinc contamination of soils has a pronounced effect on nitrification in soil, however previous {{studies have shown that}} this effect is transient due {{to the development of a}} tolerant nitrifying community. This study investigates the influence of long-term zinc (Zn) stress on the nitrifying community and determines the role of the Archaea and Bacteria in nitrification of soils exposed to Zn. To assess this, a grassland soil was artificially spiked with 1300 and 2400 mg Zn kg- 1, as ZnCl 2, and incubated outside, receiving each 4 months 150 mg NH 4 +-N kg- 1. Nitrification was inhibited by Zn after incubation for 1 week and 2 months. However, after 12 months Zn exposure, nitrification in both Zn-contaminated treatments was restored to the initial nitrification rate of the uncontaminated soil. The soil ammonia oxidiser community in both Zn treatments developed larger Zn tolerance than the uncontaminated soil. Soil was sampled after 12 months incubation and the samples were subsequently subjected to Stable Isotope Probing (SIP) of DNA by incubating 20 g of pre-incubated soil under 13 CO 2 atmosphere at 30 °C for 24 days in <b>gas-tight</b> <b>sealed</b> bottles. Ammonia was supplied at days 0, 8 and 16 (100 mg N kg- 1 soil) following injection of 6 ml of 13 CO 2 or 12 CO 2, in triplicate. Bottles were opened twice weekly to ensure aerobic conditions, resealed and CO 2 concentrations were reestablished. Soil was sampled at day 24, total DNA was extracted from soil and DNA extracts were subjected to isopycnic centrifugation in a CsCl gradient (Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge, rotor VTI 65. 2, 24 h, 186000 g) separating 13 C-labelled DNA from 12 C labelled DNA into different fractions. Only active populations, i. e. populations that autotrophically consumed CO 2, incorporate 13 C into their DNA. The abundance of ammonia oxidizing Bacteria and Archaea was measured in each fraction by qPCR of amoA genes, using primers amoA- 1 F and amoA- 2 R to target AOB and primers Crenamo 23 F and Crenamo 616 R to target AOA. 13 C was assimilated by AOB in the uncontaminated soil, as indicated by a higher relative abundance of AOB in heavier fractions than in 12 C-incubated samples. This clear shift was not observed for the AOA. After Zn exposure for 12 months a similar pattern was observed in both Zn treatments. These results show that, although ammonia oxidising Archaea dominate the number of nitrifying microorganisms in the uncontaminated soil, ammonia oxidizing Bacteria are responsible for soil nitrification. Stress conditions, arising from chronic zinc exposure, increased the relative abundance of AOB to AOA and did not change the predominance of AOB in soil nitrification activity. These results indicate that the recovery of nitrification after long-term Zn exposure and development of Zn tolerance in this soil is due to the activity of AOB, rather than AOA. status: publishe...|$|R
