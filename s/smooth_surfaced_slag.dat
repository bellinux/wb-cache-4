40|$|Recent {{advances}} in graphics hardware {{enable us to}} handle not only simple polyhedral shapes but complicated smooth shapes in CAD systems. Since the CAD systems represent such <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> by extending conventional simplicial representation, there are several problems in handling the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> shapes that have no intuitive polyhedral approximations. The first {{problem is that the}} design of <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> requires a large amount of user interactions because of the complexity of the shapes. Secondly, none of the design operations characteristic of <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> are taken into account in contemporary CAD systems. Furthermore, they cannot provide the users with any efficient keys for shape databases {{due to the lack of}} information about <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> features. To remedy such problems, hierarchical representations of <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> based on the shape features are necessary. This thesis presents a new feature-based modeling method for <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In particular, the aim of this thesis is to implement bidirectional operations between object shapes and shape features for <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces,</b> i. e., design by features and feature extraction. As the shape features, critical points such as peaks, pits, and passes ar...|$|R

First of all, we give an explicit approximat- ion of the unfolding of a <b>smooth</b> developable <b>surface</b> with the unfolding of a developable triangle mesh close to the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> The quality of the approximation depends on the maximal angle between the normals of the two surfaces and the relative curvature distance of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> (which {{is linked to the}} curvature of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> and the Hausdorff distance between the two surfaces).

40|$|Replacing a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> with a {{triangular}} mesh (i. e., a polyedron) "close to it " leads to some errors. The geometric {{properties of the}} triangular mesh can be very dierent from the geometric properties of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface,</b> even if both surfaces are very close from one another. In this paper, we give examples of " triangular meshes (the discrete Gaussian curvature is equal to 0 at each interior vertex) inscribed in a sphere (whose Gaussian curvature is equal to 1 at every point). However, if we make assumptions on the geometry of the triangular mesh, on the curvature of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> and on the Hausdor distance between both surfaces, we get an estimate of several properties of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> {{in terms of the}} properties of the triangular mesh. In particular, we give explicit approximations of the normals and of the area of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Furthermore, if we suppose that the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> is developable (i. e., "isometric " to a surface of the plane), we give an explicit approximation of the "un-folding " of this surface. Just notice that in some of our approximations, we do not suppose that the vertices of the triangular mesh belong to the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Oddly, the upper bounds on the errors are better when triangles are right-angled (even if there are small angles) : we do not need every angle of the triangular mesh to be quite large. We just need each triangle of the triangular mesh to contain at least one angle whose sine is large enough. Besides, approximations are better if the triangles of the triangular mesh are quite small where the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> has a large curvature. Some proofs will be omitted...|$|R

30|$|In summary, we {{presented}} an efficient route to prepare ultra-smooth substrates by first annealing and then electro-polishing commercial copper, {{which is more}} effective in achieving a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> than just annealing or electro-polishing alone. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} thermal annealing can release the residue internal strain and dislocation, thus the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> achieved by electro-polishing can be preserved at elevated temperatures for graphene growth. The efficiency of the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> prepared in this way was demonstrated by the reduction of graphene domain density, adlayer density, defect density, and the improvement of electrical transport performance.|$|R

The {{character}} of the principal foliations on a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> in R 3 is not well understood, in particular whether there are geometric or topological restrictions on their singularities (umbilics) distinguishing them from the singularities of arbitrary smooth foliations on an abstract <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> The non-existence of elliptic sectors in the principal foliations would give the Carathéodory conjecture that the index of an isolated umbilic is j ≤ 1. We show that if an elliptic sector exists in the principal foliations on a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> in R 3 {{it would have to}} be highly complicated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new {{binocular}} stereo algorithm that estimates scene structure {{as a collection}} of <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> patches. The disparities within each patch are modeled by a continuous-valued spline, while the extent of each patch is represented via a pixelwise partitioning of the images. Disparities and extents are alternately estimated in an iterative, energy minimization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that, for scenes consisting of <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the proposed algorithm significantly improves upon the state of the art.

40|$|In {{geometric}} modeling and processing, computer graphics and computer vision, <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> are approximated by discrete triangular meshes reconstructed from sample {{points on the}} surfaces. A fundamental problem is to design rigorous algorithms to guarantee the geometric approximation accuracy by controlling the sampling density. This paper gives explicit formulae to the bounds of Hausdorff distance, normal distance and Riemannian metric distortion between the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> and the discrete mesh in terms of principle curvature and the radii of geodesic circum-circle of the triangles. These formulae can be directly applied to design sampling density for data acquisitions and surface reconstructions. Furthermore, we prove that the meshes induced from the Delaunay triangulations of the dense samples on a <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> are convergent to the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> under both Hausdorff distance and normal fields. The Riemannian metrics and the Laplace-Beltrami operators on the meshes are also convergent to those on the <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These theoretical results lay down {{the foundation for a}} broad class of reconstruction and approximation algorithms in {{geometric modeling}} and processing. Practical algorithms for approximating surface Delaunay triangulations are introduced based on global conformal surface parameterizations and planar Delaunay triangulations. Thorough experiments are conducted to support the theoretical results...|$|R

30|$|As seen in Fig. 4 b, {{increasing}} {{the concentration of}} kerosene correspondingly decreases the signal and, consequently, the spreading of the binary mixtures on the <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Nevertheless, the contact angle suggests otherwise.
