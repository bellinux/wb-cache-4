2500|$|The third, and {{practically}} most important strategy for creditor protection, was {{to require that}} dividends and other returns to shareholders could only be made, generally speaking, if a company had profits. The concept of [...] "profit" [...] is defined by law as having assets above the amount that shareholders, who initially bought shares from the company, contributed {{in return for their}} shares. For example, a company could launch its business with 1000 shares (for public companies, called an [...] "IPO" [...] or initial public offering) each with a nominal value of 1 penny, and an issue price of £1. Shareholders would buy the £1 shares, and if all are sold, £1000 would become the company's [...] "legal capital". Profits are whatever the company makes on top of that £1000, though as a company continues to trade, the market price of shares could well be going up to £2 or £10, or indeed fall to 50 pence or some other number. The Companies Act 2006 states in section 830 that dividends, or any other kind of distribution, can only be given out from surplus profits beyond the legal capital. It is generally the decision of the board of directors, affirmed by a shareholder resolution, whether to declare a dividend or perhaps simply retain the earnings and invest them back into the business to grow and expand. The calculation of companies' assets and liabilities, losses and profits, will follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the UK, but this is not an objective, scientific process: a variety of different accounting methods can be used which can lead to different assessments of when a profit exists. The prohibition on falling below the legal capital applies to [...] "distributions" [...] in any form, and so [...] "disguised" [...] distributions are also caught. This has been held to include, for example, an unwarranted <b>salary</b> <b>payment</b> to a director's wife when she had not worked, and a transfer of a property within a company group at half its market value. A general principle, however, recently expounded in Progress Property Co Ltd v Moorgarth Group Ltd is that if a transaction is negotiated in good faith and at arm's length, then it may not be unwound, and this is apparently so even if it means that creditors have been [...] "ripped off". If distributions are made without meeting the law's criteria, then a company has a claim to recover the money from any recipients. They are liable as constructive trustees, which probably mirrors the general principles of any action in unjust enrichment. This means that liability is probably strict, subject to a change of position defence, and the rules of tracing will apply if assets wrongfully paid out of the company have been passed on. For example, in It’s A Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula the directors of a bankrupt company argued that they had been unaware that dividend payments they paid themselves were unlawful (as there had not in fact been profits) because their tax advisers had said it was okay. The Court of Appeal held that ignorance of the law was not a defence. A contravention existed so long as one ought to have known of the facts that show a dividend would contravene the law. Directors can similarly be liable for breach of duty, and so to restore the money wrongfully paid away, if they failed to take reasonable care.|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates in {{a dynamic}} context {{the effect of}} Chief Executive Officer (CEO) bonus and <b>salary</b> <b>payments</b> on banks’ {{technical}} efficiency levels. Our methodological framework incorporates the latest developments on the probabilistic approach of efficiency measurement as introduced by Bădin et al. (2012). We apply time-dependent conditional efficiency estimates to analyse a sample of 37 US banks for the period from 2003 to 2012. The empirical evidence reveals a non-linear relationship between CEO bonus and <b>salary</b> <b>payments</b> and banks’ efficiency levels. More specifically it is reported that <b>salary</b> and bonus <b>payments</b> affect differently banks’ technological change and technological catch-up levels. Finally, the empirical evidence suggests that higher <b>salary</b> and bonus <b>payments</b> are not always aligned with higher technical efficiency levels...|$|R
