5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, the {{imperial}} library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.

5|$|In 1285 Joachim III {{was sent}} to Constantinople to {{liberate}} Theodore Svetoslav, who <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> hostage.

5|$|In 1791, Jacques-Joseph Saint-Martin, an agronomist from Limoges, {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Limousin cattle in the markets of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. Limousin cattle actually came from the departments of Charente, Dordogne, Haute-Vienne, Vienne, Lot, Corrèze and Creuse. The market for Limousin cattle declined slightly in the early 19th century, but livestock <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> a major activity in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} to legalize birth control {{came to a}} gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> on the books) were rarely enforced.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began {{clearing}} the Japanese fighting {{positions on the}} hill, most of which <b>still</b> <b>remained,</b> with explosive charges, grenades, and hand-to-hand combat. From {{the top of the}} hill, the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo.

5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Dean left ATP and became the head of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), the organisation that provided entertainment to the British Armed Forces. Over the course of five months Formby requested to sign up for ENSA, but was denied; Dean relented in February 1940, and Formby was signed on a fixed salary of £10 per week, although he <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> under contact to ATP. He undertook his first tour in France in March, where he performed for members of the British Expeditionary Force.|$|E
5|$|Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (5 August 1301 – 19 March 1330) was {{the sixth}} son of Edward I of England, {{and a younger}} {{half-brother}} of Edward II. Edward I had intended to make substantial grants of land to Edmund, but when the king died in 1307, Edward II failed {{to follow through on}} his father's intentions, much due to his favouritism towards Piers Gaveston. Edmund <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> loyal to his brother, and in 1321 he was created Earl of Kent. He played an important part in Edward's administration, acting both as diplomat and military commander, and in 1321–22 helped suppress a rebellion against the king.|$|E

5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} was {{achieved}} by conducting a shoestring operation, one that was fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the close-out of aerial operations over North Vietnam, Barrel Roll <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> in last place. During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the contest}} against Missouri, sportswriters touted the Texas A game as {{showcasing}} {{two of the}} best dual-threat quarterbacks playing in college football. However, Texas A's starting quarterback Reggie McNeal missed the game due to an ankle injury; instead, freshman quarterback Stephen McGee made his first start. The game was a back-and-forth affair ultimately won by Texas, 40–29. The elevenpoint win was their second slimmest margin of victory of the regular season to that point, and they lost points in all threemajor polls but <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> solidly in secondplace.|$|E

5|$|Partly in {{response}} to Nakaguma's attacks, on 24 October the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines under Lieutenant Colonel Herman H. Hanneken deployed to the Matanikau. After Oka's forces were sighted approaching the Marine Matanikau positions from the south, Hanneken's battalion was placed on a ridge facing south which formed a continuous extension of the inland flank of the Marine's horseshoe-shaped Matanikau defenses. A gap, however, <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> between Hanneken's left (east) flank and the main perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez is {{friends with}} José Mesa. Mesa helped teach Ramírez English, helped teach {{him how to}} pitch, and {{translated}} for him in 2006 while both were with the Rockies.

5|$|St Mary's {{is a small}} church, {{measuring}} 30feet by 12feet 3inches (about 9.1 by 3.7m). It {{dates from}} the late medieval period, and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones. It had a slate roof, {{although most of the}} roof has now gone, and there is a bellcote at the west end, which may be original rather than a later addition. There is no physical division between the nave and the chancel, although one account in the 19th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them, and some traces of it <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> at that time.|$|E

5|$|The Saturn {{version of}} Silver Star Story was well {{received}} in Japan, with Weekly Sega Saturn Magazine recognizing {{it as one}} of the most memorable gaming experiences of 1997. The PlayStation version received a 7 out of 10 score from Hyper PlayStation magazine, remarking that although it contained lower quality visual effects and movie playback than the previous Saturn releases, it <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> a solid role-playing game. It sold enough to qualify for Sony's PlayStation the Best distinction, and was subsequently re-released in Japan in April 1999 at a budget price.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the island entered a long, {{stagnant}} period. Many businesses relocated off of the island. By 1959, the city of Houston had long out-paced Galveston in population and economic growth. Recognizing this, the Reverend Wendelin J. Nold, fifth bishop of the Galveston Diocese, was permitted by the Vatican to erect a Cathedral of convenience in Houston, naming Sacred Heart Church as co-cathedral. The diocese was then re-designated the Diocese of Galveston-Houston. Galveston and St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> {{the home of the}} diocese, but now the bishop could more easily access the rapidly growing Roman Catholic population in Houston.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. The Japanese justice system of the original <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
