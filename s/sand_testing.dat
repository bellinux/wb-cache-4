40|$|Chemically bonded sand cores and molds {{are more}} {{commonly}} referred to as precision sand systems in the high production automotive powertrain sector. Their behavior in contact with molten metal can lead to casting defects. Consequently, the interaction is of great interest and an important part of metal casting technology. The American Foundry Society (AFS) <b>sand</b> <b>testing</b> is based on physical, mechanical, thermal and chemical properties of the sand system. Foundry engineers have long known that certain AFS sand tests provide limited information regarding control of molding and casting quality. The inadequacy {{is due to the fact}} that sand casting processes are inherently thermo-mechanical, thermo-chemical and thermo-physical. Non-standard foundry <b>sand</b> <b>testing</b> has proven useful for laboratory measurement of these characteristics in foundry sand using a disc-shaped specimen. Similarly, the equivalent disc-shaped specimens are used for casting trials. In order to accomplish near-net-shape casting with minimal defects, it is necessary to understand both the properties of the sand system, as well as the interface of molten metal when different binders, additives and/or refractory coatings are used. The methodology for the following non-standard chemically bonded sand tests is described: (1) disc transverse; (2) impact; (3) modified permeability; (4) abrasion; (5) thermal distortion; (6) quick loss on ignition. The data related to the non-standard sand tests were analyzed and interpreted. The test results indicate that there is relatively lower test-to-test variability with the disc-shaped specimens.

The fundamental differences to 3 DP with organic binders (which is {{state of the}} art) are explained and the quality relevant process parameters of the inorganic process are introduced. Since the inorganic binder system is thermally activated during the printing process the main focus lies on the heating procedure. The properties of printed specimens are measured by the quality features fluid migration and strength for which novel methods of moulding <b>sand</b> <b>testing</b> are used.

40|$|The {{application}} of Resistive Force Theory to further understand {{the dynamics of}} wheeled locomotion through granular materials was explored. Resistive Force Theory is a new terradynamic model that simplifies the calculation of the forces applied to bodies moving through granular media because it utilizes linear superposition and is easily scalable to any material of interest. First, a MATLAB simulation was created to test different wheel designs rotating through sand. The designs tested include a four-spoke design, consisting of four treads that have a hinge halfway down their length set to a specific angle, and a "superball" design, consisting of different solid shapes defined by the "superball" equation. The average velocity and power were found for each case to find an optimal design. It was found that four-spoke designs with an angle 6 < 1800 were optimal {{as they reached the}} highest velocities, while requiring the least power. Next, dimensional analysis was performed to find a global scaling relationship for the RFT wheel designs. Scaling laws for the power and velocity were found that allow different wheel designs and conditions to be simulated with an entirely new system. Using the simulation, {{it was found that the}} scaling law for a tire rotating on Mars could be tested on Earth up to a high degree of accuracy. Physical experiments, using 3 D printed wheels and a <b>sand</b> <b>testing</b> bed, were carried out to further validate the scaling relationship. Both four-spoke and "superball" designs were tested and seem to show the general scaling trend expected. by James Slonaker. Thesis: S.

40|$|Physical {{experiments}} were conducted using 3 D printed wheels and a <b>sand</b> <b>testing</b> bed {{to explore the}} applications and predictive power of the Resistive Force Theory (RFT), an empirical model based on linear superposition designed to predict the interactive forces between solid bodies and granular media. Four-spoke wheel designs, made of four treads with a hinge halfway down each tread set to a prescribed angle 0, and cylindrical wheels were used to validate a scaling law determined from RFT. The 3 D printed wheels were attached to an experimental test rig that consisted of a motor fixed to a carriage free to move horizontally and vertically. Data was gathered {{through a series of}} horizontal, vertical, and angular position sensors and a set of force and torque sensors, then processed with a MATLAB script and determined to validate the RFT scaling law. Next, the design of an actuated wheel capable of altering its shaped while in motion was explored. RFT predicts that as motion conditions of the wheel change, a corresponding change {{in the shape of the}} wheel would lead to an improvement in the wheel's performance. In order to properly analyze the effect of the change of shape of the wheel, the actuated wheel was designed to first only change shape in the in-plane dimension, and second be sufficiently rigid such that it does not exhibit excessive deformation in the new shape while under load. Several designs were explored, and the final form of the "FrankenWheel" is designed with a series of five flaps that rotate to fixed angles using a system of gears, hinges, and a secondary motor. This version of the "FrankenWheel" has been assembled for testing. by David Carrington Motley. Thesis: S. B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{has three}} major purposes: (1) {{to explore the}} static liquefaction phenomenon in saturated sand as a relevant geotechnical hazard, (2) to show the conventional testing procedures for index characterisation and strength testing of saturated fine sands at low stress levels, and (3) {{to look into the}} fluidization mechanism and the ongoing research into its applications in saturated <b>sand</b> <b>testing,</b> done at Delft University of Technology. The exploring on static liquefaction was performed by a literature study, which allowed to relate the macroscopic scale of this hazard in underwater slopes with the common practices performed in laboratory conditions. The literature found shows that a change in the framework of understanding saturated sand behaviour, accounting for anisotropy, may occur within the next years. In addition, the literature supports that improvements on the liquefaction prediction can only be done via: improvements of: the theoretical framework in which the sand behaviour is studied, the constitutive and numerical models used for prediction of the liquefaction mechanism and the testing and the physical modelling methods allowing for both sand characterisation and the determination of the constitutive model parameters. Some tests performed to characterise a fine sand were selected to see how the method can affect the obtained results and how the conditions of the sample preparation and control can affect the liquefaction potential on a saturated sand sample. The results support that idea that the amount of fines on the sand, indicated generally by a sieving test, can affect the results of the index minimum and maximum void ratio, differentiating the properties of a sand with fines and a sand without fines. In addition, several variables such as the degree of saturation, confining stress levels and membrane penetration can {{contribute to the development of}} pore pressures and the development of liquefaction. The literature study reveals that fluidization has been used on research on granular soils sedimentation, documented in the work by Allen (1984), and is not as new in earth sciences as it was thought to be. Based on the undrained triaxial testing procedure suggested by Jager and Molenkamp (2015 a), where fluidization will be used for sample preparation, some sand batches were prepared, in which layers were removed to characterise the final product. While the results on void ratio distribution along the depth of the column are not sufficient to draw further conclusions, it was found that the discharge rate can affect the porosity distribution during and after fluidization. The study not only showcases two techniques that can allow a quantitative assessment of fluidization mechanism, but also that inclusion of this method in loose sample preparation could bring improvements into granular soils characterisation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to understand the processes influencing the colloidal silica grout injection into porous media through experimental and numerical investigations. Experimental studies include viscosity measurements, grout injection into columns and grouted <b>sand</b> <b>testing.</b> The grout viscosities are measured during gelation under shear. Colloidal silica grout injection experiments are performed on two different sizes of columns to understand the grouting processes as well as to generate data for numerical simulations. The larger diameter column experiments are performed by varying colloidal silica solution and the type of water. The smaller diameter column (slim tube) experiment was conducted to obtain the data in the absence of fingers. The use of dyes aided in visualizing the grout flow patterns and understanding the processes. A numerical model is developed by non-iteratively coupling a groundwater flow simulation model (MODFLOW) and a 3 -D multi-species reactive transport model (RT 3 D) and adding modules for the gelling process to simulate the chemical grouting in porous media. A grout gelation model is developed to estimate gel viscosity as a function of reaction time, grout concentration and shear rate. The flow field is periodically updated by taking into account the changing effective hydraulic conductivity in each cell as a result of non-uniform gel viscosity. The numerical model is verified and validated against (i) an analytical solution developed in this study, and (ii) the available numerical model results from literature, respectively. The grout model is used to analyse the experimental data of sodium silicate grout injection into the sand column as reported in literature. The grout model is also used to analyse the observations made in the colloidal silica grout injection experiment performed as part of this study. Simulation of grout injection has shown that the shear is an important parameter not incorporated in previous grouting models. The model captured the viscous fingers observed in the column experiments. The model has been able to predict the experimentally observed injection pressures in the mild slope region. The difference between experimental observations and numerical results increased {{towards the end of the}} simulation when the pressures increased steeply. It is hypothesized that this is due to the absence of filtration component in the model. The macromolecules filtered out at the pore throats contribute to the need for higher grout injection pressures. The model provides valuable insights in identifying the complex processes such as viscosification, shear, viscous finger formation and filtration, occurring during grouting.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of natural}} soils is highly influenced by structural features arising from their geological history and was recognised to lie outside current frameworks which account {{only for the}} stress-volume state of the soil. The objective of the research was to compare the shear behaviour and stiffness of two naturally cemented sands: a calcarenite with relatively low densities, weak particles and strong bonding and a silica sandstone with high densities, strong particles and weak bonding. Comparative studies were also undertaken on their corresponding reconstituted soils and on an artificially cemented carbonate <b>sand.</b> <b>Testing</b> was performed in stress path controlled triaxial systems {{over a wide range}} of confining pressures. Identification of the yield surface was found to be an essential feature to describe the shear behaviour of the soils examined. The determination of the yield points of such stiff soils required internal measurements of stresses and strains, with an accuracy higher than currently achieved in soil testing. For reliable determinations of stiffness and yielding the uniformity of strains in the samples had to be guaranteed. Therefore several parts of the equipment were redesigned or modified and new sample preparation and setting up procedures were developed. Comparison of results from natural and reconstituted soils showed that bonding increased the stiffness and the stress-strain linearity. For the naturally cemented sands the maximum shear modulus was found to vary with state only when the soils were sheared after isotropic yielding. Undrained loading-unloading probes showed that the linear behaviour was reversible and that plastic strains were accompanied by a progressive deterioration of bonding resulting initially in a reduction of the yield stresses and finally, after sufficient cycling in a decrease of the maximum shear modulus. The combined influence of bond strength and specific volume on yielding could be accounted for when normalizing the yield stresses by an equivalent pressure taken on the state boundary in isotropic compression. This type of normalization also allowed the full state boundary to be identified. The yield surface was found to be the boundary limiting the domain governed by bonding and for the calcarenite occupied a larger portion of the permissible states than for the silica sandstone. States between the yield surface and the state boundary surface were controlled by bond degradation and either particle crushing for the calcarenite or dilation for the silica sandstone. After accounting for differences in states, both naturally cemented sands showed peak strengths which were higher than those for the reconstituted soils. For the calcarenite the peak strengths simply resulted from cohesion, as the peak stress ratios were reached on the yield surface. Only when stress ratios at yielding were lower than the critical state stress ratio the strength was truly frictional and coincident with the critical state. For the silica sandstone, in contrast, the peak strengths were found to be frictional except at the lowest confining pressures. The peak stress ratios were reached at states above the yield surface and were associated with a maximum rate of dilation. The dilatancy and strength of the intact soil were higher than those of the reconstituted soil at comparable states and were interpreted as resulting from differences in fabric and from the delayed volumetric response induced by the presence of bonding at the early stages of shearing. The case of the silica sandstone showed that only when density is a predominant factor in comparison with bonding then different modes of shear behaviour follow the theory of Critical State Soil Mechanics...|$|E
