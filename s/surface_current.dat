5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a <b>surface</b> <b>current</b> can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

Where high frequency currents are considered, with skin effect, the <b>surface</b> <b>current</b> densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace equation. Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire radius {{and the distribution of}} the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Surface {{currents}} play a {{major role}} in the distribution of contaminants, the connectivity of marine populations, and can influence the vertical and horizontal distribution of nutrients within the water column. This paper aims to determine the effects of sea breeze-wind patterns on the climatology of the <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> on the continental shelf surrounding Rottnest Island, WA Australia. The alternating wind patterns allow for full cyclic rotations of wind direction, permitting the interpretation of the effect of the wind on the <b>surface</b> <b>currents.</b> It was found that the <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> only clearly follow the northbound Capes Current in times when the Fremantle Doctor sets in. <b>Surface</b> <b>currents</b> react within an hour to a change of direction of the wind, allowing southerly currents to dominate during strong northerly sea breezes, often followed by mixed currents dominated by eddies in the inter-lying times.

25|$|The Great Whirl {{is a huge}} anti-cyclonic eddy {{generated}} by the Somali current flowing in (northern) summer, {{and one of the}} two gigantic Indian Ocean Gyres (the other is the Socotra Gyre). The Great Whirl can be observed between 5-10°N and 52-57°E off the Somali coast in the summer season, a location typically around 200km southwest of the Socotra Gyre (between June to September). However, in the past both the Great Whirl and the Socotra Gyre have been known to occasionally collapse, and their exact locations differ from year to year. The Great Whirl's typical size is 400–600km in horizontal diameter, and typical <b>surface</b> <b>current</b> velocity is 1.5-2.0m/s.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{satellite}} Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields to retrieve zonal and meridional <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> (U,V) {{is now a}} widespread idea. Since the classical approach involves temporal differencing of SST fields, we investigate in this paper {{the extent to which}} mesoscale ocean dynamics may be decomposed into a superposition of dynamical modes, characterized by different linear relationships between <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> and temperature fields. Based on a completely observation-driven approach, we propose a latent class regression model from local satellite <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> and patches of SST measurements. Applied to the highly dynamical Agulhas region, we demonstrate and discuss the geophysical relevance of the proposed mixture model to achieve a spatio-temporal segmentation and tracking of the ocean surface dynamical modes.

40|$|A {{new method}} for mapping shallow water {{topography}} <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> from SAR image is introduced {{based on the}} shallow water topography SAR imaging mechanism. M 4 S (presented by Romeiser R.) was used to forward simulate radar signatures of the oceanic features over the ocean surface. The first guessed <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> can be estimated from the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of the shallow water topography profile in the SAR image according to the Apers-Hennings linear theory, the NRCS induced by the varying shallow water topography <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> could be simulated by the forward simulating model. The wind speed and shallow water topography <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> gradients are modified using the iterative method until the simulated radar signals close to the NRCS calculated from SAR image. By this method, the wind speed and the <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> can be retrieved finally. This method is tested on an ERS- 2 SAR image in the Taiwan Shoal. Results show that the simulated shallow water topography radar signal {{is consistent with the}} NRCS extracted from SAR image, and their correlation coefficient is up to 90 %, which means that this method is convergent and applicable...|$|R
60|$|The {{source of}} this {{humidity}} is the southerly or sea wind which blows steadily from May till October in Sikkim, and prevails {{throughout the rest of}} the year, if not as the monsoon properly so called, as a current from the moist atmosphere above the Gangetic delta.

When it is considered that this wind, after passing lofty mountains on the outer range, has to traverse eighty or one hundred miles of alps before it has watered all the forest region, it will be evident that its moisture must be expended before it reaches Tibet.|$|E

40|$|A third {{generation}} numerical wave model SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) {{was applied to}} study the spatio-temporal effect of <b>surface</b> <b>currents</b> and sea level height on significant wave height; and to describe the mechanisms responsible for wave–current interaction in the eastern Baltic Sea. Simulation results were validated by comparison with in situ wave measurements in deep and shallow water, carried out using the directional wave buoy and RDCP respectively, and with TerraSAR-X imagery. A hindcast period from 23 to 31 October 2013 included both a period of calm to moderate weather conditions and a severe North-European windstorm called St. Jude. The prevailing wind directions were southerly to westerly.
