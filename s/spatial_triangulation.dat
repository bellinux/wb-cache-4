40|$|With the {{development}} of space technology {{and the performance of}} remote sensors, high-resolution satellites are continuously launched by countries around the world. Due to high efficiency, large coverage and not being limited by the spatial regulation, satellite imagery becomes one of the important means to acquire geospatial information. This paper explores geometric processing using satellite imagery without ground control points (GCPs). The outcome of <b>spatial</b> <b>triangulation</b> is introduced for geo-positioning as repeated observation. Results from combining block adjustment with non-oriented new images indicate the feasibility of geometric positioning with the repeated observation. GCPs are a must when high accuracy is demanded in conventional block adjustment; the accuracy of direct georeferencing with repeated observation without GCPs is superior to conventional forward intersection and even approximate to conventional block adjustment with GCPs. The conclusion is drawn that taking the existing oriented imagery as repeated observation enhances the effective utilization of previous <b>spatial</b> <b>triangulation</b> achievement, which makes the breakthrough for repeated observation to improve accuracy by increasing the base-height ratio and redundant observation. Georeferencing tests using data from multiple sensors and platforms with the repeated observation will be carried out in the follow-up research...|$|E

The triangulation procedure requires that the position and calibration of the cameras must be accurately known. An accurate position may be found by survey. The cameras are fixed phototheodolites with electronic shutter control.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{parameterization}} {{as a tool}} for both constructing and smoothing <b>spatial</b> <b>triangulations.</b> Most of the parameterization methods we study are based on convex combination maps, which have the property that the image of each interior vertex is a convex combination of its neighbours. When mapping an existing triangulation, this latter property ensures that whenever the image of the map is convex, the map is one-to-one, and thus a homeomorphism. At the same time, convex combination maps are very general because every one-to-one piecewise linear map is a convex combination map. Suitable convex combination maps for parameterization arise naturally as discretizations of harmonic maps, but can also be constructed explicitly, in order to satisfy important properties such as linear precision...|$|R
40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{the relationship between}} spin networks and their dual representation by labelled triangulations of space in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions. We apply this to the recent proposal for causal evolution of spin networks. The result is labelled <b>spatial</b> <b>triangulations</b> evolving with transition amplitudes given by labelled spacetime simplices. The formalism {{is very similar to}} simplicial gravity, however, the triangulations represent combinatorics and not an approximation to the spatial manifold. The distinction between future and past nodes which can be ordered in causal sets also exists here. Spacelike and timelike slices can be defined and the foliation is allowed to vary. We clarify the choice of the two rules in the causal spin network evolution, and the assumption of trivalent spin networks for 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions and four-valent for 3 + 1. As a direct application, the problem of the exponential growth of the causal model is remedied. The result is a clear and more rigid graphical understanding of evolution of combinatorial spin networks, on which further work can be based. Comment: Latex, 20 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this second}} part of our series on least-squares Galerkin methods for {{parabolic}} initial-boundary value problems we study the full discretization in time and space. These methods {{are based on the}} minimization of a least-squares functional for an equivalent rst-order system over space and time with respect to suitable discrete spaces. Based on the analysis of the semidiscretization in time carried out in the rst part, we construct a posteriori error estimators for the approximation error components associated with time and space. For the space discretization error we use a hierarchical basis estimator with respect to the functional minimization problem. We prove a strengthened Cauchy-Schwarz inequality between coarse and hierarchical surplus space and a bound on the condition number of the auxiliary problem, both uniform in the mesh-size h and the time-step implying eciency and reliability of the error estimator. This allows for an adaptive strategy for both the time-step size and the <b>spatial</b> <b>triangulation</b> keeping a proper balance between these two components. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the resulting adaptive schemes in time and space...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a practical {{application of the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>triangulation</b> procedure in a digital photogrammetric system with images acquired by a non-metric camera. Image orientation and stereoscopic restitution were performed by means the Geosoft-GDS digital system with an aerial triangulation module which implements the DLT analytical approach necessary for non-metric images. For this purpose, a slide series of the Udine Castle front were taken by an Olympus reflex camera with an equivalent focal length of 90 mm and a shot distance of 65 m. 51 points on the building (not identified in advance) have been topographically surveyed with an sqm of about 3 mm, later divided into three groups (A, B and C) of 17 points each, so that 3 alternate independent samples of control points are made. Three experiments were conducted by computing the simultaneous image orientation starting from every single group and from other 10 tie points. Therefore all 51 points were photogram¬metrically restituted and the obtained coordinates were compared to those obtained topographically, assumed as reference values. The obtained results show an interesting system accuracy, either in absolute sense (planimetric sqm of about 1 cm) or in relative one (by {{taking into account the}} range camera-object) in excellent agreement with the test theoretical accuracy...|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} the five {{possible}} strategies, {{in the present case}} study they were considered in the following way {{in order to make the}} results valid: (1) Prolonged involvement: the researcher is familiar with the environment being studied (in this case study, the researchers and the company had already been collaborating on previous projects). (2) Triangulation: the application of several methods in the study of a single object. In this case study, four types were considered: <b>Spatial</b> <b>triangulation</b> of data (three sources of data were considered: observation, interviews and documentation); Personal triangulation of data (all the members of the company Social CRM project team were interviewed in order to obtain information from each of them); Investigator triangulation (the interviews were conducted by a researcher and reviewed by another researcher); and Theoretical triangulation (the different points of view of the members of the Social CRM project team were taken into account). (3) Member checking: obtaining feedback from the people who are interviewed (in the case study, after each interview, a report containing the relevant information from the interview was checked by each interviewee). (4) Negative case analysis: attempting to find another explanation that differs from the one initially assumed for the observed phenomenon (here, the two researchers were working separately (investigator triangulation)). (5) Audit trail: keeping a record of all the documentation of the project so as to be available in the future.|$|E

The first objective {{of this paper is to}} test functionalities of an application, which exploits mobile devices’ capabilities to get data associated with their <b>spatial</b> location. A <b>triangulation</b> of a set of points provides a mechanism through which it is possible to produce an accurate representation of <b>spatial</b> data. Such <b>triangulation</b> may be used for representing surfaces by Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs), and for decomposing complex two-dimensional spatial objects into simpler geometries. The second objective of this paper is to promote the use of oriented matroids for finding alternative solutions to spatial data processing and analysis tasks. This study focused on the particular case of the calculation of triangulations based on oriented matroids.

40|$|We {{describe}} a general algorithm to produce compatible 3 D <b>triangulations</b> from <b>spatial</b> decompositions. Such <b>triangulations</b> match edges and faces across spatial cell boundaries, solving several problems in graphics and visualization including the crack problem found in adaptive isosurface generation, triangulation of arbitrary grids (including unstructured grids), clipping, and the interval tetrahedrization problem. The algorithm produces compatible triangulations on a cell-by-cell basis, using a modified Delaunay triangulation {{with a simple}} point ordering rule to resolve degenerate cases and produce unique triangulations across cell boundaries. The algorithm is naturally parallel since it requires no neighborhood cell information, only a unique, global point numbering. We show application of this algorithm to adaptive contour generation; tetrahedrization of unstructured meshes; clipping and interval volume mesh generation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{probabilistic}} framework for {{the reduction in the}} uncertainty of a moving robot pose during exploration by using a second robot to assist. A Monte Carlo Simulation technique (specifically, a Particle Filter) is employed in order to model and reduce the accumulated odometric error. Furthermore, we study the requirements to obtain an accurate yet timely pose estimate. A team of two robots is employed to explore an indoor environment in this paper, although several aspects of the approach have been extended to larger groups. The concept behind our exploration strategy has been presented previously and is based on having one robot carry a sensor that acts as a "robot tracker" to estimate the position of the other robot. By suitable use of the tracker as an appropriate motion-control mechanism we can sweep areas of free space between the stationary and the moving robot and generate an accurate graph-based description of the environment. This graph is used to guide the exploration process. Complete exploration without any overlaps is guaranteed {{as a result of the}} guidance provided by the dual graph of the <b>spatial</b> decomposition (<b>triangulation)</b> of the environment.

The optimal route computed will be updated dynamically, depending on {{the location of the}} vehicle and the location of the Surface to Air Missile (SAM) sites. The problem was solved using heuristic algorithms instead of the conventional Dijkstra's & Bellman Ford algorithms, which are computationally expensive. Data fusion techniques such as <b>spatial</b> correlation and <b>triangulation</b> algorithms are presented in detail. Such techniques are important for situational awareness in a real time combat environment.

40|$|Multi-cultural {{demands of}} public {{lands in the}} United States {{continue}} to challenge federal land managers to address social and cultural concerns in their planning efforts. Specifically, these individuals lack adequate knowledge of cultural concerns {{as well as a}} consistent strategy for acquiring that knowledge for use in decision-making. Current federal approaches to cultural concerns include public participation, conservation partnerships, government-to-government consultations with American Indian tribes, cultural resource inventories, and landscape analysis. Since cultural knowledge arises from human-nature relationships and shared perceptions of natural environments, and landscapes are the ultimate expression of such knowledge, an exploratory methodology was developed for a different approach to understanding cultural concerns through landscape perceptions. Using cultural landscape theories and applications from the natural and social sciences, this study examined the landscape perceptions of four groups concerned with management planning of the Baboquivari Wilderness Area in southern Arizona: the Bureau of Land Management, landowners of the Altar Valley, recreationists, and members of the Tohono O'odham Nation. The methodology is based on a human nature relationships rather than cultural aspects or features. It takes a holistic approach that differs from other perception studies by including: emic aspects of data collection and analysis; a <b>spatial</b> component: <b>triangulation</b> of data collection through narrative and graphic descriptions; conducting ethnographic, on-site interviews; and consensus analysis and small-sample theory. The results include: verification of four cultural groups; two levels of consensus [...] -in the population of concern, and in each group [...] -that overlap in some aspects of landscape perception; descriptions of four cultural landscapes that illustrate similarities and differences among the groups, and include patterns and representations of spatial relationships; an effective methodology for revealing cultural concerns that are not identified through public forums, and with potential for application by agencies at the field office level...|$|R
