Geographic information systems (GIS) are one technology enabling the visualization of cancer risk patterns associated with incidence, mortality, and accessibility to care. Methods U. <b>S.</b> Comprehensive <b>Cancer</b> Control (CCC) program directors were interviewed from 49 of 50 states to assess use and function of GIS tools for mapping data related to cancer control policies and practices. Interviews were coded to obtain frequencies of response associated with content domains mapped using GIS tools and the perceived relative advantages. Results Significant relationships were found between the mapping of behavioral risk factors, health care services, transportation access, and policy advantages identified by program managers. The mapping of cancer incidence, mortality, and staging, transportation access, and multiple layers of content were found to have significant associations with perceived research advantages.

40|$|International audienceThe {{diagnosis}} of smoking-related {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is often made too late. Could {{the study of}} breathing pattern during exercise testing help in earlier detection. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied 34 asymptomatic <b>smokers</b> (<b>S)</b> compared to 55 nonsmoking controls (NS). The subjects, divided into 3 age groups (30 - 60 yr), were comparable in terms of anthropometric and spirometric characteristics. The smokers from 30 - 50 yr had a lower VO 2 max than the controls (p less than 0. 01) whereas the older smokers (50 - 60 yr) had a VO 2 max comparable to that of the controls. The study of breathing pattern indicated rapid, shallow breathing by all smokers. Thus exercise testing, and the abnormalities observed in breathing pattern, would seem to help in early detection of COPD in asymptomatic smokers...|$|R
40|$|A {{powerful}} way {{to discover}} key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis {{is to identify}} genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3, 131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot {{be explained by the}} presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL 2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-κΒ pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL 1 and BCL 2 L 1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types. available in PMC 2010 August 18.

40|$|Postulating that serotonin, {{secreted}} from smoking-activated platelets, {{could be}} involved in smoking-induced vascular modifications, we studied 115 men distributed in <b>smokers</b> (<b>S),</b> former <b>smokers</b> (FS) and never smokers (NS). The platelet serotonin content was similar in S and NS but lower in FS. This was unexpected because the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, which catabolizes serotonin, was inhibited during smoking. However, the amount of platelet MAO was higher in S and FS than in NS. The persistent elevated MAO amount in FS prompted us to study the methylation of its gene promoter in an additional series of patients: it was markedly lower for S and FS vs. NS due to cigarette smoke-induced increase of nucleic acid demethylase activity. This smoking-induced demethylation of the MAO gene promoter, resulting in high MAO amount persisting long after quitting smoking, has cardiovascular consequences and could impact fields such as behavior, mental health, and cancer...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{that the}} various common types of cancer are largely avoidable {{diseases}} is reviewed. Life-style and other environmental factors are divided into a dozen categories, and for each category the evidence relating those particular factors to cancer onset rates is summarized. Where possible, an estimate is made {{of the percentage of}} current U. <b>S.</b> <b>cancer</b> mortality that might have been caused or avoided by that category of factors. These estimates are based chiefly on evidence from epidemiology, as the available evidence from animal and other laboratory studies cannot provide reliable human risk assessments. By far the largest reliably known percentage is the 30 % of current U. <b>S.</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths that are due to tobacco, although it is possible that some nutritional factor(s) may eventually be found to be of comparable importance. The percentage of U. <b>S.</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths that are due to tobacco is still increasing, and must be expected to continue to increase for some years yet due to the delayed effects of the adoption of cigarettes in earlier decades. Trends in mortality and in onset rates for many separate types of cancer are studied in detail in appendixes to this paper. Biases in the available data on registration of new cases produce apparent trends in cancer incidence which are spurious. Biases also produce spurious trends in cancer incidence which are spurious. Biases also produce spurious trends in cancer death certification rates, especially among old people. In (and before) middle age, where the biases are smaller, there appear to be a few real increases and a few real decreases in mortality from some particular types of cancer, but {{there is no evidence of}} any generalized increase other than that due to tobacco. Moderate increases or decreases due to some new agent(s) or habit(s) might of course be overlooked in such large-scale analyses. But, such analyses do suggest that, apart from cancer of the respiratory tract, the types of cancer that are currently common are not peculiarly modern diseases and are likely to depend chiefly on some long-established factor(s). (A prospective study utilizing both questionnaires and stored blood and other biological materials might help elucidate these factors.) The proportion of current U. <b>S.</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths attributed to occupational factors is provisionally estimated as 4 % (lung cancer being the major contributor to this). This is far smaller than has recently been suggested by various U. S. Government agencies.

40|$|Intracellular {{delivery}} of materials {{is a challenge}} in research and therapeutic applications. Physical methods of plasma membrane disruption have recently emerged as an approach to facilitate the {{delivery of}} a variety of macromolecules to a range of cell types. We use the microfluidic CellSqueeze delivery platform to examine the kinetics of plasma membrane recovery after disruption and its dependence on the calcium content of the surrounding buffer (recovery time ~ 5 min without calcium vs. ~ 30 s with calcium). Moreover, we illustrate that manipulation of the membrane repair kinetics can yield up to 5 × improvement in delivery efficiency without significantly impacting cell viability. Membrane repair characteristics initially observed in HeLa cells are shown to translate to primary naïve murine T cells. Subsequent manipulation of membrane repair kinetics also enables the delivery of larger materials, such as antibodies, to these difficult to manipulate cells. This work provides insight into the membrane repair process in response to mechanical delivery and could potentially enable the development of improved delivery methods.

METHODS. <b>Cancer</b> incidence was obtained from 90 % of the Hispanic/Latino and 82 % of the U. <b>S.</b> populations. <b>Cancer</b> deaths were obtained for the entire U. <b>S.</b> population. <b>Cancer</b> screening, risk factor, incidence, and mortality data were compiled for Latino and non-Latino adults and children (incidence only). Long-term (1975 – 2003) and fixed-interval (1995 – 2003) trends and comparative analyses by disease stage, urbanicity, and area poverty were evaluated. RESULTS. The long-term trend in overall cancer death rates, declining since the early 1990 s, continued through 2003 for all races and both sexes combined. However, female lung cancer incidence rates increased from 1975 to 2003, decelerating since 1991 and breast cancer incidence rates stabilized from 2001 to 2003. Latinos had lower incidence rates in 1999 – 2003 for most cancers, but higher rates for stomach, liver, cervix, and myeloma (females) than did non-Latino white populations. Latino children have higher incidence of leukemia, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and germ-cell tumors than do non-Latino white children. For several common cancers, Latinos were less likely than non-Latinos to be diagnosed at localized stages. CONCLUSIONS. The lower cancer rates observed in Latino immigrants could be sustained by maintenance of healthy behaviors. Some infection-related cancers in Latinos could be controlled by evidence-based interventions. Affordable, culturally sensitive, linguistically appropriate, and timely access to cancer information, prevention, screening, and treatment are important in Latino outreach and community networks...|$|R

40|$|Intracellular {{delivery}} of macromolecules {{is a challenge}} in research and therapeutic applications. Existing vector-based and physical methods have limitations, including their reliance on exogenous materials or electrical fields, {{which can lead to}} toxicity or off-target effects. We describe a microfluidic approach to delivery in which cells are mechanically deformed as they pass through a constriction 30 – 80 % smaller than the cell diameter. The resulting controlled application of compression and shear forces results in the formation of transient holes that enable the diffusion of material from the surrounding buffer into the cytosol. The method has demonstrated the ability to deliver a range of material, such as carbon nanotubes, proteins, and siRNA, to 11 cell types, including embryonic stem cells and immune cells. When used for the {{delivery of}} transcription factors, the microfluidic devices produced a 10 -fold improvement in colony formation relative to electroporation and cell-penetrating peptides. Indeed, its ability to deliver structurally diverse materials and its applicability to difficult-to-transfect primary cells indicate that this method could potentially enable many research and clinical applications.

The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the quality of RT on Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cancer</b> Group/Pediatric Oncology Group 9961 and analyze associations of RT deviations with outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Major volume deviations were assessed based on the distance from specified anatomical region to field edge. We investigated associations of RT deviations with progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and explored associations with demographics and clinical variables. RESULTS: Of the 308 patients who were evaluable for volume deviations, 101 patients (33...|$|R
