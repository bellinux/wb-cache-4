40|$|A PWM {{converter}} is {{the prime}} component in many power electronic applications such as <b>static</b> <b>UPS,</b> electric motor drives, power quality conditioners and renewable-energy-based power generation systems. While {{there are a number}} of computer simulation tools available today for studying power electronic systems, the value added by the experience of building a power converter and controlling it to function as desired is unparalleled. A student, in the process, not only understands power electronic concepts better, but also gains insights into other essential engineering aspects of auxiliary subsystems such as start-up, sensing, protection, circuit layout design, mechanical arrangement and system integration. Higher levels of protection features are critical for the converters used in a laboratory environment, as advanced protection schemes could prevent unanticipated failures occurring during the course of research. This paper presents a laboratory-built General-Purpose IGBT Stack (GPIS), which facilitates students to practically realize different power converter topologies. Essential subsystems for a complete power converter system is presented covering details of semiconductor device driving, sensing circuit, protection mechanism, system start-up, relaying and critical PCB layout design, followed by a brief comparison to commercially available IGBT stacks. The results show the high performance that can be obtained by the GPIS converter...|$|E

40|$|Embedded {{germanium}} nanocrystals (NCs) in a silica host matrix are theoretically {{analyzed to}} identify their third-order bound-state nonlinearities. A rigorous atomistic pseudopotential approach is used for determining the electronic structure and the nonlinear optical susceptibilities. This study characterizing the two-photon absorption, nonlinear refractive index, and optical switching parameters reveals the full wavelength dependence from <b>static</b> <b>up</b> to the ultraviolet spectrum and the size dependence up to a diameter of 3. 5 nm. Similar to Si NCs, the intensity-dependent refractive index increases with decreasing NC diameter. On the other hand, Ge NCs possess about {{an order of magnitude}} smaller nonlinear susceptibility compared to Si NCs of the same size. It is observed that the two-photon absorption threshold extends beyond the half band-gap value. This enables nonlinear refractive index tunability over a much wider wavelength range free from two-photon absorption. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{case that}} no {{reliable}} channel knowledge is available, {{the use of}} diversity-exploiting transmission schemes is the preferred strategy for provision of good performance[8]. OFDMA schemes applying this strategy {{are referred to as}} non-adaptive OFDMA. Adaptive OFDMA schemes require accurate channel knowledge at the transmitter and a considerable amount of signaling which limits the range of applications to scenarios with rather slowly changing channels, e.g., slowly moving MSs. In these scenarios, however, adaptive access scheme outperform non-adaptive access schemes[9]. Nevertheless, non-adaptive OFDMA schemes are more suitable in scenarios with fast changing channels due to the use of diversity combining techniques which do not need transmitter sided channel knowledge resulting in marginal overhead. As in a realistic scenario, both situations are present, i.e., <b>static</b> <b>up</b> to semi-static users and fast moving users exist, it is beneficial to combine both multiple access schemes in a hybrid OFDMA scheme to serve all users with respect to the given conditions.|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Cerebral Palsy (CP) {{children}} are the most clients referred to occupational therapy settings. Hand function is important in Activities of Daily living. There is a hand dysfunction in most cerebral palsy children. Orthosis and splints are commonly used to improve the position, range of motion, quality of movement and function of a person's arm or hand. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of <b>static</b> cock <b>up</b> c-bar splint on strength,spasticity, range of motion, and dominant hand function in spastic diplegic children with 8 to 12 years old.   Materials and Methods: This interventional study is in a before-after design. Thirteen spastic diplegic cerebral palsy children with 8 to 12 years old were selected through students who studied in physical disabled schools in Tehran city and had the inclusion criteria. Patients used a <b>static</b> cock <b>up</b> c-bar splint (wrist in 10 degrees of extension and thumb in palmar abduction and opposition) for two months, 2 hours daily and 4 - 6 hours at night. In this study the Jebsen Taylor test was used to evaluate hand function, the Modified Ashworth Scale was used to assess spasticity of thumb, wrist and elbow, ROM of thumb, wrist and elbow were tested with goniometer and power grip was evaluated with dynamometer.     Results : Results showed a significant improvement in hand function (p< 0. 001), in wrist`s spasticity (p< 0. 001), elbow`s spasticity(p< 0. 008), palmar abduction of thumb spasticity (p< 0. 002), wrist`s ROM (p< 0. 001), Palmar abduction of thumb ROM(p< 0. 001) and power grip(p< 0. 001). The data did not show significant improvement on elbow`s joint ROM.   Conclusion: Information from present research shows that using <b>static</b> cock <b>up</b> c-bar splint for 2 months, 2 hours a day and 4 to 6 hours nightly, can be an effective method to improve power grip, hand function, thumb, wrist and elbow spasticity and range of motion of thumb and wrist of spastic diplegic CP children...|$|R

The compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal structure of La 3 Co 2 Sn 7 type with two Wyckoff {{sites for the}} U atoms. U 3 Fe 2 Ge 7 displays a ferromagnetic order below TC = 62 K. Magnetization measurements in <b>static</b> (<b>up</b> to 14 T) and pulsed (up to 60 T) magnetic fields revealed a strong two-ion uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The easy magnetization direction is along the c axis and the spontaneous magnetic moment is 3. 3 μB per formula unit at 2 K. The moment per Fe atom is 0. 2 μB, as follows from Mossbauer spectroscopy. The magnetic moments are oriented perpendicular to the shortest inter-uranium distances that occur within the zigzag chains in the ab plane, contrary to other U-based isostructural compounds. The magnetization along the a axis reveals a first-order magnetization process that allows for a quantitative description of the magnetic anisotropy {{in spite of its}} enormous energetic strength.
