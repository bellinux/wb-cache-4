5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E

In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other.|$|E

[...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E
500|$|Director Steven Vidler {{said the}} film was not about a rape, rather it was [...] "about the culture that allowed it to happen." [...] Vidler defended the choice to give the rape victim a minor role, stating, [...] "It was {{important}} to show that this {{could have happened to}} anyone. We didn't want to give away too much about the victim <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> maintain that suspense." [...] Producer David Elfick said that {{the film was}} about contemporary Australia; about [...] "kids who have all their life to enjoy, then a deadly mixture of drugs, alcohol, sexual tension, and desire add up to a tragedy." ...|$|E

As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E

500|$|While Hillenburg, Drymon and Hill {{were writing}} the pilot, Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create its personality. Drymon said, [...] "Tom came in a few times <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> pitch him what we were working to help him find the right voice. Tom had already worked on lots of other animated shows, and Steve wanted to find an original sounding voice." [...] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a very minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{director}} and choreographer Ortega {{stated that the}} rehearsal footage and concept of making a film to document {{the preparation of the}} concerts had come about as [...] "an accident". Ortega stated the film was pieced together from [...] "private footage", shot by documentarians Sandrine Orabona and Tim Patterson of Jackson, and that before Jackson's death, was never intended to be released to the public, or even in general. [...] "The recordings were made <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use them, then the tapes were destined for Michael 's private library. They have a real unguarded honesty to them." [...] Ortega stated that he had gotten the idea to use the rehearsal footage from Jackson's fans after his death: [...] "At first I got so many messages from fans around the world asking to see the shows, asking to see the footage and eventually I realized the journey wasn't over and we had to do this", and Ortega also stated that the film was made only for the Jackson fans: [...] " [...] is for the fans and the film will show the development and intentions of the show, and the concert as it moved closer to London." ...|$|E

500|$|Tom Dowd {{produced}} At Fillmore East; he {{had previously}} worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. [...] "It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff {{who took care of}} business," [...] recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, [...] "which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics." [...] Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph [...] "Juicy" [...] Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding [...] "unofficial" [...] band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "I was just hoping we could isolate them, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable," [...] said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.|$|E
500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes when you read the lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E
500|$|Gibbons said he {{deliberately}} {{constructed the}} visual look of Watchmen {{so that each}} page would be identifiable {{as part of that}} particular series and [...] "not some other comic book". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with [...] "a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin" [...] which he hoped [...] "would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former surveyor for [...] "including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> choreograph every little thing". Gibbons described the series as [...] "a comic about comics". Gibbons felt that [...] "Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [...] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications." [...] The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, [...] "perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because {{he did not have to}} rely primarily on reference books.|$|E

500|$|The writers {{ensured that}} {{although}} they were changing the storyline circumstances, the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities. According to series writer Matt Berry, the time jump allowed the writers {{to work with the}} characters [...] "without most of the baggage they’d accumulated in the earlier years, and put them into starting places <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> move them forward and build in new story arcs." [...] For this reason, the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot, in which, according to Daily, they [...] "could give the women a new drive." [...] Daily identified the Susan character as having undergone the greatest change, stating that she has given up on looking for a [...] "fairy-tale romance" [...] and is emotionally distant in her new relationship. He also stated that the character of Gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change in terms of her circumstances, as she continues to deal with her husband's blindness and their financial problems. Actress Eva Longoria had to gain weight and wear additional body padding for her character's new storyline. Dana Delany stated that her character, Katherine, who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season, is more relaxed following the time jump. However, Delany clarified that while Katherine is now friends with the other characters, she and Bree would become frenemies {{as a result of their}} business partnership. Nicollette Sheridan, commented that Edie, who played an integral role in the season's mystery story arch, is [...] "a lot more conscientious about things , without losing her comedic edge." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{writing for}} the album came under way, Carey had a falling out with Ben Margulies, the man whom Carey had written seven of the eleven songs on Carey's debut with. Together, the duo had written and {{produced}} seven songs for Carey's demo tape which she handed to Tommy Mottola. Their parting of ways was due to a contract Carey had signed prior to her signing with Columbia. Carey had agreed to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well, something she never thought twice about while writing songs in his father's basement. However, {{when the time came}} to write music for Emotions, Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album. Following the discussion, Margulies filed a lawsuit against Sony, claiming that under contract, he would be entitled to work with Carey, as well as reap extra benefits. After an almost one year lawsuit, the judge settled that Margulies was to earn ten percent of Carey's direct earnings from her record sales, not including an income from any other ventures. While settled, their relationship remained ruined, damaged by what Carey considered treachery. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey said the following regarding the contract: [...] "I signed blindly. Later, I tried to make it right <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> continue...but he wouldn't accept it." [...] After the settlement, Margulies spoke of his feelings on the matter, claiming he would hope to one day write again with Carey, placing most of the blame on the record label and concluding [...] "Hopefully one day, art will prevail over business." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E
