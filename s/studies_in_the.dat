40|$|Background: Mothers whose {{children}} <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands {{tend to be}} concerned about welfare of her child, increased economic needs due to the remote location and a long separation causing anxiety simptoms. Objectives: Analyzing the differences anxiety level between mothers {{whose children}} <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands with mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District Kumai West Kotawaringin Central Kalimantan Province. Methods: Reseach design is analytical observational with cross-sectional approach and use consecutive sampling. There are 96 respondents consist 48 mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands and 48 mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island. The research used L-MMPI questionnaire to determine the number of lies and TMAS questionnaire to measure the level of anxiety. The avaible data were analyzed using t-test statistical test. Result: After analysis using t-test obtained value of p= 0, 000. There were statistically significant differences of anxiety level between mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands with mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District Kumai West Kotawaringin Central Kalimantan Province. Conclusion: Mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer islands have higher anxiety level than mothers whose children <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} factors which can influence Chinese students’ intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. Variables to be investigated include attitudes, subjective norms, internal control, external control, and intention. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> effects of past experience were also examined. This dissertation employed questionnaire survey to collect primary data in both Chinese campus and UK campus of Nottingham University. A total of 100 students participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survey. Among them, 50 students have past experience of <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, and another 50 have no past experience of <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. The findings showed that Chinese students’ attitudes towards <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree, their subjective norms, and their internal control are direct predictors of Chinese students’ intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. External control cannot predict intention directly, but it has a direct relationship with internal control, thus external control has an indirect relationship with intention. For Chinese students who have past experience, their attitude is the strongest predictor of their intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. And for Chinese students who have no past experience, subjective norm is the strongest predictor of their intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. In addition, Chinese students with past experience tend to hold more positive beliefs about <b>studying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for a master’s degree. Also, they have stronger intention to <b>study</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK...|$|R

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E
5|$|Breed {{differences}} {{are expected to}} have reduced since the USMARC <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and 1990s because of the wide-scale introduction and use of performance recording and genetic improvement programmes. The reduction in yield reported for Limousins is possibly a result of the loss of French Limousin content and of F94L myostatin mutations from the US purebred population, which would be an expected result of the purebred grading up process practiced there. Earlier USMARC studies are reported to have evaluated high content pure French Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
