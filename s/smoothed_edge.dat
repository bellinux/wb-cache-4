40|$|The {{non-invasive}} {{assessment of}} cardiovascular changes with space-flight often involves {{the measurement of}} blood vessel dimension using ultrasound imaging. However, many commonly used mea-surement techniques are often manually intensive and dependent on the individual making the measurements. We propose a new automated method for measuring the vessel dimensions which in-volves creating a <b>smoothed</b> <b>edge</b> map of the image and using ac-tive contours to converge to {{the upper and lower}} vessel bound-aries. Preliminary results show that we are able to use this method to detect vessels walls for vascular measurements from ultrasound images. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel method to extract edge lines from point clouds of these eroded, rough fractured fragments. Firstly, a {{principal component analysis}} based method is used to extract feature points, followed by clustering of these feature points. Secondly, a local feature lines fragment is constructed for each cluster and afterwards a smooth and noise pruning process for each local feature lines fragment. Thirdly, these separated local feature lines fragments are connected and bridged in order to eliminate the gaps caused by the eroded regions and construct completed global feature lines. Fourthly, a noise pruning process is performed. The output of this method is completed, <b>smoothed</b> <b>edge</b> feature lines. We illustrate the performance of our method {{on a number of}} real-world examples...|$|E
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} a steerable pyramid based on {{a particular set of}} complex wavelets named circular harmonic wavelets (CHW). The proposed CHWs set constitutes a generalization of the <b>smoothed</b> <b>edge</b> wavelets introduced by Mallat, consisting of extending the local differential representation of a signal image from the first order to a generic n-th order. The key feature of the proposed representation is the use of complex operators leading to an expansion in series of polar separable complex functions, which are shown to possess the space-scale representability of the wavelets. The resulting tool is highly redundant, and for this reason is called hypercomplete circular harmonic pyramid (HCHP), but presents some interesting aspects in terms of flexibility, being suited for many image processing applications. In the present contribution the main theoretical aspects of the HCHPs are discussed along with some introductory applications.

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons of {{weakness}} of existing R/C structures with respect to seismic actions is often to be ascribed to the low strength and ductility of columns. As known, ductility improves considerably if concrete is laterally confined. Such confinement is traditionally realised by angles and brackets, and implies increase of dimension and difficulties of implementation. Their effectiveness is also conditioned by a correct implementation, to obtain a perfect contact of the angles with the existing concrete as well as a pre-strain through preheating of the cross stiffening brackets. The CAM system (Active Confinement of Manufacts) represents an effective alternative solution. It is implemented by using angles with <b>smoothed</b> <b>edge</b> and high strength steel ribbons 0. 8 - 1. 0 mm thick, which are pre-tensioned to give a beneficial pre-compression state in concrete and to be immediately effective when increasing loads. Its total thickness of being of the order of 6 - 8 mm, the confining device can be easily contained within the normal plaster. The effectiveness of the CAM system for the confinement of R/C concrete columns has been verified through several experimental compression tests on 34 squared section columns with 25 cm side, by evaluating the improvement of strength and ductility. In this paper the CAM strengthening system is presented, along with the main results of the experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|Enhancements are {{described}} for {{an approach that}} unifies edge preserving smoothing with segmentation of time sequences of volumetric images, based on differential edge detection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Potential applications of these 4 -D methods include segmentation of respiratory gated positron emission tomography (PET) transmission images to improve accuracy of attenuation correction for imaging heart and lung lesions, and segmentation of dynamic cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images to facilitate unbiased estimation of time-activity curves and kinetic parameters for left ventricular volumes of interest. Improved segmentation of lung surfaces in simulated respiratory gated cardiac PET transmission images is achieved with a 4 -D edge detection operator composed of edge preserving 1 -D operators applied in various spatial and temporal directions. Smoothing along the axis of a 1 -D operator is driven by structure separation seen in the scale-space fingerprint, rather than by image contrast. Spurious noise structures are reduced with use of small-scale isotropic smoothing in directions transverse to the 1 -D operator axis. Analytic expressions are obtained for directional derivatives of the <b>smoothed,</b> <b>edge</b> preserved image, and the expressions are used to compose a 4 -D operator that detects edges as zero-crossings in the second derivative {{in the direction of}} the image intensity gradient. Additional improvement in segmentation is anticipated with use of multiscale transversely isotropic smoothing and a novel interpolation method that improves the behavior of the directional derivatives. The interpolation method is demonstrated on a simulated 1 -D edge and incorporation of the method into the 4 -D algorithm is described...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{compare the}} quality of {{duodenal}} and ileal samples obtained with different biopsy forceps. MethodsFifteen dogs were included in a prospective ex vivo study. After euthanasia, the duodenum and the ileum were sampled with four different forceps and evaluated according to a standardised scoring system. The biopsy forceps evaluated had alligator jaws or cups with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> {{with or without a}} needle. ResultsThe global quality of the biopsies was better in the ileum that in the duodenum regardless of the biopsy forceps. Biopsy forceps with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> including a needle resulted in fewer artefacts than biopsy forceps with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> but no needle in both sites and those with alligator jaws without a needle provided deeper biopsies than those with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> without a needle only in the duodenum. There was no effect of the biopsy forceps type {{on the size of the}} biopsies. Clinical SignificanceOur findings may aid in choosing the appropriate type of forceps for intestinal biopsy...|$|R

40|$|In reverse engineering, the {{reconstruction}} of a surface model from a point cloud requires the extraction of closed feature lines at {{the borders of the}} different surface patches. In this paper we propose a new algorithm to extract such closed polygonal feature lines, representing sharp or <b>smooth</b> <b>edges,</b> from a point cloud. Based on the variation of the normal vectors and a graph approach we extract the sharp edges, which are used to divide the point cloud in <b>smooth</b> regions. <b>Smooth</b> <b>edges,</b> such as fillets, are extracted for each smooth region separately using a novel approach for 1 D-histogram thresholding: we use the curvature histogram in a multi-resolution manner in order to split a point set in different regions of similar curvature (patches). The polygonal <b>smooth</b> <b>edges</b> at the borders between these different patches are extracted by point clustering and processing a graph of the point clusters. status: publishe...|$|R
