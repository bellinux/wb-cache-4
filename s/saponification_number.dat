There were two extraction processes that were investigated, Soxhlet-assisted Extraction (SE) and Ultrasonic-assisted Extraction (UE) and both used ethanol solvent. A combination of several criteria was selected to find the characteristics of each extraction. In the SE, a variety of ethanol concentration and time were used; whereas in the UE, a variety of ethanol volume, time and temperature were applied. The given frequency for all UE treatments was 40 kHz. The quality of algae oil proceeded by SE was shown by the level of FFA (Free Fatty Acid) and <b>saponification</b> <b>number.</b> In the SE study, the best combination was gained when the ethanol concentration was 70 % and the given time was 200 min in which the FFA level was 9. 4 % and the <b>saponification</b> <b>number</b> was 286. 8.

Animals that do not gain weight at a rate close to that of the normal pregnant rat do not develop the reaction.

The Gong method appeared {{to be as good as}} the method including saponification, provided that the amount of soil to be extracted was lowered with respect to the original protocol when analysing soils with an organic matter content > 5 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Keruing oils can be {{obtained}} through separating the oil from keruing gum by distillation technique, or distilling keruing wood. In accordance with the lattest method, {{the objective of this}} research is to study the physico-chemical properties of keruing oils which were obtained by steam distillation of a mixture of several keruing wood species. This wood was randomly taken three times from the wastes of wood processing industry in East Kalimantan. Each wood wastes taken was steam distilled and the yielded oils were analysed their physico-chemical properties. The difference between means value of the properties of the oils was tested by using LSD according td SAS procedure. Results revealed that wood wastes gave a highly significant effect on refractive index, optical rotation, acid and ester number of keruing oils. It also gave a significant effect on <b>saponification</b> <b>number.</b> Further analysis showed that the keruing oil with clear colour compared to both keruing oil with clear yellow and pale yellow colour was a significant difference in acid and ester number. Moreover, the keruing oil with pale yellow colour had ll significant difference in <b>saponification</b> <b>number</b> compared the others. Among these oils, the refractive index and optical rotation properties were a significant difference one to the others. Based these results, if the keruing wood wastes will be used as raw materials for keruing oil production, it is better that the keruing wood containing much oil or gum should be separated from the others before further processing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to explore the effect of supplementary feeding, Azolla piñata and probiotics, on the quality and profile of fatty acids in patin fish oil extracts, protein and amino acids content. In {{this research}}, patin fish were divided into three different feeding treatments: pellets only (P 1) as a control; pellets and A. piñata (P 2); pellets and probiotics (P 3). These fishes were characterized for their growth profile, fish oil quality, protein and amino acids content. P 3 shows the best growth profile indicated with the heaviest bodyweight compare to other fish samples. Quality of fish lipids was determined by an analysis of acid value, <b>saponification</b> <b>number,</b> peroxide value, iodine number, along with an analysis of the composition of fatty acids via gas chromatography. The results show that the highest oil yield from patin fish meal extracted using dry rendering method was obtained from P 3. P 3 also shows the lowest <b>saponification</b> <b>number</b> and peroxide value. Oleic acid and palmitic acid are the major constituent of unsaturated fatty acid and saturated one, respectively, in all these fish samples. The highest crude protein content which was determined using Kjeldahl method also presented in P 3. The amount and the dominant amino acids content in the protein of P 1, P 2, and P 3, in the order, are 13 amino acids: tryptophan, 14 amino acids: asparagine, and 13 amino acids: glutamic acids...|$|E
30|$|In {{a typical}} {{preparation}} of biodiesel, waste cooking oil was filtered and centrifuged and the <b>saponification</b> <b>number,</b> acid value and molecular weight of WCO were measured as 231.9  mg KOH/g oil, 0.53  mg KOH/g oil and 727.2  g mol− 1, respectively, {{based on the}} standards methods [23]. Transesterification reaction is carried out using WCO, methanol and heterogeneous catalyst under the conditions of 8 – 1 molar ratio of methanol to WCO, a temperature of 60  °C, at a specified catalyst loading and a certain reaction time. After completion of the reaction, the desired methyl ester product was removed from glycerol phase as the upper layer in a separatory funnel.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{production}} of biodiesel using bitter almond oil (BAO) in a potassium hydroxide catalyzed transesterification reaction was investigated. The BAO was obtained from resources available in Iran and its {{physical and chemical properties}} including iodine value, acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, fatty acid composition and mean molecular weight were specified. The low acid value of BAO (0. 24 Â mgÂ KOH/g) indicated that the pretreatment of raw oil with acid was not required. The fatty acid content analysis confirmed that the contribution of unsaturated fatty acids in the BAO is high (84. 7 Â wt. %). Effect of different parameters including methanol to oil molar ratio (3 - 11 Â mol/mol), potassium hydroxide concentration (0. 1 - 1. 7 % w/w) and reaction temperature (30 - 70 Â Â°C) on {{the production of}} biodiesel were investigated. The results indicated that these parameters were important factors affecting the tranesterification reaction. The fuel properties of biodiesel including iodine value, acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, <b>saponification</b> value, cetane <b>number,</b> flash point, cloud point, pour point and distillation characteristics were measured. The properties were compared with those of petroleum diesel, EN 14214 and ASTM 6751 biodiesel standards and an acceptable agreement was observed.
