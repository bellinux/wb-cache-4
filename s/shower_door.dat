25|$|Evil businesswoman Angelica Nero {{intends to}} kill J.R. {{and his cousin}} Jack for double {{crossing}} her, but J.R. has her apprehended by the police. Unfortunately, Angelica has already had a bomb attached to Jack's car, which explodes with Jamie inside. After hearing this on the phone, J.R. runs {{out of his office}} to go to Jack's apartment. As he leaves the office, Sue Ellen arrives in the other elevator looking for him. As soon as she enters J.R.'s office, another bomb left by Angelica goes off, and the entire floor that houses Ewing Oil explodes, showering debris onto the street below. The scene then shifts to Pam in bed, the day after her marriage to Mark Graison. Pam wakes up to hear the shower running. Assuming it's Mark, she opens the <b>shower</b> <b>door,</b> only to find Bobby Ewing, alive and well. (In the Season Ten premiere, Bobby's death and all of Season Nine would be revealed as a dream that Pam was having).|$|E
500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the [...] "shower scene" [...] never once shows a knife {{puncturing}} flesh. However, a {{frame by frame}} analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all {{the doors and windows}} and would leave the bathroom and <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> open. She never realized until she first watched the film [...] "how vulnerable and defenseless one is".|$|E

50|$|Shower {{doors are}} doors used in {{bathrooms}} that help keep water inside a shower or bathtub and are alternatives to shower curtains. They {{are available in}} many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexi-glass or tempered glass. Shower doors can come in many different hardware finishes and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and shower heads. There are also shower doors that are in a neo angle design for use on shower pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the shower pan is extremely important as the <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> requires plastic lining {{along the edges of}} the door to protect against water leaking out.|$|E
50|$|The Kohler Company, {{best known}} for {{plumbing}} products, operates a plant in Union City's Industrial Park. It is now the second largest industry in the city. At the Union City plant, workers produce <b>shower</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

50|$|In August 2007 Quinnell {{was treated}} for serious {{injuries}} after slipping whilst entering a shower and falling through a glass <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> at his then home near Llanelli. He was taken to West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen with a severed right triceps and glass embedded in his right arm, hand and knee. Quinnell's godfather was Welsh rugby legend Mervyn Davies.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} script, Lizzie steps nude {{out of the}} shower upon meeting Peter. Actress Kirsten Dunst filmed the initial meeting scene nude, but before the film's release she persuaded director Richard Loncraine to edit the scene so her nudity was removed.

50|$|A glazier is {{a skilled}} {{tradesman}} responsible for cutting, installing, and removing glass (and materials used as substitutes for glass, such as some plastics). Glaziers may work with glass in various surfaces and settings, such as windows, <b>doors,</b> <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> skylights, storefronts, display cases, mirrors, facades, interior walls, ceilings, and tabletops.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of its safety and strength, {{toughened}} glass is used in a variety of demanding applications, including passenger vehicle windows, <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> architectural glass doors and tables, refrigerator trays, mobile screen protectors, as a component of bulletproof glass, for diving masks, and various types of plates and cookware.|$|R
50|$|A {{sliding door}} {{is a type}} of door which opens {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. Sliding doors can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of sliding doors such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass doors. Sliding doors are commonly used as <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{devices for}} {{containing}} water spray include a highly flexible, waterproof shower curtain, or more recently, a <b>shower</b> <b>door,</b> {{which is a}} permanently installed sliding or pivoting door made from glass or plastic. Containing water spray, leaks, and splashes within the bathtub is particularly important in bathrooms constructed with wooden under-flooring because water causes the wooden floor boards and floor joists to rot or decay over time, if left unattended.|$|E
50|$|The house {{remained}} largely unchanged from the thirteenth regular series. A separate room became the gym, {{the theme of}} the bedroom changed to a new maroon colour, with changed beds and a completely new carpet, the <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> was replaced and cameras were removed from the toilets, and new rugs were placed on the bathroom floor and the entrance to the garden. The sofas were also brand new to the Celebrity Big Brother House.|$|E
50|$|The radio {{announcer}} tells people that Casey is out and Donald Duck is {{angry about the}} game and goes into his house to take a shower. Spike the Bee locks Donald Duck in the shower room from the outside lock and plays classical music as a conductor. Donald Duck sees this and tries in vain to open the <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> as he loses his temper but he remains trapped in his shower room. The Bee then finishes conducting the music and rests.|$|E
50|$|Up-N-Away was {{the name}} of a down-sliding bath/shower door {{manufactured}} by Unitspan Architectural Systems, Inc. The bathtub <b>shower</b> <b>doors</b> had vertical tracks instead of horizontal, and closed downward rather than sideways. There were no channel tracks {{on the side of the}} bathtub; this enabled the entire side to be free when the doors were open. This design was also to make the side of the tub always clean as well as comfortable to sit on when bathing a child. The down-sliding doors were counterbalanced to be kept up and out of the way for an elegant look, but slid to lower positions for showering. Within the vertical track channels, the lower left and right edge of each sliding door attached to counterweighted ropes with nylon hanger brackets. The downward-closing bath <b>shower</b> <b>doors</b> aimed to solve the disadvantages of conventional, sideways-sliding doors to provide more convenience, relaxation and luxury. They were at first marketed on a store- or factory-to-consumer basis, with do-it-yourself installation required.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of its safety and strength, {{tempered}} glass is used in a variety of demanding applications, including passenger vehicle windows, <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> architectural glass doors and tables, refrigerator trays, as a component of bulletproof glass, for diving masks, and various types of plates and cookware. In the United States, since 1977 Federal law has required safety glass located within doors and tub and shower enclosures.|$|R
50|$|Often used {{to relax}} and unwind from a busy day. However this {{activity}} {{can also be used}} to do other actions around camp. Examples of stuff people might due during this may include raiding the tuck shop to taking off <b>shower</b> <b>doors.</b> When a camper is given too much free time it could lead to a dangerous scene at camp. This can lead to pranks and other illegal actions around camp.|$|R
50|$|One afternoon, Alice enters {{their home}} in a drunken {{incoherent}} state. She dismisses the reluctant caretaker, who leaves her alone with her children. Still drinking, Alice is confronted by her eldest daughter concerned for her mother's welfare. In return, she violently slaps Jess, who runs to her room crying. Alice enters the shower. Unable to control her balance and calling for Jess, she falls {{to the side and}} smashes through the <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> onto the bathroom floor. Fearing her mother has died, Jess contacts Michael who immediately flies home to be by his wife's side.|$|E
5000|$|Topsy {{proves to}} be clumsy, running into a chair and getting his head stuck between a couch and a table, but on both {{occasions}} Jerry helps him to his feet. Topsy then slips on the rug and crashes through the <b>shower</b> <b>door</b> as Tom runs off to search for him. Topsy then shields Jerry from Tom and goes off to teach Topsy that cat and mice like them should be friends, but Tom interrupts. Jerry holds Tom off with his pointer, but Tom resists Topsy's advances and sends him off to catch Jerry.|$|E
50|$|Scene 7. Dino {{complains}} to Breedley {{about how}} his irresistible charm has gotten him into trouble. Breedley drags his friend, who is completely drunk, into the shower to sober him up. Outside the shower, Muffin sings an aria about how she first met Dino. Rita enters and shows her affection for Muffin in a most inappropriate way. Muffin runs off. We see, through the <b>shower</b> <b>door,</b> Breedley and Dino naked in the shower, Breedley repeatedly trying to get Dino to stand up, and Dino falling down each time. Breedley comes out in a wet towel as Muffin arrives. She goes into the shower; she and Dino kiss.|$|E
50|$|In the '70s, David and Steven Sussman—Isadore's grandchildren—joined the {{business}} and brought it a step further. They developed thermally broken windows and opened up markets in sloped glazing applications such as skylights and greenhouses. Besides bending architectural systems, they were bending handrails, lighting fixtures, signs, <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> furniture {{and a host of}} other products for numerous industries. In the 1990s, the fourth generation of Robin, Jake, Jon and Josh came into the family business. The thermal window lines were updated to the advanced thermal strip technology and new lines of historical replication windows and equal sitelines with concealed ventilators windows were introduced.|$|R
50|$|Whole mirrors (not mosaics) {{cover the}} {{surfaces}} of furniture such as dressers and side tables, and are used to cover entire walls and sometimes ceilings. Animal prints (zebra, cheetah, snakeskin, etc.) as well as complex floral designs in both black-and-white and shades of single colors are used as rugs, tablecloths, and seat cushions. Imitation bamboo stalks are used as trim in <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> vanities, table legs, and other household furniture. The divan, with its plush sides and asymmetric shape, is a staple furniture item. Oversized black-and-white wall prints of famous actresses are common. The criss-cross and zig-zag are universal, whether symmetrical or not. Sunburst mirrors are almost ubiquitous.|$|R
50|$|Lay {{the textile}} out {{as flat as}} {{possible}} on the dry glass. Do not let the textile touch any metal or other casing that protects {{the edge of the}} glass. Old storm-windowpanes and glass <b>shower</b> <b>doors</b> are often used for this task, and they usually have their original edging left on, if it's not too bulky, for reasons of safety in handling. If the textile is known to be clean, it can be laid out dry and gently wetted to full saturation. As sections are wetted, any crumples, folds, or details (such as fringes, the picots on the edges of lace, or fine pleats) can be gently teased into place with clean fingertips so that they lie as flat as possible on the glass.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for Wagner was shooting the shower sequence with Tawny Kitaen, as she won't allow the director nor the camera crew to shoot the scene with her. However, she assured trust in Wagner when she seen him with a wedding ring. The moment where the spirit turns on hot blazing water in the shower while she was trapped inside the stall, they had used a couple of effects including a breakway <b>shower</b> <b>door,</b> as they had made a number of shower doors with breakway glass, and a fog machine to represent the hot water's moisture. Almost inevitably on the day of, there was a big uproar to where the set was cleared to only the director and second-camera loader assistant, as all of the men were temporarily kicked off-set; this prepared Kitaen to be more comfortable with the scene.|$|E

50|$|Constructed in 1941 on {{the same}} site as the two earlier buildings, today’s Florence was brought to life by Spokane, Washington {{architect}} G.A. Pehrson who masterfully designed the $600,000 “jewel of a hotel” in its current Art Moderne style. For the next three decades the Florence continued to welcome visitors to downtown Missoula and Big Sky Country. In fact, “Howdy” met Hollywood when John Wayne famously slumbered at The Florence—adding to the romantic notion of the Wild West mingling with the opulent splendor of the hotel’s signature style. The Florence was {{ahead of its time}} with the Northwest’s first central air conditioning system, novel glass <b>shower</b> <b>doors,</b> underground parking for the growing number of Americans traveling by automobile, and first-class interior appointments in a “harmony of color.” The Florence remained a hotel until the 1970s when the building was transformed once again—this time into an office complex with retail businesses occupying the main floor.|$|R
