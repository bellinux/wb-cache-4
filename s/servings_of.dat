5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> {{fruit and}} vegetables daily. The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes {{are not included in}} the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

30|$|With {{the help}} of the questionnaire, {{information}} was collected based on the amount of food intake and the number <b>of</b> <b>servings</b> consumed per day for each food item. Daily intake of grams of food and calories (g, kcal/day) of each food item was calculated by multiplying the amount of food intake and the number <b>of</b> <b>servings</b> per day. We used a mean[*]±[*]SD calculation for comparing food and calorie intake (g, kcal/day) of each item for three different categories: PWS, OC with T 2 DM, and OC without T 2 DM.|$|R

25|$|LaLanne blamed overly {{processed}} foods for many health problems. For {{most of his}} life, he advocated primarily a meat and vegetable diet; eating meat three times per day with eggs and fruit {{in the morning and}} many <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> vegetables in the afternoon and evening. For six years he was a vegetarian. In his later years, he appeared to advocate a mostly meatless diet which included fish, and took vitamin supplements.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{published}} in the Journal of the American Medical Association, biomedical investigators found that Brassicas vegetable intake (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprouts) was inversely related to breast cancer development. The relative risk among women in the highest decile of Brassica vegetable consumption (median, 1.5 servings per day) compared to the lowest decile (virtually no consumption) was 0.58. That is, women who consumed around 1.5 <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> Brassica vegetables per day had 42% less risk of developing breast cancer than those who consumed virtually none.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 44) This study evaluated ten weight-reduction diets {{published in}} eight popular periodicals between October 1979 and February 1980. Deficiencies of iron, significant at the. 05 level, occurred in two diets. Significant deficiencies of calcium, also at the. 05 level, were reported for two other diets. No significant deficiencies were revealed in six diets. This {{portion of the}} evaluation indicated that the diets were, in general, nutritionally adequate. However, only one diet provided the recommended number <b>of</b> <b>servings</b> daily {{for all of the}} food groups included in the Daily Food Guide. Overall, deficits occurred in each of the food groups for which the recommended number <b>of</b> <b>servings</b> daily is specified. The number of food groups for which less than the recommended number <b>of</b> <b>servings</b> daily was provided ranged from none to three per diet. These findings revealed that the diets did not altogether follow the Daily Food Guide. However, their adequacy with respect to the RDA made this the better criterion for evaluation of nutritional adequacy of the diets...|$|R
25|$|Tolerance varies for daily, regular {{caffeine}} {{users and}} high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200mg/day {{spread throughout the}} day) {{have been shown to}} produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the plan, {{including}} FDA advisor Dr. Carlos Camargo, {{have expressed}} concern that the 0.5gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat. This is because a person eating many <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> a product, or eating multiple products {{over the course of the}} day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat. Despite this, the FDA estimates that by 2009, trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1,200 cases of coronary artery disease and 250 to 500 deaths each year. This benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats, as well as manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products.|$|E
25|$|Doses of {{caffeine}} {{equivalent to the}} amount normally found in standard <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action. However, acute ingestion {{of caffeine}} in large doses (at least 250–300mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine {{for a period of}} days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect, and experience no increase in urinary output.|$|E

500|$|The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{considers}} a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market [...] "nutritious" [...] snack bars to park visitors. Ron (Nick Offerman) supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie (Amy Poehler) initially supports the deal as well, until Ann (Rashida Jones) informs her they {{are filled with}} unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors {{so they can make}} an informed choice about Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying about how much he is drinking during a recent outing, feeling she is stifling his personal freedoms. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's CEO Nick Newport Jr. (Gary Weeks) and his son and daughter, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience exclaims with excitement and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful <b>servings</b> <b>of</b> steak ("turf and turf"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having [...] "been a horse's ass".|$|E
40|$|Food {{security}} {{is defined as}} access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. In a study of 212 low-income Latino households in California, 45 % were food insecure without hunger; 13 % food insecure with moderate hunger; and 3 % food insecure with severe hunger.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Sugar-sweetened soda {{is reported to}} be associated with increased risk for diabe-tes and albuminuria, but there are currently limited data on how sugar or artificially sweetened soda may be related to kidney function decline. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This study identified 3318 women participating in the Nurses’ Health Study with data on soda intake and albuminuria; of these, 3256 also had data on estimated GFR (eGFR) change between 1989 and 2000. Cumulative average beverage intake was derived from the 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998 food frequency questionnaires. Serving categories included 1 /mo (referent), 1 to 4 /mo, 2 to 6 /wk, 1 to 1. 9 /d, and 2 /d. Microalbuminuria (MA) was considered a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 25 to 355 g/mg. For kidney function change, the primary outcome was a 30 % decline in eGFR over 11 years; rapid eGFR decline defined as 3 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 per year was also examined. Results Consumption <b>of</b> 2 <b>servings</b> per day <b>of</b> artificially sweetened (diet) soda was independently associ-ated with eGFR decline 30 % (OR 2. 02, 95 % CI 1. 36 to 3. 01) and 3 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 per year (OR 2. 20, 95 % CI 1. 36 to 3. 55).
