50|$|Crustose lichen forms a thin crust {{adhering}} {{closely to}} the substratum. In some cases, this crust may be thick and lumpy, and may be detached, in part, or submerged below its surface. The thallus of a crustose lichen is usually only discernible because of the discolouration of the substrate. Some crustose lichens have thalli consisting of scattered or loosely grouped granules. Crustose lichens differ from the leprose lichen by having an upper cortex and algal cells that are located directly beneath the cortex. The thallus of a crustose lichen has a patchwork or crazy-paving appearance. The patches, or areolae, can be as large as 1 cm in diameter or very small and raised, giving them {{the appearance of a}} wart. The surface of the thallus is generally smooth, however it is sometimes broken up by “rimose” cracks. These cracks are a by-product of thallus <b>surface</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> which is caused by alternate wetting and drying. An underlayer of fungal hyphae, the hypothallus, is present on some species of crustose lichens. A dark rim on the areolae may form in areas where the hypothallus is exposed. This may also be present on the thallus itself. These fungal hyphae are usually what attach the thallus firmly to the substrate.|$|E
40|$|The {{smoothing}} of polyhedral surfaces {{is important}} for the analysis and visualization of three-dimensional medical images. Simple Gaussian surface smoothing has a wellknown drawback of causing <b>surface</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> This has led to various signal processing algorithms for surface mesh filtering. In this paper, a new approach to surface mesh smoothing without shrinkage is presented. The approach is based on a representation of sphere shaped simplex meshes. The surface smoothing is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, which is shown to be uniquely solvable. The cost function to be optimized penalizes deviations from the sphere shape while maintaining the overall shape of the original mesh. A linear time gradient descent algorithm for solving the optimization problem is derived. The surface smoothing achieved this way is fast, simple, reversible, and does not cause <b>surface</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> We demonstrate good properties of the algorithm by filtering synthetic surfaces as well as surfaces extracted from three-dimensional medical images. In addition, quantitative comparisons to competing algorithms are made. These further illustrate the advantages of the proposed sphere filtering algorithm...|$|E

When hot pumice having interconnected bubbles is exposed to constant pressure at high-temperature conditions, the bubbles can shrink owing to the surface tension effect. This may be the mechanism that generates the low-porosity region with small vesicles around the outer edges of scoriae. To evaluate the temperature range for shrinkage, we heated the scoria samples and measured their volume change.|$|R

30|$|Twelve {{specimens}} {{were subjected}} to elevated temperatures of 500  °C for 2 or 3  h. Elevated temperatures caused minor superficial damage to the specimens: lateral hairline cracks, parallel to transverse reinforcement, were noted. In fact, these micro <b>surface</b> <b>shrinkage</b> cracks were noted {{in most of the}} specimens before heating and became clearly visible after heating. Superficial spider cracks, being more concentrated over the middle two-thirds of the column height, were also visible. Moreover, the intensity of surface cracking increased with increasing heating duration which is believed to be caused by the development of internal stresses associated with differential expansion (Hertz 2003). Most of the heat-induced cracks healed with time and became hardly detectable at the time repair was initiated.|$|E

40|$|Extension of {{the work}} of Philip (1969 a, 1972) has shown that the effect of {{overburden}} pressure on volume change of swelling soils produces equilibrium moisture profiles entirely different from those predicted without considering the overburden pressure effects. Volume change of swelling soils accompanied by moisture changes also affects the overburden pressure. The total volume change under an overburden pressure occurs in three different shrinkage phases from saturation to oven dry. These volume change characteristics are usually described on the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>surface,</b> a surface drawn as void ratio e (volume of voids/volume of solids) versus moisture ratio Θ (volume of water/volume of solids) for different overburden pressures. A relationship for the moisture gradient is developed by assuming that the overburden potential, a component of the total potential of soil water, is a function of moisture ratio only across a small soil element of a long swelling soil column which consists of large numbers of finite soil elements. The moisture gradient has complex behavior based on the properties of the three shrinkage phases on the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>surface.</b> Distribution of equilibrium moisture paths is then explained by evaluating the moisture gradients at points on an idealized <b>shrinkage</b> <b>surface.</b> It is shown that the soil at great depths could either be saturated or unsaturated at equilibrium.

This experimental program prepared a total matrix of 54 mixtures with w/b of 0. 40 and 0. 45; nominal air content of 2, 4, and 8 %; and three types of supplementary cementitious materials and one ordinary portland cement in different combinations.

The electroforming process can be easily controlled by adjusting operating parameters to produce high-density and fine grain–structured metal deposits.

40|$|Carbon {{materials}} with tailored texture {{can be obtained}} from drying and pyrolysis of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels. The pore texture of both dried and pyrolyzed material depends on the drying process. Several more or less expensive methods (supercritical drying, freeze-drying, evaporative drying) were tested in order to determine which process is the most suitable for the synthesis of a porous carbon with a definite texture. Supercritical drying leads to the highest pore volume and the widest texture range, but residual <b>surface</b> tensions and <b>shrinkage</b> are not avoided when the pore size is small or when the material density is low; this hampers to fix both the pore volume and the pore size easily. Monoliths are very difficult to obtain by freeze-drying, and the appearance of huge channels due to ice crystal growth at high dilution ratio hinders the fabrication of low density materials. Moreover, gels with small pores do not remain frozen throughout drying, which leads to <b>surface</b> tensions and <b>shrinkage.</b> Although generally replaced by more complicated techniques, evaporative drying is suitable when dense carbons are needed or when the only selection criterion is the pore size: all pore sizes are reachable, but this parameter is in this case strongly correlated to the pore volume.

In any casting industry the leading problem taking place is Mould shifting from electrical furnace to the die casting. In the present work an attempt was made to fabricate the pneumatic system for pouring the molten metal in to the cavity semi automatically. The system was tested for carrying the metal which reduces the manual work for mould shifting from electrical furnace to die casting and the results are compared with manual working which improves the quality, productivity and defect free product. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{annealing}} {{on the structure}} and the helix orientation in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) monolayers of diblock copolymers (PLGA-b-PMLGSLGs) of poly(alpha-L-glutamic acid) (PLGA) and poly(gamma-methyl-L-glutamate-ran-gamma-stearyl-L-glutamate) with 30 mol % of stearyl substituents (PMLGSLG) with unidirectional helix orientation deposited on hydrophilic silicon substrates was characterized by means of small-angle X-ray reflectivity, transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Upon annealing at 100 degrees C for 24 h, the a-helices became less tilted toward the substrate surface normal. <b>Surface</b> area <b>shrinkage</b> accompanied the change in tilt, indicated {{by an increase in}} both film thickness and electron density, resulting in more compact and uniform films. The enhancement of the helix orientation by thermal annealing was greater for the PMLGSLG block and for the diblock copolymers with the shorter block lengths. For these diblock copolymers, annealing resulted in postorientation of the PMLGSLG block helices almost perpendicular to the substrate surface, This effect originates from a considerable increase in intermolecular packing of the PLGA block caused by hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups upon annealing, as well as the high mobility of the PMLGSLG block helices for rearrangement favored by the melted side chain mantle at elevated temperatures...|$|R
