5|$|The {{secondary}} armament of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A {{hit from}} a light gun {{could not be}} relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate mountings of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack {{was to provide a}} destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I the secondary armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide field of fire and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, the secondary guns were seen as {{a major part of the}} anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, dual-purpose guns increasingly adopted.|$|E

25|$|Its {{superficial}} {{similarity to}} wolves was often noted by explorers during the Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. They {{noted that the}} ears of the Eskimo dogs they encountered {{were similar to those}} of American wolves, and their forelegs lacked the black mark above the wrist characteristic of European wolves. The most <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the two species was said to be through the length and posture of the tail, which was shorter and more curved in the dog.|$|E

25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who {{you were going to get}} married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> meet women. Asker agrees and starts to go round the houses selling fabrics.|$|E
25|$|Pharaohs' {{subjects}} {{viewed the}} pharaoh {{as a living}} god, the god Horus. Once the pharaoh died, he became the god Osiris, the king of eternity. While some retainers' deaths {{appear to have been}} taken for granted, other sacrifices appear to have raised the status and wealth of some retainers in the afterlife. This can be inferred from the wealth they were interred with and their graves' position in relation to the king's grave. This also suggests that the retainers agreed to be sacrificed to raise their social status and wealth in the afterlife. Matthew Adams, an archeologist from the University of Pennsylvania and the associate director of an expedition made by New York University, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have viewed being sacrificed at a king's death a <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reach eternal life. For a civilization so centered on the life to come, a guarantee of eternal happiness and security would seem a likely motivation for a retainer to agree to be sacrificed.|$|E
500|$|The idea to use zombies for [...] "Millennium" [...] {{arose from}} a {{separate}} aborted project. Reportedly, Stephen King, who had co-penned season five's [...] "Chinga", wished {{to write an}} episode based on George A. Romero's cult 1968 zombie film Night of the Living Dead. In addition, Romero was slated to direct the episode. According to [...] "Millennium" [...] co-writer and executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the staff of The X-Files met with both King and Romero and the two showed an interest in producing the episode. Initially, the episode was slated for the seventh season, but it never came to fruition. Zombies as a plot device were then later relegated to what would become [...] "Millennium". However, Mulder's line, [...] "Shoot them in the head, it seems to stop them", mirrors a very similar line lifted from Night of the Living Dead: [...] "Shoot them in the head, that's a <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> kill them." ...|$|E

Depending on the second or third person, a given sentence may vary widely because honorific speech comprises a separate vocabulary, including all parts of speech and topics both lofty and mundane. Examples include: pohnkoiohlap (to eat with the nahnmwarki), likena (high chief's wife), pahnkupwur (chest; normally mwarmware), pahnpwoal (armpit; normally pahnpeh), dauso (anus, normally pwoar), kelipa (to joke, normally kamwan), kaluhlu (to vomit), and keipweni (an interjection). Although at times {{in the absence of a}} specific honorific word, the word [...] "Ketin" [...] is often used to indicate that the proceeding verb is honoric ("Koht kin ketin kapikada" [...] would translate to [...] "God creates").
