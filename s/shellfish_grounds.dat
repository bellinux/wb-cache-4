40|$|The Beaufort River is {{a complex}} estuarine river system that {{supports}} a variety of uses including <b>shellfish</b> <b>grounds,</b> fisheries nursery habitats, shipping access to Port Royal, receiving waters for wastewater effluent, and an 18 -mile reach of the Intracoastal Waterway. The river is on the Section 303 (d) list of impaired waters of South Carolina for low dissolved-oxygen concentrations. The Clean Water Act stipulates that a Total Maximum Daily Load must be determined for impaired waters. An empirical model was developed to simulate the impact of point-source discharges and rainfall on dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the Beaufort River. The model uses of water level, specific conductance, temperature, and dissolved-oxygen concentration data collected at 15 -minute intervals from seven real-time gaging stations and effluent point-source data collected {{on a weekly basis}} for a 33 -month period. The empirical model utilizes data mining techniques, including artificial neural network (ANN) models, to quantify the relations between the time series of three wastewater point-source discharges and the dissolved-oxygen concentrations recorded at seven real-time gages distributed throughout the system. Data mining is a new science that extracts knowledge from large volumes of data, and uses attributes from fields such as computer science, signal processing, advanced statistics...|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{seawater}} temperature increases define optimal {{growth conditions}} for Dinoflagellate species which can reach high concentrations in water column {{and also in}} filter-feeding organisms like Mytilus galloprovincialis. Commonly produced by Dinophysis and Prorocentrum spp., okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues {{are responsible for the}} Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) syndrome in humans. Closure of <b>shellfishing</b> <b>grounds</b> is therefore recommended by the EU when DSP toxin levels in shellfish exceed 16 mu g OA 100 g(- 1) flesh. Despite not being responsible for casualties either in humans or mussels, DSP outbreaks are considered natural events causing health and economic issues due to the frequency of their occurrence. Since gene expression studies offer a wide range of different solutions, we used a mussel cDNA microarray to evaluate gene expression changes in the digestive gland of mussels fed for five weeks with OA-contaminated nutrient. Among the differentially expressed genes we observed a general up-regulation of transcripts coding for stress proteins, proteins involved in cellular synthesis, and a few not annotated proteins. Overall, at the first time point analyzed we identified 58 candidate transcripts for OA-induced stress in mussels, half of which have unknown function. In this paper we present the first gene expression analysis performed on Mediterranean mussels exposed to okadaic acid. The characterization of these transcripts could be useful for the identification of an early physiological response to OA exposure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Beaufort and Jasper Counties are two {{rapidly growing}} coastal {{counties}} in South Carolina. According to the 2000 census, the region grew by 40 {{percent during the}} preceding 10 years. The population growth has increased the quantity of wastewater in the area. The Beaufort River is a complex tidal river system {{that is home to}} <b>shellfish</b> <b>grounds,</b> fisheries nursery habitats, and extensive recreation by the local community. The river also serves as receiving water for treated wastewater from military and civilian wastewater reclamation facilities (WRF). Although not uncommon for coastal areas, the river is on the South Carolina list of impaired waters for low dissolved oxygen. The WRFs discharging into the Beaufort River are old and operating close to their permitted capacity. A regional approach was necessary to address the complex river system issues and to protect the highly sensitive ecosystems of the Beaufort River. A regional wastewater management approach was developed that called for consolidating the military and municipal wastewater discharges into a single, high-quality discharge. This plan, however, required extensive data collection and modeling to prove its validity. Toward that end, an artificial neural network (ANN) dissolved-oxygen model was developed for the river to predict the impacts from a regional WRF. The database, ANN models, model controls, streaming graphics, and simulation output were integrated into a spreadsheet-based Decision Support System (DSS) to facilitate the dissemination of th...|$|E
40|$|The Beaufort River is {{a complex}} estuarine river system that {{supports}} a variety of uses including <b>shellfish</b> <b>grounds,</b> fisheries nursery habitats, shipping access to Port Royal, receiving waters for wastewater effluent, and an 32 kilometer section of the Intracoastal Waterway. The river is on the 303 (d) list of impaired waters of South Carolina for low dissolved-oxygen concentrations. The Clean Water Act stipulates that a Total Maximum Daily Load must be determined for impaired waters. Artificial neural network (ANN) models and other data mining techniques were applied in the Beaufort River system to quantify {{the relationships between the}} time series of four wastewater pointsource discharges and the dissolved-oxygen concentrations recorded at seven real-time gages distributed about the system. The analysis included environmental factors such as water temperature, tides, and rainfall. This paper describes findings of the relationship between one of the point sources and a nearby gage. It was found that the effects of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonia loads on the dissolvedoxygen concentrations vary significantly with water temperature and tidal conditions. Depending on tidal conditions, calculations estimate that at a water temperature of 20 ° Celsius, a reduction of 100 lbs/day of 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand from the point source will increase the dissolvedoxygen concentration at the nearby gage by 0. 073 mg/L. The corresponding change in dissolved oxygen relative to 100 lbs/day of NH 3 is 0. 16 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|The dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii is a {{well-known}} harmful algal species that can potentially cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Usually A. ostenfeldii occurs in low background concentrations only, but in August of 2012 an exceptionally dense bloom of more than 1 million cells L- 1 occurred in the brackish Ouwerkerkse Kreek in The Netherlands. The A. ostenfeldii bloom produced both saxitoxins and spirolides, and is {{held responsible for the}} death of a dog with a high saxitoxin stomach content. The Ouwerkerkse Kreek routinely discharges its water into the adjacent Oosterschelde estuary, and an immediate reduction of the bloom was required to avoid contamination of extensive <b>shellfish</b> <b>grounds.</b> Previously, treatment of infected waters with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) successfully suppressed cyanobacterial blooms in lakes. Therefore, we adapted this treatment to eradicate the Alexandrium bloom using a three-step approach. First, we investigated the required H 2 O 2 dosage in laboratory experiments with A. ostenfeldii. Second, we tested the method in a small, isolated canal adjacent to the Ouwerkerkse Kreek. Finally, we brought 50 mg L- 1 of H 2 O 2 into the entire creek system with a special device, called a water harrow, for optimal dispersal of the added H 2 O 2. Concentrations of both vegetative cells and pellicle cysts declined by 99. 8 % within 48 h, and PSP toxin concentrations in the water were reduced below local regulatory levels of 15 µg L- 1. Zooplankton were strongly affected by the H 2 O 2 treatment, but impacts on macroinvertebrates and fish were minimal. A key advantage of this method is that the added H 2 O 2 decays to water and oxygen within a few days, which enables rapid recovery of the system after the treatment. This is the first successful field application of H 2 O 2 to suppress a marine harmful algal bloom, although Alexandrium spp. reoccurred at lower concentrations in the following year. The results show that H 2 O 2 treatment provides an effective emergency management option to mitigate toxic Alexandrium blooms, especially when immediate action is required...|$|E

2500|$|Dredgers – use a dredge for {{collecting}} molluscs from the seafloor. There are {{three types of}} dredges: (a) The dredge can be dragged along the seabed, scooping the <b>shellfish</b> from the <b>ground.</b> These dredges are towed {{in a manner similar}} to beam trawlers, and large dredgers can work three or more dredges on each side. [...] (b) Heavy mechanical dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. Dredgers don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths.|$|R

40|$|Results of {{chemical}} concentrations of heavy metals, polyciclyc aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloretane (DDT) and its metabolites in queen scallop (Aequipecten opercularis) are presented. Sampling took place, after the spawning period, {{in the main}} <b>shellfish</b> <b>grounds</b> of the Rias of Vigo and Arosa (NW Spain). Each sample was prepared from 20 individuals representing the available size range existing in the selected area. The soft tissues (total edible portion) were separated from the shells, triturated with an Ultraturrax homogeniser and freeze-dried. The analysis of trace metals includes a nitric acid digestion in a microwave. The quantification {{was carried out by}} atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman effect graphite furnace. Total mercury was determined by flow injection cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry. The method used for the determination of 13 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) is based in a Soxhlet extraction with organic solvents mixture, followed by an extract cleaning up using column chromatography. Finally, the extract was analysed using gigh performance liquid chromatography with wavelength programmable fluorescence detector. Samples for analyses of PCBs were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with organic solvents mixture. Clean-up and fractioned of the extract was performed with a chromatographic columns. The extract were analysed by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector using capillary columns and He as carrier gas. The lipid content was gravimetrically determined. The quality of the chemical analyses is demonstrated by the results obtained in different intercalibration exercises that take part on a regular basis, such as QUASIMEME. The internal laboratory QC includes analyses of duplicate samples and procedural blanks as well as control charts of CRMs. The experimental values for metals were far below the EU maximum levles for bivalve molluscs for human consumption, with the exception of Pb, for which some results exceeded EC Regulation Nº 1881 / 2006. The Pb values appear to be more related to the biology of this species than to the contaminant levels in the study areas, as the Pb values in other species of bivalve molluscs from these areas show concentrations far below the limits for consumption. The average As and Zn concentrations was higher in Arosa than in Vigo. Cd, Hg and Cu showed very similar values in both areas of study. For PAHs, the comparison value used in this study was the one established for extraction and consumption after the Erika and Prestige oil spills, 200 µg kg- 1 dry wt in Vigo, which is 3 - 4 times less than the limit, to 151 - 181 µg Kg- 1 dry wt in Arosa, which is very close to, but below the maximum allowed level. In general, the queen scallop showed higher PAH concentrations in Arosa than in Vigo, and the origin also appears to be different. The highest concentrations of PCBs were found in the Ría of Vigo, zone with greatest industrial and port activity, with a maximum value of 20 µg Kg- 1 wet wt, which is considerably lower than the level established by the FDA for edible seafood. In the Ria of Arousa the concentrations were 6 - 7 times lower, with values ranging level 2. 8 and 3. 2 µg kg- 1 wet wt. The concentrations of DDTs showed similar values in the two rias: 0. 52 - 0. 64 µg kg- 1 wet wt in the Ria of Vigo and 0. 45 - 0. 55 µg kg- 1 wet in the Ria of Arosa. The levels were also lower then the maximum limits established by the EU...|$|E
