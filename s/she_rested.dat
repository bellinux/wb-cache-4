After arriving in the Thames, she anchored off the Mucking Light. Just before dawn, she was cut down and holed on the starboard bow by Cato, with one hand being seriously injured.

His {{last words}} {{were to his}} family, telling Emma [...] "I am not the least afraid of death– Remember what a good wife you have been to me– Tell all my {{children}} to remember how good they have been to me", then while <b>she</b> <b>rested,</b> he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis [...] "It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you". He had expected {{to be buried in}} St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral was held on Wednesday 26 April and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, Manning became pregnant; {{the couple}} were overjoyed and Manning relaxed, {{becoming}} less critical of others, including her own mother, {{with whom she had}} long had a difficult relationship. Uncharacteristically, <b>she</b> <b>rested,</b> walked, painted and even knitted. In the seventh month, however, the baby died in utero, and as was the practice at the time, Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child. [...] "I am like a walking cemetery", she sorrowfully repeated during this period. Grief-stricken, Manning became paranoid, constantly afraid that Reggie would be assassinated. Reggie decided that she was having a nervous breakdown, and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month's holiday. Returning to Jerusalem, she was still far from well, and the poet Louis Lawler noticed the discontent of this [...] "strange and difficult woman", and Reggie's [...] "wonderfully patient" [...] behaviour, despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period. Manning never fully recovered from her loss, and was rarely to talk or write of it. She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals, especially cats.|$|E
