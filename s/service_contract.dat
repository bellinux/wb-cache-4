40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the transition from traditional <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> at Department of Defense Field Contracting Activities. There {{has been an increase}} in spending on services over the past decade that has forced the Federal Government to review its policy on <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> In 1991, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy established policy for the acquisition of <b>services</b> using performance-based <b>contracting.</b> Interviews of Government contracting personnel and review of professional literature highlight barriers to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> These barriers are: management of cultural change, education and training of Government and contractor personnel, adoption of best commercial practices, writing of performance-based statements of work, and the tasks involved in contract administration. This thesis makes recommendations for overcoming these barriers and provides guidance for successful implementation of performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> within the Department of Defense.

This thesis critically analyzes the DoD <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process with a focus on innovation through alpha contracting as a redesign enabler. <b>Service</b> <b>contracting</b> is increasingly important as the DOD shifts to contractor support with the many unique characteristics requiring special attention that <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> entails. Data gathered from field research and interviews are employed to support comparative process analysis of eight <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process flows. Innovation analysis of these eight processes is employed to redesign the <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process through alpha contracting. Both positive implications and potential inhibitors to alpha contracting are discussed, as well as mechanisms to overcome the inhibitors. To generalize the results of this research, a decision model is developed to assist acquisition managers in assessing the likelihood of alpha contracting success. The thesis concludes that alpha contracting can innovate the <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process and offers suggestions for future research along these lines.
