25|$|These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each {{consisting}} of an antenna complex that uses chlorophylls and accessory photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins to harvest light {{at a variety}} of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll a at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll a molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. Photosystem I contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules, designated P700, at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700nm light. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll that absorbs 680nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the visible spectrum).

40|$|In a car crash, {{the higher}} level of energy {{absorption}} in the frontal structures leads to less transferred energy to the passengers and hence a safer car. S-shaped front rails, also known as S-rails, {{are one of the}} main structural elements and energy absorbers in a car body. Energy absorption in the S-rails happens through local buckling. In order to improve the passenger safety in a frontal crash, S-rails design should be optimised to absorb {{higher level of}} energy while crushing. In this study, using Finite Element Methods, the crashworthiness impact of tapering S-shaped rails is studied through investigating the energy <b>absorption</b> and <b>Specific</b> Energy <b>Absorption</b> of 42 tapered square cross section steel S-rail models subjecting to quasi-static and dynamic loading. The results are verified using analytical analysis. To develop the models, two S-rails, one without (type A) and one with (type B) internal diagonal reinforcement are tapered with 20 different tapering ratios ranging from 110 % to 300 % with 10 % increments. All models are subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The effectiveness of tapering S-rails is assessed through investigating the <b>Specific</b> Energy <b>Absorption</b> (SEA) variations. In quasi-static loading conditions, tapering type A models showed 144 % increase in energy absorption and 22 % improvement in <b>specific</b> energy <b>absorption.</b> In type B models under quasi-static loading, the energy absorption increased by 118 % and a maximum of 6 % improvement in <b>specific</b> energy <b>absorption</b> was achieved as a result of tapering the S-rails.

An original method of manufacturing the composite tubes with vacuum infusion together with an expandable foam core to form multi-cellular structures was used. Low cost, 24 k tow carbon fibre braids were used and their performance was compared with that of the more expensive l 2 k tow size fibres.

Multi-tube designs involved the hexagonal and cubic packing of Al foam-filled deep drawn Al tubes inside rigid cylindrical and rectangular dies. For comparison purposes, empty Al tubes, Al and polystyrene foam-filled single tubes, Al and polystyrene foam-filled bitubular tubes and empty multi-tube designs of hexagonal and cubic packing were also tested under the similar test conditions. The Al-closed cell foams {{used for the}} filling of tubes were prepared in house using a patented foaming process. For each tube geometry investigated the average crushing load and <b>specific</b> energy <b>absorption</b> was calculated {{and the results were}} compared. It was shown that although foam filling resulted in higher energy absorption than the sum of the energy absorptions of the tube alone and foam alone, it was not more effective in increasing the specific energy than simply thickening the tube walls. The lower <b>specific</b> energy <b>absorptions</b> of the Al-foam filled single tubes based on the equal mass criterion were due to the relatively lower plateau stresses of the filler material used. The experimental results have further shown that both multi-tube and bitubular geometries exhibited higher <b>specific</b> energy <b>absorption</b> capabilities than those of foam-filled single tubes. The increased strengthening coefficients of the multi-tube geometries with foam filling were solely due to the frictional loads between the adjacent tube walls, tube walls and die wall and constraint effect of die itself.
