Using statistical regression, we develop a <b>balance</b> <b>constraint</b> for the BEC of aerosol variables {{and apply it to}} a three-dimensional variational data assimilation system in the WRF/Chem model; 1 -month forecasts from the WRF/Chem model are employed for BEC statistics. The cross-correlations between the different species are generally high. The largest correlation occurs between elemental carbon and organic carbon with as large as 0. 9. After using the <b>balance</b> <b>constraints,</b> the correlations between the unbalanced variables reduce to less than 0. 2. A set of data assimilation and forecasting experiments is performed. In these experiments, surface PM 2. 5 concentrations and speciated concentrations along aircraft flight tracks are assimilated. The analysis increments with the <b>balance</b> <b>constraints</b> show spatial distributions more complex than those without the <b>balance</b> <b>constraints,</b> which is a consequence of the spreading of observation information across variables due to the <b>balance</b> <b>constraints.</b> The forecast skills with the <b>balance</b> <b>constraints</b> show substantial and durable improvements from the 2 nd hour to the 16 th hour compared with the forecast skills without the <b>balance</b> <b>constraints.</b> The results suggest that the developed <b>balance</b> <b>constraints</b> {{are important}} for the aerosol assimilation and forecasting...|$|R

40|$|When search {{trees are}} made relaxed, <b>balance</b> <b>constraints</b> are {{weakened}} such that updates {{can be made}} without immediate rebalancing.

40|$|The COS {{hydrolysis}} reaction (COS + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 S) using γ-Al 2 O 3 at 220 Â°C is described and discussed. The stoichiometric reaction of COS {{in the absence}} of water proceeds and the extent of reaction is comparable to the moisture content of the alumina that can be removed during TGA. The reaction of COS and H 2 O is long lived at this temperature but the <b>sulphur</b> <b>balance</b> based on H 2 S is ca. 80. It is found that elemental sulphur is deposited in the reactor and on the catalyst during this reaction. Reaction in the presence of H 2 increases the <b>sulphur</b> <b>balance</b> to 100 and no sulphur is deposited on the catalyst. The beneficial effect of hydrogen is demonstrated by mixing sulphur with γ-Al 2 O 3 which on reaction with H 2 leads to the formation of COS and H 2 S.

40|$|We {{consider}} a problem faced by a buying office {{for one of}} the largest retail distributors in the world. The buying office plans the distribution of goods from Asia to various destinations across Europe. The goods are transported along shipping lanes by shipping companies, many of which have collaborated to form strategic alliances; each lane must be serviced by a minimum number of companies belonging to a minimum number of alliances. The task involves purchasing freight capacity from shipping companies for each lane based on projected demand, and subject to minimum quantity requirements for each selected shipping company, such that the total transportation cost is minimized. In addition, the allocation must not assign an overly high proportion of freight to the more expensive shipping companies servicing any particular lane, which we call the lane cost <b>balancing</b> <b>constraint.</b> This study is the first to consider the lane cost <b>balancing</b> <b>constraint</b> in the context of freight allocation. We formulate the freight allocation problem with this lane cost <b>balancing</b> <b>constraint</b> as a mixed integer programming model, and show that even finding a feasible solution to this problem is computationally intractable. Hence, in order to produce high-quality solutions in practice, we devised a meta-heuristic approach based on tabu search.
