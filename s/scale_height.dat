40|$|We use {{three-dimensional}} magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations {{to study}} {{the formation of a}} corona above an initially weakly magnetized, isothermal accretion disk. We also describe a modification to time-explicit numerical algorithms for MHD which enables us to evolve highly stratified disks for many orbital times. We find that MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) produces strong amplification of weak fields within two <b>scale</b> <b>heights</b> of the disk midplane in a few orbital times. About 25 % of the magnetic energy generated by the MRI within two <b>scale</b> <b>heights</b> escapes due to buoyancy, producing a strongly magnetized corona above the disk. Most of the buoyantly rising magnetic energy is dissipated between 3 and 5 <b>scale</b> <b>heights,</b> suggesting the corona will also be hot. The average vertical disk structure consists of a weakly magnetized turbulent core below a strongly magnetized corona which is stable to the MRI. The largescale field structure in both the disk and corona is toroidal. The functional form of the stress is flat within two <b>scale</b> <b>heights,</b> but proportional to the density above two <b>scale</b> <b>heights.</b> For initially weak uniform vertical fields, we find the exponential growth of magnetic field via axisymmetric vertical modes of the MRI produces strongly buoyant sheets of magnetic energy which break the disk apart into horizontal channels. These channels rise several <b>scale</b> <b>heights</b> vertically before the onset of the Parker instability distorts the sheets and allows matter to flow back towards the midplane and reform a disk. We suggest this evolution may be relevant to the dynamical processes which disrupt the inner regions of a disk when it interacts with a strongly magnetized central object.

25|$|The {{upper part}} of the thermosphere, where the mean free path of the {{molecules}} exceeds the <b>scale</b> <b>height,</b> is called the exosphere. The lower boundary of the Uranian exosphere, the exobase, is located at a height of about 6,500km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The exosphere is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure {{at the base of the}} thermosphere explain in part why Uranus's exosphere is so vast. The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated exosphere include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.|$|E

The [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratio, an excellent measure of radiation hardness, rises with z in the halo of NGC 891. It is also higher in the halo of NGC 5775 than in the disk. NGC 3044 presents a more confusing situation. To explain the [Ne III]/[Ne II] as well as optical line ratio behavior in NGC 891, we carry out a simple exploration of parameter space with CLOUDY, which indicates a large increase in radiation temperature with height. Illustrative examples of physical models using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code show that the rising neon ratio {{may be explained by}} adding a vertically extended, hot stellar source to a thin disk of massive stars. However, several other sources of hard spectra may be relevant. PAH features have <b>scale</b> <b>heights</b> of 430 [...] 530 pc in NGC 891 and 720 [...] 1080 pc in NGC 5775, suggesting they can be transported by disk-halo flows.

From these, we determine the best fit parameters for each of our systems. For three systems, none of our models produce a satisfactory fit. For the remaining systems, no single value for the convective overshooting parameter fits all the systems, but most of our systems can be well described with an overshooting parameter between 0. 09 and 0. 15, corresponding to an extension of the mixed region above the core of about 0. 1 - 0. 3 pressure <b>scale</b> <b>heights.</b> Of the nine systems where we are able to obtain a good fit, seven can be reasonably well fit with a single parameter of 0. 15.
