25|$|Critics see {{the change}} in {{calendar}} as an unwarranted innovation, influenced by Western society. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> sound theological reason has been given for changing the calendar, that the only reasons advanced are social. The proposal for change was introduced by Meletios Metaxakis, a patriarch whose canonical status has been disputed and who {{is alleged to have}} been a Freemason, which is forbidden by the Orthodox Church.|$|E
25|$|If we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one {{may help}} the mother obtain an abortion, {{we fail to}} {{acknowledge}} the motherâ€™s right over her body (or property).

As Thomson reminds, the house belongs to the mother; similarly, the body which holds a fetus also belongs to the mother.|$|E

When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|The Calvinist atonement {{is called}} {{definite}} by some {{because they believe}} it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called {{limited in its extent}} because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, which is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as particular redemption, giving its adherents the name Particular Baptists. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in general as General Baptists believe.|$|E

500|$|Many Native Americans were {{offended}} that Geronimo, {{the renowned}} 19th-century Apache leader, was irrevocably linked with bin Laden. The {{chairman of the}} Fort Sill Apache Tribe, the successor to Geronimo's tribe, {{wrote a letter to}} Obama asking him to [...] "right this wrong." [...] The president of the Navajo Nation requested that the U.S. government change the code name retroactively. Officials from the National Congress of American Indians said the focus should be on honoring the disproportionately high number of Native Americans who serve in the military, and they had been assured that [...] "Geronimo" [...] was not a code name for bin Laden. The U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs heard testimony on the issue from tribal leaders, while the Defense Department had no comment except to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> disrespect was intended.|$|E

He also made the cover of Time in Asia; Forbes wrote, [...] "Congratulations Jeremy. You have now made the cover of Time the same number of times as Michael Jordan. Linsanity reigns on." [...] Lin's story was also on the front-page of many Taipei newspapers. [...] "I haven't done a computation, but it's fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> player has created the interest and the frenzy in this short period of time, in any sport, that I'm aware of like Jeremy Lin has," [...] said NBA commissioner David Stern.|$|E

Now I am convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> Christians have enclosed places of this sort.

500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{issue is}} that of free will, {{the degree to which}} people are {{responsible}} for their own choices. Free will relates to determinism, if everything is strictly determined by prior state, then some would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one can have free will. Kurzweil holds a pragmatic belief in free will because he feels society needs it to function. He also suggests that quantum mechanics may provide [...] "a continual source of uncertainty at the most basic level of reality" [...] such that determinism does not exist.|$|E
