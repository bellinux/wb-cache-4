25|$|Ricardo's {{work on the}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> {{affected}} the development of British aircraft engines in the thirties and during the war. He even enhanced the famous Rolls-Royce Merlin engine in the Mosquito by giving it an oxygen enrichment system to improve its performance.|$|E
25|$|Daimler's <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engines idle silently {{but they}} left a slight haze of oil smoke {{trailing}} behind them. These engines consumed oil {{at a rate}} of up to an Imperial gallon every 450 miles, oil being needed to lubricate the sleeves particularly when cold. However, by the standards of their day they required very little maintenance.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom the Bristol Aeroplane Company was {{concentrating on}} {{developing}} radials {{such as the}} Jupiter, Mercury and <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> Hercules radials. Germany, Russia and Japan started with building licensed versions of the Armstrong Siddeley, Bristol, Wright, or Pratt & Whitney radials before producing their own improved versions. France continued its development of various rotary engines but also produced engines derived from Bristol designs, especially the Jupiter.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{nacelles}} {{were designed}} to receive Bristol Jupiter, Pegasus or Perseus engines without modification, a far-sighted provision which later enabled e.g. the two inboard Jupiters of G-ACJK Syrinx readily to be replaced with Perseus IIL <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engines, to test their performance in airline conditions. When Syrinx was re-built (after it had been severely damaged when blown over by sidewinds while taxiing at Brussels airport), it was fitted with four Pegasus XC engines.|$|E
25|$|Power: Because each {{cylinder}} on a {{radial engine}} {{has its own}} head, it is impractical to use a multivalve valvetrain on a radial engine. Therefore, almost all radial engines use a two valve pushrod-type valvetrain which may result in less power for a given displacement than multi-valve inline engines. The limitations of the poppet valve were largely overcome {{by the development of}} the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve,</b> but at the cost of increased complexity, maintenance costs and reduced reliability.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Harry Ricardo wrote {{a paper on}} the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> design that led to the USAAC's hyper engine efforts. He claimed that the 1hp/in³ goal was {{impossible}} to achieve with poppet valve type engines. The USAAC engineering team at Wright Field decided to test this claim by beating it. The I-1430 was the result of an experimental effort at Wright Field to build a high-power cylinder using conventional poppet valves. The engineers, led by Sam Heron, used a variety of techniques to raise the allowable RPM, which was the key to increased power without requiring a larger engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{reciprocating}} sleeve valves were open-ended, {{rather than}} sealing in a junk head. The open end uncovered the exhaust ports {{high in the}} cylinder wall {{at the bottom of}} the sleeves' stroke, leaving the ports cut into the sleeve to handle the incoming charge only. The sleeves had a stroke of 30% of the piston travel at 1.950 in (49.5mm) and operated 15 degrees in advance of the crankshaft. The Crecy sleeve valves were of similar construction but differed in their operation compared to the rotary <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> design that was pioneered by Roy Fedden, and used successfully for the first time in an aircraft engine, the Bristol Perseus, in 1932.|$|E
25|$|By 1930, the BSA Group's primary {{activities}} were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles. However, all the quality car businesses experienced financial {{difficulties in the}} late 1920s. Daimler's situation seemed particularly serious. Sales fell sharply in 1927–1928, a period of losses ensued and no dividends were paid between 1929 and 1936. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engine was outdated, Daimler's production methods had become old-fashioned, they had an extravagantly large range of products. Their bankers noted the decreasing sales volume, the poor performance for price {{and the need for}} up-to-date machine tool equipment. Stratton-Instone's dominance of distribution was removed and other outlets arranged. The interests in Singer and the Daimler Hire business were sold and Lanchester bought. The in-house bodywork department was closed and by the spring of 1931 car production ceased, only commercial vehicle production and aero engine work kept Daimler in business.|$|E

500|$|Each {{of the two}} bogies {{had three}} cylinders, with the driving wheels {{connected}} by chains enclosed in an oil-bath, based upon Bulleid's chain-driven valve gear on his Pacific locomotives. The valve gear used the unusual <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> arrangement that was also tested on the ex-LB H1 class Hartland Point in parallel {{with the construction of}} the first Leader locomotive. The Leader was the first steam locomotive to use a form of <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> since Cecil Paget's locomotive of 1908 and the concurrent testing of the principle on Hartland Point hints at the rushed nature of the locomotive's conception. The locomotive sat on the unusual Bulleid Firth Brown wheels, which were lighter, yet stronger, than the spoked equivalent.|$|E
2500|$|Although Ricardo did not {{invent the}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve,</b> in 1927, he {{produced}} a seminal research paper that outlined {{the advantages of the}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve,</b> and suggested that poppet valve engines {{would not be able to}} offer power outputs much beyond 1500hp (1,100kW). [...] A number of <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> aircraft engines were developed following this paper, notably by Napier, Bristol and Rolls-Royce. Bristol produced the Perseus, Hercules, Taurus and the Centaurus, Napier produced the Napier Sabre, and Rolls-Royce produced the Eagle and Crecy, all using sleeve valves.|$|E

5000|$|Features {{found in}} a Moline-Knight {{included}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> and a quiet engine. [...] Some drawbacks were its large oil consumption and its carburetor's sensitivity to altitude.|$|R
50|$|The Knight {{engine was}} an {{internal}} combustion engine, designed by American Charles Yale Knight (1868-1940), that used <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> {{instead of the}} more common poppet valve construction.|$|R

2500|$|Among {{his many}} other works, he {{improved}} the engines {{that were used}} in the first tanks, oversaw the research into the physics of internal combustion that led to the use of octane ratings, was instrumental in development of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engine design, and invented the Diesel [...] "Comet" [...] Swirl chamber that made high-speed diesel engines economically feasible.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of four stroke engines have poppet valves, although some aircraft engines have <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves.</b> Valves may {{be located in}} the cylinder block (side valves), or in the cylinder head (overhead valves). Modern engines are invariably of the latter design. There may be two, three, four or five valves per cylinder, with the intake valves outnumbering the exhaust valves in case of an odd number.|$|R
50|$|Typical parts made by {{this process}} are pipes, flywheels, {{cylinder}} liners {{and other parts}} that are axi-symmetric. It is notably used to cast cylinder liners and <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> for piston engines, parts {{which could not be}} reliably manufactured otherwise.|$|R
50|$|Percy Martin was {{particularly}} involved in two successful technical developments, {{the development and}} introduction in 1908 of <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> for Daimler's engines and, in 1930, their fluid flywheel fitted to all their vehicles in conjunction with Wilsons epicyclic gearboxes and a forerunner of automatic transmissions.|$|R
2500|$|In November 1912 the Daimler CC bus arrived. Features {{of the bus}} {{included}} a Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engine rated at 40 h.p. a silent chain type gearing system and a worm type gear box.

2500|$|The Rolls-Royce Eagle Mk XXII [...] was a British 24-cylinder, <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve,</b> H-block {{aero engine}} of 46 litre (2,807 cubic inches) displacement. It was {{designed}} and built in the early-1940s by Rolls-Royce Limited and first ran in 1944. It was liquid-cooled, of flat H configuration with two crankshafts and was capable of 3,200 horsepower (2,387 kW) at 18 psi boost.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark IV {{introduced}} {{the much more}} powerful 825hp (615kW) Bristol Perseus <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> radial engine enclosed in a NACA cowling which significantly improved performance, increasing maximum speed to 156mph (251km/h) and rate of climb to 840ft/min (4.3m/s). [...] However, in this version the Perseus had overheating problems, and this version was thus deemed unsuitable for tropical service with production limited to 18 aircraft all of which served with the home based squadrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{designers}} {{finally settled}} on an 'H' layout with two crankshafts and 'blade and fork' connecting rod attachments, the crankshafts being connected through the propeller speed reduction unit. The new engine followed {{the layout of}} the Napier Sabre and similarly used <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> but with a simplified drive system.|$|R
50|$|In July 1947 No. 2039 was {{experimentally}} rebuilt with <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> by Oliver Bulleid as {{a mobile}} test bed {{in preparation for}} his Leader class locomotives. It was never returned to its original state and {{in common with the}} remainder of the class had been withdrawn by 1951. None have survived.|$|R
50|$|The engine's origins lay in {{the wartime}} {{production}} of Bristol aero engines at the new Banner Lane shadow factory, operated by Standard in Coventry. From 1939 this factory produced Bristol Hercules engines, an air-cooled radial engine, with Bristol's typical <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves.</b> With peace in 1945, this huge factory then stood empty.|$|R
