The paper provides recommendations on improvement of <b>sand</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> properties and contains an analysis of possible variants for usage of complex-modified <b>sand</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> in the road construction.

The paper reveals only specific aspects of the efficient application of quartz sand in road asphalt concrete. The subject of the paper loоks rather interesting for regions {{where there are no}} rock deposits for obtaining broken-stone ballast but there is rather significant spreading of local quarts sand. Its successful application is connected with the necessity to develop special equipment for physical and chemical activation of sand grain surface that permits strongly to increase an adhesive strength in the area of phase separation within the “bitumen–SiO 2 ” system. The considered problem is a topical one and its solution will make it possible to local sand in a maximum way and partially to exclude application of broken stone in road construction. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{bottom of}} the salt pan (French oeillet) may be {{composed}} of clay lined pools, basalt, <b>sand,</b> <b>concrete,</b> or even tile. This keeps the salt from coming {{into contact with the}} silt beneath and becoming dirty.

The salt is raked toward the sides of the pan where it is then shoveled into a pile and left to dry slightly before storing. 90 to 165 pounds of sel gris can be harvested in one day, whereas for fleurs de sel the daily yield is only 4.5 to 6.6 pounds.|$|E

40|$|Manufactured sand {{differs from}} natural sea and river dredged sand in its {{physical}} and mineralogical properties. These {{can be both}} beneficial and detrimental to the fresh and hardened properties of concrete. This paper {{presents the results of}} a laboratory study in which manufactured sand produced in an industry sized crushing plant was characterised with respect to its physical and mineralogical properties. The influence of these characteristics on concrete workability and strength, when manufactured sand completely replaced natural sand in concrete, was investigated and modelled using artificial neural networks (ANN). The results show that the manufactured <b>sand</b> <b>concrete</b> made in this study generally requires a higher water/cement (w/c) ratio for workability equal to that of natural <b>sand</b> <b>concrete</b> due to the higher angularity of the manufactured sand particles. Water reducing admixtures can be used to compensate for this if the manufactured sand does not contain clay particles. At the same w/c ratio, the compressive and flexural strength of manufactured <b>sand</b> <b>concrete</b> exceeds that of natural <b>sand</b> <b>concrete.</b> ANN proved a valuable and reliable method of predicting concrete strength and workability based on the properties of the fine aggregate (FA) and the concrete mix composition...|$|E

30|$|The use {{of locally}} {{available}} materials {{as well as}} the use of industrial and agricultural waste in building industry has become a potential solution to the economic and environmental problems of particularly developing countries. Coarse aggregate is considered as the main ingredient to produce Portland cement concrete. However, the resources of this material are depleting in many countries or in specific regions, therefore finding a potential substitute for coarse aggregate is crucial. The use of sand (natural or crushed) as a substitute for coarse aggregate to produce <b>sand</b> <b>concrete</b> was investigated. This kind of concrete has strength comparable with conventional Portland cement concrete. By definition, <b>sand</b> <b>concrete</b> is therefore defined as a fine aggregate concrete, in which coarse aggregate is replaced by sand and fine aggregate is by filler material (Bederina et al. 2012; Bederina et al. 2007; Khay et al. 2010).
