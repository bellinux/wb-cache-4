25|$|The first road to use {{the idea}} was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, who {{rejected}} a Baldwin proposal in 1932–33 but then constructed the single Baltimore and Ohio Class N-1, #5600 George H. Emerson in the railroad's own shops without Baldwin's assistance. The locomotive was completed in May 1937 and managed to retain the same coupled wheelbase as the road's current 4-8-2s by having the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> reversed, mounted alongside the firebox, and driving {{the second set of}} coupled wheels forwards. This proved to be less than ideal, the size of the cylinders and firebox both being constrained by this location, the long steam passages proving problematic, and the cylinders suffering from the dust and heat of the nearby firebox.|$|E

50|$|Trojan {{also made}} another split-single engine {{later with the}} {{cylinders}} arranged in a 'V' formation.

50|$|The {{high-pressure}} cylinders were {{fitted with}} 10 in diameter piston valves {{and had a}} bore of 17+1/2 in, while the low-pressure cylinders were fitted with Richardson balanced slide valves and had a bore of 28 in. Both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> had a stroke of 26 in.|$|R
50|$|A 4-4-4-4 steam locomotive, in the Whyte {{notation}} {{for describing}} locomotive wheel arrangements, has a four-wheel leading truck, two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> four driving wheels, and a four-wheel trailing truck. While {{it would be}} possible to make an articulated locomotive of this arrangement, the only 4-4-4-4s ever built were duplex locomotives - with two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> driving two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> driven wheels in one rigid frame.|$|R
2500|$|Instead {{came the}} idea of having {{multiple}} groups of cylinders and driven wheels mounted in one rigid frame. A [...] "duplex" [...] version of a 4-8-4 would be a 4-4-4-4, with the eight driving wheels split into two groups of four, each with its own <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> and valve gear. The reciprocating mass of both sets would be substantially less than the single set on the 4-8-4, since they would be under less stress and gentler piston thrusts. The cylinders could be smaller yet have larger, more efficient valves. The most obvious tradeoff was that in Baldwin's proposed design, the rigid wheelbase was longer since the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> had to be between the two sets of drivers. This was sufficiently concerning for many roads, for whom current locomotives were taxing enough, to reject the duplex idea.|$|E
2500|$|Operationally, the {{locomotive}} didn't fare {{as well as}} was hoped due to its large cylinder size and small fire grate area (one fireman even commented disgustedly, [...] "All Hell couldn't keep steam up in that engine!").

50|$|Although {{considered}} the first Garratt locomotives, {{they did in}} fact differ in two important details from Herbert Garratt's original concept. First: they are compound locomotives, with two high-pressure cylinders on the rear engine, and a pipe leading to two larger low-pressure cylinders on the front engine; second: both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> were placed facing each other inside their engine units, rather than facing out as in all other Garratts.

50|$|Steam under {{pressure}} is converted into mechanical energy more efficiently {{if it is}} used in a compound engine; in such an engine steam from a boiler is used in high-pressure (HP) cylinders and then under reduced pressure in a second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The lower-pressure steam occupies a larger volume and the low-pressure (LP) cylinders are larger than the high-pressure cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept was}} further {{developed}} in the early 1930s in the United States by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, with their duplex locomotives which divided the drive between two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> outside <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{locomotive}} {{built with}} this arrangement was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's sole class N-1 #5600 George H. Emerson, constructed at the B&O's own Mount Clare Shops in May 1937. To reduce the fixed wheelbase, this locomotive had the two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> at opposite ends, {{so that the}} rear pair were beside the firebox. This {{proved to be a}} poor design, as it restricted the firebox size and exposed the cylinders to dust and dirt, causing premature wear.

50|$|Although they {{appeared}} to have exceedingly long boilers, the barrel {{in front of the}} rear <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> actually contained first a primitive firetube superheater for further heating the steam before use; the steam was carried forward from the boiler proper by outside steam pipes as shown in the photograph.

25|$|More-powerful {{locomotives}} {{tend to be}} longer, {{but long}} rigid-framed designs are impractical for the tight curves frequently found on narrow-gauge railways. Various designs for articulated locomotives were developed to overcome this problem. The Mallet and the Garratt were the two most popular, both using a single boiler and two engines (<b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> and driving wheels). The Garratt has two power bogies, whereas the Mallet has one. There were also {{a few examples of}} triplex locomotives that had a third engine under the tender. Both the front and tender engines were low-pressure compounded, though they could be operated simple (high-pressure) for starting off. Other less common variations included the Fairlie locomotive, which had two boilers back-to-back on a common frame, with two separate power bogies.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were renovated and remotorised with Kolomna 12 D 49 M engines, {{and other}} more minor improvements: A replacement engine for the 232 series was sought because {{the engine was}} reaching its wear limit. Different new engines were tested: a Caterpillar engine, a MaK engine and the Russian 5D49. For cost reasons and because the Russian engine could be used with the fewest modifications the 5D49 was selected. However, the Russian producer proved no longer capable of supplying this engine, as a result an engine largely similar to the 5D49 but with only twelve cylinders was supplied. This engine can have <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> turned off to save fuel at low workloads. By 2003, 65 locomotives had been rebuilt.|$|R

On 8 October 1952, after only two months in service, it was the train engine of the double-headed Liverpool and Manchester express involved in the Harrow and Wealdstone railway accident.

50|$|Probably the {{greatest}} {{advantage of the}} Garratt was the fact that, with its boiler and grate area suspended between two engine units without the need to leave room for coupled wheels and cylinders, wide and deep fireboxes with large grate areas and large diameter boilers were possible. On a Garratt, the boiler could literally be dimensioned up to the full {{cross section of the}} loading gauge. With each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> and coupled wheels constituting a separate engine, the end result was two locomotives in one, with one huge shared boiler which needed only one crew. A Garratt is therefore a single locomotive with double the tractive effort and, with its weight distributed over a long and flexible multi-axle wheelbase, a lower axle loading.|$|E
