5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschool’s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle and treating sex and romance as <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> feminine point of view, {{with the use}} of reverse sexism and tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Some of their songs deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, {{whether that is}} specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E

5|$|Del Toro {{spent a year}} {{working with}} Beacham on the screenplay, and is {{credited}} as co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished {{to see in the}} genre, such as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> child's perspective. The script also received an uncredited rewrite from Neil Cross, who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series Luther and wrote the del Toro-produced horror film Mama. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script Monstropolis caught the filmmaker's attention. Drew Pearce also carried out uncredited work on the script.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E
5|$|Majin Tensei is {{a series}} of {{strategy}} video games published by Atlus. It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei franchise, and began with 1994's Majin Tensei. Since then, four further titles have been released: Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis (1995), Ronde (1997), Majin Tensei: Blind Thinker (2007) and Majin Tensei: Blind Thinker II (2008). The player navigates a field <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> top-down or three-quarters perspective as a human character, and battles demons; they can also recruit demons, and fuse multiple allied demons to create new, stronger demons.|$|E

5|$|The game is <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{top-down}} perspective, {{and focuses}} on sword combat. The player moves the hero through the game world, which is divided into several areas; as the player enters one, enemy characters start to appear there. Among the areas in the game world, there are dungeons that the player needs to get through. These usually consist {{of a number of}} rooms divided across three to four floors; in order to navigate their way through a dungeon, the player needs to break walls, unlock doors, and sometimes press down buttons and break pots.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Tiruvannamalai {{revolves}} around the Annamalaiyar Temple. The recorded history of the town {{dates back to the}} ninth century, as <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Chola inscriptions in the temple. Further inscriptions made before ninth century indicate the rule of Pallava kings, whose capital was Kanchipuram. The seventh century Nayanar saints Sambandar and Appar wrote of the temple in their poetic work, Tevaram. Sekkizhar, the author of the Periyapuranam records both Appar and Sambandar worshiped Annamalaiyar in the temple. The Chola Kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries, from 850 to 1280, and were temple patrons. The inscriptions from the Chola king record various gifts like land, sheep, cow and oil to the temple commemorating various victories of the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a young hero who, {{together}} with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on combat with monsters or other enemies, and is <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies.|$|E

5|$|When Krrish {{enters the}} compound, {{there is a}} vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish {{eventually}} defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However Vikram gets {{shot in the head}} by Siddhant. In the final scene, Krrish wounds Siddhant fatally. Before he dies, Siddhant asks Krrish who he is, and Krishna reveals himself. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to call Jadoo, whose spaceship can be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance.|$|E
5|$|While Drive {{is set in}} {{the present}} day, it carries a heavy 1980s {{atmosphere}} that is cautiously set from beginning to end and is underlined not only by the vehicles or music and clothes, but also by its architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often leaving out more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it is because they are being <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E

5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Goffman {{became a}} faculty member in the {{sociology}} department at the University of California, Berkeley, first as a visiting professor, then from 1962 as a full professor. In 1968 {{he moved to the}} University of Pennsylvania, receiving the Benjamin Franklin Chair in Sociology and Anthropology, due largely to the efforts of Dell Hymes, a former colleague at Berkeley. In 1969 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1970 Goffman became a cofounder of the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization and coauthored its Platform Statement. In 1971 he published Relations in Public, in which he tied together many of his ideas about everyday life, <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sociological perspective. Another major book of his, Frame Analysis, came out in 1974. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1977–78. In 1979, Goffman received the Cooley-Mead Award for Distinguished Scholarship, from the Section on Social Psychology of the American Sociological Association. He was elected the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association, serving in 1981–82; he was, however, unable to deliver the presidential address in person due to progressing illness.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Christian viewpoint.|$|E
