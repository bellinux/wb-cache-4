5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the effects of substantial spark retard on engine combustion, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, feed gas enthalpy, and catalyst light-off. Engine experiments were conducted at cold engine conditions for various ignition timings and air/ fuel ratios. Chemical and thermal energy of the exhaust gas was tracked from cylinder-exit to the catalytic converter inlet using a variety of experimental techniques. Time-resolved exhaust port and exhaust runner hydrocarbon concentrations were converted to an exhaust HC mass flow rate and compared to time-averaged downstream HC levels. Quenching experiments quantified cylinder-exit HC emissions by rapidly cooling exhaust gas at the valve seats, effectively freezing HC oxidation reactions. Combustion stability was observed to decrease as the phasing of the 50 % mass fraction burned location occurred later in the expansion stroke. A thermodynamic burn rate analysis indicated combustion was complete by exhaust valve opening with <b>spark</b> <b>timings</b> as late as 200 after top-dead-center (ATDC). Engine operation with a relative air/fuel ratio 10 % lean of stoichiometric resulted in the lowest observed tailpipe-out HC emissions. Retarded <b>spark</b> <b>timings</b> increased exhaust system oxidation, with port HC oxidation ranging from 15 % to 37 % with additional HC reductions (40 - 50 %) in the runner for ATDC <b>spark</b> <b>timings.</b> Catalyst light-off times were reduced by 5 seconds and cumulative catalytic converter-in HC emissions were reduced by 44 % prior to light-off. A phenomenological model of exhaust system oxidation was developed to provide insight into HC burn-up with late combustion phasing. (cont.) A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was coupled with an exhaust flow model and exhaust thermal model. The hydrocarbon tracking and exhaust gas quenching experiments provided initial conditions for a reacting plug flow model. The predicted exhaust HC reaction rates were found to be strongly coupled with exhaust gas temperature and the hydrocarbon species used to represent unburned fuel. The analysis showed that most of the oxidation occurred early in the exhaust period when gas temperatures exceeded 1300 K. by Brian E. Hallgren. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Currently, {{bioethanol}} {{leads the}} automotive fuel market {{as the main}} substitute for gasoline in spark-ignition engines. However, worldwide interest has been triggered in the potential of 2, 5 -dimethylfuran, known as DMF, since the discovery of improved production methods. Although the energy content of DMF is {{comparable to that of}} gasoline, little is known about its combustion characteristics and emissions. Therefore, this work examines the effect of DMF in a single cylinder direct-injection spark-ignition engine. The results are compared to ethanol and gasoline using the optimized <b>spark</b> <b>timings</b> for gasoline and the respective fuel. In summary, DMF produces competitive combustion and emissions qualities to gasoline, which, in some cases surpass ethanol. The two biofuels have a higher burning rate and lower initial combustion duration than gasoline. They also produce greater combustion efficiency, which helps to lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. These initial results highlight how DMF, which was originally only considered as an octane improver, has the potential to become a competitive renewable gasoline alternative. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Impact of biofuel (2 -methlyfuran, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran and ethanol) on the {{performance}} of a gasoline direct injection engine has been investigated. MF demonstrates better knock resistance properties and faster burning rates compared to those of gasoline. MF has much lower fuel consumptions than ethanol, produces much lower hydrocarbon (HC) and PM emissions than those of gasoline. However NOx emissions from MF are significantly higher than those of gasoline when fuel-optimized <b>spark</b> <b>timings</b> are used, which can be addressed by either retarding ignition timing or using exhaust gas recirculation. MF produce much lower aldehyde emissions compared with gasoline, methanol and ethanol. The majority of HC emissions are unburned fuel. Toluene and benzene are detected in the exhaust however their concentrations are relatively low. Under rich combustion and later injection operating conditions, soot only accounts for a small fraction (< 30 %) of PM. Soot produced from the combustion of DMF and ethanol is more easily oxidized than gasoline soot due to their unique capsule type oxidation mode, smaller primary and agglomerated particles. PM emissions vary significantly to fuel and injection system.

40|$|Engine knock {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{limiting}} factors for modern Spark-Ignition (SI) engines to achieve high efficiency targets. The stochastic nature of knock in SI units hinders the predictive capability of RANS knock models, which are based on ensemble averaged quantities. To this aim, a knock model grounded in statistics was recently developed in the RANS formalism. The model is able to infer a presumed log-normal distribution of knocking cycles from a single RANS simulation by means of transport equations for variances and turbulence-derived probability density functions (PDFs) for physical quantities. As a main advantage, the model is able to estimate the earliest knock severity experienced when moving the operating condition into the knocking regime.

40|$|International audienceUsing 15 LES {{cycles of}} a high load / low speed spark {{ignition}} engine operating point, two different fresh gases autoignition regimes called knock and super-knock are analyzed. A direct " a posteriori " analysis of pressure waves and autoignition heat release observed in LES is proposed. It reveals that low to moderate knock intensity, corresponding to late <b>spark</b> <b>timings</b> (ST) is characterized by one or several random autoignition (AI) spots which consume the surrounding fresh gases without coupling with the AI heat release. On the contrary, the highest knock intensities correspond to what is usually called super-knock, a very intense knock observed under pre-ignition conditions or for very early ST, as done in this study. LES shows that the pressure waves generated by one {{or a couple of}} AI spots are strong enough to induce locally a strong fresh gases temperature increase leading itself to a substantial decrease of the AI delay. This allows to generate a coupling between the pressure wave and the AI reaction rate which reinforce each other, leading to maximum pressures and propagation speeds close to those of a detonation. These results therefore strongly support the hypothesis proposed in the literature that super-knock is characterized by a deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). An " a priori " analysis is also performed thanks to the use of a local detonation indicator based on Bradley's DDT diagram. It is shown that this tool not only predict...|$|R

However, thermodynamic conditions encountered in these engines promote the occurrence of abnormal combustions like knock or super-knock, which are experimentally difficult to analyse due to the risks of engine damages. The Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) method mainly used in industry for piston engines is not the most appropriate as knock does not always affect the mean cyclecaptured by RANS. Using an accurate LES compressible code and improved versions of ECFM-LES (Extended Coherent Flame Model) and TKI (Tabulated Kinetics of Ignition) models allowing a full uncoupling of flame propagation and auto-ignition reaction rates, this work demonstrates {{for the first time that}} LES is able to describe quantitatively knocking combustion in a realistic SI engine configuration.
