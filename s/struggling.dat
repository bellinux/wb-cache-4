5000|$|In the Manifesto Against Labour, Krisis argues {{against the}} {{traditional}} Marxist notion of class <b>struggle</b> as the motor of history. According to Krisis, {{there is no}} class-subject. The <b>struggle</b> between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is not a <b>struggle</b> between a revolutionary class and its oppressor, but rather a <b>struggle</b> between two opposed interests that are integral to capitalism and form a single [...] "labor camp". Contrary to traditional Marxism, then, Krisis asserts that the <b>struggle</b> against capitalism is not the <b>struggle</b> for the liberation of labor, but rather a <b>struggle</b> for liberation from labor.|$|R

In 1990, Jack Mara's son, Tim, who was <b>struggling</b> with cancer at the time, sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{focus on}} the characters? <b>struggle</b> against fate in Thomas Hardy?s Wessex Tales.

They <b>struggle</b> against fate because they cannot accept and {{surrender}} to their fate. I decide discuss the ways the main characters <b>struggle</b> against their fate as my topic. I {{need to use the}} literary approach and employ the literary theory especially the theory of conflict as the main tool to analyze the situations that show the characters? <b>struggle</b> against fate. In addition, I also use the theory of characterization to analyze the characters? thinking or action as their <b>struggles</b> when they fight against fate. Finally, as my finding, I see the four main characters <b>struggle</b> against fate but they cannot fight against fate. The important point is not the result of their <b>struggle</b> but their <b>struggles</b> and willingness to fight against fate. When they <b>struggle</b> against fate, they prove that {{they do not want to}} surrender to their fate...|$|R

The study empirically tests correlates of spiritual <b>struggle</b> and outcomes of resolution of <b>struggle</b> over time {{in response to a}} writing paradigm (versus a control condition). Spiritual <b>struggle</b> was assessed with multiple measures to capture the multidimensionality of this construct. At baseline, participants were asked to identify an open, negative event, respond to questionnaires, and write over three days. At the first follow-up resolution of <b>struggle</b> and event-related closure were assessed. At the final follow-up, extent of resilient response to a subsequent stressor was assessed in terms of distress response, use of positive coping methods, meaning violations, and spiritual <b>struggle.</b> Additional general, non-event-specific outcomes were measured as well. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess changes in spiritual <b>struggle</b> and outcomes, and structural equation modeling of latent growth curves was used to analyze the trajectory of <b>struggle</b> and the relationships between resolution and outcomes. Results indicated that measures of <b>struggle,</b> except quest, were cross-sectionally associated with negative outcomes, particularly at follow-ups. Spiritual <b>struggle</b> decreased over time and closure increased for both the <b>struggle</b> intervention and control groups. Finally, resolved spiritual <b>struggle,</b> although largely unrelated to outcomes, predicted some aspects of resilient response to a subsequent stressor and greater meaning in life...|$|R
