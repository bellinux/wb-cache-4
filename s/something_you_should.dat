After Christiansen's death family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.|$|E

Daily Beast writer Tracy Quan {{described}} The Alyona Show as [...] "one of RT's most popular vehicles". The New Republic columnist Jesse Zwick wrote that one journalist {{told him that}} Minkovski is [...] "probably the best interviewer on cable news." [...] Benjamin R. Freed wrote in the avant-garde culture magazine SOMA that [...] "The Alyona Show does political talk with razor-sharp wit." [...] David Weigel called the show [...] "an in-house attempt at a newsy cult hit" [...] and noted that [...] "her meatiest segments were about government spying, and the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars". Minkovski had complained about being characterized {{as if she was}} [...] "Putin's girl in Washington" [...] or as being [...] "anti-American". After Minkovski argued that Glenn Beck was [...] "not on the side of America. And the fact that my channel is more honest with the American people is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be ashamed of.", Columbia Journalism Review writer Julia Ioffe asked [...] "since when does Russia Today defend the policies of any American president?

30|$|The {{richness}} of the Futures Map is the special target {{of the first and}} the third criteria of the pragmatic external validity. Using the concept of Ackoff [1], their main function is to avoid the omission error. The omission error is one formulation of the so-called third kind of error in the statistical inference. In the statistical inference, you make the acceptance error if <b>you</b> accept <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> reject (the type I error). The type II error is the rejection error. You do not accept <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> accept. In the Futures Map frame, you make the type I or II error if you wrongly either add or reject to add a hypothetical scenario path to the futures map. Using the metaphor of the geographical map, your Futures Map has a type I error if it includes a path that in practice is not available. It has a type II error if your Futures Map does not describe a hypothetical path that is available in the futures landscape.|$|R

5000|$|The A.V.

The episode takes the most predictable stance on its premise--eating the flag is not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be arrested for--and then doesn’t offer much variation outside {{of a series of}} escalating incidents. That makes for a diverting half hour that occasionally stabs at legitimate criticism, but one that’s ultimately more forgettable than its various absurdities would suggest." ...|$|E

The city of Waghdas is in the grip of a cholera epidemic, which turns out to be a virus that is sexual in origin". Morgan notes that while this disease is similar to AIDS, the novel was written when AIDS was unheard of. Morgan concludes that Cities of the Red Night is, [...] "certainly the most compelling and inventive of Burroughs' books since Naked Lunch." ...|$|E

The three {{remaining}} members set themselves the challenge of pursuing a sound different from that of their previous albums and thus produced the album Blue Night, which almost went platinum in Denmark and sold well in Asia, with sales over one million. The following year a biography of MLTR, <b>Something</b> <b>You</b> <b>Should</b> Know written by Poul Martin-Bonde, was published along with a few previously unreleased recordings. The English translation of the book was called It Never Rains on Bali, a reference to an incident that took place during the band's 1995 Bali concert, where a no-rain forecast proved wrong and the unexpected rain stopped the concert.|$|E

2500|$|The twenty-sixth episode, [...] "Going Too Far", never {{aired in}} Excel Sagas {{original}} run on TV Tokyo {{because it was}} purposefully too violent, obscene, and exactly one minute too long for broadcast in Japan. One network that did broadcast this episode, however, was Animax in Latin America. The opening sequence is altered to contain pixelated nudity and more blood, and the closing presents the translator on fours, wearing a collar, and singing the [...] "Bolero", as Menchi translates into her own language. The episode itself, in addition to much more violence, blood, and gore, includes situations containing nudity, lesbianism, apparent paedophilia, soaplands, and a love hotel—in several instances involving minors. The episode obliquely refers to the 1995 sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway by including sarin attacks {{as a method of}} exterminating enemies. The director himself remarks that it [...] "felt good to go past the limits of a TV series", although he thinks it [...] "is not <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do too often".|$|R
