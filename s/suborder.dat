5|$|As of 2012, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 78 species in the Sclerodermatineae. The type of the <b>suborder</b> is the family Sclerodermataceae; other families in the <b>suborder</b> are the Boletinellaceae, Diplocystaceae, and the Gyroporaceae.|$|E
5|$|Cymothoida – Chiefly marine isopods {{with over}} 2,700 species. Members are mostly {{carnivorous}} or parasitic. Includes the family Gnathiidae, the juveniles {{of which are}} parasitic on fishes. The previously recognised <b>suborder</b> Epicaridea is included as two superfamilies within this <b>suborder</b> and Cymothoida now includes part of the formerly recognised <b>suborder</b> Flabellifera.|$|E
5|$|English {{comparative}} anatomist William Henry Flower created the <b>suborder</b> Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were grouped under English biologist St. George Jackson Mivart's <b>suborder</b> Anthropoidea (=Simiiformes). According to Flower, the <b>suborder</b> Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's <b>suborder</b> Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the <b>suborder</b> Strepsirrhini, {{in which he}} included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared {{the structure of the}} nose and reinstated the use of the <b>suborder</b> Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new <b>suborder,</b> Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.|$|E

50|$|The soil <b>suborders</b> {{within an}} order are {{differentiated}} {{on the basis}} of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven <b>suborders</b> are recognized in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, some texts group rodents {{into three}} <b>suborders</b> {{on the basis}} of the shape of the infraorbital canal. According to this {{taxonomy}} the rodents are divided into the <b>suborders</b> Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha, and Myomorpha.|$|R
5|$|Sphaeromatidea – Benthic isopods {{mostly from}} the {{southern}} hemisphere with respiratory pleopods inside a branchial chamber. This <b>suborder</b> now includes part of the formerly recognised <b>suborder</b> Flabellifera.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies (<b>suborder</b> Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (<b>suborder</b> Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E
5|$|<b>Suborder</b> Polystilifera. Includes about 100 pelagic and 50 benthic species. Their pads bear many tiny stylets.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 the Ptreridophyte Phylogeny Group {{placed it}} as the sole family in the Saccolomatineae, one of six <b>suborders</b> making up the Polypodiales order. These <b>suborders</b> are phylogenetically related as shown in this cladogram: ...|$|R
50|$|Sucking lice (Anoplura, {{formerly}} known as Siphunculata) have around 500 species and represent the smaller of the two traditional <b>suborders</b> of lice. As opposed to the paraphyletic chewing lice, which are now divided among three <b>suborders,</b> the sucking lice are monophyletic.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, {{only two}} <b>suborders</b> in Diprotodontia were noted: Vombatiformes which {{encompassed}} the wombats and koala and Phalangerida which contained all other families. Kirsch et al. (1997) split the families into three <b>suborders.</b> In addition, the six Phalangeriformes families are {{split into two}} superfamilies.|$|R
5|$|Thrips lay {{extremely}} small eggs, about 0.2mm long. Females of the <b>suborder</b> Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their ovipositor, and insert their eggs, one per slit. Females of the <b>suborder</b> Tubulifera {{lay their eggs}} singly or in small groups on the outside surfaces of plants.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauridae is {{a family}} in rank-based Linnaean taxonomy, within the {{superfamily}} Tyrannosauroidea and the <b>suborder</b> Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Anura {{is divided}} into three suborders that are broadly {{accepted}} by the scientific community, but the relationships between some families remain unclear. Future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships. The <b>suborder</b> Archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs. These are Ascaphidae, Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae and Leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages. The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced <b>suborder</b> Mesobatrachia are the fossorial Megophryidae, Pelobatidae, Pelodytidae, Scaphiopodidae and Rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic Pipidae. These have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders. Neobatrachia is by far the largest <b>suborder</b> and includes the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species. Ninety-six percent of the over 5,000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians.|$|E

50|$|In the {{classification}} used here, the order Osmeriformes contains two <b>suborders,</b> six families, some 20 genera, and about 93 species. Other authors choose {{a slightly different}} arrangement, but whether treated as <b>suborders</b> (Galaxoidei and Osmeroidei) or superfamilies (Galaxoidea and Osmeroidea), the division in two lineages is generally maintained.|$|R
5|$|Asellota – The <b>suborder</b> {{containing}} {{the majority of}} freshwater isopod species, found in both surface and subterranean waters, along with some deepwater marine species.|$|E
5|$|Calabozoida – A small <b>suborder</b> {{consisting}} of two marine species in the family Calabozoidae and one freshwater species in the family Brasileirinidae which is found in subterranean locations.|$|E
5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a <b>suborder</b> within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of <b>suborder,</b> though some have reduced {{to the level of}} infraorder.|$|E

50|$|The {{families}} are classified over <b>suborders</b> and superfamilies as below.|$|R
5|$|Isopods first {{appeared}} in the fossil record during the Carboniferous period of the Paleozoic some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the <b>suborder</b> Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread <b>suborder</b> form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include Asellota, Microcerberidea, Calabozoidea and the terrestrial Oniscidea.|$|E
5|$|Phoratopidea – A single marine species, Phoratopus remex, which {{warrants}} its own <b>suborder</b> {{because of}} its unique characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Phreatoicidea – Small <b>suborder</b> of {{freshwater}} isopods resembling amphipods, limited to South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|<b>Suborder</b> Monostilifera. Includes 500 {{species with}} a single central stylet. Some use the stylet for {{locomotion}} {{as well as for}} capturing prey.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians {{and the other}} prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the <b>suborder</b> Haplorhini with the simians or in the <b>suborder</b> Prosimii with the strepsirrhines. Prosimii {{is one of the}} two traditional primate suborders and is based on evolutionary grades (groups united by anatomical traits) rather than phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships. Yet both systems persist because the Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the research literature and textbooks.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting {{belongs to}} the genus Sillago, a {{division}} of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae containing 29 individual species. The Sillaginidae are in the <b>suborder</b> Percoidei, {{a division of the}} Perciformes.|$|E
50|$|Classification is controversial. As {{traditionally}} defined {{before the}} introduction of cladistics, the Perciformes are almost certainly paraphyletic. Other orders that should possibly be included as <b>suborders</b> are the Scorpaeniformes, Tetraodontiformes, and Pleuronectiformes.Of the presently recognized <b>suborders,</b> several may be paraphyletic, as well. These are grouped by suborder/superfamily, generally following the text Fishes of the World.|$|R
50|$|Thyreophorans include various subgroups, {{including}} the <b>suborders</b> Ankylosauria and Stegosauria. In both the <b>suborders,</b> the forelimbs were much {{shorter than the}} hindlimbs, particularly in stegosaurs. The clade {{has been defined as}} the group consisting of all species more closely related to Ankylosaurus than to Triceratops. Thyreophora is the sister group of Cerapoda within Genasauria.|$|R
50|$|Athyris, Composita, and Meristella are {{representative}} genera. Three <b>suborders</b> have been defined.|$|R
