5|$|The first fish {{descriptions}} from Puerto Rico {{were compiled}} by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, {{there are over}} 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food, mosquito control, and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass. Accidental introductions, such as the <b>sailfin</b> armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed {{to the release of}} aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including largemouth bass, peacock bass, and channel catfish, and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers.|$|E
25|$|ASR may be {{performed}} more often {{when the need}} for oxygen is higher. In the <b>sailfin</b> molly, gestating females (this species is a livebearer) spend about 50% {{of their time in}} ASR as compared to only 15% in non-gestating females under the same low levels of oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Arctoscopus japonicus, the <b>sailfin</b> sandfish or Japanese sandfish, is {{a species}} of fish of the Perciformes (Perch-likes) order, Trichodontidae (sandfishes) family. Known in Japan as , it is a commercially {{important}} fish especially for Akita and Yamagata prefectures. Its habitat occurs in sandy-mud bottoms ranging from the Sea of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea.|$|E
25|$|In the Malili Lakes of Sulawesi, Indonesia, {{one species}} of <b>sailfin</b> {{silverside}} (Telmatherina sarasinorum) is an egg predator. They often follow courting pairs of the {{closely related species}} T. antoniae. When those pairs lay eggs, T. sarasinorum darts in and eats the eggs. On four different occasions in the field (out of 136 observation bouts in total), a male T. sarasinorum who was following a pair of courting T. antoniae eventually chased off the male T. antoniae and took his place, courting the heterospecific female. That female released eggs, {{at which point the}} male darted to the eggs and ate them.|$|E

The fish are usually small, between about , {{although}} some caught are up to [...] The aquatic prey is mostly caught by diving into {{the water from the}} air, although flying fish, the preferred fish of this species, are sometimes caught while in the air. Fish species eaten include Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema libertate), sharpchin flyingfish (Fodiator acutus), flyingfish of the genus Hirundichthys, <b>sailfin</b> flyingfish (Parexocoetus brachypterus), ornamented flying fish (Cypselurus callopterus), bigwing halfbeak (Oxyporhamphus micropterus), longfin halfbeak (Hemiramphus saltator), tropical two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus volitans), redlip blenny (Ophioblennius atlanticus), squirrelfish (Holocentrus adscensionis), mackerel scad (Decapterus macarellus), shortjaw leatherjacket (Oligoplites refulgens), and mackerels (Scomber spp.). Squid eaten include the glass squid (Hyaloteuthis pelagica).|$|E
