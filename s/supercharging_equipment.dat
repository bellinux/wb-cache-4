40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preliminary tests made on the effects of supercharging an air-cooled engine under airplane flight conditions. Service training airplanes were used in the investigation equipped with production types of Wright J engines. A N. A. C. A. Roots type supercharger was driven {{from the rear of the}} engine. In addition to measuring those quantities that would enable the determination of the climb performance, measurements were made of the cylinder-head temperatures and the carburetor pressures and temperatures. The <b>supercharging</b> <b>equipment</b> was not removed from the airplane when making flights without supercharging, but a by-pass valve, which controlled the amount of supercharging by returning to the atmosphere the surplus air delivered by the supercharger, was left full open. With the supercharger so geared that ground-level pressure could be maintained to 18, 500 feet, it was found that the absolute ceiling was increased from 19, 400 to 32, 600 feet, that the time to climb to 16, 00 feet was decreased from 32 to 16 minutes, and that this amount of supercharging apparently did not injure the engine.

5000|$|In 1986 (1988 for the US market), Toyota {{introduced}} a supercharged engine for the MR2. Based {{on the same}} block and head, the 4A-GZE was equipped with a small Roots-type supercharger and a Denso intercooler. T-VIS was eliminated and the compression ratio was lowered to 8:1. It produced [...] and 140 lbft Nm and accelerated the small car from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.5 to 7.0s. The supercharger was belt-driven but actuated by an electromagnetic clutch, {{so that it would}} not be driven except when needed, increasing fuel economy. Curb weight increased to as much as 2494 lb for supercharged models, due to the weight of the <b>supercharger</b> <b>equipment</b> and a new, stronger transmission. A fuel selector switch was also added in some markets, to allow the car to run on regular unleaded if required to. In addition to the new engine, the MR2 SC was also equipped with stiffer springs, and received special [...] "tear-drop" [...] aluminium wheels. The engine cover had two raised vents (only one of which was functional) that visually distinguished it from the naturally aspirated models. It was also labeled [...] "Supercharged" [...] on the rear trunk and body mouldings behind both doors. This model was never offered in European or Australian markets, although some cars were privately imported.|$|R
5000|$|A {{range of}} {{advanced}} versions were also {{developed during the}} lengthy teething period. The 213B was designed to run on 100 octane [...] "C3" [...] fuel, allowing the boost pressure to be increased and the take-off power improved to 2,000 PS. The 213C was essentially an A model with re-arranged secondary <b>equipment</b> (<b>supercharger,</b> oil pump, etc.) to allow a Motorkanone cannon to fire through the propeller shaft. The 213D added a new three-speed supercharger for smoother power curves and improved altitude performance, {{but it was not}} produced.|$|R
5000|$|The first gasoline-burning {{aviation}} {{power plants}} that the Junkers Motorenwerke ever built, the L1 and L2 single overhead camshaft (SOHC) liquid-cooled inline-six aviation engines {{of the early}} and mid-1920s. Development of this line led up through the L8. All of these were developments of the BMW IIIa inline-six SOHC German World War I aviation engine, which BMW allowed as {{they were no longer}} interested in development of their WWI designs. The Junkers L55 engine, however, was the very first V12 layout aviation powerplant of any type created by the Junkers firm, using a pair of the earlier straight-six L5 engines as a basis for an [...] "upright" [...] liquid-cooled V12 aviation engine, as the contemporary BMW VI engine already was. Development of the Jumo 210 itself started in 1931 under the designation L10. The L10 was Germany's first truly modern engine design, featuring three valves per cylinder, an inverted-V layout, a <b>supercharger</b> as standard <b>equipment,</b> and a cast cylinder block. The 210 was odd in that the cylinders were machined into a block along with one side of the crankcase, two such parts being bolted together side-by-side to form the engine. Normal construction techniques used three parts, two cylinder blocks and a separate crankcase.|$|R
