40|$|While the {{critical}} dimension in the microelectronics industry is continually going down due to developments in photolithography, {{it is coming}} {{at the expense of}} exponential increase in lithography tool costs and rising photomask costs. Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (<b>S-FIL)</b> is a nano-patterning technique that results in significantly lower cost of the lithography tool and process consumables. In this study, a comparison of <b>S-FIL</b> with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography technique is provided at the 50 nm node. Advantages and disadvantages of <b>S-FIL</b> for various application sectors are provided. Finally, cost of ownership (CoO) computations of <b>S-FIL</b> versus EUV is provided. CoO computations indicate that <b>S-FIL</b> may be the cost-effective technology in the sub- 100 nm domain, particularly for emerging devices that are required in low volumes...|$|E
40|$|Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (<b>S-FIL)</b> is one {{of several}} new methods of imprint {{lithography}} being actively developed. As with other nanoimprint methods, <b>S-FIL</b> resolution appears to be limited only by template resolution, and offers a significant cost of ownership reduction when compared to other NGL methods such as EUVL and 157 nm lithography. Market segments capable of being addressed with <b>S-FIL</b> technology include nanodevice fabrication, compound semiconductors, photonic and optical devices, data storage, and advanced packaging. Successful implementation will require a commercial supplier of <b>S-FIL</b> tools, as well as an infrastructure that will support fabrication of the necessary 1 X templates. The Imprio 100, manufactured by Molecular Imprints, Inc. is the first commercially available <b>S-FIL</b> tool. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the performance and capabilities of the Imprio 100. Performance related to several tool parameters including layer-to-layer overlay, pre-aligner precision, residual layer thickness and uniformity, resolution, wafer throughput, and exposure lamp intensity uniformity was evaluated. Several spin-coatable organic materials were evaluated for their efficacy as transfer layers. Contact angle analysis of each material along with a comparison of the spread time and resulting residual layer, and overall resolution using each material was also done. This paper will present the results of both the factory and site acceptance tests, and will also cover the imprinting capability of the tool...|$|E
40|$|A cost {{effective}} methodology for pattering of Nano Imprint Lithography (NIL) templates incorporating different length scale features is proposed. The approach relies on selecting the optimum processing window of different technologies for {{cost effective}} micro- and nano-patterning. Very promising results were obtained when first fused silica templates were structured by F 2 laser ablation at 157 nm. It was demonstrated that nano-scale features and complex 3 D micro-scale features could be machined with a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) over the existing topography produced by laser ablation. Thus, {{a large area}} (up to several square centimeters) of the NIL templates is easily patterned with micro- and even meso-scale features by laser ablation while nano- and micro-scale features could be introduced locally by FIB machining. Through <b>S-FIL</b> process such templates were validated and the nano- and micro-structures were accurately replicated in one imprinting step...|$|E
40|$|We report {{fabrication}} of single crystalline silicon nanowire based-three-dimensional MIS nano-capacitors for potential analog and mixed signal applications. The array of nanowires is patterned by Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (<b>S-FIL).</b> Deep silicon etching (DSE) {{is used to}} form the nanowires with high aspect ratio, increase the electrode area and thus significantly enhance the capacitance. High-! dielectric is deposited by highly conformal atomic layer deposition (ALD) Al 2 O 3 over the Si nanowires, and sputtered metal TaN serves as the electrode. Electrical measurements of fabricated capacitors show the expected increase of capacitance with greater nanowire height and decreasing dielectric thickness, consistent with calculations. Leakage current and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) are also measured and compared with planar MIS capacitors. In view of greater interest in 3 D transistor architectures, such as FinFETs, 3 D high density MIS capacitors offer an attractive device technology for analog and mixed signal applications. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
