40|$|Changes in spatial {{distribution}} in several fish {{species have been}} related to recent increase in global temperature. In the North Sea, both a poleward shift and a shift to deeper water have been observed. Here, we study the underlying mechanism of these shifts in a comparative study {{of the changes in}} distribution of two boreal flatfish species (plaice Pleuronectes platessa and dab Limanda limanda) and three Lusitanian flatfish <b>species</b> (<b>sole</b> Solea solea, solenette Buglossidium luteum, and scaldfish Arnoglossus laterna) as recorded in annual bottom trawl surveys carried out in the North Sea in late summer since 1985. The distribution is analysed in relation to the bottom temperature {{at the time of the}} survey as well as to the seasonal maximum bottom temperature earlier in the year. It is shown that the boreal species plaice and dab moved to deeper water and maintained the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced in earlier periods, while the Lusitanian <b>species</b> <b>sole,</b> solenette, and scaldfish experienced an increase in the seasonal maximum temperature that they experienced while maintaining their depth distribution. This overall response varied between length classes, reflecting a preference for higher temperature of the smaller length classes. The results lend support to the hypothesis that the fish displayed a direct response to the maximum temperature that occurred during the growth season before the time of sampling...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the landing rates of Belgian beam {{trawlers}} in the Southern Bight of the North Sea were affected through competitive {{interactions with the}} Dutch beam trawler fleet and whether {{the development of a}} pulse trawler fleet has altered competitive interactions between both fleets. Effects of competition were investigated through a natural experiment based on the different weekly exploitation patterns of both fleets. Logbook data were used to fit a generalized additive mixed model for the daily landing rates of the target <b>species</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Results showed that landing rates of sole by the Belgian beam trawlers (> 221 kW) from 2006 to 2013 were lower during weekdays than during weekends when the Dutch trawler fleet is in harbour, while no such an effect was found for plaice. After the development of a pulse trawler fleet in 2011, the negative weekday effect in the sole landing rates was much more pronounced in 2012 and 2013. This increased loss of efficiency during weekdays, as a result of increased competition with the Dutch trawler fleet, coincided with a reallocation of fishing effort by the Belgian beam trawler fleet. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{ecosystem}} model Atlantis {{was used}} to investigate the key dynamics and processes that structure the Eastern English Channel ecosystem, with a particular focus on two commercial flatfish <b>species,</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). This complex model was parameterized with data collected from diverse sources (a literature review, survey data, as well as landings and stock assessment information) and tuned so both simulated biomass and catch fit 2002 – 2011 observations. Here, the outputs are mainly presented for the two focus species and for some other vertebrates found {{to be important in}} the trophic network. The calibration process revealed the importance of coastal areas in the Eastern English Channel and of nutrient inputs from estuaries: a lack of river nutrients decreases the productivity of nursery grounds and adversely affects the production of sole and plaice. The role of discards in the trophic network is also highlighted. While sole and plaice did not have a strong influence on the trophic network of vertebrates, they are important predators for benthic invertebrates and compete for food with crustaceans, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and other demersal fish. We also found that two key species, cod (Gadus morhua) and whiting, thoroughly structured the Eastern English Channel trophic network...|$|E
40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target <b>species</b> (<b>sole,</b> plaice, turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives. Mixed-species MSY was lower than the sum of the single-species MSYs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Thirty French fleets fishing {{primarily}} in the Bay of Biscay were defined based on techno-economic input criteria: i) 18 fishing gear or gear combinations ii) the location of fishing grounds visited during a year (< 12 nautical miles from coast, beyond 12 nm or both) and iii) total vessel length (< 20 m for trawlers and other gears < 24 m). The fleets were then characterised in terms of horse power, economic dependence {{on a list of}} nine dominant commercial <b>species</b> (<b>sole,</b> Nephrops, sea bass, hake, monkfish, anchovy, cuttlefish, sardine and squid) and their contribution to the landings of these species from the Bay of Biscay. Most fleets derived the majority of their income from one or two among the nine species. Species dependencies changed little during the study period, except for those vessels targeting anchovy before the fishery restrictions starting in 2005. Fish community impacts were compared based on fleet landings’ profiles. Twelve landings profiles were determined using hierarchical cluster analysis. Fleets using similar gears had the same landings ’ profiles and therefore exercised similar pressures on the ecosystem, though not always in the same areas. The depletion of anchovy and the closure of the fishery lead to a change in landings profile for offshore pelagic trawlers from anchovy dominance to one with a larger proportion of albacore and sea bass. During the study period, the overall vessel number decreased from 2163 to 1845. Few vessels changed fleets, but if they did, they primarily started to fish closer to the coast, which might be a result of increasing fuel prices...|$|E

40|$|Gelatin from skins {{of several}} marine species were {{compared}} {{on the basis}} of their rheological characteristics (viscoelasticity and gel strength) and chemical/structural properties (amino acid composition, molecular weight distribution and triple helix formation). Gelatins from flat-fish <b>species</b> (<b>sole</b> and megrim) presented the best gelling ability and the gels were more thermostable than those from cold-adapted fish (cod and hake). This different behaviour may be explained considering the amino acid composition, the α 1 /α 2 collagen-chain ratio, and the molecular weight distribution. Thus, cod gelatin presented a lower alanine and imino acid content, and a decreased proline hydroxylation degree; cod and hake gelatins presented a low α 1 /α 2 ratio (∼ 1); hake gelatin showed a highly significant decrease in β-components and other aggregates. The squid gelatin presented the most significant changes regarding amino acid composition and molecular weight distribution, most of these differences arising from the low solubility of the squid connective tissue. However, the squid gelatin showed viscoelastic properties intermediate between those from flat-fish and cold-adapted fish species. Circular dichroism analysis reveals that gelling involves a refolding of denatured collagen chains into the typical triple helix conformation and, conversely, unfolding upon reheating. Thermal folding and unfolding curves were similar to those of viscoelastic properties but showing a shift towards lower or higher temperatures upon cooling and heating, respectively. The folding process seem to be directly related in the stabilisation of the gels without disregarding its role in triggering the gelation process. Finally, gel strength evaluation revealed the importance of slow cold maturation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{can suffer}} lethal damage to {{swimming}} bladder or other organs due to extreme loud impulse sounds caused by e. g. pile driving (Popper & Hastings 2009). Juvenile and adult fish can actively swim {{away from a}} sound source, but planktonic larvae {{are not able to}} do this. As a result, fish larvae may suffer more from underwater noise than the older life stages. Despite the many indications for adverse effects, detailed information on the effect of different sound levels on fish is still scarce, especially for the early life stages. Within the framework of the Appropriate Assessment of Dutch offshore wind farms, the effect of piling noise on the southern North Sea population of herring, sole, and plaice larvae was simulated (Prins et al. 2009). For this, an existing larval transport model (Bolle et al. 2005, 2009, Dickey-Collas et al. 2009, Erftemeijer et al. 2009) was expanded with crude assumptions on larval mortality caused by pile driving. The model results were extrapolated to other fish species and older life stages, based on “expertjudgment", in an attempt to assess the effect of offshore piling on the prey availability for birds and marine mammals in Natura 2000 areas (Bos et al. 2009). This assessment involved a large number of uncertainties. The first and most important uncertainty was the range around a piling site in which larval mortality occurs. It was assumed that 100 % mortality occurs up to a distance of 1 km from the piling site. However, little is known about larval mortality rates in relation to the level of exposure to piling noise. In general, there is an urgent need to obtain more knowledge on the effect of sound on fish (survival, distribution, and behaviour) during different life stages. More particularly, in view of the rapid extension of offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap on lethal effects of loud impulse noises caused by pile driving. The broader aim of the current project is to examine the effect of piling noise on the survival of fish larvae. However, within the limited resources and time frame of the Shortlist research programme {{it is not possible to}} carry out field experiments, nor is it possible to execute elaborate series of experiments. The first goal within the Shortlist programme is to examine the feasibility of laboratory experiments with pile driving noise and fish larvae. The second goal is to use the laboratory set-up in a pilot study aiming at determining the threshold at which mortality of fish larvae occurs. This shortlist study is limited to laboratory experiments, lethal effects, larvae of 1 <b>species</b> (<b>sole,</b> Solea solea) and 3 series of experiments (trials). The study consists of exposure-effect experiments only; the effects of pile driving at the population level will not be modelled, nor will the results be extrapolated to other species or life stages. The progress to date has been documented in a series of memo’s. These memos are included in this report as Appendices and are summarised in the sections of the report...|$|E
40|$|Dover sole (Solea solea) is gastronomically highly {{appreciated}} {{and has a}} high market value. The {{species is}} therefore {{considered to be a}} very promising candidate for European aquaculture. Furthermore, ensuring a reliable supply of sole would reduce fishing pressure on wild Dover sole populations. However, as for many other fish <b>species,</b> <b>sole</b> production is hampered by amongst others high susceptibility to diseases and larval mortality, justifying the need for more research in this area. Infectious diseases are a major cause of larval mortality thereby decreasing survival and having a negative impact {{on the development of the}} fish embryo and larva. Severe economic losses due to diseases in larviculture may be linked to vibriosis. Various Vibrio spp. have been cited as causative agents, with Vibrio anguillarum on top of the list. Efforts have been made to reduce infectious diseases, in the past mainly by applying antibiotics. Because of the emergence of acquired antimicrobial resistance, there is a great need for alternative measures to overcome diseases. In this respect, the amount of studies investigating the use and effect of probionts in aquaculture increased drastically. However, the mode of action of these probiotics is largely unknown. In addition, researchers become increasingly interested in studying bacteria-host interactions as understanding these may assist in combatting disease. Reliable experimental models not only enable experiments exploring the mode of action of probiotic candidates but also facilitate research aimed at unravelling the ways pathogens elicit disease and mortality. Nevertheless, only a handful of studies focused on the development of such models for fish larvae and for Dover sole, no such model is available yet. Our research group developed a standardized biotic challenge model for Dover sole larvae adopting Vibrio spp. as potential pathogens. Five potentially pathogenic isolates were selected: the wild-type V. anguillarum HI 610, V. anguillarum Fr and V. harveyi Fr that were both isolated from a disease outbreak in a French sea bass farm, V. tapetis isolated from skin blisters and liver of Dover sole and V. tapetis 2 originating from active skin ulcers of wild dab (Limanda limanda). Each isolate was added to the housing water of larvae at 10 days after hatching in a final concentration of 10 ^ 5, 10 ^ 6 or 10 ^ 7 colony forming units (CFU) /ml. No significant differences in survival were noticed between the larvae inoculated with V. anguillarum wild-type, V. harveyi Fr, V. tapetis, V. tapetis 2 and the control group at any of the concentrations tested. Vibrio anguillarum Fr supplied at a final concentration of 10 ^ 6 CFU/ml well water resulted in a larval mortality of 36 %, while the non-challenged control group displayed 5 % mortality. When this isolate was administrated to the larvae at a concentration of 10 ^ 7 CFU/ml, 48 % mortality was observed. In addition to proving valuable in many other applications, this model is to be regarded as a powerful tool to evaluate the impact of (a) biotic components on larval health. Different probiotic candidates (administrated via the water and Artemia nauplii) were already assessed for their protective potential against V. anguillarum challenge and several prebiotic components will be evaluated in the future. In a next step, the impact of algal toxins on larval health will be considered amongst others by evaluating the susceptibility to disease agents...|$|E
