50|$|Fullerenes {{react with}} carbenes to methanofullerenes. The {{reaction}} of fullerene with dichlorocarbene (created by <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate</b> pyrolysis) was first reported in 1993. A single addition takes place along a 6,6 bond.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 Yeldham was a Principal in the Colonial Office, West African Department, {{and wrote}} a {{memorandum}} (16 March) on Soviet activity in Nigeria. There was MI5 surveillance of Harry Pollitt's contact with Mokwugo Okoye, a Zikist leader (Yeldham, memorandum in December of that year). During the Malayan Emergency, in 1952, he {{was instrumental in the}} use of <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate</b> as a defoliant.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Dihalocarbenes {{have been}} {{generated}} by thermal decomposition of <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate</b> and tribromomethylphenylmercury, and give mono dihalocyclopropyl adducts with steroid dienes. Such compounds offer an easy {{starting point for}} the synthesis of unusual derivatives of potential biological interest. Under the same conditions, however, addition to non-conjugated double bonds does not take place. This lack of reactivity can be ascribed to several factors, none of which is totally satisfactory. Deoxidation of allylic alcohols has also been observed under carbene conditions, and a similar new reaction of allylic acetates was discovered...|$|E
40|$|Enteroviruses {{added to}} 114 liters of dechlorinated tap water were {{recovered}} in a 16 -ml sample by a two-stage concentration procedure in which {{different types of}} membrane filters were used in each concentration stage. Viruses in tap water at pH 3. 5 were first adsorbed to 10 -in. (ca. 25. 4 -cm) epoxy-fiber glass filters (Filterite). Viruses adsorbed to these filters were eluted with a solution of 0. 2 M <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate</b> buffered at pH 9 with 0. 2 M lysine. Viruses in this solution were adsorbed to 47 -mm asbestos filters (Seitz) without pH adjustment or other modification of the solution. Viruses were recovered from the Seitz filters with 16 ml of either Casitone or fetal calf serum at pH 9. With these procedures ca. 45 % of several types of enteroviruses added to 114 liters of tap water could be recovered in the final 16 -ml sample...|$|E
40|$|Polyglycerolteichoic acid:glucosyl {{transferase}} (TAG transferase), one of {{the three}} enzymes involved in the pathway leading to the glucosylation of teichoic acid in Bacillus subtilis 168, was investigated. During {{the early stages of the}} growth of B. subtilis, TAG transferase is predominantly a soluble enzyme found in the cytoplasm. As growth proceeds, the amount of soluble enzyme decreases and the proportion of insoluble, membrane-bound TAG transferase increases, reaching a maximal value at the close of the logarithmic phase. Data are presented which suggest that these are two forms of the same enzyme, or have some common component. The effects of chaotropic agents, such as <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate</b> and sodium perchlorate, on the cytoplasmic membrane were also studied. These data show that such compounds can effectively remove the TAG transferase from the membrane in a water-soluble form. A study of some of the physical properties of this solubilized enzyme suggests that there is little difference between the two forms of the enzyme. Experiments are described which indicate that the glucosyl transfer by both the membrane-bound and soluble enzymes is not mediated by lipids...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was made}} of the ability of chaotropes, low-molecular-weight ionic compounds which enhance the solubilization of hydrophobic compounds in water, to improve the recovery of enteric viruses from highly organic estuarine sediments. Chaotropic agents alone were poor eluents of polioviruses from sediment but were effective when combined with 3 % beef extract. Chaotropes of lower potency, NaNO 3, NaCl, and KCl, were more efficient eluents than the stronger chaotropes, guanidium hydrochloride or <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate.</b> The most effective eluent was 2 M NaNO 3 in 3 % beef extract at pH 5. 5, which eluted 71 % of sediment-associated polioviruses. Efficient concentration of the sodium nitrate-beef extract eluate by organic flocculation required the addition of the antichaotrope (NH 4) 2 SO 4 to a 2 M concentration and Cat-Floc T (Calgon, Pittsburgh, Pa.) a cationic polyelectrolyte, to a 0. 01 % concentration. Dialysis of the final concentrate was necessary to reduce salts to nontoxic levels before assay in cell cultures. Trials with highly organic estuarine sediment seeded with high or low numbers of poliovirus 1, echovirus 1, or rotavirus SA- 11 demonstrated the superiority of this method over two other methods currently in use...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} eluent composition, pH, and chaotropic agents on the {{recovery}} of T 2, MS 2, and indigenous coliphages from various foods were investigated. Additionally, methods of sample suspension and clarification were evaluated for coliphage recovery and application to various foods. Clarified sample suspensions were assayed for coliphages with a modified agar layer technique and appropriate Escherichia coli hosts. Centrifugation and polypropylene mesh filtration were more rapid and effective than glass wool filtration for clarification of sample suspensions and subsequent recovery of coliphages. Blending, stomaching, and shaking procedures were generally comparable for sample liquefaction and release of coliphages from foods. Complex basal eluents, EC medium and 1 % casein, were generally more effective than a less complex eluent, phosphate buffer, for elution of coliphages from foods. For most foods, incorporation of sodium chloride or chaotropic agents, i. e., <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate,</b> urea, Tween 80, Triton X- 100, and sodium nitrate, into basal eluents did not enhance recovery of coliphages. Indigenous coliphage recovery was not affected by sample suspension pH over a range of 6. 0 to 9. 0. With an optimal procedure, i. e., EC medium eluent, blending, and centrifugation, {{the recovery of}} T 2 and MS 2 ranged from 48 to 81 % and from 58 to 100 %, respectively, depending on the food type...|$|E
40|$|Perennial {{creeping}} grasses such as Cynodon dactylon are {{of major}} {{concern in the}} South African sugarcane industry, and investigations to establish optimum control measures for these species have been given high priority. Research results showed that herbicides with a base ofglyphosate (isopropylamine salt of glyphosate) or sulfosate (trimesium salt of glyphosate) produced consistent acceptable kill ratings for Cynodon spp., and products such as MSMA (720 g/Q monosodium methane arsenate) and TCA (960 g/kg <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate)</b> in combination controlled Digitaria abyssinica. The Cynodon species investigated included C. dactylon and C. plectostachyus, the former being both stoloniferous and rhizomatous and the latter stoloniferous only. D. abyssinica is a rhizomatous species (Gibbs Russell etal., 1991) Different application techniques such as controlled droplet applicators were compared with the conventional manually operated knapsack sprayers. In addition, certain physical operations intended to enhance product efficacy were tested. These included rotavating or slashing, with herbicide application commencing after sufficient regrowth had occurred. Tests extended from early to late summer to determine seasonal influence on control measures. Trials were conducted in a semi-controlled environment as well as under fallow conditions, and in plant and ratoon cane fields. Results indicated that creeping grass control in sugarcane can be improved by making specific changes to current recommendations. Observations in heavily infested fields indicated that good grass control and minimal cane damage {{can be achieved by}} slashing cane and spraying the grass after a suitable period...|$|E
40|$|Apomyoglobin folding {{proceeds}} {{through a}} molten globule intermediate (low-salt form; I 1) {{that has been}} characterized by equilibrium (pH 4) and kinetic (pH 6) folding experiments. Of the eight alpha-helices in myoglobin, three (A, G, and H) are structured in I 1, while the rest appear to be unfolded. Here {{we report on the}} structure and stability of a second intermediate, the trichloroacetate form of the molten globule intermediate (I 2), which is induced either from the acid-unfolded protein or from I 1 by > or = 5 mM <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate.</b> Circular dichroism measurements monitoring urea- and acid-induced unfolding indicate that I 2 is more highly structured and more stable than I 1. Although I 2 exhibits properties closer to those of the native protein, one-dimensional NMR spectra show that it maintains the lack of fixed side-chain structure that is the hallmark of a molten globule. Amide proton exchange and 1 H- 15 N two-dimensional NMR experiments are used to identify the source of the extra helicity observed in I 2. The results reveal that the existing A, G, and H helices present in I 1 have become more stable in I 2 and that a fourth helix [...] the B helix [...] has been incorporated into the molten globule. Available evidence is consistent with I 2 being an on-pathway intermediate. The data support the view that apomyoglobin folds in a sequential fashion through a single pathway populated by intermediates of increasing structure and stability...|$|E
40|$|Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is a {{phytotoxic}} substance that, {{until the}} 1980 s {{was used in}} the form of <b>sodium</b> <b>trichloroacetate</b> (TCA-Na) as a herbicide in agriculture and forestry. Since then it has been banned almost everywhere in Europe and in many other countries in the world. Although much has been learned about the natural and anthropogenic sources of TCA over the past few years, at present {{little is known about the}} harmful effects of TCA and its atmospheric precursors (such as tetrachloroethylene, PER) on wild and forest plant species. Therefore experiments lasting a number of years were carried out on pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch trees (Betula pendula Roth) with respect to the chronic uptake of airborne PER via the air/leaf pathway, the aim being to study the fate of PER and its metabolisation into TCA. This work was augmented by outdoor model experiments on pines about 10 years old regarding the uptake of TCA-Na via the soil/root pathway. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements on needles and leaf material affected by TCA-Na and PER indicated that the extent to which TCA influences photochemical and biochemical mesophyll processes varies depending on the entry pathway, the particular part of the plant directly affected by TCA, and weather-related factors. It was proven that TCA-Na applied via the soil/root pathway moderately raises the vitality of pine trees depending on the concentration involved, despite high levels of TCA in the needles (up to 1 800 μg TCA kg– 1 dry weight needles). By contrast, fumigating pine trees and birch trees with PER led to the accumulation of up to 70 μg TCA kg– 1 dw in the assimilation organs and exacerbated the trees’ sensitivity to stressors. Although physiological activity was initially stimulated, the effect of additional stress in the form of an artificially induced drought caused PER-affected birch trees, in particular, to sometimes undergo sharp losses of vitality of as much as 58 % compared to the controls. One may thus expect that, future climate changes accompanied by long periods of drought are likely to exacerbate the ecotoxicological risk in regions with high PER pollution, possibly resulting in the vegetation in the terrestrial ecosystems of the areas concerned being destabilised...|$|E
