40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the natural, nominal, risk free rate of {{interest}} is zero under rele-vant contemporary institutional arrangements. However, as Spencer Pack reminded us, “[n]atural and nature are complex words, fraught with ambiguity and contradiction” (1995, 31). The sense in which we wish to employ the term natural here does not imply a “law of nature, ” which may be why “[Alfred] Marshall replaced the evocative label ‘natu-ral ’ with the more prosaic ‘normal’ ” (Eatwell 1987, 598). Marshall may have clarified it the best when he wrote that “normal results are those which may be expected as the out-come of those tendencies which the context suggests ” ([1920] 1966), 28, emphasis added). In this case, it is {{of the utmost importance}} to first clarify the context, to which we now turn. State-Issued Currency The primary, defining institutional arrangement characterizing the relevant con-text is that of a “tax-driven ” state currency and flexible exchange rates. By state currency we mean to indicate there is a government that taxes and has a monopoly of issue. A flexi-ble exchange rate is commonly referred to as a “fiat ” currency, in other words, a state-issued currency convertible only into itself (Keynes 1930), as opposed to a fixed exchange rate policy such as a gold standard or other convertibility to any other com-modity or currency fixed by the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> (such as currency boards, pegged curren...|$|E

40|$|Block et al. (I) {{reported}} {{a method to}} estimate year of birth using the Social Security number in cohort studies in which the age of {{a significant portion of}} cases was unknown. Social Security numbers have proven useful to us in a different way in a long-term follow-up study of childhood lead poisoning. We have been following cases diagnosed up to 68 years ago, and for many of these cases it has been decades since their vital status was estab-lished. We were able to obtain a Social Security number for most of these individuals but had difficulty ascertaining their vital status at any point after they were lost to medical follow-up. By using the tables and extrapolations provided by Block et al., we identified year and <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> of each Social Security number. We knew, therefore, cases to be alive up to the date of issue, and we knew in which state to concentrate follow-up efforts. This method increased follow-up for 60 (13 percent) of the cases. On average, 14 years of follow-up were gained for each of the 60 cases, and total years of follow-up were increased 6 percent for the study group overall. The greatest gains in years of follow-up were for female cases who did not obtain Social Security numbers until middle age. This application of Social Security numbers may be of use to other investigators involved in retrospective follow-up studies, par-ticularly studies of childhood diseases where age of onset occurs prior to the age of obtaining...|$|E
