Reliability centered maintenance is a systematic, disciplined process that produces an efficient equipment management strategy to reduce the probability of failure [1].

The system boundary for the study has been selected as containment <b>spray</b> <b>pump</b> and its motor drive. Failure Mode and Criticality Effects analysis is applied to evaluate the failure modes while the logic tree diagram used to determine the optimum maintenance strategy. It is concluded that condition based maintenance tasks should be enhanced to reduce component degradation and thus improve reliability and availability of the component. It is recommended to apply time directed tasks to age related failures and failure finding tasks to hidden failures...|$|R

30|$|During the outbreak, the {{quarantine}} was not executed properly as pastoralists could still move their animals from one village to another {{to search for}} pastures. Also farmers were still selling animals to nearby country (Kenya) via unauthorized routes. The movement of animals from Tanzania to Kenya either for search of good pasture or for sale has been reported (Diallo et al. 2000) to facilitate further {{spread of the disease}} to unaffected areas during the 2006 – 07 RVF outbreak. It was observed that good pastures were found in the low land areas where mosquitoes were also found in large numbers and facilitated the disease transmission. However, the short difference in time of occurrence of disease in different regions of Tanzania is an indication that, those foci of outbreaks were caused by other factors other than animal movement as it was also highlighted by (FAO 2000). The results also indicated that few farmers used dipping tanks and the majority used <b>spray</b> <b>pumps</b> to control vector borne diseases. Since some of the farmers owned large number of animals, {{it was not possible to}} effectively spray all of them. According to (Peter et al. 2005) and (Davies and Martin 2006) effective use of dipping tanks also reduces the magnitude of mosquito borne diseases like RFV.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is {{a common}} chronic disease of the upper airways and has {{considerable}} impact on quality of life. Topical delivery of drugs to the paranasal sinuses is challenging, therefore the rate of surgery is high. This study investigates the delivery efficiency of a pulsating aerosol in comparison to a nasal <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> to the sinuses and the nose in healthy volunteers and in CRS patients before and after sinus surgery. METHODS: (99 m) Tc-DTPA pulsating aerosols were applied in eleven CRSsNP patients without nasal polyps before and after sinus surgery. In addition, pulsating aerosols were studied in comparison to nasal <b>pump</b> <b>sprays</b> in eleven healthy volunteers. Total nasal and frontal, maxillary and sphenoidal sinus aerosol deposition and lung penetration were assessed by anterior and lateral planar gamma camera imaging. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers nasal <b>pump</b> <b>sprays</b> resulted in 100 % nasal, non-significant sinus and lung deposition, while pulsating aerosols resulted 61. 3 +/- 8. 6 % nasal deposition and 38. 7 % exit the other nostril. 9. 7 +/- 2. 0 % of the nasal dose penetrated into maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses. In CRS patients, total nasal deposition was 56. 7 +/- 13. 3 % and 46. 7 +/- 12. 7 % before and after sinus surgery, respectively (p< 0. 01). Accordingly, maxillary and sphenoidal sinus deposition was 4. 8 +/- 2. 2 % and 8. 2 +/- 3. 8 % of the nasal dose (p< 0. 01). Neither in healthy volunteers nor in CRS patients there was significant dose in the frontal sinuses. CONCLUSION: In contrast to nasal <b>pump</b> <b>sprays,</b> pulsating aerosols can deliver significant doses into posterior nasal spaces and paranasal sinuses, providing alternative therapy options before and after sinus surgery. Patients with chronic lung diseases based on clearance dysfunction may also benefit from pulsating aerosols, since these diseases also manifest in the upper airways...|$|R
40|$|Nasal drug {{delivery}} {{can be assessed}} {{by a variety of}} means and regulatory agencies, e. g., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have published a set of guidelines and regulations proposing in vitro test methods for the characterization of nasal drug products. This article gives a summary of the FDA and EMA requirements regarding the determination of droplet size distribution (DSD), plume geometry, spray pattern and shot weights of solution nasal sprays and discusses the analytical challenges that can occur when performing these measurements. In order to support findings from the literature, studies were performed using a standard nasal <b>spray</b> <b>pump</b> and aqueous model formulations. The aim was to identify possible method-, device- and formulation-dependent influencing factors. The literature review, as well as the results from the studies show that DSD, plume geometry and spray pattern are influenced by, e. g., the viscosity of the solution, the design of the device and the actuation parameters, particularly the stroke length, actuation velocity and actuation force. The dominant factor influencing shot weights, however, is the adjustment of the actuation parameters, especially stroke length and actuation velocity. Consequently, for routine measurements assuring, e. g., the quality of a solution nasal spray or, for in vitro bioequivalence studies, the critical parameters, have to be identified and considered in method development in order to obtain reproducible and reliable results...|$|R

In this system, {{only a few}} piglets may be colonized with the herd's prevalent systemic strain, which results in infection of naive penmates late in the nursery. In view of these factors, the objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the early colonization of piglets with the farm's prevalent systemic strain of H. parasuis and S. suis as an alternative method for disease prevention; and (2) to evaluate 2 different protocols for experimental colonization: direct colonization of piglets and colonization of piglets through nose-to-nose contact with inoculated sows.

40|$|To {{minimize}} the total energy consumption of a cooling tower-assisted heat pump (CTAHP) system in cooling mode, a model-based control strategy with hybrid optimization algorithm {{for the system}} is presented in this paper. An existing experimental device, which mainly contains a closed wet cooling tower with counter flow construction, a condenser water loop and a water-to-water heat pump unit, is selected as the study object. Theoretical and empirical models of the related components and their interactions are developed. The four variables, viz. desired cooling load, ambient wet-bulb temperature, temperature and flow rate of chilled water at the inlet of evaporator, are set to independent variables. The system power consumption can be minimized by optimizing input powers of cooling tower fan, <b>spray</b> water <b>pump,</b> condenser water pump and compressor. The optimal input power of <b>spray</b> water <b>pump</b> is determined experimentally. Implemented on MATLAB, a hybrid optimization algorithm, which combines the Limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm with the greedy diffusion search (GDS) algorithm, is incorporated to solve the minimization problem of energy consumption and predict the system’s optimal set-points under quasi-steady-state conditions. The integrated simulation tool is validated against experimental data. The results obtained demonstrate the proposed operation strategy is reliable, and can save energy by 20. 8 % as compared to an uncontrolled system under certain testing conditions...|$|R
