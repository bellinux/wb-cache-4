5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. <b>Some</b> <b>air</b> forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or the sands of the Mediterranean front.|$|E
5|$|The task {{groups were}} forced to stay within enemy air range longer than {{anticipated}} due to Canberra situation. Early morning fighter sweeps were launched to suppress air power on Luzon and Formosa while the newly formed task group attempted to escort Canberra to safety. <b>Some</b> <b>air</b> groups encountered Japanese planes in the strike zones, but no major air-to-air combat developed. Throughout the afternoon, enemy aircraft flew to {{the perimeter of the}} task groups to relay sighting reports.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and <b>some</b> <b>air</b> forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|Wright's Air Pump {{was unusual}} {{in that it}} {{depicted}} archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may {{have been based on}} Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; Erasmus Darwin has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left of the table, and John Warltire, whom Darwin had invited to help with <b>some</b> <b>air</b> pump experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher; but Wright never identified any of the subjects or suggested they were based on real people.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain <b>some</b> <b>air</b> quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles, México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, {{the location of the}} plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E

25|$|In {{extremely}} humid locations, adding insulation to {{an already}} well-insulated tank may cause condensation leading to rust, mold, or other operational problems so <b>some</b> <b>air</b> flow must be maintained, usually by convection caused by waste heat, but in particularly humid conditions such ventilation may be fan-assisted.|$|E
25|$|Whilst <b>some</b> <b>air</b> {{ambulances}} do have effective {{methods of}} funding, in the UK, they remain almost entirely charity funded, as improved cost-benefit ratios are generally achieved with land based attendance and transfers.

25|$|The jet streams are {{systems of}} upper-air westerlies. They {{give rise to}} slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-knot winds in <b>some</b> <b>air</b> streams. First {{observed}} by World War II pilots, they develop just below the tropopause over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the polar jets, the subtropical westerly jets, and the less common tropical easterly jets. They follow the principle of geostrophic winds.|$|E
5000|$|Very little Irish music {{composed}} before 1700 survives. <b>Some</b> <b>airs</b> {{from this}} period are preserved in manuscript, the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book {{being one of the}} more notable examples. A reference to [...] Callen O Costure Me/Cailin O Chois tSuire Me in William Ballet's book of lute music in the late 16th centureyis the first known record of an Irish song being set down in musical notation.|$|R
50|$|The video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live in February 2000. It was Iglesias' first {{video to}} make it to number one on the popular chart show. <b>Some</b> <b>airing</b> of the video on MTV cut out the section of the video {{featuring}} the Thunderpuss 2000 remix. Music stations such as Much Music and various stations throughout Europe aired a version which featured the full album version of the song.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Some</b> {{stations}} <b>air</b> Let's Make a Deal At 3:00 pm {{instead of}} the normal 10:00 am slot. Also, <b>some</b> stations <b>air</b> The Young and the Restless 30 minutes earlier at 12:00 pm. That is because CBS operates on two different feed's allowing it {{to have a different}} programming schedule than normal for some stations. One example of this is the Duluth/Superior affiliate KBJR, which have both scheduling changes.|$|R
25|$|The 650hp (490kW) Condor engine drove a two-blade {{propeller}} and had, after <b>some</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry input, a nose-mounted radiator under the propeller shaft. The Ministry advised that {{the wings of}} the first two Berkeleys of the three specified in the contract should have wooden wings for speed of completion, with the third to be all metal. Leitner-Watts Metal airscrews were required for the second and third machine. The first Berkeley flew on 5 March 1925.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} can {{be prevented}} by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air. For that purpose, in hybrid towers, saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air. <b>Some</b> <b>air</b> enters the tower above drift eliminator level, passing through heat exchangers. The relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower. The discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible.|$|E
25|$|Waterpump grew {{beyond its}} {{original}} training mission. From 19–29 July 1964, <b>some</b> <b>Air</b> Commandos were smuggled into Laos as an improvised Tactical Air Control Party for Operation Triangle. The {{success of the}} endeavor led to a forward air control system being {{set up for the}} war's duration. Some Waterpump personnel were later infiltrated into Laos to help staff regional Air Operation Centers. With Waterpump help, by war's end the RLAF had grown from 20 to 75 T-28 strike aircraft; it also operated ten AC-47 gunships and 71 support aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Stations {{typically}} have an air compressor (some {{with a built-in}} or provided handheld tire-pressure gauge) to inflate tires and a hose to add water to vehicle radiators. <b>Some</b> <b>air</b> compressor machines are free of charge, while others charge a small fee to use (typically 50 cents to a dollar in North America). In many U.S. states, state law requires that paying customers must be provided with free air compressor service. In most cases, a token provided by the attendant is used in lieu of coins.|$|E
25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating <b>some</b> <b>air</b> increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular latent (moisture) {{as well as the}} sensible (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called condensate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>Air</b> Commandos now {{began to}} {{infiltrate}} Laos. In May 1964, two formed a skeletal Air Operations Center at Wattay outside Vientiane. The Air Commandos also pushed the envelope to sneakily fly some combat missions {{from time to}} time. Moreover, when U.S. Navy Lieutenant Charles F. Klusman was shot down on an armed reconnaissance mission on 6 June 1964, B and A Team pilots successively flew cover for the combat search and rescue effort. Also in June, a Waterpump officer and two enlisted specialists were covertly sent to Luang Prabang to support B Team efforts there.|$|E
