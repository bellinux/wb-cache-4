5|$|The {{urban growth}} of Southampton, {{as in many}} English walled towns and cities, put {{considerable}} pressure on the older fortifications. In 1898 to 1899, for example, parts of the wall west of Biddles Gate, including a square tower, were demolished to create the Western Esplanade road. By {{the second half of}} the century, the Bargate and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> were creating serious traffic congestion; various options were considered to relieve this including demolition, but it was not until the 1930s that the decision was made to retain the gatehouse, but to destroy the walls on either side.|$|E
5|$|ZIPRA {{personnel}} in Bulawayo used civilian vehicles to smuggle weapons and equipment, including mortars, into their Entumbane camp {{over the next}} few days. C Company, 1RAR, comprising 96 men under Major Lionel Dyck (including a detachment from Support Company) and eight armoured vehicles, noticed this while they were garrisoning the Alamo on 11 February. The major reported to Brigade headquarters that the number of ZIPRA troops at Entumbane appeared to have swelled considerably, and that the chain link fence surrounding the camp had been taken down. Superiors ordered him not to intervene. Anticipating an imminent attack, Dyck used a silenced rifle to shoot out the floodlights surrounding the Alamo, lined up his vehicles against the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> so his men could stand on them while defending, and ranged mortars on a variety of targets in the ZIPRA complex.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of time Copenhagen became {{the focal point of the}} {{political}} power and the outlying local royal residences were used less and less frequently.

25|$|Furthermore, {{over the}} dike {{surrounding}} the Schiffenensee, northeast of Barberêche, stands Petit-Vivy Castle. It {{is among the}} oldest preserved castles in the region. The still-preserved, mighty, four-sided keep {{was built in the}} second half of the 13th century, and has 3.5-m-thick walls. Around the keep are the remains of former <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls,</b> arranged in triangular form. The residential buildings were built in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{departure}} from the previous game, there are elements from it that have remained. This includes the Magic Weapons, which are secondary weapons to Simon's whip. Each {{of them have a}} different use. Like most games in the series, some of these require the usage of hearts. One of them returning from Castlevania is the Holy Water, a small glass which can disintegrate walls that conceal hidden items. Some Magic Weapons make their first appearance in Simon's Quest, such as the Diamond, which attacks enemies while bouncing off any <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
25|$|The tower, often named Leander's Tower in {{reference}} to the legend of Hero and Leander (which took place in the Dardanelles strait, also known as the Hellespont in antiquity), was destroyed during the earthquake of 1509, and burned in 1721. Since then it was used as a lighthouse, and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> were repaired in 1731 and 1734, until in 1763 it was erected using stone. From 1829 the tower was used as a quarantine station, and in 1832 was restored by Sultan Mahmud II. Restored again by the harbour authority in 1945, the most recent restoration began in 1998 for the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough, and steel supports were added around the ancient tower as a precaution after the 17 August 1999 earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The Drill Hall Library in North Road, Chatham, {{was built}} as a {{military}} drill hall in 1902, for the Royal Navy as part of HMS Pembroke shore establishment and barracks. After the barracks closed in 1984. The Grade II listed buildings of the barracks, which include the Captain's House (now a Solicitor's Offices), a Mess block (now University Offices and Restaurant), the Pilkington Building (now a cafe, student services and a lecture theatre), the four barrack blocks (now various lecture rooms), the Gymnasium, and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> of barracks were then redeveloped {{as part of the}} Universities at Medway, a tri-partite collaboration of the University of Greenwich, the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University on a single campus. The three universities share use of the Drill Hall Library.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} changed its {{boundaries}} {{as well as}} the geographic limits of its quarters several times, principally as a result from destructions of the town by surrounding Hindu and Muslim powers. For instance, Golkonda forces under General Mir Jumla conquered Madras in 1646, massacred or sold into slavery many of the Christian European inhabitants and their allied Indian communities, and brought Madras and its immediate surroundings under his control. Nonetheless, the Fort and its <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> remained under British control who slowly rebuilt their colony with additional colonists despite another mass murder of Europeans in Black Town by anti-colonialists agitated by Golkonda and plague in the 1670s. In 1674, the expanded colony had nearly 50,000 mostly British and European colonists and was granted its own corporate charter, thereby officially establishing the modern day city. Eventually, after additional provocations from Golkonda, the British pushed back until they defeated him.|$|E
25|$|On Day 52 Jen, who {{was named}} as a {{replacement}} nominee for Amber, packed and scattered her belongings through the House, destroyed and bleached Dick's cigarettes. Dick, in retaliation, later threw Jen's clothing over the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> of the Big Brother house. Big Brother later informed Dick they would replace the cigarettes. Jen began to cook food while on a slop restriction Later that night, Jen went outside and ate food while on slop. Big Brother told Jen she would receive a penalty nomination, she must be a nominee for the entire week and cannot win HoH or Veto for Week 8 if she survived Week 7. This was found unfair to Jameka, the other Week 7 nominee, and the penalty nomination was removed. Jen would instead receive a penalty eviction vote for Week 7 plus any votes cast against her by her fellow HouseGuests.|$|E

500|$|During the 14th {{century the}} castle {{was allowed to}} fall into disrepair. From Edward III onwards, [...] little money was spent on {{maintaining}} the property and by the 15th century the castle was in ruins. The castle hall and chamber were roofless by the 15th century, and Henry VI ordered these buildings to be destroyed and the stone reused for constructing King's College in 1441, with {{other parts of the}} castle being used to help build Trinity College's chapel. More stonework was given away by Mary I in the 16th century for building a mansion at nearby Sawston in the Fens, and other grants of stone given to Emmanuel and Magdalene colleges. By 1604 only the gatehouse, used as a gaol, and the keep remained intact, with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> described by contemporaries as [...] "rased and utterly ruinated".|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were {{designed}} in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an [...] "aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass" [...] {{with the use}} of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings. The aim was {{to call attention to the}} increasingly complex three-dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely [...] "short buildings made taller with additional stories". Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath. Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one looked up the building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.|$|E

500|$|Another {{development}} of the 1820s, on Thomas Read Kemp's landholding, was the Jewish cemetery and its chapel. [...] Its location on Florence Place, off Ditchling Road {{just north of the}} railway line, places it marginally outside Brighton and Hove City Council's definition of the Round Hill area, but the site has always been associated with Round Hill. In 1826, Kemp, who at the time was a member of parliament, donated a parcel of land on the north slope of the hill to the congregation of Brighton's synagogue. The town had a large Jewish population—about 150 by 1840. An octagonal brick cemetery chapel (the Ohel), designed by the firm of Thomas Lainson and Son, was built in the burial ground in 1893. [...] In accordance with Jewish custom, it had facilities for mourners to wash their hands upon leaving the [...] "presence of death". Money to build the chapel and a fence round the cemetery was raised in the 1890s by charging members of the Middle Street Synagogue two shillings per week for a year; some prominent members of Brighton's Jewish community provided interest-free loans as well. Burials include Henry Solomon, Brighton Borough's chief constable (murdered in 1844); Hyam Lewis, a Brighton Town Commissioner and the first Jew in England to hold such a high-ranking municipal position; Levi Emanuel Cohen, a radical journalist who helped Brighton achieve borough status; and Sir John Howard, an engineer. The cemetery has been full for many years and is now closed except for family burials where a tomb already exists. [...] It is locked and in poor condition; many graves are overgrown. [...] The foundation stone commemorating Kemp's gift of the land survives, though. The cemetery chapel and its <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> and gates are Grade II listed buildings.|$|E

[...] The cemetery chapel and its <b>surrounding</b> <b>walls</b> and gates are Grade II listed buildings. [...] Designed in 1893 by Lainson and Son and built by the Garrett building firm, the chapel is a red-brick octagonal structure in the Queen Anne style, with a tiled turreted roof and corbel-topped piers at each corner, a pedimented entrance and arched windows set below recessed panels.

The wall itself was about 44m thick at the base and about 12m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30m high, which included merlons, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by embrasures. This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by a solid glacis, which is made out of bricks and quicklime. Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.|$|E
