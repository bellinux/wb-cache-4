In 1922, the Marconi Company formed the [...] "Marconiphone" [...] department, to design, manufacture and sell domestic receiving equipment. This equipment complied with Post Office <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests,</b> {{and was therefore}} awarded the BBC authorisation stamp; initially sets were made at the Chelmsford Works. In December 1923, the 'Marconiphone' department was formed as {{a subsidiary of the}} Marconi Company. Some Marconiphone Company sets were made at the Sterling Telephone Company (STC) Works at Dagenham. However, design and research of these domestic receivers still continued at Chelmsford. In December 1929, the Marconiphone was sold to the Gramophone Company, along with the right to use the trademark [...] "Marconiphone" [...] and the copyright signature [...] "G. Marconi" [...] on domestic receivers. The Marconi Company never re-entered the domestic radio market. In 1931 the Gramophone Company became Electric and Musical Industries (EMI) and produced domestic and radio receivers using the Marconiphone trademark until 1956, when receivers were made by the British Radio Corporation, under licence. Domestic receivers bearing the Marconiphone trademark produced after 1929 had no connection with the Marconi Company.|$|E

Both a general and an education-based metric have strong effects. The novel statistical power arises from difference-indifferences for blacks and whites, multiple cohorts, periods, and coefficient restrictions consistent with both the data and models in which differences in mate availability can induce blacks and whites to respond in opposite directions to changes in mate availability.

Contrary to predictions made {{at the time of the}} cuts, panel data estimates provide no evidence that areas which reduced expenditure the most have experienced relative increases in teenage pregnancy rates. Rather, expenditure cuts are associated with small reductions in teen pregnancy rates, a result which is robust to a number of alternative <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> for causality.

40|$|Abstract. Clemens, Radelet, Bhavnani, and Bazzi (CRBB, 2012) {{argues that}} the most-cited {{cross-country}} studies {{of the impact of}} foreign aid can be reconciled if changed in certain ways. The shared finding is then, in the CRBB view, that more aid is followed on average by more growth. I exactly replicate the estimation results of CRBB, and then question these estimation results with additional <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests.</b> One change, restricting the aid variable to assistance most likely to affect growth in the short run, does not make much difference. Two other changes—lagging the aid variables and differencing the data to remove fixed effects—fail to re-move contemporaneous endogeneity. Addressing this issue produces evidence of zero or nega-tive Granger causation from aid/GDP to growth. And the regressions embodying all of CRBB’s changes do not peg the impact of aid as statistically significant...|$|E

Using detailed individual-level matched panel data, covering a large share of manufacturing firms and more than 30 million workers between 1997 and 2002, we consider the endogeneity of profits, by adopting different measures of profits and different instruments and by controlling for spell fixed effects. Our results, robust to different <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests,</b> indicate no evidence of rent sharing. This conclusion contrasts with findings for most developed countries, even those with flexible labour markets.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of the Low Voltage (LV) and High Voltage (HV) power supply {{distribution}} of the MDT (Monitored Drift Tubes) detector is addressed. Due to the high number of channels (1168 for low voltage and twice for high voltage) involved and to the dimension of the apparatus, these power supply systems are very complicated. Both system are made of three different parts: a power generator, a system controller and an active distributor. The first two parts will be localized in the cavern close to the experimental area, so they are subjected to standard environmental conditions. The third part (the active distributor) will be placed in the experimental area on the platforms just outside the detector, where the environmental conditions are more severe, due to the presence of magnetic field (about 800 Gauss) and radiations. In the following we present the design <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> for the power supply systems. (3 refs) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} day of {{the week}} and month of the year effects in seventeen European stock market indexes in the period 1994 - 2007. We discuss the shortcomings of model <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> used in previous work, and propose a simpler specification, usable for detecting all types of calendar effects. Recognizing that returns are non-normally distributed, autocorrelated and that the residuals of linear regressions are variant over time, we use statically robust estimation methodologies, including bootstrapping and GARCH modeling. Although returns tend to be lower in the months of August and September, we do not find strong evidence of across-the-board calendar effects, as the most favorable evidence is only country-specific. Additionally, using rolling windows regressions, we find that the stronger country-specific calendar effects are not stable over the whole sample period, casting additional doubt on the economic ignificance of calendar effects. We conclude that our results are not immune to the critique that calendar effects may only be a “chimera” delivered by intensive data mining...|$|E
40|$|To be {{successful}} innovators, organizations must select the best ideas for implementation. Extant {{research shows that}} idea selection is distorted {{by a number of}} biases, but has failed to consider hierarchy, a key element of organizations. We examine how hierarchical distance between an idea's creator and its evaluator affects evaluation outcomes and thus advance three competing theoretical predictions based on homophily, competition, and status. To test our predictions, we use a unique dataset from an enterprise crowdfunding initiative at Siemens where 265 employees evaluated 77 ideas by allocating corporate funds, resulting in 20, 405 evaluation dyads. We find that idea evaluations are more favorable if the idea creator is hierarchically similar to the evaluator, thus supporting the homophily perspective. Idea novelty amplifies this bias, inducing more social evaluations. Our findings are robust to various <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests,</b> and are absent in a subsample where idea creators remained anonymous. We contribute to the idea evaluation research and inform organizational idea selection process designs...|$|E
40|$|A new Linac using superconducting Quarter-Wave Resonators (QWRs) {{is under}} {{construction}} at CERN {{in the framework of}} the HIE-ISOLDE project. The QWRs are made by niobium sputtered on a bulk copper substrate. The working frequency at 4. 5 K is 101. 28 MHz and they will provide 6 MV/m accelerating gradient on the beam axis with a total maximum power dissipation of 10 W. The properties of the cavity substrate have a direct impact on the final cavity performance. The copper substrate has to ensure an optimum surface for the niobium sputtered layer. It has also to fulfil the required geometrical tolerances, the mechanical stability during operation and the thermal performance to optimally extract the RF dissipated power on cavity walls. The paper presents the mechanical design of the high β cavities. The procurement process of the copper raw material is detailed, including <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests.</b> The manufacturing sequence of the complete cavity is then explained and the structural and thermo-mechanical behaviour during the tests performed on a prototype cavity...|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} in the economic literature that restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion reduces the demand for abortion. The unresolved question is whether such restrictions also increase safe sex (that is, pregnancy avoidance) behavior among women. This study explores that issue using state-level gonorrhea rates among women for 1975 - 95. The rationale is that sexual behavior that leads to greater risk of accidental pregnancies {{is likely to be}} highly correlated with sexual behavior leading to greater risk of STD infection. Since gonorrhea has an incubation period of about a week, and is transmitted almost exclusively through sexual intercourse, a change in sexual behavior should soon be followed by a change in gonorrhea rates. The study used a partial adjustment model with lagged dependent variables estimated using Arellano-Bond’s GMM method. Results fail to find any statistically significant evidence that Medicaid funding restrictions are effective in reducing gonorrhea rates. This finding is robust to a variety of alternate <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests.</b> This suggests that restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion fail to promote safe sex behavior among women. ...|$|E

40|$|What determines {{vertical}} scope? Transactions cost economics (TCE) {{has been}} the dominant paradigm for understanding "make" vs. "buy" choices. However, the traditional focus on empirically validating or refuting TCE has taken attention away from other possible drivers of scope, and it has rarely allowed us to understand the explanatory power of TCE versus other competing theories. This paper, using a particularly rich panel dataset from the Mortgage Banking industry, explores both {{the extent to which}} TCE predictions hold, and their ability to explain the variance in scope, when compared to all other possible drivers of integration. Using some direct measures of transaction costs, we observe that integration does mitigate risks; yet such risks and transaction costs do not seem to drive firm-level decisions of integration in retail production of loans. Rather, capability-driven and capacity- (or limit to growth-) driven considerations explain a significant amount of variance in our sample, under a variety of <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests.</b> We thus conclude that while TCE explanations of vertical scope are important, their impact is dwarfed by capability differences and by the desire of firms to leverage their capabilities and productive capacity by using the market.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{relationship}} between individual skills and labour market performance of immigrants residing in Lombardy during the period 2001 - 2005. We use a recent dataset collected by the NGO ISMU, which includes information on individual characteristics and the legal status of each immigrant. Our results show that returns on schooling are positive and range from 0. 8 per cent to 0. 9 per cent, a figure that is much lower than the one estimated for native Italians. This result is robust to a number of <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests.</b> In particular, it is not influenced by the legal status of the alien or by a possible self-selection in the labour supply. Moreover, although more talented immigrants tend to self-select in the Lombardy region compared with the other Italian regions, their return on schooling remains low compared with natives. We also show that a certain heterogeneity exists across educational levels and countries of origin: immigrants from Eastern Europe are better able to exploit their human capital, especially when they hold a university degree, while the school-wage profile of Latin Americans and Asians is basically flat. Finally, there is some evidence of a cohort effect in migration, but this tends to impact on the return on experience rather than on the return on schooling.

We find evidence that is {{not consistent with the}} MPA.

We show that consultants exert a negative influence on basic (cash) pay. In addition, we illustrate that the choice of hiring a consultant can be explained by economic determinants, e. g., firm governance characteristics. The existence of a powerful CEO does not increase the likelihood of hiring a pay consultant. The results are robust to several model <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> for selection bias.
