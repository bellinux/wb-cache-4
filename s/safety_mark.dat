25|$|Two {{first quarter}} field goals from Septien gave Dallas an early 6-0 lead before Tampa Bay {{converted}} two turnovers into 10 points. First, quarterback Danny White lost a fumble that was recovered in mid air by Bucs linebacker Hugh Green, who {{took off for}} a 60-yard touchdown return. The Cowboys responded with a drive to the Tampa Bay 38, but on third down, <b>safety</b> <b>Mark</b> Cotney intercepted White's pass and returned it 50 yards to set up Bill Capece's 32-yard field goal.|$|E

Stoyanovich finished the drive with a 22-yard field goal that cut their deficit down to one score, 27-20. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Dolphins 27, but this time their defense was up to the task and Kelly was intercepted by safety Jarvis Williams on the 2. However, Miami could not pick up a first down pinned deep in their own territory. Marino tried to go deep on third down, but Bills <b>safety</b> <b>Mark</b> Kelso picked him off at the Dolphins 48, leading to a 28-yard Norwood field goal that gave the Bills a 30-20 lead.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} an Ohio Stadium-record crowd of 105,711, the Nittany Lions got their first win at Ohio State since 1978 by {{defeating}} the Buckeyes 13–6 in a game where both offenses were held below their season averages. The turning point of the game occurred {{early in the fourth}} quarter with Ohio State holding a three-point lead and facing a 3rd-and-1. <b>Safety</b> <b>Mark</b> Rubin tackled Buckeyes quarterback Terrelle Pryor and forced a fumble recovered by linebacker NaVorro Bowman. Backup quarterback Pat Devlin, in for an injured Daryll Clark, scored on a quarterback sneak for the only touchdown of the game. After Kevin Kelly's second field goal, the Buckeyes last drive was ended with an interception by cornerback Lydell Sargeant at the goal line, Pryor's second turnover of the game.

25|$|There {{would be}} no more scoring until 5:45 {{remained}} in the half, when the Packers suddenly buried St. Louis with three consecutive touchdowns. First, Cardinals safety Benny Perrin slipped while covering James Lofton in the end zone, and Dickey threw him the ball for a 20-yard score. Then Packers linebacker George Cumby recovered Stump Mitchell's fumble on the Packers 39. Dickey's subsequently completed a 30-yard pass to Jefferson and Eddie Lee Ivery broke off an 18-yard run before finishing the drive with a 2-yard rushing score. Two plays later, <b>safety</b> <b>Mark</b> Murphy intercepted Neil Lomax's pass and returned it 22 yards to the Cardinals 12-yard line, setting up Dickey's 4-yard touchdown toss to Ivery that gave Green Bay a 28-3 lead. St. Louis managed to respond with Lomax's 5-yard touchdown pass to Pat Tilley with nine seconds left in the half, but Lewis blocked the extra point, and their 28-9 halftime deficit ended up being as close as the score would ever get.|$|E
