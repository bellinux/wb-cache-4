Although [...] "growing the fleet" [...] was still an essential ingredient {{to the growth of}} the gas turbine service business, the lack of new-unit opportunities at the time dictated at least a temporary shift in emphasis. CTSD developed the [...] "Total Service" [...] program, promoting capabilities in outage management and availability improvement programs. [...] "Total Service - More Than Just Parts" [...] became the mantra. (This writer recalls the National Sales Meeting in Orlando ca. 1983, prior to completion of the new office building at the Quadrangle, and the theme of the meeting was [...] "We’re in the Service Now". The entire Steam Turbine Generator Marketing operation was reorganized around the operating plant market.) ...|$|E

The following step was to demerge the Travel Retail business and list Duty Free S.p.A.(1 October 2013) on the stock market operated by Borsa Italiana, thus launching a new phase of growth for both companies. Tondato is currently also chairman of World Duty Free S.p.A.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949 in Bregenz on Lake Constance (Austria), a {{city with}} a genuine textile heritage, the {{industrialist}} Reinhold Wolff from Vorarlberg (Austria) and the retail entrepreneur Walter Palmers (*1903, †1983) from Vienna founded a company called Wolff & Co. KG, focussing on the production of women's stockings made from real and artificial silk. They customized used American Cotton machines specifically for their own purposes, {{and for the first time}} processed polyamide fiber into stockings. The following year, the Wolford brand was officially registered. The brand name is an acronym of the name of the founder Reinhold Wolff and the city of Oxford. It should be internationally applicable. The international expansion began in the 1970s. In 1988, the company carried out a <b>strategic</b> <b>refocusing</b> and positioned its products in the luxury segment, which continues to today and is still being expanded. In addition to that, in April 1988, the company was transformed into a stock corporation. On February 14, 1995 Wolford went public with the so-called [...] "Lady Share" [...] in Vienna and Paris.The company made its mark over the years mainly due to its new seamless products, e.g. tights and bodysuits, as well as collaborations with designers such as Karl Lagerfeld, Emilio Pucci, Zac Posen, Kenzo, Valentino and Vivienne Westwood. Further, co-operations with photographers such as Helmut Newton and Mario Testino contributed to the brand awareness.|$|E

As part of this divestment, Arkema made a 100 million euro cash payment to the Klesch group and took on debts amounting to 470 million euros to help revive the activity. In response to fears of redundancy and to protests from employees {{at a number of}} production sites, the trade unions negotiated, with the Arkema management, industrial and social guarantees as well as support measures designed {{to protect the rights of}} employees should the Klesch group implement redundancies following their take-over of the vinyl products activities. Hence two trust funds of €20 M were set up to secure compensation payments and the rights of employees of the companies that were sold off.2012 : as part of its <b>strategic</b> <b>refocusing</b> on specialty chemicals, Arkema acquired a new visual identity as well as a new signature [...] "Innovative Chemistry".2015 : in February the company finalized the purchase of Bostik from Total S.A..|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{trades of}} wholly- or partially-owned subsidiaries between firms {{listed on the}} Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) for the years 1996 to 2010, to explore the economic impact in terms of <b>strategic</b> <b>refocusing,</b> stock market valuation and performance effects. By pairing both sides to each deal, we show differences in firm characteristics, returns, and subsequent performance of buying and selling firms. Unlike mergers between whole firms, most subsidiary deals straddled different industries. Most sellers were larger, more diversified and less profitable than buyers. Our event study reveals that abnormal returns were positive for buyers yet insignificantly different from zero for sellers. However, subsidiary sales in the core business earned negative returns, the more so the larger the deal. An analysis of ex-post operating results shows that the performance of sellers often declined after the trade, in particular for firms that divested a core-related subsidiary. We conclude that subsidiary trades in Japan in this period contributed importantly to strategic repositioning and a more efficient use of corporate assets...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of Labour Force Survey data from May 1997 to May 2000 {{suggests that the}} long-term decline in labour force participation for older Australian men has recently abated. This shift may be already reflecting {{the emergence of a}} new set labour market conditions linked to the declining rate of growth of the Australian labour force due to population ageing. The data show that the growth in the employment of men in older age groups has exceeded the growth of these groups due to population ageing. Further, older men are satisfying employer demand in a range of occupations, including higher-skilled occupations and, in the majority of cases, on a full-time basis. The paper argues that the challenge of ensuring a vibrant and responsive economy can be met despite labour force ageing if sufficient resources are committed to Australia’s human capital development and if sufficient measures are taken to stem the incidence of early retirement. It is further argued that a decisive shift in strategic outlook by national leaders would be necessary to the success of an intensive human capital approach to maintaining productivity growth. Whereas the 1980 s and 1990 s were dominated by a preoccupation with capital widening and aggregate economic growth, premised on population growth, a human capital based response to labour market ageing would require a <b>strategic</b> <b>refocussing</b> upon per capita economic growth...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis is a {{communicable}} bacterial disease. Although curable, globally {{two million}} people die and nine million new cases occur annually. Early detection and diagnosis reduce transmission and optimise patient health outcomes. Cambodia, a country with high tuberculosis burden, implements an innovative public/private mix Referral Program referring symptomatic clients from private pharmacies to public sector clinics for timely care. Using Cambodia’s Referral Program as a case study, the aim of research {{was to investigate the}} role of private pharmacies in tuberculosis control. To gain insight into contextual issues qualitative research comprised in-depth interviews with Referral Program stakeholders at strategic level and focus group discussions with pharmacy-based referral providers at operational level. Quantitative research comprised an interview survey with pharmacy-based providers to investigate referral-associated factors and providers’ clinical responses to symptomatic clients. Strong stakeholder collaboration contributed to successful Program management. <b>Strategic</b> <b>refocus</b> was considered essential to ensure sustainability. Referral was associated with pharmacies’ commitment to the Program. However, referral was negatively associated with compliance with protocols perceived to adversely impact client relationships. Cambodia’s Referral Program provided a promising model for involving pharmacies in tuberculosis control. Building sustainable capacity within pharmacy-based partnerships will be essential in making significant contribution to tuberculosis control.

40|$|During {{periods of}} radical {{organisational}} change two elements - namely the organisation's strategy {{and its people}} - are affected profoundly. <b>Strategic</b> change involves <b>refocusing</b> the organisation {{in a direction that}} has little bearing on its past. People are affected by changes, as they are displaced {{to other parts of the}} organisation in different roles, or perhaps, are removed under the euphemism of de-layering, rightsizing and re-engineering. Hence, rather than enhance knowledge, senior managers inadvertently destroy knowledge during a radical organisational change. Yet pressures to change and the pace of change are unrelenting. Senior managers are forced to take an approach that can be summarised as ''change first - limit the damage to knowledge later''. Thus, this paper argues that organisations need a process to manage knowledge during periods of radical organisational change. The paper proposes such a process through case study evidence. It highlights actions managers take to ensure that they navigate the paradox of leading the organisation through radical change and nurture knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} on turnarounds has given considerable importance to measures like retrenchment, cost control and other operative measures, but {{the role of}} strategic change has been undermined so far. This work is centred at analysing the role of strategy in turnarounds. For the purpose of study an already identified turnaround company is chosen from Wild (2010) paper, to have no doubts regarding its qualification to the criteria. A case study approach prevalent to Business History Literature is adopted to analyse the role of strategic factors initiating turnarounds, {{in the light of}} resource base view theory. Special attention has been given to the criteria of defining company’s expansion in terms of organic & acquisitive growth, and how they have an impact in turnaround. The study finds that strategic factors like: <b>Strategic</b> Acquisitions, Diversification/ <b>Refocusing</b> and Changes in Management can {{play a major role in}} reviving company’s performance. It reveals that selection of an appropriate case following a contextual method of analysis in the light of resource base view theory can have an impact on the research findings.

40|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{turnaround}} literature focusses on the {{actions taken by}} firms to turnaround decline although actions tend to be objective and not specific to distinct turnaround situations. The lack of focus on decline, however, is certainly not encouraging given {{that it is a}} common factor in all turnaround cases. Declines and turnarounds are a regular occurrence which leads this research to question the sustainability of turnarounds. The scenario where firms slip back into decline after turnaround is a case of turnaround reversal and it could mean that they have not addressed the causes for decline properly or {{have not been able to}} adapt to new changes in the market and/or industry. This research attempts to understand turnaround reversals and its causes by applying an exhaustive case research method. A robust case selection methodology was applied to FTSE All Share companies and Taylor Wimpey was selected for detailed case analysis. The case study proceeded to examine three distinct phases in Taylor Wimpey’s history covering a period of 20 years (fiscal years 1992 – 2011) supported by a wealth of primary and secondary data on the company. With the application of contemporary turnaround processes such as restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, <b>strategic</b> leadership, repositioning, <b>refocusing</b> and diversification this study was able to understand turnaround reversals and the gain valuable insight into the sustainability of turnarounds. This study also hopes to be the stepping stone to further studies on turnaround sustainability and reversals...|$|R
