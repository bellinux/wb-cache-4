25|$|From the Riga to Minox B, {{the film}} counter counts up to 50, while from Minox BL, C, to TLX, the film counter counts down from 36/30/15. For {{mechanical}} Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate shutter speed dial sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (BL has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, the <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> starts with 1/15 sec, {{and ends with}} 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an 'A' setting for automatic exposure, controlled by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) exposure meter.|$|E

50|$|The Konica Hexar RF meters for {{exposure}} either by aperture priority auto-exposure (with AE lock and +/-2EV exposure compensation) or in metered-manual mode. Aperture priority is selected by setting the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> {{to either the}} AE or AE lock position. Manual exposure is set by selecting a specific shutter speed on the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> (there is a central interlock button to prevent accidentally moving the dial from the AE modes to a manually selected shutter speed).|$|R

5000|$|M6 TTL - 1998-2002. With [...]72 and [...]85 {{viewfinder}} versions. From 2000 the [...]58 viewfinder {{camera for}} eyeglass wearers {{are added to}} the line. Supported TTL flash. The added electronics added 2mm of height to the top plate, and the <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> was reversed from previous models (traditionally, turning clockwise increased shutter speed).|$|E
5000|$|M7 2002- current model (as of 2015). Has TTL exposure, {{aperture}} priority and manual exposure, electronic shutter and two mechanical speeds of 1/60 and 1/125. Comes in [...]58, [...]72, and [...]85 viewfinder formats, each with different brightline framelines. Same taller top plate and counter-clockwise <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> as the M6 TTL. Leica even produced an M7 made of solid titanium, and offered it in a kit with 1 or several like titanium colored lenses.|$|E
50|$|The Pentax ME was an {{aperture}} priority automatic camera, {{with an electronic}} focal plane shutter from 8 s to 1/1000 s, synchronized at 1/100 s. The shutter curtains were metal and had a vertical movement. There was no <b>shutter</b> <b>dial,</b> and the camera {{could not be used}} in manual mode, except for B and 1/100 exposures. The exposure meter was of the standard TTL open aperture center weighted type. It was activated by a slight pressure on the release button.|$|E

50|$|The XG-9's {{integrated}} switch for on/off/self-timer/battery {{check was}} removed and its functions {{spread around the}} camera. The self timer was relocated to a switch {{on the front of}} the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b> The lock button for the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the rewind knob.|$|R
50|$|The design {{echoes the}} 1963 Olympus Pen F half-frame SLR film camera, {{especially}} in the silver top and the chunky front dial, {{a nod to the}} <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> on the film camera.|$|R
5000|$|M6 TTL - 1998 - 2002. The M6 TTL {{replaced}} the M6, which ceased manufacture. Originally available in 0.72 and 0.85 viewfinder versions; in 2000 a 0.58 version of M6 TTL {{was added to}} the line. The lower magnification viewfinder makes it easier to see the 28mm framelines, especially when wearing glasses. The <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> of the M6 TTL is reversed from previous models, turning {{in the same direction as}} the light meter arrows in the viewfinder; this feature has continued in the M7, M8, and M9, but not the MP, which returned to the older, smaller diameter, opposite direction shutter speed dial. One of the key differences from the M6 [...] "Classic" [...] is TTL flash capability with dedicated flash units, such as the SF-20. The added electronics increased the height of the top plate by 2 mm.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 1980s {{competition}} and technical innovations made 35 mm camera systems more versatile and sophisticated by adding more advanced light metering capabilities such as spot-metering; limited area metering such as used by Canon with the F1 series; matrix metering as used by Nikon, exposure communication with dedicated electronic flash units. The user interface also changed on many cameras, replacing meter needle displays that were galvanometer-based and thereby fragile, with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{and then with}} more comprehensive liquid crystal displays (LCDs) both in the SLR viewfinder and externally on the cameras' top plate using an LCD screen. Wheels and buttons replaced the <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> on the camera and the aperture ring on the lens on many models, although some photographers still prefer shutter dials and aperture rings. Some manufacturers introduced image stabilization on certain lenses to combat camera shake and to allow longer hand-held exposures without using a tripod. This feature is especially useful with long telephoto lenses.|$|E
50|$|Only a few {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the original Kine Exakta (version 1) during its production run until it was replaced by the model II in 1948: Within a few months the circular focusing loupe, visible on top of the collapsed finder hood, was substituted for a rectangular one covering about 50% of the ground glass image (version 2). This version also appeared on the North American market as Exacta, spelled with a c (version 3). About a year later, a threaded hole was added at the right-hand front above the flashbulb synchronising contacts for securing the flashgun to the camera (version 4). After the 1939 to 1945 hostilities production of the Exacta version slowly resumed, but with several minor changes to the camera body, among these are: The Ihagee logo no longer appear in relief on the rectangular back door leather patch. The carrying strap eyelets {{on either side of the}} top edge of the camera are inserted between two small protrusions and riveted in place. The right-hand <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> is milled without a groove along the middle of the edge.|$|E
5000|$|Serial numbers above 134xxxx {{are usually}} {{considered}} more reliable as earlier {{problems in the}} production line were resolved by then (i.e. <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> clutch which was made more robust, preventing unwanted slipping of the setting).|$|R
50|$|Much work {{went into}} human factors {{engineering}} {{to create an}} ergonomic user interface for the camera. The form of previous cameras was largely dictated by the required locations of mechanical controls on the body, such as the film advance lever, rewind crank, <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial,</b> <b>shutter</b> release, etc. On the T90, the film transport control is no longer required, while the others are no longer mechanically linked. This gave the designers more freedom to shape the camera {{to make it easier}} to control and hold, and to place controls in a way that suited the user rather than a mechanical design.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} 30 years {{the vast majority}} of SLRs standardized the layout of the controls. The film was transported from left to right, so the rewind crank was on the left, followed in order by the pentaprism, <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial,</b> <b>shutter</b> release and the film advance lever, which in some cameras was ratcheted so that multiple strokes could be used to advance the film. Some cameras, such as Nikon's Nikkormat FT cameras (marketed under the brand-name 'Nikormat' in European countries and elsewhere) and some models of Olympus OM series, deviated from this layout by placing the shutter speed control as a ring around the lens mount.|$|R
50|$|The Booster T Finder and Servo EE Finder {{were both}} {{essentially}} {{variations on the}} standard eye=level finder. The Booster T Finder contained an ultra-sensitive metering cell which could read as low as EV −3.5. Just like the metering range was shifted towards the dark side, this finder also shift the shutter speeds the camera provided towards the long end. Instead of the normal range (1 s - 1/2000 s), the Booster T Finder gave 60 s - 1/60 s. The shutter speed dial on the finder locked on to the camera's normal <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> and drove it through a coupling pin for the standard range of 1 s - 1/60 s. The finder also had a trigger button, which went through the finder down to the normal trigger button. When the Booster's shutter speed dial was turned further, towards longer times, the camera's dial stopped at the B(ulb) setting, and the finder kept the trigger button pressed {{for the duration of}} the exposure. The mechanics of this connection also resulted in the oddity that there was no 2 s setting, but 4, 3 and 1 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the collapsible finder hood is to shield the focusing screen from outside stray light, but by lowering the hinged magnifying glass into the finder for critical focusing, it also becomes a direct vision frame finder. By looking into the rectangular opening {{at the back of}} the hood, it provides the field of view of a 50mm lens, a useful feature since the focusing screen image is laterally reversed, which makes it less useful as an action finder. Pushing a small notch to the side at the lover right on the rear finder hood panel, flips the lowered magnifying glass up and away. The finder panels are stowed away one by one, sides first, and covered by the front lid, which is held down by a hook at the back. The hook is furnished with a release button to erect the hood. A small sector lever close to the <b>shutter</b> <b>dial,</b> with R and V engraved next to it in the top plate, controls the film transportation, R for rewind and V for advance, for Rückwärts and Vorwärts in German. A knob on the left-hand edge of the body slides downwards to release the back, which is not hinged, only hooked onto the right-hand edge just before closing by a firm pressure on the left-hand back.|$|E
5000|$|Two leaf-shuttered lenses {{were also}} made available, first the 90mm 2.8 {{and later a}} 165mm 2.8 that both {{allowing}} flash sync at all speeds, thereby solving many mirror and shutter vibration problems as well as allowing for fast shutter speeds for use with strobes and portable flashes while in bright shooting conditions. Lenses {{are linked to the}} body by the operation of the aperture stop-down lever being tripped. The camera body is set to the [...] "time-exposure" [...] setting. The through-the-lens (TTL) metering pentaprism viewfinder and included a knurled <b>shutter</b> <b>dial</b> ring with fitted case. The TTL-metered Pentaprism is the same coverage as the non-metered pentaprism, a coverage of 90% of frame and has a sensitivity pattern of 60% center-weight and 30% inner field sensitivity. The TTL Metering Pentaprism has no internal power of its own, instead, the operating power comes from one of the three contacts found in the finder bay of the body as well as grounding to the body. Only two of the three contacts are utilized and depending on the two modes: Normal as 'AUTO' mode and in an override to stopdown mode in the 'MAN' mode as found on many equipped lenses. In 'AUTO' is where the lens is fully opened and adjustments are read from the coupled index from the lens-through the index ring of the body mount-to the chain and index shuttle, the TTL-Meter receives the position information via a protruding tab facing the finder bay. The tab operates a linear potentiometer. In 'MAN' or manual mode with so equipped lenses, the sliding of the lens switch will move an internal lever that then presses down on the activating switch in the body. The switch is located inside the pin of the lens release pin. This inner pin is connected to an electrical toggle inside the body and switches the current from body grounded to bay connector to activate the secondary circuit. The installation of the TTL-Meter into the finder bay requires first the removal or turning of the lens to remove tension on the aperture chain. When the lens is rotated to allow the index on the chain to properly match up with the tab under the meter, the finder can then be seated and firmly pressed until the locks {{on either side of the}} finder latch. Removal of the finder is the reverse by first removing the lens and then pressing in the locks on the sides of the finder and lifting out. The physical difference of the TTL-Meter to the regular prism is the bulky arm that extends to the shutter speed dial. The dial covers the body dial and is coupled via a spring loaded index to the shutter speed dial. The included knurled ring assists the reach of the shutter speed dial due to the bulk of the TTL-Meter prism. The stop-down mode or direct metering through while the aperture is allowed to operate and change the amount of light, is similar to the 'MAN' mode, but activates when a non-auto-aperture lens is mounted causing index ring to be positioned to place the meter's linear potenioment into a bypass mode to activate the secondary circuit in the meter. The lens is allowed to stop-down and the light is directly measured, however, the shutter speed dial link operates the same in 'MAN' mode. As did the body receiving improvements over time, so did the TTL-Meter have had some changes. Although the image coverage remained unchanged, the type of metering and the circuitry received some upgrades. CdS (cadmium sulfide) to Gpd (gallium photo diode) photo cells and a two part circuit to a single board to improve response time and reliability. The early version is identified by the single marked 'ON' switch and the meter needle starts from UP to down and the later model has a 'ON' & 'OFF' marked switch and the meter needle starts from BOTTOM to top. The later model would also have the sole PENTAX badge by 1986.|$|E
50|$|The Asahi Pentax series {{went through}} various {{iterations}} until 1964. Each successive model incorporated minor improvements, the most noticeable being {{the incorporation of}} the two <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dials</b> (one for high speeds and one for low speeds) into one. The AP of 1957 is externally almost identical to the 1964 SV.|$|R
50|$|The FT used a metal-bladed, {{vertical}} travel, {{focal plane}} shutter with a speed range of 1 to 1/1000 second plus Bulb and flash X-sync of 1/125th second. The Nikkormat F-series had a shutter speed ring concentric with the lens mount, unlike Nippon Kogaku's other manual focus SLRs with a top mounted <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1979: Asahi Pentax ME Super (Japan): first SLR with {{primarily}} electronic {{push button}} controls. Had increase/decrease push buttons for shutter speed selection {{instead of a}} traditional <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b> As digital computerized SLR features multiplied, push button controls also multiplied and replaced analogue electromechanical dial switches in most 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|CONTAX RTS Fundus - usually marked 'Medical/Scientific' on {{the base}} plate it {{featured}} a 3mm high guard around the shutter release and a lock button on the front plate for the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b> Several of these also had enhanced mirror dampers; most RTS Fundus cameras were sold for laboratory use, especially with Zeiss ophthalmic equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Later on, as body {{serial numbers}} {{approached}} the two million mark, more easily detectable changes were introduced; the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> on chrome cameras became chrome finished with coarse patterned sides. All screws {{are of the}} crosshead variety. The take-up film spool got a grey four-tongued plastic moulding for film attachment. The lens got a scalloped focusing ring.|$|R
50|$|The OM-4 used a {{horizontal}} cloth {{focal plane shutter}} with a manual speed range of one second - 1/2000 second (up to 240 seconds was possible in automatic mode), plus bulb and flash X-sync of 1/60 second. Unlike most SLRs of the era, the OM-4 used a familiar OM-series shutter-speed ring, concentric with the lens mount, instead of a top-mounted <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nippon Kogaku KK, Japan {{introduced}} their high-speed Nikon F2H in 1976. The {{mirror is}} a pellicle {{rather than a}} conventional front surfaced mirror that swings out of the light path when the exposure is made. To identify the F2H, note the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> has no T, B or 1/2000; has no self-timer and has a non-removable Type B focusing screen.|$|R
50|$|Leica {{announced}} the Leica M8.2 on 15 September 2008. The Leica M8.2 includes all the upgrades {{offered in the}} upgrade program, however the black version is coated with black paint (as opposed to the black chrome finish of the standard Leica M8) and black Leica branding dot. An auto S setting producing only JPEGs {{was added to the}} <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1983: Pentax Super A (Japan; called Super Program in USA): first SLR with {{external}} LCD data display. With push buttons for shutter speed selection {{instead of a}} <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial,</b> the Super Program used an LCD to show set shutter speed. As computerized SLR features multiplied, large external LCD panels became normal on virtually all 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Program mode can {{be biased}} towards longer or shorter shutter speeds {{by using the}} <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial.</b> Also in program mode {{automatic}} flash exposure was fully controlled by the camera: off in daylight conditions, fill in flash with low light, full flash when dark. Normal flash synchronisation speed is 1/250s and with suitable flash units can {{be up to the}} camera's highest speed of 1/8000s.|$|R
50|$|When {{using the}} AE finder, setting the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> to 'A' engages a small {{switch on the}} finder which puts the camera into aperture-priority auto {{exposure}} mode. The normal meter display {{to the right of}} the through-the-lens (TTL) image disappears from the viewfinder, and a different meter display appears below the TTL image, which indicates which shutter speed the AE system has chosen.|$|R
5000|$|Optional {{vertical}} grip MB-D200 holds {{one or two}} EN-EL3E lithium-ion or six AA {{batteries in}} holder tray, provides vertical <b>shutter</b> release, command <b>dials,</b> and AF-ON button; Vertical grip/wireless transmitter WT-3 available Spring 2006.|$|R
50|$|Built-in light {{metering}} with SLRs {{started with}} clip-on selenium cells meters. One such meter {{was made for}} the Nikon F which coupled to the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial</b> and the aperture ring. While the selenium cell area was big, the add-on made the camera look clumsy and unattractive. In order for built-in light metering {{to be successful in}} SLR cameras, the use of Cadmium Sulfide Cells (CdS) was imperative.|$|R
50|$|Previous {{screw mount}} Leicas used two {{separate}} <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dials</b> for slow and fast speeds (the fast speed dial {{on top of}} the camera rotated during firing). The M3 combined slower and faster speeds and the dial does not rotate during firing. Supposedly, this reduces vibrations in the camera. Early models used a non-geometrical series of shutter speeds. On later models this became the international standard of 1s to 1/1000s.|$|R
50|$|Full-program auto-exposure soon {{followed}} {{with the advent}} of the Canon A-1 in 1978. This SLR had a 'P' mode on the <b>shutter</b> speed <b>dial,</b> and a lock on the aperture ring to allow the lens to be put on 'Auto' mode. Other manufacturers {{soon followed}} with Nikon introducing the FA, Minolta introducing the X-700 in 1981, and Pentax introducing the Super Program. Olympus, however, continued with 'aperture-priority' automation in their OM system line.|$|R
