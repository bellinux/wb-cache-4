5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot <b>spoilers,</b> the producers decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience. The producers also instigated the rumor that multiple endings would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spoiler</b> and Natalia {{developed}} a friendship and <b>Spoiler</b> shared {{a great amount}} of personal information with Natalia while her nose was not plugged. When her nose was plugged, she was able to control what she said and how she behaved around Natalia. After <b>Spoiler</b> contacted Natalia's estranged mother, Natalia fled from her. Robin and <b>Spoiler</b> eventually found her as she was being confronted by Prescott. After a mental showdown, Prescott flees from Robin and <b>Spoiler</b> and dies from electrocution on an underground railway. <b>Spoiler</b> then convinced Natalia to return to STAR Labs for further testing; otherwise, she would contact her mother again.|$|R

Jessica Shea, Community Manager at 343 Industries, warned fans {{to be wary of}} Halo 4 <b>spoilers</b> that were posted on the internet. O'Connor stated at New York Comic Con that leaks of the game and footage would not have any impact on how the game is released or marketed and that unlicensed uploading of high-profile games is inevitable.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual <b>spoilers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fine Brothers have {{a popular}} series where they spoil {{a variety of}} topics ranging from books to films to video games. The first episode of their Spoiler series, 100 Movie <b>Spoilers</b> in 5 Minutes – (Movie Endings Ruined), was {{uploaded}} on YouTube on November 11, 2008. With over 2.7million video views as of July 28, 2014, the episode is also the most popular of the series. The brothers also uploaded a video containing <b>spoilers</b> of the first seven Harry Potter films in roughly seven minutes on July 13, 2011. The Fine Brothers spoiled 47 years in roughly 6 minutes of the popular series, Doctor Who, and released subsequent sequels in preparations for the premieres of series 8 & 9 respectively. Other TV shows that have had spoiler videos made about them have included Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Orange Is the New Black. Additionally, the Fine Bros put up a video each month spoiling 50 viral videos that have circulated on YouTube and other sources during the previous month.|$|E

Her music caused everyone in the theater, including Robin, to cry; with the exception of <b>Spoiler</b> (who was recovering from a cold). Outside the theater, she is attacked by an unknown man, but rescued by <b>Spoiler.</b> She refuses to share her name with Stephanie to provide to the police. This causes <b>Spoiler</b> to become suspicious of her, and eventually <b>Spoiler</b> and Robin perform a stakeout at the theater where she performs. During her performance, <b>Spoiler</b> cries but Robin (who has his nose plugged) is unmoved by Natalia's music. <b>Spoiler</b> later track Natalia to her apartment and helps her save her scientific research papers when it is discovered that her apartment is on fire.|$|R
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual <b>spoilers.</b> When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 a Boeing 747, {{operating}} as Pan Am 845 struck approach light structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control {{of some of the}} <b>spoilers,</b> ailerons, and one inboard elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing. There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard <b>spoilers,</b> the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more recently, an additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as <b>spoilers</b> for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is {{moving out of the}} ACC and into the Big Ten, the future of this series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and <b>spoilers.</b> Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time jump in the episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of <b>spoilers,</b> the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>spoiler</b> {{is a term}} {{describing}} an application, {{the operation}} of a <b>spoiler</b> varies depending on the particular effect it's trying to spoil. Most common <b>spoiler</b> functions include disrupting some type of airflow passing over and around a moving vehicle. A common <b>spoiler</b> diffuses air by increasing amounts of turbulence flowing over the shape, [...] "spoiling" [...] the laminar flow and providing a cushion for the laminar boundary layer. However, other types of airflow may require the <b>spoiler</b> to operate differently and take on vastly different physical characteristics.|$|R
40|$|This paper numerically {{studies the}} {{influence}} of the downward <b>spoiler</b> deflection on the boundary layer flow of a high-lift two-element airfoil consisting of a droop nose, a main wing, a downward deflecting <b>spoiler</b> and a single slotted flap. Both of the boundary layer of the upper surface of the <b>spoiler</b> and the confluent boundary layer of the upper surface of the flap become thicker, as the downward <b>spoiler</b> deflection increases. Compared to the attached flow at the angle of attack of 10 °, the flow of the upper surface of the <b>spoiler</b> becomes separated at the angle of attack of 16 ° when the <b>spoiler</b> deflection is large enough, which corresponds to the boundary layer flow reversal in velocity profiles...|$|R

5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, with the Doctor {{reading from a}} pulp novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal <b>spoilers</b> and tears out the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that {{anything}} she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the <b>spoilers</b> did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The <b>spoilers</b> {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E
40|$|The {{flow field}} {{generated}} by a two-dimensional airfoil with a statically deflected flap type <b>spoiler</b> has been experimentally studied. Subsonic tests ascertained the effect of varying <b>spoiler</b> deflection and angle of attack on the flow field at two Reynolds numbers. Measurements of the mean and fluctuating surface pressures and velocities in the wake, along with schlieren flow visualization of the near wake, were made. The results pertaining to the unsteady characteristics of the <b>spoiler</b> flow field are presented. It is shown that vortex shedding characterized the <b>spoiler</b> wake and determines the unsteady nature of the overall flow field; {{the character of the}} vortex shedding changes with <b>spoiler</b> deflection; and the fluctuating surface pressure field (vortex shedding frequency component) is of appreciable magnitude at large <b>spoiler</b> deflections...|$|R
40|$|The steady/unsteady {{flow field}} {{generated}} by a typical two dimensional airfoil with a statically deflected flap type <b>spoiler</b> was investigated. Subsonic wind tunnel tests were made over a range of parameters: <b>spoiler</b> deflection, angle of attack, and two Reynolds numbers; and comprehensive measurements of the mean and fluctuating surface pressures, velocities in the boundary layer, and velocities in the wake. Schlieren flow visualization of the near wake structure was performed. The mean lift, moment, and surface pressure characteristics are in agreement with previous investigations of <b>spoiler</b> aerodynamics. At large <b>spoiler</b> deflections, boundary layer character affects the static pressure distribution in the <b>spoiler</b> hingeline region; and, the wake mean velocity fields reveals a closed region of reversed flow aft of the <b>spoiler.</b> It is shown that the unsteady flow field characteristics are as follows: (1) the unsteady nature of the wake is characterized by vortex shedding; (2) {{the character of the}} vortex shedding changes with <b>spoiler</b> deflection; (3) the vortex shedding characteristics are in agreement with other bluff body investigations; and (4) the vortex shedding frequency component of the fluctuating surface pressure field is of appreciable magnitude at large <b>spoiler</b> deflections.
