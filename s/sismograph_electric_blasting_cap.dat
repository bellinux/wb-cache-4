50|$|McVeigh {{rented a}} storage {{space in which}} he stockpiled seven crates of 18 in Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 <b>electric</b> <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the 40000 lb of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as {{he did not believe}} it to be {{powerful}} enough (although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills, liquid nitromethane, a piece of Tovex sausage, and a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.|$|R
5000|$|I {{believe that}} this moral {{obligation}} far overrides our obligation to obey man-made laws. ...I {{felt that it was}} necessary to begin the development of a resistance movement that could carry out sabotage and expropriations... Hansen, in her closing words at trial On the night of July 27, 1982, a British Columbia Department of Highways explosives storehouse north of Squamish was entered, and 38.5 cases of dynamite were stolen. On September 13, a local hunter came upon two wooden structures that had been built in the forests of Garibaldi, near the site of the theft. One contained four reels of detonating cord and three boxes of <b>electric</b> <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> and the other building held 28.5 cases of dynamite, as well as explosive gelatins. This indicates that ten crates of dynamite were not stored in the wooden structures, to which Taylor and Hansen held keys.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} an electromagnetic (EM) fire warning alarm sys-tem for underground mines. The system generates a magnetic field for through-the-earth signal trans-mission to microreceivers carried by individual miners. EM fields can induce electric currents in metallic conductors; if an EM transmitting antenna and an <b>electric</b> <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> array are too close, the field could induce a current in the blasting array and cause an unintentional initiation of the electric detonators. The USBM conducted tests that define the safe and unsafe regions for using electric detonators near the transmitting antenna of the warning alarm system. The minimum safe distance between a transmitting antenna and a blasting array is the distance where the induced electrical current in the blasting array is 50 mA, which is the safe current level specified in Federal mine safety regulations. Tests indicate that at transmitting power levels of 100 -and 1, 000 -W, separation distances of 9 and 21 m, respectively, were required. These distances are small compared with the dimensions of a mine. Thus, the tests indicate that, with proper placement of the transmitting antenna, the warning system can be used safely in the proximity of blasting arrays...|$|R
50|$|Bickford’s fuse {{not only}} {{dramatically}} improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but {{also contributed to}} the development of dynamite. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding nitroglycerine and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called kieselguhr into individual cylinders. At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and igniting the fuse, it will set the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and producing a current which will travel from the source to the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> will also set off the dynamite.|$|R

50|$|The exploding-bridgewire {{detonator}} (EBW, {{also known}} as exploding wire detonator) {{is a type of}} detonator used to initiate the detonation reaction in explosive materials, similar to a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> because it is fired using an electric current. EBWs use a different physical mechanism than <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> using more electricity delivered much more rapidly, and explode in a much more precise timing after the electric current is applied, by the process of exploding wire method. This has led to their common use in nuclear weapons.|$|R

5000|$|A {{detonator}} {{contains an}} easy-to-ignite primary explosive {{that provides the}} initial activation energy to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include mercury fulminate, lead azide, lead styphnate and tetryl and DDNP. <b>Blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and some detonators are stored separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe.
