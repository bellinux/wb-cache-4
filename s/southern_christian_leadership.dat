5|$|The Birmingham campaign, or Birmingham {{movement}}, was {{a movement}} organized in early 1963 by the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference (SCLC) to {{bring attention to}} the integration efforts of African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama.

This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is on <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> as a {{theological}} and academic field of study, rather than on the praxis of <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership.</b> We define <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> and note the varying ecclesial, theological and social contexts within which research in the field of <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> is conducted. We discuss some trends and areas of interest that emerge from within African and European contexts, especially those of South Africa and Germany. In the article, we show how research in <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> is linked to other disciplines, both theological and non-theological. Finally, we identify key areas of research and methodological issues relevant to the field of <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership,</b> particularly in relation to the disciplines of Practical Theology and Theological Ethics. We give special credit to Schleiermacher who defined Practical Theology as the �theory of church leadership�. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> is understood as a trans-disciplinary field of study that draws on both theological and other disciplines (such as Management Sciences, Psychology and Sociology). <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> can be pursued as a distinct discipline or a trans-disciplinary field of study, but it cannot be pursued in isolation. </p...|$|R

5|$|Ford {{was born}} in New Orleans, Louisiana; his parents were leaders in the African American community. Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations. He was expelled by the university, despite it being historically black, because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation. Ford {{was a member of}} the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King, Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People's Campaign. He was arrested 73 times for participating in protests during the civil rights movement. In 1973, he won a draft evasion trial on basis of conscientious objection. Ford worked as a car salesman and later became a full-time legislator. Ford is a lifelong bachelor.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded the <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral {{authority}} and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests {{in the service of}} civil rights reform. One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, The Freedom Singers, Charles Evers, Cleveland Robinson, Randolph Blackwell, Annie Bell Robinson Devine, Charles Kenzie Steele, Alfred Daniel Williams King, Benjamin Hooks, Aaron Henry and Bayard Rustin.|$|E

40|$|My purpose {{with this}} essay {{has been to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> and Psychical Education (PE) leadership can enrich each other. Thru literature studies I examined the issues: What {{is the meaning of}} <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> and what is the meaning of leadership for a PE teacher? The chapter stressed the importance of discovering your own <b>leadership</b> style within <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership,</b> and having a clear vision from God. The leadership of the PE teacher aimed more at strengthening the students and having a good attitude towards them. The attitude towards students is critical to the social climate. I selected three PE teachers and two priests for the quality interview. I showed {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} qualitative interview and I believe validity was good. The results section examined: Can <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> and PE leadership enrich each other? One of the main points was what one of the respondents said: It´s interesting with the dialogue and talks. Through conversation between church and school, leadership could be enriched to a higher degree, since <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> is clearer in the ethics questions and the PE focuses more on teambuilding. The conclusions I drew was that different kinds of leadership can enrich in different ways in the leadership puzzle, which is solved by individuals. Through conversation and dialogue we can learn from each other and grow as leaders. I have in this essay shown that an exchange between PE teachers and the <b>Christian</b> <b>leadership</b> would enrich both sides...|$|R
