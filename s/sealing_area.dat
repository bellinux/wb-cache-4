50|$|The {{elliptic}} chamber {{is called}} a 'cam ring' by the industry. As a vane moves into, say, a maximum extension, and then rotates into a minimum extension region of the cam ring, it passes through a gradual transition from maximum to minimum followed by a gradual transitionback to maximum and this happens twice per revolution. In order to prevent oil under pressure from bypassing the vanes, 4 sealing areasare created by means of 4 kidney shaped ports located in the transition areas between minimum and maximum. The spaces between the kidney ports are called the sealing areas and this port system is located at either, or both axial ends of the rotor and vanes. The configuration of the ports and sealing areas are such that the space between any two adjacent vanes is slightly less than the coverage ofthe <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> In other words, as the vanes rotate through the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> for {{a small amount of}} rotation, both adjacent vanes arewithin the <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> As the rotation continues, the first vane in line leaves the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> but not before the next vane in succession is firmly in the sealing region.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect is}} to prevent the {{exchange}} of oil from any two adjacent chambers located {{on either side of}} a given <b>sealing</b> <b>area</b> and the oil can only be interchanged by the actual rotation of the rotor and vanes. This is the pumping mechanism for the historical vane pump or motor. The term 'pressure balanced' {{comes from the fact that}} pressure in any chamber is matched by the same pressure in the diametrically opposite chamber and the hydraulic radial side thrust calculated by a 'side view area' and the two forces are opposite and cancel; hence the name'pressure balanced'.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire <b>sealing</b> <b>area.</b> Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|E
40|$|A fatal {{explosion}} in a <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> at the Sago Mine in 2006 prompted researchers and regulators in the United States to re-examine {{the requirements for}} explosion-resistant mine seals. Seals are used in underground coal mines to isolate abandoned mining areas from active workings. Prior to the Sago disaster, mining regulations required seals to withstand a 140 kPa explosion pressure. Recent research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory showed that pressures from explosions can far exceed this pressure. U. S. mining regulations now require much stronger seals. Current research focuses on understanding the science, engineering and management of <b>sealed</b> <b>areas</b> of coal mines. Scientific efforts seek understanding of how explosive methane-air mixtures accumulate using measurements and models of the <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmosphere. Additional scientific efforts aim to understand the explosion pressures that can develop {{using a combination of}} numerical modeling and experiments. Engineering efforts aim to produce design guidelines for seals that can resist the new higher pressure design criteria. NIOSH researchers are also developing guidance for monitoring of <b>sealed</b> <b>area</b> atmospheres and inertization of potentially explosive gas mixtures within <b>sealed</b> <b>areas.</b> This paper seeks to encourage scientific discussion among international peers since preventing explosions within <b>sealed</b> <b>areas</b> is of interest to underground coal operators and regulators...|$|R

50|$|Blister packs are {{commonly}} used as unit-dose packaging for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or lozenges. Blister packs can provide barrier protection for shelf life requirements, and a degree of tamper resistance. In the US, blister packs are mainly used for packing physician samples of drug products or for over-the-counter (OTC) products in the pharmacy. In {{other parts of the}} world, blister packs are the main packaging type since pharmacy dispensing and re-packaging are not common. A series of blister cavities is sometimes called a blister card or blister strip as well as blister pack. The difference between a strip pack and blister pack is that a strip pack does not have thermo-formed or cold formed cavities; the strip pack is formed around the tablet {{at a time when it}} is dropped to the <b>sealing</b> <b>area</b> between sealing moulds. In some parts of the world the pharmaceutical blister pack is known as a push-through pack (PTP), an accurate description of two key properties (i) the lidding foil is brittle, making it possible to press the product out while breaking the lidding foil and (ii) a semi-rigid formed cavity being sufficiently collapsible to be able to dispense the tablet or capsule by means of pressing it out with the thumb. Breaking the lidding foil with a fingernail for the appropriate tablet will make the pressing out easier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The onset and {{development}} of cavitation in the annular needle seat passage of piezo-driven outward-opening pintle injector nozzles used with spray-guided direct-injection gasoline engines are studied using a Eulerian–Lagrangian computational fluid dynamics cavitation model. Cavitation is formed because of the fluid acceleration taking place at the needle <b>sealing</b> <b>area</b> {{and it has been}} found to be affected by its geometric details. Various submodels for nucleation and bubble formation, further bubble growth and collapse, as well as bubble break-up and transport are incorporated into the model. Qualitative model validation is performed against experimental data reported elsewhere in large-scale nozzle replicas, showing similar cavitation patterns to be formed. These consist of vapour pockets rather than a con-tinuous vapour film and develop transiently in a rather chaotic manner around the circumfer-ential needle <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> even under stationary geometry and fixed-flowrate conditions. Further transient effects associated with the fast opening and closing of the piezo-controlled needle valve are also presented...|$|E

This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks – surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 – was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence).

Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. <b>Sealed</b> <b>area</b> had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of lidding films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the leak resistance (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the <b>sealing</b> <b>area</b> of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>area,</b> the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays and multi-layer polymer lidding films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process and lid sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|E
