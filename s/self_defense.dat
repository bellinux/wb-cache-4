50|$|In Force of the Example the {{paradigm}} of exemplary normativity (and of judgment) is discussed {{in relation to the}} contemporary philosophical horizon. During the 20th century, the view that assertions and norms are valid insofar as they respond to principles independent of all local and temporal contexts came under attack from two perspectives: the partiality of translation and the intersubjective constitution of the <b>self.</b> <b>Defenses</b> of context-transcending normativity have then by and large been recast into various forms of proceduralism. In his book, instead, Ferrara tries a strategy centered on the exemplary universalism of judgment for reconciling context-transcending normativity with our pluralistic intuitions. Drawing on Kant's Critique of the Power of Judgment but also on Arendt, Rawls, Dworkin and Habermas, Ferrara outlines a view of exemplary validity designed for today's dilemmas, showing how this notion - for long thought to belong in the domain of aesthetics - can be applied to central issues in political philosophy, including public reason, human rights, radical evil, sovereignty, republicanism and liberalism and religion in the public sphere.|$|R

40|$|Eric Hermelin (1860 - 1944) {{translated}} {{more than}} 10. 000 pages Persian Sufi poetry, German texts by Jakob Böhme and Latin texts by Emmanuel Swedenborg. In the translation process Hermelin shaped his strategies and perceptions in ways which served their patterns of desire, {{and what they}} constructed reflected and served their own unique identity. Added up, the devices which constitute strategies of reading {{set in motion by}} the <b>selfs</b> <b>defense</b> of its identity are: Defenses, Expectations, Fantasies, and Transformations. Hermelin's mystical hermeneutics produced not only understanding of texts, but often no less produced an increased awareness, with appropriate hermeneutical sensitivity, of self-perception and self-identity. A self-awareness and a strengthening of an individual and corporate identity as one who has a stake in the texts and that to which they bear witness constitutes an important reader-effect in this case of Sufi poetry. But without any principle of suspicion, in Gadamer's terminology a premature fusion of horizons will take place before Hermelin has listened in openness with respect for the tension between the horizons of the text and the horizon of Hermelin. The textual horizon has col-lapsed into that of Hermelin's narrative biography, and is unable to do more than to speak back his own valnes and desires. Something socio-pragmatical was after all woven into the controversial bon vivant, when he used literary works to replicate himself. At the same time, the texts spoke from beyond the self...|$|R

5|$|Stuart Lake {{described}} {{in his book}} how Earp single-handedly stood down a large crowd that wanted to lynch gambler Michael O'Rourke (Johnny Behind the Deuce). O'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company—he said in <b>self</b> <b>defense.</b> Henry was well-liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. In fact, the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for standing down the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Johnny Behan. This incident as described by Lake added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman.|$|E

50|$|Vasubandhu's {{critique}} of the <b>Self</b> is a <b>defense</b> of Buddhist Anatman doctrine, and also a {{critique of}} the Buddhist Personalist School and Hindu view of the soul. It is intended to show the unreality of the self or person as over and above the five skandhas (heaps, aggregates which make up an individual). Vasubandhu begins by outlining the soteriological motive for his argument, writing that any view which sees the self as having independent reality (e.g. the Hindu view) is not conductive to Nirvana.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too embarrassed to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular <b>Self</b> <b>Defense</b> (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E

2500|$|The second path, that {{of dynamic}} psychiatry, began in 1924 with {{observations}} by Eugen Bleuler, who {{observed that the}} schizoid person and schizoid pathology were not things to be set apart. [...] Ronald Fairbairn's seminal work on the schizoid personality, from which most {{of what is known}} today about schizoid phenomena is derived, was presented in 1940. Here Fairbairn delineated four central schizoid themes: (1) the need to regulate interpersonal distance as a central focus of concern, (2) the ability to mobilize <b>self</b> preservative <b>defenses</b> and self-reliance, (3) a pervasive tension between the anxiety-laden need for attachment and the defensive need for distance that manifests in observable behavior as indifference, and (4) an overvaluation of the inner world {{at the expense of the}} outer world. Following Fairbairn, the dynamic psychiatry tradition has continued to produce rich explorations on the schizoid character, most notably from writers Nannarello (1953), Laing (1965), Winnicott (1965), Guntrip (1969), Khan (1974), Akhtar (1987), Seinfeld (1991), Manfield (1992) and Klein (1995).|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{changes and}} {{developments}} in defense technology {{have created a}} difficult analytical environment for decision authorities when selecting the best weapon system for their armed forces. Appropriate operations analysis techniques and tools can provide some insight needed for the selection process. The objective of this thesis is to identify and develop suitable Operations Research analytical techniques and tools to aid decision authorities in the Ship <b>Self</b> Air <b>Defense</b> (SSAD) system selection process. The thesis first develops a SSAD system simulation Model (SSAD-Sim) using discrete event simulation techniques and implements it in the Java programming language and Modkit. The simulation is then used to identify appropriate exploratory analysis capabilities including measures of effectiveness evaluation and parameter sensitivity analysis. Exploratory analysis techniques are used to evaluate two different SSAD systems and firing policies. Key parameters analyzed for sensitivity include numbers of trackers, SAM inventory levels and tracker slew delay. As {{a result of the}} success of the SSAD simulation, further component additions and modifications are recommended for further study and development. Turkish Navy author...|$|R

50|$|The sensitive, guilt-ridden {{children}} in the family learn to meet the parent’s needs for gratification {{and try to get}} love by accommodating the whims and wishes of the parent. The child’s normal feelings are ignored, denied and eventually repressed in attempts to gain the parent’s “love”. Guilt and shame keep the child locked into this developmental arrest. Their aggressive impulses and rage become split off and are not integrated with normal development. These children develop a false <b>self</b> as a <b>defense</b> mechanism and become codependent in relationships. The child's unconscious denial of their true self perpetuates a cycle of self-hatred, fearing any reminder of their authentic self.|$|R
40|$|Adult female social wasps {{use their}} mandibles in various {{important}} contexts (Duncan 1939), such as for getting food (mostly arthropod prey) and feeding the larvae, in the col-lecting {{and application of}} materials used in nest construc-tion (mainly wood fibers), in <b>self</b> and colonial <b>defense,</b> in social aggressive interactions, and in other more subtle and less known ways (see for example O’Donnell 2003).

40|$|Integrating terror {{management}} {{theory and}} objective self-awareness theory, we propose the existential escape hypothesis, {{which states that}} people with low self-esteem should be especially prone to escaping self-awareness as a distal response to thoughts of death.

Five studies supported this hypothesis. Individuals low, but not high, in self-esteem scored lower on a measure of private self-awareness (Study 1), showed less implicit self-activation (Studies 2 & 3), {{were more likely to}} choose to write about others than themselves (Study 4), and consumed more alcohol in a field study at a nightclub (Study 5) in response to mortality reminders.
