I don't think it is the role of the BBC to <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on a moral purpose." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's {{very likely}} {{spending}} it now--my money!" [...] Barnes continued. [...] "Here am I living on crusts and four-penny dinners, and begging my way in here, and some {{one else is}} <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> Never mind! It may be my turn yet!

6000|$|... "I have," [...] Savine {{acknowledged}} coolly. [...] "It {{suggested that}} I {{have no intention}} of carrying out my agreement, that I am hoodwinking the authorities for some indefinite purpose mysteriously connected with maintaining our present provincial rulers in power. The thing's absurd on the face of it, when I'm <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> like water, and you ought to know me better. I won't even get the comparatively insignificant bonus until the work is finished." ...|$|R

Now, before you give me any answer, I've {{got to ask you}} a thing or two," [...] and he drew a paper from his pocket. [...] "Are you {{prepared}} to support the abolition of 'tied' houses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she declared, [...] "I won't, but I shall {{wait till}} I find a husband who's charming enough and bad enough. One who'll beat me and swindle me and <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on other women--that's {{the sort of}} man for me. Mr. Dormer, {{delightful}} as he is, doesn't come up to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your money?" [...] said Mr. Hatchard. [...] "To {{hear you}} talk anybody 'ud think you'd got three hundred a year, instead o' thirty.

Why should I <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> keeping you, while you waste yours on pink vases and having friends in to tea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That he wouldn't beat me; or <b>spend</b> all <b>my</b> <b>money</b> if I {{managed to}} have it tied up out of his power; or look down on me with {{contempt}} because my father was an apothecary! Was not that what {{you were going to}} say?" ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{possible}} types {{of health care}} financing {{and the impact of}} regulatory fees on health care. It responds to questions like "Why does health care cost so much? What benefit do I get from <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on books or art or cars or clothes if I am death?" Sick and pain, confronted with the possibility of death, people would be willing to spend almost any amount of money to get their health back. Health care costs so much because people are willing to pay so much for it. The conclusion includes an example of the situation before and after the introduction of regulatory fees in the Czech health system and an analysis of their impact...|$|R
5000|$|Lovell's Tableaux and Kin Series {{include an}} {{abundance}} of antique objects that are symptomatic of Lovell's love of collecting. Lovell has said: [...] "I began collecting hands after I had already been using hands in my work. The more I learned about the iconography of hands, the more excited I was {{to continue with the}} theme. Also, my interest in collecting crayon portraits came simultaneously with the images in the Hand Series, thought I didn't consciously think about it at the time.... There has always been a reason for my wanting to own certain objects more than others. I've tried to be a focused collector, so that I was <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on things that fed the work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help," [...] she said, [...] "what people say. Every one {{has spoken}} of me always {{as being very}} rich, and a good many men have wanted to marry me to <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> That is why I came down here, {{if you want to}} know, Miss Caynsard. I came to escape from a man whom my {{stepmother}} was determined that I should marry, and whom I hated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is a case," [...] said he, [...] "where my dreadful {{money can}} do some good. I am anxious to help Myrtle Dean, for I believe she is deserving of my best offices. But I don't exactly know what to do. She is really your protégé, my dears, and I am {{going to put the}} affair in your hands for settlement.

6000|$|... "Cheap at the price, cheap at the price," [...] Dick {{explained}} to his guardians. [...] "Wouldn't you rather see me <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> in buying professors than in buying race horses and actresses? Besides, {{the trouble with}} you fellows is that you don't know the game of buying brains. I do. That's my specialty. I'm going to make money out of them, and, better than that, I'm {{going to make a}} dozen blades of grass grow where you fellows didn't leave room for half a blade in the soil you gutted." ...|$|E
5000|$|After leaving {{school in}} 1997, she decided against {{going to a}} {{university}} and instead tried a series of different jobs, in journalism, investment banking, publishing, public relations, and stockbroking. She later said [...] "I didn't go to university... I knew I'd have great fun, <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> parents' <b>money,</b> and do very little work. I was also bored with studying." [...] In 1998, she moved with her family to Mells, Somerset.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he went on, {{recovering}} {{himself a}} little, [...] "I {{am going to}} die in this horrible place, and all <b>my</b> <b>money</b> will not even give me a decent funeral. Addison and Roscoe will get it--confound them!--as though they had not got enough already. It makes me mad when I think of those Addison girls <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> or bribing Peers to marry them with it, or something of that sort. I disinherited my own nephew, Eustace, and kicked him out to sink or swim; and now I can't undo it, and I would give anything to alter it! We quarrelled about you, Miss Smithers, because I would not give you any more money for that book of yours. I wish I had given it to you--anything you wanted. I didn't treat you well; but, Miss Smithers, a bargain is a bargain. It would never have done to give way, on principle. You must understand that, Miss Smithers. Don't revenge yourself on me about it, now that I am helpless, because, you see, {{it was a matter of}} principle." ...|$|R

"There was a {{time when}} I didn't know if I was going to do the second Dethklok album, I had the studio lined up, and the players lined up, and the {{engineer}} and co-producer, and all that shit, and unfortunately, the guy we were negotiating with went on vacation and left things kind of dead.

60|$|October 9.--A gracious {{letter from}} Messrs. Abud and Son, bill-brokers, etc.; assure Mr. Gibson {{that they will}} {{institute}} no legal proceedings against me {{for four or five}} weeks. And so I am permitted to <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> and my leisure to improve the means of paying them their debts, for that is the only use of my present journey. They are Jews: I suppose the devil baits for Jews with a pork griskin. Were I not to exert myself, I wonder where their money is to come from.|$|E
6000|$|... "You silly boy!" [...] she said, {{five minutes}} afterwards. [...] "Of course, I {{thought of it}} all along. I never made any secret of it to your father. I told him that our escape was like a fairy tale, and {{that it must have}} the same ending: 'and they married, and lived happy ever after.' He would never have let me have my way with the house, had I not confided in him. He said that I could <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> as I pleased, on myself, but that not one penny should be laid out on his house; and I was obliged to tell him.|$|E
6000|$|Dryfoos did {{not think}} it {{necessary}} to answer such a question. [...] "It's all Fulkerson, Fulkerson, Fulkerson. It seems to me that Fulkerson about runs this family. He brought Mrs. Mandel, and he brought that Beaton, and he brought that Boston fellow! I guess I give him a dose, though; and I'll learn Fulkerson that he can't have everything his own way. I don't want anybody to help me <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> I made it, and I can manage it. I guess Mr. Fulkerson can bear a little watching now. He's been travelling pretty free, and he's got the notion he's driving, maybe. I'm a-going to look after that book a little myself." ...|$|E

[...] "I picked and co-wrote the songs that if I was a guy who would be <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> hard-earned <b>money</b> buying an album I would want to hear." [...] That means {{original}} back-to-basics Southern rock and country-tinged singer/songwriter tunes co-written with A.J.

6000|$|... "I haven't enough," [...] Scott said, smiling. [...] "But I {{have some}} rich {{relations}} who might finance me if I could show them a sure snap. I'd {{like to do}} so, anyhow, because, after <b>spending</b> most all <b>my</b> <b>money,</b> I feel I've got to make good." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2017, he {{told the}} German {{newspaper}} Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung [...] "As a Social Democrat, I attribute exceptional importance to solidarity.

6000|$|... "She {{ran away}} from me some time ago," [...] he went on, [...] "sick to death of me she was. She thought she'd got all my money. She hadn't. There's plenty more, plenty more. She ran away and left me with Mathers. She was paying him so much a week to keep me quiet, not {{to let me go}} {{anywhere}} where I should talk, to keep me away from her so that she could live up here and see all her friends and <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> And at first I didn't mind, and then I did mind, and I got angry with Mathers, and Mathers wouldn't let me come away, and three nights ago I killed Mathers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Said Axel Gunderson, who didn't {{care for}} dancing and social functions: [...] "I've {{got a good}} pay-day. Now I can go home. It is fifteen years since I've seen my mother and all the family. When I pay off, I shall send my money home to wait for me. Then I'll pick a good ship bound for Europe, and arrive there with another pay-day. Put them together, and I'll have more money than ever in my life before. I'll be a prince at home. You haven't any idea how cheap {{everything}} is in Norway. I can make presents to everybody, and <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> like what would seem to them a millionaire, and live a whole year there before I'd {{have to go back}} to sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely I mayn't when it does; but I'm {{likely to}} be poor enough till that happy {{accident}} occurs. But, as far as luck goes, you've had more than me; you won nearly as much, in stakes, as I did, last autumn, and your stable expenses weren't much above a quarter what mine were. But, the truth is, I manage better; I know where my money goes to, and you don't; I work hard, and you don't; I <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on what's necessary to my style of living, you spend yours on what's not necessary. What the deuce have the fellows in Mayo and Roscommon done for you, that you should mount two or three rascals, twice a-week, to show them sport, when you're not there yourself two months in the season? I suppose you don't keep the horses and men for nothing, {{if you do the}} dogs; and I much doubt whether they're not the dearest part of the bargain." ...|$|E

60|$|And I {{sat back}} and marvelled {{secretly}} at this encyclopaedic-minded man, this Leith Clay-Randolph, this common tramp who made himself at home in my den, charmed such friends as gathered at my small table, outshone me with his brilliance and his manners, spent <b>my</b> <b>spending</b> <b>money,</b> smoked <b>my</b> best cigars, and selected from my ties and studs with a cultivated and discriminating eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "After <b>spending</b> all <b>my</b> <b>money</b> and the {{proceeds}} of my watch and diamond, I began to seek employment; {{but no one would}} employ a man without recommendations or antecedents.

I have done odd jobs, at times, but my fortunes went from bad to worse until of late I have become no better than the typical tramp." ...|$|R
6000|$|I sold my voyage in the Edward for {{two hundred}} and fifty dollars, and went back to my landlord, in Water street. Of course, {{everybody}} was glad to see me, a sailor's importance in such places being estimated by the length of his voyage. In Wall street they used to call a man [...] "a hundred thousand dollar man," [...] and in Water, [...] "an eighteen months, or a two years' voyage man." [...] As none but whalers, Indiamen, and Statesmen could hold out so long, we were all A. No. 1, for a fortnight or three weeks. The man-of-war's-man is generally most esteemed, his cruise lasting three years; the lucky whaler comes next, and the Canton-man third. The Edward had been a lucky ship, and, insomuch, I had been a lucky fellow. I behaved far better this time, however, than I had done on my return from St. Domingo. I kept sober more, did not <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> as foolishly or as fast, and did not wait to be kicked out of doors, before I thought of getting some more. When I shipped anew, I actually left a hundred dollars behind me in my landlord's hands; a very extraordinary thing for Jack, and what is equally worthy of notice, I got it all again, on my next return from sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Call me {{what you}} please!" [...] says Charles, with the most heart-rending simplicity; and Mrs. Sherrick {{straightway}} kisses her daughter. Sherrick meanwhile has been pointing out {{the improvement of the}} chapel to Clive (which now has indeed a look of the Gothic Hall at Rosherville), and has confided to him the sum for which he screwed the painted window out of old Moss. [...] "When he come to see it up in this place, sir, the old man was mad, I give you my word! His son ain't no good: says he knows you. He's such a screw, that chap, that he'll overreach himself, mark my words. At least, he'll never die rich. Did you ever hear of me screwing? No, I <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> like a man.

I don't let 'em sing in the evening, or him do duty more than once a day; and you can calc'late how the music draws, because in the evenin' there ain't half the number of people here. Rev. Mr. Journyman does the duty now--quiet Hogford man--ill, I suppose, this morning. H. sits in his pew, where we was; and coughs; that's to say, I told him to cough.

60|$|Since I last {{wrote to}} you I have left that hotel, {{and come to}} live in a French family. It's a kind of boarding-house {{combined}} with a kind of school; only it's not like an American hoarding-house, nor like an American school either. There are four or five people here that have come to learn the language--not to take lessons, but to have an opportunity for conversation. I was very glad to come to such a place, for I had begun to realise that I was not making much progress with the French. It seemed to me that I should feel ashamed to have spent two months in Paris, and not to have acquired more insight into the language. I had always heard so much of French conversation, and I found I was having no more opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at Bangor. In fact, I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor, from those French Canadians that came down to cut the ice, than I saw I should ever hear at that hotel. The lady that kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I suppose), that I couldn't bear to let her know I didn't like it. The chambermaid was Irish, and all the waiters were German, so that I never heard a word of French spoken. I suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops; only, as I don't buy anything--I prefer to <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> for purposes of culture--I don't have that advantage.|$|E

50|$|My Dear Mary: - By my {{drinking}} to excess, {{and gambling}} also, I have involved {{myself to the}} amount of about three thousand dollars which I have borrowed from time to time from friends and acquaintances. Under the promise to return the same the following day, which I have often failed to do. To such and extend have I gone in this way that I am now ashamed to meet my fellow man on the street; besides that, I have deeply wronged you as a husband, by <b>spending</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> instead of maintaining you as it become a husband to do. Though you have near complained of my miserable conduct, you nevertheless have suffered too much. I therefore, to save you from farther disgrace and trouble, being that I cannot maintain you respectably, I shall end this state of thing this very morning. Of course, in all this, there is no blame-attached contrary you have asked me to permit you to earn money honestly by teaching and I refused. You have always been true to me. If I write these few lines, it is to set you a night before this wicked world, to keep slander from blaming you in way manner whatever. Now, my dear beloved, I hope that you will pardon me, and also Mr. Sainsevain. It is time to part, God bless you, and may you be happy yet, your husband Damien Marchesseault.|$|R
