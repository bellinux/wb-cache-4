Watkins was no <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E

25|$|Urlus is {{best remembered}} for his Wagnerian {{performances}} but he sang many {{other types of}} roles. He performed regularly, for example, the Evangelist in Johann Sebastian Bach's St Matthew Passion, always to much acclaim, as well as singing Tamino in Mozart's Die Zauberflöte and Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio. He appeared, too, in such Verdi parts as Manrico (in Il trovatore), Radames (Aida) and Otello (Otello). He was not a <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French repertoire either, appearing at various times as Samson (in Samson et Dalila), Faust (Faust), Raoul (Les Huguenots) and Don José (Carmen).|$|E
25|$|Hajibeyov was no <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tragic {{chaos of}} war; he {{lived through the}} Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, {{the fall of the}} Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan in 1920, and both World Wars. The {{political}} repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azeri were changed three times — from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic — a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process and may well {{have been one of the}} factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage.|$|E

Upon its return to America it first performed in New York City at Aeolian Hall on January 7, 1914, when, demonstrating a recurrent predilection for adventurously mixing music old and new, the program featured Glazounov’s Suite in C Major, op. 35; Haydn’s Quartet in G Major, op. 76 no. 1; and the Romantische Serenade of Jan Brandts Buys, {{which had been}} heard in New York on only one prior occasion. The quartet's sixth transcontinental tour of the United States and Canada, announced in late 1917, included two performances in New York City and others in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago.|$|E

He was type-rated in Cessna Citations, Learjet, and Beechjet, as well as being a certificated flight instructor (CFI) and certified examiner for commercial, instrument, tailwheel, multiengine, and Citation type-ratings. Having broken the sound barrier in the Concorde (as a passenger) and having flown as a crop-duster to help pay for college, Odegard was no <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> varied envelopes of flight. He was quite familiar with the many aspects of aviation and his vision for a well-rounded school which trains pilots in all aspects of flight helped the aviation program at UND become what it is today. Odegard died of cancer in 1998 at the age of 57. He is buried in Grand Forks, less than a mile away from the UND campus.|$|E

[...] "He knew his cast of village characters, their interactions, attitudes and consequent expressions and body language."

Polls showing Barkley with a comfortable lead and an overwhelming victory by New Deal supporter Claude Pepper in Florida's May Senate primary convinced Chandler to shift his focus from the New Deal. He criticized Barkley as [...] "a <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state" [...] and obliquely referred to [...] "fat, sleek senators who go to Europe and have forgotten the people of Kentucky except when they run for election".
