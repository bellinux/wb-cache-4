40|$|Master planned estates {{have grown}} in number Australia and internationally as a favoured form of {{development}} in new and infill estates. This paper explores the use of legal entities known {{in the state of}} Victoria as owners' corporations to hold communal assets in private ownership for the exclusive use of those living in master planned estates. The privatization of assets that would normally be held by municipal government has been associated by some with heightened conflict in estates, greater costs for residents and increased separation from the larger community. This paper seeks to investigate the motivations and attitudes of both local government planners and developers in utilizing forms of private collective ownership in residential estates in a major city of Australia, Melbourne. This empirical investigation demonstrates that developers generally utilize these ownership structures in order to provide a different, but not necessarily better, <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> as a means of market differentiation. Planners, on the other hand, are more diffident in their endorsement of privatized community ownership and demonstrate a degree of concern about their changed relationship to residents in such estates. The research suggests that issues relating to this choice of ownership of community assets have not been fully considered by local government, particularly in terms of protecting the long-term interests of residents...|$|E

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{increase in}} the number of students at Dutch universities in the sixties and seventies made it impossible for professors to deal with the many different questions students confronted them with. New professionals, student counsellors/psychologists and student advisers entered the universities. Three levels of counselling can be distinguished: 1) counselling by professors (for problems linked with the course of study); 2) counselling by student advisers in the faculty or department (for problems concerning study planning); 3) counselling by student counsellors/psychologists (for other - e. g., personal problems). This article focuses on the activities of the student counsellors/psychologists. Measures taken by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science in the past ten years to cut down expenses created a severe deterioration of the students' situation (e. g., the limitation of the right to a grant from a period of six years in 1990 to a period of four years in 1996, the lowering of the donation part of the grant, and a restriction of the duration of the studies). As a consequence students feel they are under great pressure. Students therefore need to be well informed about rules and regulations. Counsellors try to limit "drop-out" rate as much as possible. Maintaining a high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> at Utrecht University (such as student counselling, a broad range of student societies and adequate information service) will be the challenge for the future...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} value of {{simulation}} based training {{in the management of}} obstetric emergencies. Method :A search by keywords :obstetrics, gynecology, simulation, drills, emergency training restricted to randomized trials led to a selection of eight articles. Results :Shoulder dystocia simulation unmasked deficiencies in performing Mc Robert maneuver in nearly 20 % of doctors in training as well as ineffective and potentially harmful maneuver such as pressure on the uterine fundus. Delivery of the impacted shoulder improved from 42, 9 % to 83, 3 % after simulation training leading to a shorter head to body delivery interval. In postpartum haemorrhage simulation, lack of knowledge on prostaglandins and alkaloids of ergot, delay to transfer the patient to the operating room (82 % of cases) and a poor communication between different professionals were identified. Post simulation improvement was seen in knowledge, technical skills, team spirit and structured communication. In severe preeclampsia simulation, mistakes such as injection of undiluted magnesium sulphate, caesarean section on an unstable patient were identified and reduced by 75 %. Management of magnesium sulphate toxicity was also improved after simulation training. Conclusion :This review confirms the potential of simulation in training health professionals on management of obstetrics emergencies. Although the integration of this training modality into the curriculum of health care professionals in obstetrics and gynaecology seems beneficial, questions on the cost, the minimum <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>facilities,</b> type of mannequins, human resources and frequency of drills required to achieve the learning objectives remain unanswered.
