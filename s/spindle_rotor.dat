However, since the unbalanced vibration is often distributed on different node positions, the multinode unbalanced vibration greatly exacerbates the difficulty of vibration control. Based on the traditional influence coefficient method for controlling the vibration of a flexible rotor, the optimal influence coefficient control method with weights for multinode unbalanced vibration of flexible electric spindle rotors is proposed.

40|$|Abstract: Forces {{generated}} during precision wafer grinding {{are small}} and present challenges for accurate and reliable process monitoring. In this work, these challenges are met by incorporating noncontact displacement sensors into an aerostatic spindle that is calibrated to measure grinding forces from the relative motion between the <b>spindle</b> <b>rotor</b> and stator. This arrangement allows the calculation of grinding forces without introducing compliance into the structural loop of the grinding machine. Aerostatic spindles are used in precision wafer grinding requiring high stiffness and very low error motions (5 – 25 nm). Several experiments evaluate this force sensing approach in detecting workpiece contact, process monitoring with small depths of cut, and detecting workpiece defects. The results indicate that force measurements offer good performance for monitoring precision wafer grinding since this approach provides excellent contact sensitivity, high signal resolution, and has sufficient bandwidth to detect events occurring within a single revolution of the grinding wheel...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{satisfy the}} {{increasing}} demand for parts in optical quality {{it is necessary to}} reduce the processing time, e. g. by ultra precision high performance cutting (UP-HPC). One aspect of UP-HPC is the increase of the spindle speed. High speed spindles require a well balanced <b>spindle</b> <b>rotor</b> to enable the machining of optical surfaces. With conventional speed spindles the unbalance is detected by measuring vibrations at the spindle housing. Thus, the unbalance excited vibrations propagate from the rotor through the air bearings to the spindle housing. In order to calculate the angular position and the magnitude of the unbalance from these measurements the dynamic properties of the air bearings and the housing as well must be known. In this paper the dynamic properties of an ultra precision spindle at different speeds are investigated by means of experimental impact tests. It is shown that the tested air bearing provides a good transfer behavior only in the higher frequency range above 200 Hz and that the spindle housing is not the preferable location to measure the rotor unbalance...|$|E
40|$|In {{machining}} process, chatter is {{an unstable}} dynamic phenomenon which causes overcut and quick tool wear, etc. To avoid chatter, traditional methods aim to optimize machining parameters. But they have inherent disadvantage in gaining highly efficient machining. Active magnetic bearing (AMB) is a promising technology for machining {{on account of}} low wear and friction, low maintenance cost, and long operating life. The control currents applied to AMBs allow not only to stabilize the supported spindle but also to actively suppress chatter in milling process. This paper, for the first time, studies an integrated control scheme for stability of milling process with a spindle supported by AMBs. First, to eliminate the vibration of an unloaded <b>spindle</b> <b>rotor</b> during acceleration/deceleration, we present an optimal controller with proper compensation for speed variation. Next, the controller is further enhanced by adding an adaptive algorithm based on Fourier series analysis to actively suppress chatter in milling process.

40|$|Recently, {{high speed}} cutting {{technology}} is widely adapted {{in the manufacturing}} process due to the increased demand of quality and productivity. Well-known high-speed cutting systems are motorized spindles. It {{is convinced that the}} profile of spindle rotation changes over the period of time due to the tool wear or tool change, which deteriorates not only machining quality but also tool life significantly. Therefore, automatic spindle balancing with respect to the spindle rotating condition becomes an essential requirement for high speed and high precision machining systems. This paper presents an automatic compensating scheme for spindle unbalance using an electromagnetic exciter (EME). The proposed scheme provides several advantages such as compensation of spindle unbalance-induced exciting force, spindle monitoring, and accurate control since it uses non-contact excitation based on electromagnetism. In the proposed system, the spindle unbalance-induced force is measured by vibration sensors and used as the feedback. Accordingly the electromagnetic force is applied to the <b>spindle</b> <b>rotor</b> in the counter side that corresponds with the measured unbalance force. In this paper, to implement the compensating system, the controller is designed and also the spindle-bearing system is built up. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is very effective to compensate the spindle unbalance-induced exciting force in real time.

40|$|In {{the short}} and medium {{perspective}} an essential development of ultra-precision machining and micromachining is expected. It concerns the ultra-precision equipment and processing technology for optical elements and components of machines and devices of different size and purpose. The paper reviews the literature references in the field concerned, investigates the results of national and international researches associated with development of computational models, which describe the process of ultra-precision machining and micromachining. The main objective of the computation models {{is the relationship between}} the operating condition parameters and process indicators, such as cutting forces and temperatures, wear and tool life. A significant disadvantage of the models presented in the literature references is their poor adaptation to a possible change in the input data and machining conditions. Usually, their using makes it possible to conduct design analysis of incorporated parameters interrelation, but it is quantitatively impossible to determine the process output parameters with changing machining conditions. One of examples to apply the ultra-precision machining is the plane reflectors made of aluminum alloy. They are used in space technology {{as a part of the}} radiative cooler. For such reflector a technology has been designed to provide machining with a diamond milling head on the ultra-precision CNC machine. The calculation part of the paper analyses the kinematic scheme of machining and presents a model to determine a cutting length for the particular surface type. In subsequent calculations the cutting length is treated as a parameter to calculate the tool wear, cutting force and temperature. The presented computational model enables us to determine the cutting forces and temperature on the rake and clearance surface. The calculation takes into account the radius of cutting edge and the wear on the clearance surface, which depends on the path length of the cutting tool along the work piece. The literature references contain information about the single-point diamond cutters used in various operations of ultra-precision machining. It is established that the final diamond turning with a new (resharpen) cutter with the feed less than 9 micrometer per revolution and the depth of cut 3 [...] 4 micrometer ensures that the copper and aluminum surfaces are processed with a maximum height of profile within 50 nm. This roughness allows us to use treated surfaces as reflecting ones in optical elements for various purposes. Based on the analysis, a model have been created to calculate the cutting force and temperature for ultra-precision machining of flat reflector made of aluminum alloy by using a diamond milling head. According to the calculated dependences, it was concluded that the value of tangential force changes little, while the radial component of the force increases with increasing cutting length and tool wear. The cutting forces are within tenths of Newton. The paper conducts a comparison of the calculated values of the cutting forces with the experimental data presented in the literature references. When finishing the cutting temperature changes within 50 … 70 0 С. After considering the modeling results a technology for ultra-precision machining of the reflector has been developed, tested, and implemented. The experimental part presents the machining results of flat reflectors using the developed technology. After machining the treated surface has passed a quality control using the μSurf NanoFocus AG confocal microscope. Measuring results have shown that the arithmetical mean deviation of the reflecting surface profile is within the range of 0, 01 micrometer, which meets the requirements. A development of dynamic model of aerostatic spindle for the ultra-precision machine is expected to be the next step of research. The input parameters of the dynamic model to be used are the calculated cutting forces, as well as the experimentally measured stiffness and damping coefficients of the spindle assembly. Dynamic model will enable us to determine the spatial displacement of the <b>spindle</b> assembly <b>rotor,</b> to analyze and reduce the processing errors. </p...|$|R
