50|$|Centaurea solstitialis, yellow star-thistle, is {{a member}} of the family Asteraceae, native to the Mediterranean Basin region. The plant is also known as golden starthistle, yellow {{cockspur}} and <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby's</b> thistle (or Barnaby thistle) The plant is a thorny winter annual species in the knapweed genus.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of disturbance in prairie {{has long been}} recognized. Increasingly interest and research {{have focused on the}} action and interaction of multiple disturbances. The distribution of Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> [Cirsium flodmanii (Rydb.) Arthur] on ant mounds, badger mounds, buffalo wallows, and potholes and in a lightly and a moderately grazed pasture was compared at the Nature Conservancy 2 ̆ 7 s S. H. Ordway Jr. Memorial Prairie in northcentral South Dakota. In the lightly grazed pasture, Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> occurred most frequently on hilltops and ridges, but in the moderately grazed pasture it occurred with equal frequency on hilltops and ridges, and low areas surrounding potholes. Flodman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> was common on earthen mammal mounds and was less abundant on thatching ant mounds and buffalo wallows. No thistles were sampled in potholes. Relative availability of light may explain the thistle 2 ̆ 7 s distribution. Implications of observed patterns are discussed for the evolution of life history traits and the management of prairie remnants...|$|R
60|$|The day wasted away in Beaton's hands; at half-past {{four o'clock}} {{he went out}} to tea at the house of a lady who was At Home that {{afternoon}} from four till seven. By this time Beaton was in possession of one of those other selves of which we each have several about us, and was again the laconic, staccato, rather worldlified young artist whose moments of a controlled utterance and a certain distinction of manner had commended him to Mrs. Horn's fancy in the summer at <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{found that}} he had been giving the cook a holiday, and dining about hither and thither with Fulkerson. Once he had dined with him at the widow's (as they always called Mrs. Leighton), and then had spent the evening there, and smoked with Fulkerson and Colonel Woodburn on the gallery {{overlooking}} the back yard. They were all spending the summer in New York. The widow had got so good an offer for her house at <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby</b> for the summer that she could not refuse it; and the Woodburns found New York a watering-place of exemplary coolness after the burning Augusts and Septembers of Charlottesburg.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I have. I {{shall never}} care for you again, Mr. Beaton; {{you might as}} well {{understand}} it once for all. Don't think it's anything in yourself, or that I think you unworthy of me. I'm not so self-satisfied as that; I know very well that I'm not a perfect character, and that I've no claim on perfection in anybody else. I think women who want that are fools; they won't get it, and they don't deserve it. But I've learned a good. deal more about myself than I knew in <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby,</b> and a life of work, of art, and of art alone that's what I've made up my mind to." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{may or may}} {{not have}} known the {{deference}} with which he treated Alma's work; but the girl herself felt that his abrupt, impersonal comment recognized her as a real sister in art. He told her she ought to come to New York, and draw in the League, or get into some painter's private class; and it was the sense of duty thus appealed to which finally resulted in the hazardous experiment she and her mother were now making. There were no logical breaks in the chain of their reasoning from past success with boarders in <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby</b> to future success with boarders in New York. Of course the outlay was much greater. The rent of the furnished house they had taken was such that if they failed their experiment would be little less than ruinous.|$|R
40|$|Successful {{recovery}} {{planning for}} a rare species relies upon knowledge of its life history and ecology, {{as well as an}} understanding of its habitat requirements and disturbance regime (Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Soule 1986, Lande 1988 a). Species that depend upon early-successional or transient habitats in landscape mosaics present unique recovery challenges (Menges 1990). They require perpetuation of multiple populations within a shifting mosaic of local habitats. Recovery plans for these species must be formulated from an understanding of population demography within the context of community and landscape dynamics. Processes that maintain landscape mosaics must be given long-term protection if recovery is to succeed. Pitcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle,</b> Cirsium pitcher (Torr.) T. and G., is listed as threatened in the United States and Canada (Harrison 1988). This monocarpic plant is endemic to the western Great Lakes sand dunes. It is an early-successional species that colonizes open patches in dynamic dune landscapes (Pavlovic et al. 1993). Its recovery depends upon the perpetuation of interacting mosaics of populations, or metapopulations, in Great Lakes dune systems. The concept of metapopulation dynamics (Levins 1970, den Boer 1981, Gilpin 1987, Goodman 1987 a, Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Hanski 1991) is useful for understanding Cirsium pitcheri ecology and management options. It describes species persistence in environments where the probability of local extinction is high, and has applications to species recovery and reserve design (e. g., Shaffer 1981, Gilpin 2 ̆ 6 Soule 1986, Goodman 1987 b, Lande 1988 b, Menges 1990, Murphy, Freas 2 ̆ 6 Weiss 1990). In this chapter, we present a recovery model for Pitcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>thistle</b> based upon metapopulation theory and apply it to recovery sites in Illinois and Indiana...|$|R
50|$|For many years, Shanidar 4 {{was thought}} to provide strong {{evidence}} for a Neanderthal burial ritual. Routine soil samples from around the body, gathered for pollen analysis {{in an attempt to}} reconstruct the palaeoclimate and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire flowering plants (or at least heads of plants) had entered the grave deposit. Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. Yarrow, Cornflower, Bachelor's Button, <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby's</b> Thistle, Ragwort or Groundsel, Grape Hyacinth, Joint Pine or Woody Horsetail and Hollyhock were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have long-known curative powers as diuretics, stimulants, astringents as well as anti-inflammatory properties. This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had shamanic powers, perhaps acting as medicine man to the Shanidar Neandertals.|$|R
6000|$|Margaret {{knew that}} her aunt had in mind their common {{experience}} with the Leightons, whom, to give their common conscience peace, she had called upon with her aunt's cards and excuses, and an invitation for her Thursdays, somewhat too late to make the visit seem a welcome to New York. She was so coldly received, {{not so much for}} herself as in her quality of envoy, that her aunt experienced all the comfort which vicarious penance brings. She did not perhaps consider sufficiently her niece's guiltlessness in the expiation. Margaret was not with her at <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby</b> in the fatal fortnight she passed there, and never saw the Leightons till she went to call upon them. She never complained: the strain of asceticism, which mysteriously exists in us all, and makes us put peas, boiled or unboiled, in our shoes, gave her patience with the snub which the Leightons presented her for her aunt. But now she said, with this in mind: [...] "Nothing seems simpler than to get rid of people if you don't want them. You merely have to let them alone." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had gone}} on some such terms before; was it now for the last time? She {{believed}} it was. She felt in herself a satiety, a fatigue, in which his good looks, his invented airs and poses, his real trouble, were all alike repulsive. She did not acquit herself of the wrong of having let him think she might yet have liked him as she once did; {{but she had been}} honestly willing to see whether she could. It had mystified her to find that when they first met in New York, after their summer in <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby,</b> she cared nothing for him; she had expected to punish him for his neglect, and then fancy him as before, but she did not. More and more she saw him selfish and mean, weak-willed, narrow-minded, and hard-hearted; and aimless, with all his talent. She admired his talent in proportion as she learned more of artists, and perceived how uncommon it was; but she said to herself that if she were going to devote herself to art, she would do it at first-hand. She was perfectly serene and happy in her final rejection of Beaton; he had worn out not only her fancy, but her sympathy, too.|$|R
50|$|McWilliam {{served as}} MP {{through the middle}} of a long period of Liberal {{ascendancy}} in the Miramichi Valley. The coalition that sustained the Liberal Party was centered on the Irish vote, especially from the town of Chatham where they formed the majority, buttressed by the votes of the Irish minority in Newcastle, and the smaller Irish villages like <b>St.</b> Margarets, <b>Barnaby</b> River and Sevogle. Added to this were the votes of the French-speaking Acadians of Neguac, Rogersville, Beaverbrook and Baie-Sainte-Anne and surrounding areas. The majority of Protestants voted Progressive Conservative, but there were always a minority who supported the Liberals.|$|R
40|$|The history, {{identification}} and chemical, mechanical and cultural control of musk thistle are discussed. Musk thistle {{is a major}} problem for many Midwestern landowners. It reduces forage yields by robbing moisture and plant food from palatable grasses. Livestock refuse to enter heavily infested areas and will not graze close to the spiny plants. Since its emergence as a serious weed problem in the late 1940 <b>s,</b> musk <b>thistle</b> has invaded thousands of acres of Nebraska pastureland and even occurs in some cultivated fields. It has moved from the Kansas border to the South Dakota border and as far west as Colorado and Wyoming...|$|R

40|$|The {{arguments}} {{in this paper}} address the Chumash in the historic and late prehistoric periods. As of now, {{there is no real}} evidence that the Chumash ate seeds of any species of Salvia other than S. columbariae (chia) and perhaps <b>S.</b> carduacea (<b>thistle</b> sage). This is not a mystery. Preferential selection of foods with better flavor-which in turn is related to nutritional factors-has been included in some general models of hunter-gatherer subsistence, but has been largely ignored in the literature on southern California prehistory. It may be particularly relevant among groups like the Chumash, where the economic base was secure enough to permit the luxury of choice...|$|R
60|$|The {{notion of}} {{shutting}} up is an exigency of the rounded period. The fact is, of course, that Alma Leighton was not shut up {{in any sense}} whatever. She was the pervading light, if not force, of the house. She was a good cook, and she managed the kitchen {{with the help of}} an Irish girl, while her mother looked after the rest of the housekeeping. But she was not systematic; she had inspiration but not discipline, and her mother mourned more over the days when Alma left the whole dinner to the Irish girl than she rejoiced in those when one of Alma's great thoughts took form in a chicken-pie of incomparable savor or in a matchless pudding. The off-days came when her artistic nature was expressing itself in charcoal, for she drew to the admiration of all among the lady boarders who could not draw. The others had their reserves; they readily conceded that Alma had genius, but they were sure she needed instruction. On the other hand, they were not so radical as to agree with the old painter who came every summer to paint the elms of the <b>St.</b> <b>Barnaby</b> meadows. He contended that she needed to be a man in order to amount to anything; but in this theory he was opposed by an authority, of his own sex, whom the lady sketchers believed to speak with more impartiality in a matter concerning them as much as Alma Leighton. He said that instruction would do, and he was not only, younger and handsomer, but he was fresher from the schools than old Harrington, who, even the lady sketchers could see, painted in an obsolescent manner. His name was Beaton--Angus Beaton; but he was not Scotch, or not more Scotch than Mary Queen of Scots was. His father was a Scotchman, but Beaton was born in Syracuse, New York, and it had taken only three years in Paris to obliterate many traces of native and ancestral manner in him. He wore his black beard cut shorter than his mustache, and a little pointed; he stood with his shoulders well thrown back and with a lateral curve of his person when he talked about art, which would alone have carried conviction even if he had not had a thick, dark bang coming almost to the brows of his mobile gray eyes, and had not spoken English with quick, staccato impulses, so as to give it the effect of epigrammatic and sententious French. One of the ladies said that you always thought of him as having spoken French after it was over, and accused herself of wrong in not being able to feel afraid of him. None of the ladies was afraid of him, though they could not believe that he was really so deferential to their work as he seemed; and they knew, when he would not criticise Mr. Harrington's work, that he was just acting from principle.|$|R

40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{studies have}} become an {{integral}} part of modern drug development, but these studies are not regulatory needs for herbal remedies. This paper updates our current knowledge on the disposition pathways and pharmacokinetic properties of commonly used herbal medicines in humans. To retrieve relevant data, the authors have searched through computer-based literatures by full text search in Medline (via Pubmed), ScienceDirect, Current Contents Connect (ISI), Cochrance Library, CINAHL (EBSCO), CrossRef Search and Embase (all from inception to May 2010). Many herbal compounds undergo Phase I and/or Phase II metabolism in vivo, with cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) playing a major role. Some herbal ingredients are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which is highly expressed in the intestine, liver, brain and kidney. As such, the activities of these drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are determining factors for the in vivo bioavailability, disposition and distribution of herbal remedies. There are increasing pharmacokinetic studies of herbal remedies, but these studies are mainly focused on a small number of herbal remedies including St John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> wort, milk <b>thistle,</b> sculcap, curcumin, echinacea, ginseng, ginkgo, and ginger. The pharmacokinetic data of a small number of purified herbal ingredients, including anthocyanins, berberine, catechins, curcumin, lutein and quercetin, are available. For the majority of herbal remedies used in folk medicines, data on their disposition and biological fate in humans are lacking or in paucity. For a herbal medicine, the pharmacological effect is achieved when the bioactive agents or the metabolites reach and sustain proper levels at their sites of action. Both the dose levels and fates of active components in the body govern their target-site concentrations after administration of an herbal remedy. In this regard, a safe and optimal use of herbal medicines requires a full understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles. To optimize the use of herbal remedies, further clinical studies to explore their biological fate including the disposition pathways and kinetics in the human body are certainly needed. <br /...|$|R
