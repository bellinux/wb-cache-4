40|$|This {{research}} {{has tried to}} find a relation between particle settling velocity and shape. This was done by taking the settling velocity log-contrast of a non-spherical particle and an equivalent spherical particle. This log-contrast should be the logarithmic function of a certain shape factor. Settling data of several shapes were taken from previous authors and with those data several existing and new shape factors were tested to form a single relation. Recently a simple equation was developed which can explicitly predict the settling velocity of spherical particles for any Reynolds number. This equation was tested to be fairly accurate for spherical data. However, the spherical data showed a systematic error which needs to be resolved for the equation to be perfectly accurate. The equation also showed to be fairly accurate for non-spherical <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter</b> data. However <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter</b> data cannot be used to define the shape of a particle as there is no direct relation between <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter</b> and actual particle size and shape. In order to find a relation between particle settling velocity and shape, a correct shape factor must be found. For that matter several shape factors from previous authors were tested on data directly available from previous authors. The existing shape factors were proved to not be able to combine all investigated shapes into a single relation for settling velocity and a new shape factor was found with which a single relation might be formed. This new equation is a generalization of the Corey Shape Factor, the Boekhout Shape Factor: BSF=D_s/(?D_l?^n D_i^(1 -n)). However due to the small amount of data, important data gaps exist so that nothing can be concluded with certainty. Therefore more settling experiments should be done over a large range of Reynolds numbers to be able to conclude whether the Boekhout Shape Factor is the correct link between particle settling velocity and shape.

40|$|Quarry rock is a {{frequently}} applied {{construction material}} in hydraulic engineering. The main reason is its unique stability capacities in environments of high hydrodynamic activity. Furthermore, quarry rock is produced and handled relatively easily and available at numerous locations across the globe. The size, or more precisely, {{the dimension of}} rock {{plays an important role}} in the realization of granular hydraulic structures. In general, two definitions are applied for the dimension of quarry rock, viz. : the nominal <b>diameter</b> and the <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter.</b> The ratio of both diameters is referred to as the shape factor of quarry rock and is frequently applied to express the one diameter in the other. Quarry rock however consists of a practically infinite variety of sizes and shapes and as a result the material is typically graded. For quarry gradings therefore the shape factor is based on ‘median’ values for the nominal <b>diameter</b> and <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter,</b> which are related to the fifty percent cumulative mass percentage of the grading. In a report published by G. J. Laan (1981) the value of the shape factor for quarry rock was determined to be 0. 84. Unfortunately, Laan passed away and the concerned report is missing from the libraries. Despite the resulting lack of theoretical background the value of 0. 84 is still widely applied in hydraulic engineering practice, as is recommended by - amongst other literature - the Rock Manual (2007). In this thesis the value of the shape factor has been reassessed. By conducting experiments on 21 samples, consisting of 200 - 250 rocks, extracted from various gradings, it is found that the shape factor is reasonably well represented by means of a Gaussian distribution. The average value and standard deviation are 0. 86 and 0. 24 respectively. Furthermore, it is concluded that the value of the shape factor is not constant within a grading. The value of the shape factor slightly decreases for increasing rock size. Such relation is however not discerned over the coarseness of the tested gradings. According to the tested gradings, the value of the shape factor is independent from the shape of the rock, in terms of both elongation and blockiness. For individual rock however, on average the value of the shape factor slightly increases for an increase of elongation as well as blockiness. As a consequence it cannot be completely ruled out that, for gradings consisting of a significantly higher percentage of relatively elongated or blocky rock compared with the tested gradings, the shape factor will increase. Like the shape factor for rock gradings, the shape factor of individual rocks is also represented reasonably well by means of a Gaussian distribution. The average value and standard deviation are 0. 84 and 0. 083 respectively. Moreover, it is found that the shape factor of an individual rock may exceed the value of 1. 0. For such rock the nominal <b>diameter</b> exceeds the <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter.</b> Subesequent research should focus on the shape factor value for gradings of significantly different coarseness and gradings that consist of a significantly higher percentage of relatively elongated or blocky rock compared with the tested gradings, the shape factor will increase. For uncrushed rock it is expected both interests are met. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

For this purpose, group of experiments were conducted in a laboratory channel 25 m long, 0. 80 m wide and 0. 70 m deep. A block was built {{at the end of}} the channel to work as a dam to impound water. The channel was supplied with drainage pipes on both sides to release water out in a manner similar to what happens in reservoirs. The bed of the channel was filled with sand of 0. 80 mm median <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter</b> and 0. 72 geometric standard deviation. The slope was 0. 0093 for all experiments. Two sizes of sand were used representing the sediment. The median diameter and geometric standard deviation of the first were 0. 365 mm and 0. 46 respectively. The second sample had 0. 65 mm median diameter and 0. 67 standard deviation. A total of seventy experiments were conducted in two groups to examine effect the sediment transport rate, particle size of sediment and flow velocity on aggradation characteristics. The results showed that there is a strong linear direct relationship between aggradation elements (length and depth) with the rate of sediment transport. Group of dimensionless parameters affecting the aggradation characteristics were used to develop empirical equations to predict the length, maximum depth of aggradation and predict transient bed profile. The results of empirical approach were compared with the measurement data and previous numerical method.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} study {{was made to}} determine the variation with depth and velocity of the hydraulic and sediment transport characteristics of a constant-discharge flow. Eight experimental runs were performed in a 60 -foot long, 33. 5 -inch wide recirculating laboratory flume. The unit discharge for all runs was 0. 50 cfs per ft. and the velocity was varied from 0. 91 to 2. 21 fps, corresponding {{to a change in}} depth from 0. 550 to 0. 228 ft. The bed sand used for these experiments had a geometric mean <b>sieve</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0. 142 mm and a geometric standard deviation of 1. 38. As the velocity was increased, the bed form changed from a dune-covered configuration to a flat bed, with sand waves occurring at intermediate velocities. It was found that for the unit discharge and bed sand used in this investigation, two different velocities and sediment transport rates are possible for a given slope, or a given bed shear velocity; however, this multiplicity is possible only in the range of slope and shear velocity where major changes in the bed configuration occur since it is a result of large variations in the bed roughness. Therefore the slope or shear velocity cannot logically be used as an independent variable since neither of these quantities uniquely determines the velocity or transport rate. However, if the velocity is used as the independent variable for a constant-discharge flow, the slope, shear velocity, and friction factor are all uniquely determined. The sediment transport rate was found to be a single-valued, uniformly increasing function of velocity, and it can therefore be used in place of the velocity as the independent variable. A comparison of data from this investigation with data from previous investigations which used the same sand showed that even a small decrease in the amount of fine material in the bed sand can {{have a significant effect on}} the transport rate. However, even relatively large changes in the standard deviation of the bed material have a small effect on the friction factor...|$|R

The research focuses on the study of vitamin C changes in Latvia grown wild (Vaccinium oxycoccus L.) and cultivated (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) cranberries during convective and microwave vacuum drying. Latvian wild cranberries and cultivated cranberry varieties ‘Early Black’, ‘Ben Lear’, ‘Stevens’, ‘Bergman’ and ‘Pilgrim’ from Kurzeme region harvested in 2010 were used for experiments. Mechanical and thermal pre-treatment of fresh berries was applied for better water evaporation in drying process. During experiments the berries were dried: in a convective air dryer by controlled hot air stream circulation velocity of 1. 2 m s- 1 at temperature + 50 ± 2 °C. The berries were placed on the perforated <b>sieve</b> (<b>diameter</b> 0. 185 m, diameter of holes – 0. 002 m); the moisture content of dried berries was 9. 0 ± 0. 1 %. Following quality parameters were analysed during experiments: moisture content (oven-drying method) and vitamin C content (LVS EN 14130 : 2003). Experimentally it was ascertained that drying time of berries by various drying methods mainly depends on the pre-treatment manner. During the drying process moisture content of cranberries decreased from on average 86. 94 % to 9. 00 %, about ∼ 10. 00 times. Vitamin C is the least stable of all vitamins and it can be easily degraded during processing and storage. The most harmful factors to vitamin C content are the presence of oxygen, prolonged heating in the air ambiance and exposure to light.

The trial was divided in two periods of 14 days each. Diet (DM= 53. 7 %) was formulated in order to assure the nutritional requirements of cows producing 24 kg/d of milk (crude protein= 14. 4 % DM; NDF= 40. 9 % DM; milk FU= 0. 88 /kg DM) and additional amounts of concentrates were distributed using automatic feeders. Four TMR samples were collected daily (7. 00 am, 10. 00 am, 1. 00 pm, 4. 00 pm) for six days during each experiment period for a total number of 48 feed samples. Each feed sample was subjected to the estimation of the particle size distribution using the separator of Pennsylvania State University composed of two <b>sieves</b> (<b>diameters</b> of 19 and 8 mm) and a collector on the bottom, and to {{the determination of the}} chemical composition. Changes of all three particle size fractions for TMRs were observed during the day with distributions of the TMR both once and twice daily. With the once daily distribution, the large particles fraction increased linearly (P< 0. 001) from 19. 7 to 23. 4, 32. 2, and 35. 1 %, while the finest particle fraction decreased (from 60. 1 to 58. 3, 50. 0, 47. 8 %). According to particle size changes, the chemical composition varied significantly at the different times of sampling when TMR was distributed once daily. Significant variations of DM were detected for TMR with a linear (P< 0. 001) increase (from 54. 4 to 57. 9, 60. 7, 61. 5 %). Considering once TMR distribution, the values of NDF and starch showed an opposite trend with an increase of 6. 5 and a decrease of 8. 3 points from 7. 00 am to 4. 00 pm (i. e., 9 hrs after distribution). Correlations were estimated between chemical and physical characteristics of TMRs. NDF content was positively and significantly correlated to the fraction of particles retained by a 19 mm sieve (r= 0. 42; P< 0. 001) and negatively correlated with the smaller particles (r=- 0. 51; P< 0. 001). In conclusion, when the TMRs are prepared excluding corn/hay silages, twice daily distributions of diet can avoid the selection of large feed by the cows, thereby preserving both a uniform particle size distribution and a steady chemical composition of the diet during the day. However, the cost for the extra time needed for twice daily dis- tribution should be carefully considered...|$|R

For the determination of soil physical and chemical properties, representative soil samples were collected randomly from each land use at the depths of 0 – 20 and 20 – 40  cm in three replications based on similar slope. Ten sub-samples were taken from each depth in each treatment of the three land uses to prepare one composite soil sample. A total of eighteen (18) disturbed soil samples were collected and well mixed in a bucket. About 1  kg of the composite samples was then properly labeled, bagged and transported to the laboratory for the sample preparation and analysis of selected soil physicochemical properties. The soil samples were air-dried, ground and made to pass through a 2  mm <b>diameter</b> <b>sieve.</b> To determine the soil bulk density, undisturbed soil samples were collected in core samplers of known dimensions.|$|R
30|$|All {{deposition}} data {{analyzed in}} this study were obtained in the same way according to the VDI standard 4330 - 3 [46] specific for maize [47] as follows: the pollen samples were removed from the filter pads of the PMF and from the liquid in the 1.5 -L attached flask by using an ultrasonic bath (Sonorex Bandelin Super RK 102, BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) and vacuum filtration (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). These procedures sedimented the aerosol particle sample as a filter cake on an acetyl-ethylene membrane filter (12 μm pore size, 50 mm diameter, Whatman, Maidstone, UK), after pre-filtering the liquid through a 125 -μm metal mesh test <b>sieve</b> (100 mm <b>diameter,</b> Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). Sample quality was checked by examining the filter cakes under a binocular microscope. A sample from each filter cake was transferred into a 15 -ml tube. After centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), the volume was reduced to 2 ml. Then, 2 ml glycerol was added to give 4 ml 50 % glycerol pollen suspension (density 1.1 g/cm 3). The pollen suspension was mixed with a shaker and stored at − 20 °C until subsequent analysis.|$|R
40|$|Background : at present, fluvial mollusks are {{of great}} {{consequence}} for {{the transmission of}} diseases to both man and animals, influenced by climate change. Objective : to characterize fluvial malaco-fauna, considering its distribution in the different areas of Jesus Menendez municipality, Las Tunas province, stratifying the main species of medical importance and their relation to the main ecosystem types. Methods : 22 fluvial ecosystems were sampled throughout the town, during the years 2013 and 2014, covering both rainy and little rainy period. Sampling from the hatcheries was done twice a year, by catches (15 minutes per point of surveys), using a circular 15 cm <b>diameter</b> <b>sieve,</b> 1 mm mesh size and 20 cm handle. Species were related to their corresponding habitat. Results : 11 species of fluvial mollusks were identified, being Pomaceapaludosa (18, 3 %), Biomphalariahabanenesis (17 %), Fossariacubensis (16, 1 %), and Tarebiagranifera (14, 8 %), the most common species with the highest population density. The most important locations were hatcheries, ditches, organic farms and rivers. Conclusions : Jesus Menendez municipality {{has a variety of}} fluvial mollusks, existing species capable of being of use as intermediary hosts for transmitting diseases, both to human and animal health. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{influence}} of treatments with different seed spray volumes and their effects on the physical and physiological quality. The soybean seeds from cultivars NA 5909 RG and BMX Potência RR were used and three lots of each cultivar were selected in <b>sieves</b> of different <b>diameters</b> (5. 5; 6. 0 and 6. 5 mm). The treatments consisted of different seed volumes: 1) non-treated seeds; 2) 600 mL. 100 kg of seeds- 1; 3) 800 mL. 100 kg of seeds- 1; 4) 1000 mL. 100 kg of seeds- 1; 5) 1200 mL. 100 kg of seeds- 1; 6) 1400 mL. 100 kg of seeds- 1. The physical parameters evaluated were mechanical damage, water content and variations in the length and width of the seeds. The physiological seed quality was determined by germination, first count germination, length and dry weight of seedlings, field emergence and emergence speed index tests. In terms of use of the product in liquid form, it is possible to use the treatment in spray volumes up to 1400 mL. 100 kg seed- 1, regardless the cultivar or seed size and without damaging the soybean seeds physically and physiologically...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research {{was to assess the}} changes in soil erodibility during the non-vegetation period as one of the factors affecting the snowmelt erosion. The temperature fluctuation was simulated {{with the use of a}} climatic chamber ex situ. The soil surface was for simplicity reasons considered without any plant or snow cover. The paper deals with the rate of soil erodibility determination – the soil erodibility should increase due to the decrease of soil aggregate stability depending on the number of freeze-thaw cycles and initial soil moisture. Soil samples (taken from three sites) were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under laboratory conditions. Changes in soil agreggate stability were monitored as one of the main soil characteristics which determine the soil erodibility. Two methods were used to determine the soil macroaggregate stability (soil aggregate fraction 1 – 2 mm) : standard single-sieve method of wet sieving (Kemper and Rosenau, 1986), and dry aggregate analysis using a set of flat <b>sieves</b> with a <b>diameter</b> of 1 [*]mm and 0. 5 [*]mm. The results of each method are controversial. Intended hypothesis has not been clearly confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Branch root {{development}} on the primary root of maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings was followed for 9 d after planting. This period includes the shift from seedling heterotrophy to autotrophy. Linear density of branches in the basal region ranged from ∼ 38 cm− 1 at the base to ∼ 10 cm− 1 beyond 10 cm. Branch roots in the first ∼ 8 cm were produced before assimilate was available. Branch length decreased from ∼ 26 mm at 1 cm along the primary root to ∼ 8 mm at 10 cm from the base. Without the cotyledon, branch root density in the basal region was ∼ 10 cm− 1 and roots were short (∼ 5 mm). Beyond 8 – 10 cm both measurements matched those of intact seedlings. Dark-grown seedlings had basal branch root densities higher than those without cotyledons but none beyond 10 cm. There were more and smaller <b>diameter</b> <b>sieve</b> tubes in the basal region of the primary root. These decreased distally in number but had larger diameters where branches formed after assimilate was available. Proliferation of basal branch roots in very young seedlings can have major advantages for successful seedling establishment {{in the field and}} could be screened for without difficulty...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sand {{production}} in water, {{oil and gas}} wells is usually controlled by gravel packing techniques worldwide. Consideration in the gravel pack design requires that the particle size is {{five or six times}} the formation sand depending on the formation sand median <b>diameter.</b> <b>Sieve</b> analysis result shows that the grain sizes of sand and gravel of the Ethiope River sediments fall within the size range (0. 378 - 12. 0 mm) recommended for a gravel pack by the American Petroleum Institute. Acid solubility test on the gravel and sand gives desirable results as the maximum solubility of 1. 0 % required for gavel pack is not exceeded. The sphericity and roundness of the particle grains range from 0. 70 - 0. 68 and 0. 70 - 0. 67 respectively, which is within the range (0. 6) allowed for gravel pack. The presence of the objectionably high content of silt and clay in some of the samples particularly those collected near the Ethiope River source area (e. g. UM 1 -UM 10) however reduces the pack efficiency and formation permeability as the “fines and mud ” tend to clog the screen slots (openings). A possible solution to this problem will entail some systematic process of flushing out “fines and mud ” from the deposit prior usage...|$|R
