5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, Noreen's <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unusual. Though no one {{has been}} {{executed}} for blasphemy yet in Pakistan, the accused often remain imprisoned for an extensive amount of time while the case is being processed. In May 2014, Noreen's appeal hearing was delayed for the fifth time.|$|E
5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E
5|$|Sharitarish was a Chaui who, at {{some time}} before 1805, had been {{involved}} in a struggle over the leadership of that band. In the course of this struggle, he had brought his clan to the Kitkehahki village on the Republican, where he had deposed Iskatappe, the hereditary chief of the Kitkehahki. Although the exact <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, it is thought that Sharitarish was trying to bring the Kitkehahkis back to the Platte, to support his faction in the Chaui village.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means that the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will {{no longer need to}} shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|Weaker tornadoes, and {{at times}} even {{stronger}} tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term skipping tornado. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly {{at the time of}} the birth and organization of the tornado. This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis, thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Dravidian languages, {{as well as their}} {{subsequent}} development and the period of their differentiation, are unclear, and the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> helped by the lack of comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages. Inconclusive attempts have also been made to link the family with the Japonic languages and with the extinct Elamite language (by Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{government}} {{efforts to}} promote Mandarin through the Speak Mandarin Campaign, the propagation of Mandarin and Chinese culture amongst Chinese Singaporeans {{continues to be a}} challenge because Mandarin faces stiff competition from the strong presence of English. However, this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only limited to Mandarin, but also Malay and Tamil, where rising statistics show that English is progressively taking over as home language of Singaporeans.|$|E

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{cause of the}} Jahn–Teller effect {{is the presence of}} molecular orbitals that are both degenerate and open shell (i.e., incompletely occupied). This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unique to coordination complexes and can be encountered in other areas of chemistry. In organic chemistry the phenomenon of antiaromaticity has the same cause and also often sees molecules distorting; {{as in the case of}} cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene (COT).|$|E
25|$|If we are {{justified}} in {{assuming that the}} scope of the generalization 'All ravens are black' can be restricted to ravens, then this means that we have some outside information which we can rely on concerning the factual situation.

25|$|According to a 2007 {{interview}} with Yevgeny Shevchuk, the then-speaker of the Transnistrian Supreme Council, Transnistria is {{in a difficult}} economic situation. Despite a 30% tax increase in 2007, the pension fund is still lacking money and emergency measures must be taken. However, Shevchuk mentioned that the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> hopeless and it cannot be considered a crisis, as a crisis means three-month delays in payment of pensions and salaries.|$|E

25|$|One {{major problem}} MTA and NY Waterway had to {{overcome}} in planning was the ice floes that can sometimes clog the shallows near the riverbanks, particularly on the Newburgh side, in cold weather. This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> encountered by its ferries downriver as the salinity of the river below the Hudson Highlands is high enough to prevent ice from forming {{in all but the}} coldest temperatures. However, while Newburgh Bay is below the river's salt front, ice from the freshwater sections often accumulates in it.|$|E
25|$|Setting up {{a theory}} with a finite cutoff for {{mathematical}} reasons, one {{hopes that the}} cutoff can be made sufficiently large to avoid its appearance in observables of physical interest, but in local quantum field theories that are of interest in hadronic physics the <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that simple. Namely, particles of different momenta are coupled through the dynamics in a nontrivial way, and the calculations aiming at predicting observables yield results that depend on the cutoffs. Moreover, they {{do so in a}} diverging fashion.|$|E
25|$|Since Horemheb {{remained}} childless, {{he appointed}} his Vizier, Paramesse, {{to succeed him}} upon his death, both to reward Paramesse's loyalty and because the latter had both a son and grandson to secure Egypt's royal succession. Paramesse employed the name Ramesses I upon assuming power and founded the 19th Dynasty of the New Kingdom. While the decoration of Horemheb's KV57 tomb was still unfinished upon his death, this <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unprecedented: Amenhotep II's tomb was also not fully completed when he was buried, even though this ruler enjoyed a reign of 26 Years.|$|E
