Fox opposed the bellicose stances of Pitt's ministry in the Nootka Sound crisis, and over the Russian occupation of the Turkish port of Ochakiv on the Black <b>Sea.</b> <b>Fox</b> contributed to the peaceful resolution of these entanglements, and gained a new admirer in Catherine the Great, who bought a bust of Fox and placed it between Cicero and Demosthenes in her collection. On 18 April, Fox spoke in the Commons – together with William Wilberforce, Pitt and Burke – in favour of a measure to abolish the slave trade, but – despite their combined rhetorical talents – the vote went against them {{by a majority of}} 75.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet vulpinus {{is derived}} from the Latin vulpes meaning [...] "fox", and in some older literature the species name was given incorrectly as Alopias vulpes. [...] "Fox shark" [...] is the earliest known English name for this species and is rooted in classical antiquity, from a belief that it was especially cunning. In the mid-19th century, the name [...] "fox" [...] was mostly superseded by [...] "thresher", referencing the shark's flail-like use of its tail. This species is often known simply as thresher shark or thresher; Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder introduced the name [...] "common thresher" [...] in 1945 to differentiate it from the bigeye thresher (A. superciliosus). It is also known by many other common names, including Atlantic thresher, grayfish, green thresher, long-tailed shark, sea ape, <b>sea</b> <b>fox,</b> slasher, swiveltail, thintail thresher, thrasher shark, and whiptail shark.|$|E
2500|$|Loughlin and Queenfish {{received}} this message, but its significance did not register {{because of the}} non-specificity of course, speed, and routing. [...] Advised by another submarine of his wolfpack (...) that targets were in the area, Loughlin thought he came upon a destroyer in a dense fog. [...] Firing four torpedoes, Loughlin quickly sank the [...] "destroyer" [...] and recovered one survivor. [...] Hours later the survivor revealed that Queenfish had sunk the Awa Maru. [...] Loughlin immediately reported the sinking to Lockwood, and Lockwood in turn reported to Admirals Nimitz and King while ordering Queenfish and <b>Sea</b> <b>Fox</b> to search for more survivors.

50|$|The Arctic fox is {{the only}} land mammal native to Iceland. It came to the {{isolated}} North Atlantic island {{at the end of}} the last ice age, walking over the frozen <b>sea.</b> The Arctic <b>Fox</b> Center in Súðavík contains an exhibition on the Arctic fox and conducts studies on the influence of tourism on the population. Its range during the last ice age was much more extensive than it is now, and fossil remains of the Arctic fox have been found over much of northern Europe and Siberia.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the presence of sea ice {{is an important factor in}} facilitating migration and determining the degree of genetic isolation among contemporary arctic fox populations. Because the extent of sea ice is dependent upon global temperatures, periods of significant cooling would have had a major impact on fox population connectivity and genetic variation. We tested this hypothesis by extracting and sequencing mitochondrial control region sequences from 17 arctic foxes excavated from two late 9 th- 12 th century AD archaeological sites in northeast Iceland, both of which predate the Little Ice Age (~ 16 th- 19 th century). Despite the fact that five haplotypes have been observed in modern Icelandic foxes, a single haplotype was shared among all of the ancient individuals. Results from simulations within an approximate Bayesian computation framework suggest that the rapid increase in Icelandic arctic fox haplotype diversity can only be explained by <b>sea</b> ice-mediated <b>fox</b> immigration facilitated by the Little Ice Age...|$|R
50|$|After {{extensive}} research, the Tallebudgera Estuary in the hinterland behind Burleigh on the Gold Coast in Queensland was selected, {{the reasons}} including that it offered an untouched natural habitat for koalas apart from already having cleared areas (then farmland) {{for development of}} animal enclosures.

40|$|AbstractTranscription {{factors of}} the Forkhead (Fox) family have been {{identified}} in many metazoans, and play important roles in diverse biological processes. Here we define the set of fox genes present in the sea urchin genome, and survey their usage during development. This genome includes 22 fox genes, only three of which were previously known. Of the 23 fox gene subclasses identified in vertebrate genomes, the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome has orthologues of all but four (E, H, R and S). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that one S. purpuratus fox gene is equally related to foxA and foxB of vertebrates; this gene defines a new class. Two other genes appear to be specific to the sea urchin, with respect to the genomes so far sequenced. Fox genes orthologous with those of vertebrates but lacking in arthropod or nematode genomes may be deuterostome-specific (subclasses I, J 1, J 2, L 1, M and Q 1), while the majority are pan-bilaterian. All but one of the S. purpuratus fox genes (SpfoxQ 1) are expressed during embryogenesis, most in a very specific temporal and spatial manner. The <b>sea</b> urchin <b>fox</b> genes clearly execute many different regulatory functions, and almost all of them participate in the process of embryonic development...|$|R

Other animals in the park include island scrub jay, harbor seal, California <b>sea</b> lion, island <b>fox,</b> spotted skunk, island night lizard, barn owl, American kestrel, horned lark and meadowlark and California brown pelican. One hundred and forty-five of these species are unique to the islands and found nowhere else in the world.
