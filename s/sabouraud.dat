40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{of growth of}} Histoplasma capsulatum by Candida albicans and other yeasts on <b>Sabouraud's</b> agar was investigated. Histoplasma (yeast-phase inoculum) was grown alone and in mixtures with yeasts at 25 C for 4 -week periods. As few as 10 colonies of C. albicans completely inhibited the growth of approximately 50, 000 potential colonies of Histoplasma. The pH was determined in cultures of 36 colonies of Candida on media containing 1, 2, and 4 % glucose by spotting the agar with pH indicators. A drop in the pH became noticeable in all three media about the 3 rd day of incubation, and a pH of 3. 5 was reached in about 7 days. Subsequently, the pH remained almost stationary in the 4 % glucose-agar, rose slowly in the 2 % glucose-agar, and rose sharply in the 1 % glucose-agar. The growth of Histoplasma was inhibited completely at pH 4 and below. When the pH was controlled in mixed cultures, some growth of Histoplasma was obtained. Substitution of maltose for glucose delayed the development of acidity and allowed the appearance of numerous mycelial colonies {{in the presence of}} Candida. This growth was arrested as soon as the medium became acid. Four other species which also acidified the <b>Sabouraud's</b> medium effected similar inhibition. It was thus shown that severe and prolonged acidity produced by some yeasts in the sugar-rich <b>Sabouraud's</b> media is alone sufficient to completely inhibit Histoplasma during the standard 4 -week incubation of specimens such as sputum...|$|R
