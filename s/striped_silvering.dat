40|$|We {{demonstrate}} sub-dB/cm propagation {{losses in}} polymer-based <b>silver</b> <b>stripe</b> waveguides at the wavelength of 1. 31 μm. The <b>silver</b> <b>stripe</b> waveguides were fabricated in a low-loss fluorinated polymer clad. To form uniform metal stripe patterns, which {{are essential for}} reducing propagation loss, we developed a lift-off process using double layers of photoresist and SiNx. A propagation loss of less than 1. 0 dB/cm was obtained with the 11 -nm-thick <b>silver</b> <b>stripes</b> in the width range of 1. 5 - 4. 5 μm. A coupling loss of ~ 1. 0 dB with a polarization maintaining single mode fiber was achieved for a width of 4. 5 μm. For a width of 2. 0 μm, we recorded a minimum propagation loss of 0. 4 dB/cm, which is comparable with that of dielectric multi-mode waveguides...|$|R
