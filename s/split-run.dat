50|$|In 1947, Donald Murphy of Wallaces Farmer used a <b>split-run</b> edition {{to study}} the effects of making text easier to read. They found that {{reducing}} from the 9th to the 6th-grade level increased readership 43% for an article on nylon. There was a gain of 42,000 readers in a circulation of 275,000. He found a 60% increase in readership for an article on corn. He also found a better response from people under 35.|$|E

5000|$|In {{marketing}} and web analytics, A/B testing (bucket tests or <b>split-run</b> testing) is a controlled experiment with two variants, A and B. [...] It {{is a form}} of statistical hypothesis testing or [...] "two-sample hypothesis testing" [...] as used in the field of statistics. In online settings, such as web design (especially user experience design), the goal of A/B testing is to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest (e.g., click-through rate for a banner advertisement). Formally the current web page is associated with the null hypothesis. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable typically by testing a subject's response to variable A against variable B, and determining which of the two variables is more effective.|$|E
5000|$|One {{source of}} tension is a {{difference}} in philosophy: the Canadian position is that its culture {{is a prerequisite for}} safeguarding its nationhood and should thus be excluded from free trade agreements, whereas Americans negotiators see media as just another commodity. This difference came to light during the dispute over [...] "split-run" [...] magazine during the 1990s. <b>Split-runs</b> are magazines produce a slightly modified edition (say, for a Canadian market) and resell much of the advertising space to Canadian advertisers. Canadian publishers argued that the Americans were poaching all their advertising revenue without producing substantial Canadian content. American publishers and the U.S. government countered that banning [...] "split-runs" [...] was illegal under international trade law. There have also been disputes over the generous tax credits that the Canadian federal and provincial governments give to television and film productions. This, combined with a weaker Canadian dollar caused American filmmakers to complain during the 1990s that [...] "runaway productions" [...] were hurting American employment in the film industry, especially in California.|$|R
5000|$|Historian Robbie Jones {{called the}} house at Rose Glen the [...] "most {{impressive}} antebellum house ever constructed in Sevier County." [...] The house is a tripartite Greek Revival home consisting of a two-story central block flanked by one-story wings. The front facade of the central block includes a recessed portico supported by square Doric columns. Enclosed porches are located {{on both sides of}} the rear of the central block. The house rests on a mostly limestone foundation, although the west wing rests on a brick foundation (possibly left over from the earlier Shields house). A <b>split-run</b> staircase in one of the rear porches provides access to the second story of the central block, which contains three bedrooms. The house has three cellars, one of which (under the central block) was used as a kitchen, and has three brick chimneys with post-and-lintel mantels.|$|E
40|$|Marketing and {{advertising}} managers began “scientific advertising ” {{in the early}} 1900 s with <b>split-run</b> newspaper tests. Large publishers printed two runs of the same newspaper. Placing different versions of their advertisement (with a unique mail-in coupon) in each run, managers could measure the number of orders from each. This offered {{a simple way to}} test new pictures...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{contemporary}} cultural policy have {{focused primarily on}} the impact of foreign popular cultural goods on national cultures. While these studies evaluate the effectiveness of the policies, the motivations driving the original legislation are largely overlooked. This dissertation marks a departure from this approach by assessing contemporary Canadian cultural policy from a motivational perspective by questioning the factors driving protectionist cultural policy in an era of trade liberalization. In addition to qualitative and quantitative research, this analysis relies on documents received from the Canadian government through Access to Information Requests to provide an understanding of the influencing factors driving the development of protectionist cultural policy in Canada in response to the <b>split-run</b> magazine dispute of the 1990 s. This thesis begins with an examination of the perceived role of popular culture in nation building and the presumed role of foreign culture in eroding national identity as the foundation of protectionist cultural policy in Canada. After establishing this foundation, three hypotheses regarding potential alternative motivations driving the development of contemporary protectionist cultural policy in Canada are tested through an in-depth examination of the <b>split-run</b> magazine dispute. The first hypothesis is that protectionist cultural policy in Canada is motivated by economic forces. The second hypothesis is that private interests of industry and political stakeholders drive protectionist cultural policy in Canada. The final hypothesis is that cultural protectionism in Canada serves a broader political agenda in a globalizing context. Analysis revealed that the legislation developed throughout the <b>split-run</b> dispute was not designed to meet the government's stated objective of fostering a greater sense of national identity through the provision of Canadian content to Canadians. Likewise, while economics and a broader political agenda both appeared to factor into the policy development to some extent, neither can be determined as the primary motivator driving Canadian protectionist cultural policy. Instead, this dissertation reveals contemporary Canadian cultural policy is driven by political elites purporting to protect national identity while shaping legislation to promote stakeholder interests. In doing so, it substantiates allegations that Canadian cultural policy is shaped by elites promoting their own objectives. This dissertation provides the foundation for further analysis of the role and influence of stakeholders in cultural nationalism...|$|E
40|$|As {{a direct}} {{marketing}} tool, electronic Short Message Service (SMS) {{is likely to}} surpass internet-based advertising {{before the end of}} 2006. This article profiles heavy and light consumer acceptors of SMS direct advertising texts and SMS direct marketing prompts to watch TV programs. The article includes empirical findings of practitioner campaign evaluations of SMS-TV direct marketing campaigns in U. K. and U. S. markets. The results support the view that younger consumers higher in social class are the most willing to accept SMS direct advertising text and respond favorably to SMS-TV integrated marketing communications. The article closes with a call for true experiments to validate consumer acceptance and use of SMS-TV interactive, commercial, communications via <b>split-run</b> testing. ...|$|E
