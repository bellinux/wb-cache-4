The particle X is assumed to decay {{to a pair of}} light quarks, and the fully hadronic final state XH → qq̅'bb̅ is analysed. The search considers the regime of high XH resonance masses, where the X and H bosons are both highly Lorentz-boosted and are each reconstructed using a single jet with large radius parameter. A two-dimensional phase space of XH mass versus X mass is <b>scanned</b> <b>for</b> evidence of <b>a</b> <b>signal,</b> over <b>a</b> range of XH resonance mass values between 1 TeV and 4 TeV, and for X particles with masses from 50 GeV to 1000 GeV. All search results are consistent with the expectations for the background due to Standard Model processes, and 95...|$|R
