40|$|We {{consider}} slicing {{of extended}} finite state machines. These may be non- deterministic and hence standard techniques for slicing, developed for control flow graphs, are not immediately applicable. In this {{paper we propose}} ways of expressing the semantic correctness of slicing. We shall demand that the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine</b> simulates the original machine, so an “observable” step taken by the latter can also {{be done by the}} former. In the other direction, we cannot hope for a perfect simulation, but demand that for each observable step by the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine,</b> either the original machine simulates it or (i) it gets stuck, or (ii) it loops. To ensure correctness, it suffices to demand that the set of transitions in the slice satisfies two conditions: it must be closed under the well-known notion of data dependence, and it must have the “weak commitment ” property highlighted by Danicic et al. If the slice also has the “strong commitment ” property, the case (ii) above can be ruled out, meaning that the original machine will simulate the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine</b> except that it may get stuck. We prove that for each of the properties “weak commitment ” and “strong com- mitment”, there exists a least set with that property; we also give algorithms to compute that least set...|$|R

Liver samples from five different species (human, pig, cattle, rat, mouse) were cut and the reproducibility of slice thickness was analyzed by cross sectioning the PCLS.

40|$|Three {{groups of}} {{premises}} (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} whether a simple semi-quantitative method aided by software enhanced visualization can be reliable {{enough for the}} quantification of emphysema during the daily workload. Patients and methodsThirty patients with COPD were included. Patients had a standard non enhanced MDCT study of the chest using a 16 <b>slice</b> <b>machine.</b> The images were evaluated visually and scored. This scoring was repeated after applying a density mask. Three radiologists evaluated the images on separate occasions. Repeatability was also tested. The CT emphysema index and the mean lung attenuation were calculated. The extent of airway disease was not assessed. ResultsKappa test between the 3 readers revealed slight agreement (k= 0. 122, p= 0. 001) before the density mask and substantial agreement (k= 0. 75, p< 0. 0005) after its application. A high degree of repeatability was found. The median visual score after density mask application, showed a stronger correlation to the emphysema index (r= 0. 81, p< 0. 0005) than before. ConclusionWe present a simple visual score for quantitation of emphysema, that when combined with a simple density mask, the inter-rater agreement and repeatability of scoring are markedly improved.
