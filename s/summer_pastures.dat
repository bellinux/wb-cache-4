25|$|Traditional or fixed {{transhumance}} {{has occurred}} throughout the inhabited world, particularly Europe and western Asia. It is often important to pastoralist societies, as the dairy products of transhumance flocks and herds (milk, butter, yogurt and cheese) may form {{much of the}} diet of such populations.

30|$|Marked herbage offer {{differences}} were observed between the Chinese and Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture.</b> Compared to the Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture,</b> higher water availability due to higher amounts of snow melt water and spring precipitation {{were likely to}} foster plant growth on the Chinese <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> during the late spring, the period immediately preceding <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> utilization. For 2013 and 2014, the average cumulated precipitation before <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> utilization amounted to 71  mm in China and 32  mm in Mongolia (Figure  1). These data imply that the Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> suffered from low soil moisture contents in the late spring/early summer season; in addition, very low average daily air temperatures before the utilization period was of − 11  °C in Mongolia as compared with only − 2  °C in China (Figure  1) and was delaying vegetation growth (Yiruhan et al. 2014). Additionally, strict regulations at the Chinese <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> (that is, limited animal numbers and restricted access to the pastures {{until the end of}} the main flowering period) may have favoured herbage production.|$|R

25|$|In Kyrgyzstan, {{transhumance}} practices, {{which never}} died {{out during the}} Soviet period, have undergone a resurgence in the difficult economic times following independence in 1991. Transhumance is integral to Kyrgyz national culture. The people use a wool felt tent, known as the yurt or jailoo, while living on these <b>summer</b> <b>pastures.</b> It is symbolised on their national flag. Those shepherds prize a fermented drink made from mare's milk, known as the kumis. A tool used in its production is the namesake for Bishkek, the country's capital city.|$|E
25|$|Beltane is {{mentioned}} {{in some of}} the earliest Irish literature and it is associated with important events in Irish mythology. It marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the <b>summer</b> <b>pastures.</b> Rituals were performed to protect the cattle, crops and people, and to encourage growth. Special bonfires were kindled, and their flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. The people and their cattle would walk around the bonfire or between two bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the aos sí. Doors, windows, byres and the cattle themselves would be decorated with yellow May flowers, perhaps because they evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: a thorn bush decorated with flowers, ribbons and bright shells. Holy wells were also visited, while Beltane dew was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness. Many of these customs were part of May Day or Midsummer festivals in other parts of Great Britain and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} to {{take stock}} of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher <b>summer</b> <b>pastures.</b> It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E

500|$|Mesta flocks {{followed}} a seasonal pattern of transhumance across Spain. In the spring, {{they left the}} winter pastures (invernaderos) in Extremadura and Andalusia to graze on their <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> (agostaderos) in Castile, returning again in the autumn. Spanish rulers eager to increase wool profits gave extensive legal rights to the Mesta, often {{to the detriment of}} local peasantry. The huge merino flocks had a lawful [...] for their migratory routes (cañadas). Towns and villages were obliged by law to let the flocks graze on their common land, and the Mesta had its own sheriffs that could summon offending individuals to its own tribunals.|$|E
500|$|The {{department}} of Ariege {{is known for}} the annual transhumance (seasonal migration) of cattle, sheep and horses, including {{many members of the}} Mérens breed. Each year, in June, hundreds of horses are moved to <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> at around [...] in altitude, where they live in a semi-feral state, traveling on steep mountain paths and weathering storms and other climactic variations. In October, they return to the valleys for the winter. An old tradition, the transhumance fell out of favor, but has been reintroduced to Ariege by the association Autrefois en Couserans. Since 2000, the association has worked with local horse breeders to promote the return to the annual practice. Around 500 Mérens make the transhumance each year. Herds are usually led by an experienced mare marked with a bell, as is done with cattle. A stallion can accompany the mares with foals to maintain cohesion of the herd and prevent it from mixing with other herds on the mountain slopes. The behavior of transhumant herds is midway between that of feral horses and domesticated horses who are around humans year-round. Some horses, raised high in the mountains, stay there year-round and do not perform the transhumance.|$|E

2500|$|Cattle {{ranching}} {{is another}} traditional branch of Nakhchivan farming. Due {{to the dry}} climate, pastures in Nakhchivan are unproductive, therefore sheep breeding prevails over other livestock production. Winter pastures stretch on the PriAraz plain, on the foothills and mountain sides to the altitude of 1200m. But the <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> go up on the high-mountain area to an altitude of 2300–3200m. The most widespread sheep variety is [...] "balbas".

2500|$|Altan Khan [...] died soon after, but in {{the next}} century the Gelug spread {{throughout}} Mongolia, aided in part by the efforts of contending Mongol aristocrats to win religious sanction and mass support for their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to unite all Mongols in a single state. Viharas (Mongolian datsan) were built across Mongolia, often sited at the juncture of trade and migration routes or at <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> where large numbers of herders would congregate for shamanistic rituals and sacrifices. Buddhist monks carried out a protracted struggle with the indigenous shamans and succeeded, to some extent, in taking over their functions and fees as healers and diviners, and in pushing the shamans to the fringes of Mongolian culture and religion.|$|E
2500|$|The subjugation of the Hazarajat, {{particularly}} the mountain fortresses of Ghor, proved {{difficult for the}} Mongols after their conquest of the region, and ultimately Mongol military detachments {{left behind in the}} region [...] "adopted the language of the vanquished". In the late 14th century, Timur's armies made expeditions into Hazarajat, but Hazarajat was once again free after his death. During Mongolian era, majority of Hazara were pastoralists dwelling in yurts and spoke Moghol. They started inhabiting the fortified villages, adopted a Persian dialect, and farming in the high steppes in the early 16th century. However, they kept flocks and some, on the norther slopes of Koh-i-Baba, remained nomadic and continued migrating between highland <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> and lowland winter pastures.|$|E

[...] The primary picture is of a population that lived in small hamlets located in defensible places. There is evidence that herdsmen, when traveling between <b>summer</b> <b>pastures,</b> built temporary camps or lived in caves and rock shelters. However, their range was not confined to the hills, nor was their culture confined to herding cattle, as shown by sites like Coppa Nevigata, a well-defended and somewhat sizeable coastal site where a variety of subsistence strategies were practiced alongside advanced industries such as dye production.|$|E

2500|$|Beltane {{was one of}} four Gaelic {{seasonal}} festivals: Samhain (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), Beltane (~1 May), and Lughnasadh (~1 August). Beltane {{marked the}} beginning of the pastoral summer season, when livestock were driven out to the <b>summer</b> <b>pastures.</b> Rituals were held at that time to protect them from harm, both natural and supernatural, and this mainly involved the [...] "symbolic use of fire". There were also rituals to protect crops, dairy products and people, and to encourage growth. The aos sí (often referred to as spirits or fairies) were thought to be especially active at Beltane (as at Samhain) and the goal of many Beltane rituals was to appease them. Most scholars see the aos sí as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. Beltaine was a [...] "spring time festival of optimism" [...] during which [...] "fertility ritual again was important, perhaps connecting with the waxing power of the sun".|$|E
2500|$|In Ireland {{transhumance}} {{is known}} as [...] "booleying". [...] Transhumance pastures were known as Booley, Boley, Bouley, Buaile and Boola. These names survive in many place names such as Buaile h'Anraoi in Kilcommon parish, Erris, North Mayo, where the landscape still clearly shows {{the layout of the}} rundale system of agriculture. The livestock, usually cattle, was moved from a permanent lowland village to <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> in the mountains. The appearance of [...] "Summerhill" [...] (...) in many placenames also bears witness to the practice. This transfer alleviated pressure on the growing crops and provided fresh pasture for the livestock. Mentioned in the Brehon Laws, booleying would have dated back to the Early Medieval period or even earlier. The practice was widespread in the west of Ireland up until the time of the Second World War. Seasonal migration of workers to Scotland and England for the winter months superseded this ancient system, together with more permanent emigration to the USA.|$|E
2500|$|Samain or Samuin was {{the name}} of the feis or festival marking the {{beginning}} of winter in Gaelic Ireland. It is attested in some of the earliest Old Irish literature, from the 10th century onward. It was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: Samhain (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), Bealtaine (~1 May) and Lughnasadh (~1 August). Samhain and Bealtaine, at the witherward side of the year from each other, are thought to have been the most important. Sir James George Frazer wrote in [...] that 1 May and 1 November are of little importance to European crop-growers, but of great importance to herdsmen. It is at the beginning of summer that cattle are driven to the upland <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> and the beginning of winter that they are led back. Thus, Frazer suggests that halving the year at 1 May and 1 November dates from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent on their herds.|$|E
