5000|$|The fulcrum roll is a roll {{in which}} {{the rim of the}} drum {{momentarily}} replaces the original finger-created fulcrum. The initial stroke creates contact with the drum head in a relatively normal manner. Immediately subsequent, at the bottom or end of the down <b>stroke</b> <b>motion,</b> the rim is contacted approximately 1 inch in front of the thumb and forefinger. Contact with the rim rocks the front portion of the stick upwards from the point of contact with the rim. At this moment, the wrist is located just below the rim and the bead is a couple inches above the head. From the bottom of the down-stroke, the hand is then raised for the upstroke. While the hand raises, the bead of the stick is returning back toward the head after its bounce off the rim. As the raising hand and falling bead reach the same height, the head is struck for the second time. This creates two beats contacting the drum head out of a single <b>stroke</b> <b>motion</b> of the arm. The precise moment of contact with the rim momentarily creates a new fulcrum at the drum stick's physical point of contact with the rim. This is one of the easier and more commonly used forms of a [...] "one handed roll". When executed with precision, this doubling of contact means 16th notes can be played while the arm only strokes 8th notes, or 32nd notes can be played while stroking only 16th notes.|$|E

50|$|The {{decrease}} in efficiency {{when looking at}} the cursorial model is caused by the flapping stroke needed to achieve flight. This <b>stroke</b> <b>motion</b> needs both wings to move in a symmetrical motion, or together. This is opposed to an asymmetrical motion like that in humans' arms while running. The symmetrical motion would be costly in the cursorial model because it would be difficult while running on the ground, compared to the arboreal model where it is natural for an animal to move both arms together when falling. There is also a large fitness reduction between the two extremes of asymmetrical and symmetrical flapping motion so the theropods would have evolved to one of the extremes.|$|E

Psychophysical experiment with 11 observers was executed {{in order to examine}} whether two and four stroke apparent motions can induce vection or not. It has been known that two frames of visual pattern which are slightly shifted with each other can create an impression of continuous motion toward designated direction, using luminance reversal pattern (Four <b>stroke</b> <b>motion)</b> or introducing brief blank inter-stimulus interval (Two <b>stroke</b> <b>motion).</b> Vection strengths measured by magnitude estimation were compared between conditions of the two and the four <b>stroke</b> <b>motion,</b> conventional apparent motion, and original motion sequence with 60 Hz refresh rate (real motion).

40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of drag-based paddling propulsion are studied {{with a simple}} mechanical model and a measurement technique for mapping three-dimensional flow fields. In drag-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength is an important parameter {{in the relationship between}} vortex formation and thrust generation. Our results indicate that spanwise flow behind the paddling propulsor significantly affects tip vortex development and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow is dependent on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared with a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, spanwise flow is not as strong as that for the high Reynolds number case. Without sacrificing total impulse, the flexible propulsor can smooth out thrust peaks during sudden <b>stroke</b> <b>motions,</b> which is favorable for avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. We also explored the role of stopping vortex shedding in efficient thrust generation by determining the relationship between stroke angles and total impulses generated by paddling propulsors...|$|R

Experiments on a lightweight prototype of this stroke-cam mechanism on a 50  mm-long wing demonstrate that a harmonic <b>stroke</b> <b>motion</b> is generated with a peak-to-peak stroke amplitude of 175 ° at a flapping frequency of 40  Hz.

40|$|A stroke-analysis {{system based}} on a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) {{simulation}} has been developed to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces acting on a swimmer’s hand. Using the present stroke-analysis system, a stroke technique of top swimmers can be recognized {{with regard to the}} hydrodynamic forces. The developed analysis system takes into account the effect of a transient <b>stroke</b> <b>motion</b> including acceleration and a curved stroke path without using assumptions such as a quasi-static approach. An unsteady Navier-Stokes solver based on an unstructured grid method is employed as the CFD method to calculate a viscous flow around a swimmer’s hand which can cope with the complicated geometry of hands. The CFD method is validated by comparison with experiments in steady-state and transient conditions. Following the validations, a stroke-analysis system is proposed, in which a hand moves in accordance with a stroke path measured by synchronized video cameras, and the fluid forces acting on the hand are computed with the CFD method. As a demonstration of the stroke-analysis system, two world class swimmers’ strokes in a race of 200 m freestyle are analyzed. The hydrodynamic forces acting on the hands of the top swimmers are computed, and the comparison of two swimmers shows that the stroke of the faster swimmer, who advanced at 1. 84 m·s- 1 during the stroke-analysis, generated larger thrust with higher thrust efficiency than that of the slower swimmer, who advanced at 1. 75 m·s- 1.

40|$|A new semifree-piston rotary {{generator}} {{concept is}} modelled dynamically and {{reduced to a}} single equation for piston <b>stroke</b> <b>motion.</b> This new concept comprises a toroidal-segment piston and cylinder, which orbit on separate generator disks, coupled {{by a pair of}} torsion springs to form a balanced mass-elastic system capable of spin. Conventional cyclic combustion takes place in the cylinder causing resonant motion of the disks. A two-part control strategy is proposed and tested by simulation to address the multi-objectives of maximum mechanical power transfer, minimum peak generator torque, and accurate piston top dead center (TDC) position control. A Part I strategy initially assumes that the combustion gas pressure is a function of time only. This produces torque control that follows a stroke velocity feedback law, which maximizes power transfer and implicitly minimizes generator torque, {{at the same time as}} power generation. When stroke-dependent gas pressure is introduced, however, the Part I strategy creates an unstable self-excited nonlinear system. The Part II strategy is designed to control piston TDC position and stabilize the response. This uses proportional control of gas pressure rise, assumed possible through fuel injection control and in-cylinder pressure sensing. An ideal-air-standard-dual-combustion two-stroke cycle is then adopted for nonstochastic simulation purposes, excluding the effect of delays and coupled system dynamics. A study is undertaken of a nominal 1. 42 l, 200 mm orbit-radius, constant-pressure-scavenged diesel design with three different spring stiffness values. By focusing near the minimum compression ratio for diesel, to give a lower bound on the possible ideal output power, control gains are found that produce stable motion with piston TDC position errors of less than 1 %. The power range is from 16 kW to 336 kW, depending mainly on spring stiffness. Since the concept can also store significant kinetic energy, it is potentially attractive as a range-extender for electric vehicles...|$|E
