50|$|Rumex conglomeratus, {{known as}} {{clustered}} dock and <b>sharp</b> <b>dock,</b> is a plant {{of the family}} Polygonaceae. An annual or biennial plant growing up to 100 cm high. A native of Europe, Asia and North Africa, {{it has also been}} introduced into North America.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible use of plants to remediate polluted waters, a pot experiment {{was carried out}} in the laboratory with five wetland plant species, i. e., <b>sharp</b> <b>dock</b> (Polygonum amphibium L.), duckweed (Lemna minor L.), water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), water dropwort [Oenathe javanica (BL.) DC. ] and calamus [Lepironia articulata (RETZ.) DOMIN]. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and three heavy metals, cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb), were the objects of remediation. <b>Sharp</b> <b>dock</b> was found to be a good accumulator of N and P. Indeed, on a dry weight basis the shoots of <b>sharp</b> <b>dock</b> accumulated up to 6. 4 % of N and 1. 1 % of P with BCF (bioconcentration factor) values of 2235 and 1568, respectively. Water hyacinth and duckweed strongly accumulated Cd with concentrations of 462 and 14200 mg/kg, respectively, and BCF values of 1225 and 2567, respectively. Water dropwort achieved the highest concentrations of Hg, i. e., 1. 2 mg/kg with a BCF value of 807, whereas calamus achieved the highest concentrations of Pb, i. e., 512. 4 mg/kg in its roots with a BCF value of 1217. Thus, it could be concluded that the above plant species are good candidates for phytoremediation of polluted waters, as follows: <b>sharp</b> <b>dock</b> through accumulation of N and P in its shoots, water hyacinth and duckweed as hyperaccumulators of Cd, water dropwort as an hyperaccumulator of Hg and calamus as an hyperaccumulator of Pb...|$|E
