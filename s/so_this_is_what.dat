500|$|Although a level {{sharing the}} same name {{appeared}} in Sonic & Knuckles, the original version of Hidden Palace was left unfinished until the remastered iOS port was released in December 2013, which features a redesigned version of the level as an optional stage. Sega also provided some magazines with mockup images that showed another scrapped level, the desert-themed Dust Hill Zone, and the stolen 1992 prototype features an unused level slot titled [...] "Genocide City". Naka has also alluded to another scrapped level in the Sonic Jam Official Strategy Guide, explaining why the Metropolis Zone had three parts to it, while every other level only had two: [...] "Due to problems with the story, Act 3 {{was going to be}} a different Zone that would only appear once, but since it was cut, we still wanted to have something after Act 2. So that's why there are three acts in this one. We had already finished the map, and it would have been a shame to waste it, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we went with." ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani's {{debut album}} Love. Angel. Music. Baby. took {{influence}} {{from a variety}} of 1980s genres, which included electropop, new wave, dance-rock, hip hop, R, soul, and disco music. Stefani cited early Madonna, Lisa Lisa, Club Nouveau, Prince, New Order and The Cure as major influences for the album. Several of the album's tracks were designed for clubs, and contained electro beats meant for dancing. Dealing with fashion and wealth, the singer name-drops several designers who she considered inspirations in her personal career, such as John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood. Her second studio album The Sweet Escape resembles musically its predecessor while exploring more modern pop sounds, dabbling heavily into genres such as dance-pop and rap. It carried on the same themes developed in Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and was criticized for doing <b>so.</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> the Truth Feels Like, the singer's third album, continued Stefani's endeavors with the pop genre. However, she incorporated music {{from a variety of}} other genres, including reggae, disco, and dancehall, in addition to the use of guitars. Stefani's lyrics shifted towards events that had recently occurred in her personal life, such as her divorce from husband Rossdale, and newfound relationship in Shelton. Additionally, the singer stated her album was not [...] "about revenge" [...] like others had interpreted it, and that it was actually [...] "about forgiveness".|$|E

[...] "Heigh-ho! <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> all our fine ambitions have come to, Lexy, your music and my M.D. A place in a department store for you, and one in a lumber mill for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I had my {{suspicions of}} you. I had my suspicions from the first, when I heard that my idiot of a nephew {{had made a}} casual friend in London. <b>So,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> you <b>were!</b> A thief, who--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Harry went, and {{his father}} sighed and mused! [...] "That's a fine fellow! <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> comes of {{bringing}} sick sailors home--one's own boys must be catching the infection. Little monkey, he talks as wisely {{as if he were}} forty! He is really set on it, do you think, Margaret? I'm afraid so!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> {{is going}} on, eh?" [...] he stormed. [...] "Having food brought {{in on the}} sly, eh? Well, I'll see that that is stopped! You'll go without your supper for this!" [...] And then, {{after a few more}} words, he stormed out of the room, banging the door behind him and locking it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it," [...] he wheezed. [...] "You're {{having a}} joke with me! <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you were {{hatching}} as I came downstairs! Don't tell me! If you had really thrown him over, you wouldn't have been laughing together like that. It's no good, my dear. I {{might have been}} taken in, if I had not seen you, but I did." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he {{had thought}} was God! Tarzan's lip curled in an angry snarl as he leaped into the hut after the terror-stricken witch-doctor.

6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> {{she meant}} by another {{turn of the}} screw! She had made a public {{imbecile}} of me. Now she would brand me as a criminal. This time she has failed. But how about the next? I dare not think of it--and of Agatha and my poor old mother! I wish that I were dead! ...|$|R
60|$|Faith {{explained}} tearfully. The Blythe girls {{sympathized with}} her, and even Mary Vance {{agreed that it}} was a hard position to be in. But Jerry, on whom the thing came like a thunderbolt, refused to <b>be</b> placated. <b>So</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> some mysterious hints he had got in school that day meant! He marched Faith and Una home without ceremony, and the Good-Conduct Club held an immediate session in the graveyard to sit in judgment on Faith's case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our navy had {{suddenly}} and mysteriously disappeared! Also, as suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut down, the Church laid a ban upon the electric light! I {{had to be}} up and doing--and straight off. Your life was safe--nobody in these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back--I had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming. I felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours. <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I did. From our various works I selected all the men--boys I mean--whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and I called them together secretly and gave them their instructions. There are fifty-two of them; none younger than fourteen, and none above seventeen years old." ...|$|E
60|$|Nancy {{you would}} call a shop-girl--because you have the habit. There is no type; but a perverse {{generation}} is always seeking a type; <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the type should be. She has the high-ratted pompadour, and the exaggerated straight-front. Her skirt is shoddy, but has the correct flare. No furs protect her against the bitter spring air, but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily {{as though it were}} Persian lamb! On her face and in her eyes, remorseless type-seeker, is the typical shop-girl expression. It is a look of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood; of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come. When she laughs her loudest the look is still there. The same look {{can be seen in the}} eyes of Russian peasants; and those of us left will see it some day on Gabriel's face when he comes to blow us up. It is a look that should wither and abash man; but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowers--with a string tied to them.|$|E
6000|$|... ...I {{have just}} {{despatched}} your inclosure to P. L. at I, Dorotheergasse 6, Vienna; an address that I recommend your taking a note of; and I {{have also made}} the reflection that the fury, or whatever, that Edinburgh inspires you with ought, you know, to do the very opposite of drying up the founts of your genius in writing to me--since you say your letter would have been other (as it truly might have been longer) didn't you suffer so from all that surrounds you. That's the very most juvenile logic possible--and the juvenility of it (which yet in a manner touches me) is why I call you retrogressive--by way of a long stroke of endearment. There was exactly an admirable matter for you to write me about--a matter as to which you are strongly and abundantly feeling; and in a relation which lives on communication as ours surely should, and would (save for starving,) such occasions fertilise. However, of course the terms are easy on which you extract communication from me, and always have been, and always will be--so that there's doubtless {{a point of view}} from which your reservations (another fine word) are quite right. I'm glad at any rate that you've been reading Balzac (whose [...] "romantic" [...] side is rot!) and a great contemporary of your own even in his unconsidered trifles. I've just been reading Compton Mackenzie's Sinister Street and finding in it an unexpected amount of talent and life. Really a very interesting and remarkable performance, I think, in spite of a considerable, or large, element of waste and irresponsibility--selection isn't in him--and at one and the same time so extremely young (he too) and so confoundingly mature. It has the feature of improving so as it goes on, and disposes me much to read, if I can, its immediate predecessor. You must tell me again what you know of him (I've forgotten what you did tell me, more or less,) but in your own good time. I think--I mean I blindly feel--I should be with you about Auld Reekie--which somehow hasn't a right to be so handsome. But I long for illustrations--at your own good time. We have emerged from a very clear and quiet Xmas--quiet for me, save for rather a large assault of correspondence. It weighs on me still, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I call--and you will too--very brief.... I wish you the very decentest New Year that ever was. Yours, dearest boy, all affectionately, ...|$|E

5000|$|Surfing and snowboarding {{are what}} I do for fun - {{to get out}} and play in nature. We live in a {{beautiful}} universe, and I wish to enjoy it and understand it as best I can. And I try to live a balanced life. Surfing is simply the most fun I know how to have on this planet. And physics, and science in general, is the best way of understanding how everything works. <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I spend my time doing.

50|$|The {{fact that}} {{something}} {{may be used}} for propaganda is not a values statement about the thing itself. It is a simple truism that people are influenced by things around them and therefore, when those things around include architecture, people will be influenced by it as a part of an environment. This inherent quality of architecture then can be used by those with the desire to do <b>so.</b> <b>This</b> use <b>is</b> <b>what</b> transforms the architecture from a simple influence into a piece of propaganda.|$|R

The car ran on one cylinder, put together from whatever parts the two brothers could find in Montreal, Hamilton, Toronto and Detroit, Michigan. Instead of a transmission the Shamrock had a system of belts and clutches helping it to run. The vehicle was named Shamrock the First, and without being aware of it the Mimna Brothers {{became a part of}} Canadian history.|$|E

The tour features shows in the United Kingdom, her first since over five years. For {{the first leg of}} the tour, ticket sales were good, prompting a second round of dates in the U.S. When describing the vibe of the tour, Lauper stated:"When I was a really young kid, country music was pop music, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we grew up listening to.

[...] He also said [...] "When I eventually sat down and opened National Front News, my sense of euphoric defiance ended - very abruptly", as it was filled with [...] "hate-filled articles" [...] about Jewish people, Holocaust denial and black and Asian immigration into Britain.

Shortly after the airing of the pilot, AMC released a featurette titled [...] "Directors' Commentary On “Pilot”" [...] which went into greater detail about {{the creation of the}} pilot episode, with both Rogen and Goldberg providing commentary and insight into its construction. The directors were intent on challenging themselves within the production, with the budget limitations helping in that regard, as it forced both men to become even more creative, to which Rogen remarked, [...] "We were very concerned about our budget on this show, and how good our visual effects would be.
