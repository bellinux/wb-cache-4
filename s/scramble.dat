5|$|Seven {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} on the event's card, which featured a supercard, a scheduling {{of more than}} one main event. The three brands, Raw, SmackDown, and ECW, were all represented by their respective Championship <b>Scramble</b> match – a 20minute time limit bout, during which participants can become the temporary champion via pinfall or submission. The main event of the pay-per-view was the Championship <b>Scramble</b> from the Raw brand. It was originally scheduled to feature World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk defending his title; he was replaced by Chris Jericho after Randy Orton attacked CM Punk. Jericho won the match and became World Heavyweight Champion. The Championship <b>Scramble</b> from the ECW brand featured ECW Champion Mark Henry defending, losing the match and title to Matt Hardy. The SmackDown brand's Championship <b>Scramble</b> saw WWE Champion Triple H defeat the other competitors to retain his championship. Another featured match on the undercard was an unsanctioned match, or hardcore match, in which Shawn Michaels defeated Chris Jericho.|$|E

He continued to feud with Henry until No Mercy, where Hardy successfully retained the title.

The use of randomized QMC methods, where randomness {{can be brought to}} bear on quasirandom sequences through <b>scrambling</b> and other related randomization techniques, brings more wide applications for QMC. However, the integration variance can depend strongly on the <b>scrambling</b> methods. Much of the work dealing with <b>scrambling</b> methods has been aimed at ways of linear <b>scrambling</b> methods. In this paper, we {{take a close look at}} the quadratic <b>scrambling</b> method for Faure sequences and compare with other linear <b>scrambling</b> methods. We will investigate the implementation and the performance of nonlinear <b>scrambling</b> methods for Faure sequences. The <b>scrambling</b> methods will focus on quadratic and inversive <b>scrambling.</b> We will compare those nonlinear <b>scrambling</b> methods with linear <b>scrambling</b> methods by a set of test-integral functions. Pseudorandom number generation by nonlinear methods will be expensive when their moduli are large. In our case, the modulus is relatively small. To the best of our knowledge, such a comparison has never been done before. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{predominant}} match {{from the}} SmackDown brand was a Championship <b>Scramble</b> for the WWE Championship, in which title holder Triple H faced Jeff Hardy, The Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). The {{build up to}} the match began on the August 22 episode of SmackDown!, when General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced that SmackDown would have a Championship <b>Scramble</b> match and that the competitors would include WWE Champion Triple H and four men to be decided later in the night {{through a series of}} qualifying matches. The first qualifying match was a ten man battle royal, which saw The Big Show disrupt the match and throw all the competitors over the top rope. The Brian Kendrick, however, was saved by his bodyguard, Ezekiel Jackson, who caught Kendrick and put him back in the ring after the Big Show had eliminated all other competitors. Thus, Kendrick qualified for the Championship <b>Scramble.</b> The second qualifying match saw MVP defeat Festus by count out, qualifying for the match. The third qualifying match was Shelton Benjamin versus Finlay, which Benjamin won. The final qualifying match was Jeff Hardy versus The Great Khali, which Hardy won.|$|E

5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit <b>scramble</b> competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as <b>scramble</b> competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore {{the nature and}} {{properties}} of <b>scrambling</b> in Korean.

I assume that <b>scrambling</b> is adjunction and defend this view in Ch. 5. In Ch. 2 and Ch. 3, based on binding facts and scope reconstruction, I claim that <b>scrambling</b> is best analyzed as A-movement. <b>Scrambling</b> either creates a binding relation which does not obtain in the base order, or destroys a binding relation which obtains in the base order. A <b>scrambled</b> element undergoes optional reconstruction for scope interpretation. All these properites are consistent with those of standard A-movement.

30|$|The main {{process of}} chaotic image {{encryption}} algorithm includes two processes {{of confusion and}} <b>scrambling</b> {{based on the number}} of pseudorandom sequences. Whether it is the confusion of pixel color processing or the <b>scrambling</b> process of pixel position conversion, the processing effect is highly correlated with the randomness of the number of pseudorandom sequences. Therefore, the pseudorandom number generator of this paper is analyzed by simulating the <b>scrambling</b> operation. The random analysis of the <b>scrambling</b> location in this paper is mainly through the construction of the <b>scrambling</b> matrix which satisfies the sequence number of uniform distribution after the random sequence number is optimized, and the M[*]×[*]N matrix is obtained, and then the randomness of the <b>scrambling</b> matrix is examined by the correlation between the eight neighborhood elements of the elements of the <b>scrambled</b> matrix.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the characteristics of}} <b>scrambling</b> in Japanese within the Principles and Parameters theory (Chomsky 1981 - 1992, and others). In the late 19802 ̆ 7 s, the important hypothesis has been raised that <b>scrambling</b> can be in principle A or A'-movement (e. g. Mahajan 1989). The present work investigates when and why <b>scrambling</b> can be A-movement. A wide range of examples with <b>scrambling</b> is considered, including the comparison of clause-internal <b>scrambling</b> vs. long distance <b>scrambling,</b> <b>scrambling</b> to the sentence initial position vs. <b>scrambling</b> to the intermediate position, as well as long distance <b>scrambling</b> out of a finite clause vs. long distance <b>scrambling</b> out of a Control clause. ^ Chapter 1 gives {{an overview of the}} thesis. The discussion in Chapter 2 leads the conclusion that only clause-internal <b>scrambling</b> to the intermediate position and <b>scrambling</b> out of a Control clause to the intermediate position can be A-movement. It is, therefore, argued that there is an A-position in the intermediate position, between the subject and the indirect object. Chapter 3 considers the status of the intermediate A-position. It is shown that clause-internal <b>scrambling</b> to this position is necessarily A-movement, while <b>scrambling</b> out of a Control clause to this position can be A or A'-movement. This contrast is accounted for in terms of the Case Checking Theory and the Economy of derivation in Chomsky (1989, 1992) and Chomsky and Lasnik (1991). It is argued that A-scrambling is to the Spec of AGRoP. Chapter 4 provides further support for the hypothesis raised in Chapter 3, considering long distance A-scrambling. The data are presented which suggest that the <b>scrambled</b> object can have its Case checked in the matrix clause. Another important goal of this chapter is to examine the structure of a Control construction in Japanese, which has not been adequately discussed in the literature. Provided that a Control clause allows long distance A-scrambling, whereas a finite clause does not, the structural differences are considered in conjunction with the locality requirement on A-movement in Chomsky and Lasnik (1991). ...|$|R
