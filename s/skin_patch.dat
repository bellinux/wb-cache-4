25|$|A Japanese company {{develops}} a reusable <b>skin</b> <b>patch</b> which can treat chronic {{high blood pressure}} by constantly releasing bisoprolol into the bloodstream.

25|$|A similar {{approach}} to the ALS assay. The transdermal patch is a suggested method of detecting active M.tuberculosis circulating within blood vessels of patient. This <b>skin</b> <b>patch</b> contains antibodies recognizing the secreted bacterial protein MPB-64 passing through the blood capillaries of the skin creating an immunological response. If the patch detects this secreted bacterial protein, the surrounding skin will redden.|$|E

25|$|HRT may be {{reasonable}} {{for the treatment}} of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a <b>skin</b> <b>patch.</b> Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of strokes and blood clots. When used for menopausal symptoms some recommend it be used for the shortest time possible and at the lowest dose possible. Evidence to support long term use however is poor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{test that}} was done {{throughout}} the 1980s by some opposition groups and holistic dentists was the <b>skin</b> <b>patch</b> test for mercury allergies. As part of [...] "prospecting for disease," [...] Consumer Reports wrote that these groups had placed high doses of mercuric chloride on a <b>skin</b> <b>patch</b> which was guaranteed to produce irritation on the patient's skin and subsequent revenue for the person administering the test.|$|E
2500|$|The Ara macaws {{are large}} parrots ranging from [...] {{in length and}} 285 to 287g (10oz) in weight in the chestnut-fronted macaw to [...] in the green-winged macaw. The wings of these macaws are long and narrow which is typical for species of parrot which travel long {{distances}} in order to forage. They have a massive downward curved upper mandible and a patch of pale skin around the eye that extends to base of the beak. The <b>skin</b> <b>patch</b> bears minute feathers arranged in lines that form a pattern over the otherwise bare skin in all species of the genus except the scarlet macaw in which the skin is bare. In most species the bill is black, but the scarlet macaw and green-winged macaw have a predominantly horn coloured upper mandible and a black lower one.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the problem of}} determining head pose estimation and face 3 D orientation of several people in low resolution sequences from multiple calibrated cameras. Spatial redundancy is exploited and the head in the scene is detected and geometrically approximated by an ellipsoid. <b>Skin</b> <b>patches</b> from each detected head are located in each camera view. Data fusion is performed by backprojecting <b>skin</b> <b>patches</b> from single images onto the estimated 3 D head model, thus providing a synthetic reconstruction of the head appearance. Finally, these data are processed in a pattern analysis framework thus giving an estimation of face orientation. Tracking over time is performed by Kalman filtering. Results of the proposed algorithm are provided in the SmartRoom scenario of the CLEAR Evaluation. ...|$|R
5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by <b>patches</b> of abnormal <b>skin.</b> These <b>skin</b> <b>patches</b> are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{cosmetic}} {{problem that}} vitiligo produces affects patients psychologically. Many patients with vitiligo are suggested {{to cover their}} white <b>skin</b> <b>patches</b> with cosmetic products. There are formulations in traditional Iranian pharmacy to color these white <b>skin</b> <b>patches.</b> In this study, one of these formulations was compared with a cosmetic formulation. Methods. Two groups of patients were selected. One group used a marketed formulation and other group used a traditional Iranian Pharmacy formulation. The {{quality of life of}} the patients was compared based on the Dermatology Life Quality Index Questionnaire. Results. Both interventions were associated with statistically improved Dermatology Life Quality Index scores over the 8 -week intervention (P <. 05), although the difference between the 2 was not statistically significant (P. 436). Conclusion. Traditional Iranian Pharmacy formulation is effective in increasing {{the quality of life in}} vitiligo patients...|$|R

50|$|A dermal patch or <b>skin</b> <b>patch</b> is a {{medicated}} adhesive patch that {{is placed}} on the skin to deliver a medication into the skin. This is in contrast to a transdermal patch, which delivers the medication through the skin and into the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|Pure {{lorazepam}} is {{an almost}} white powder that is nearly insoluble in water and oil.

50|$|There {{are various}} tools {{that can be}} used to apply {{foundation}} including your fingers, a sponge, and several varieties of foundation brushes, each providing a different finish.

5000|$|Lidocaine <b>skin</b> <b>patches.</b> These are small, bandage-like patches {{that contain}} the topical, pain-relieving {{medication}} lidocaine.

5000|$|In recent years, {{the plaster}} has changed quite drastically. Instead of herbs being smeared on <b>patches</b> of dog <b>skin,</b> <b>patches</b> of linen and fabric are used, {{due to the}} fact that dog skin is much more {{expensive}} and hard to obtain (animal rights). In addition, modern chemicals are often added to the adhesive [...] "herbal" [...] mixture on the plaster, including ingredients such as menthol and camphor.|$|R
25|$|Fentanyl {{may produce}} more {{prolonged}} respiratory depression than other opioid analgesics. In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but {{doctors in the}} United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008.
