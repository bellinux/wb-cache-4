50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments for the mining industry was the Guibal fan, which was patented in Belgium in 1862 by the French engineer Théophile Guibal. The Guibal fan had a <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> surrounding the fan blades, as well as a flexible shutter to control the escape velocity, which made it far superior to previous open-fan designs and led to the possibility of mining at great depths. Such fans were used extensively for mine ventilation throughout Britain.|$|E
50|$|The main adit was {{relatively}} large, {{and ran for}} 440 yd to reach an underground marshalling area. This level was designated as floor A. An incline led up to floors B to D Up, {{and there were a}} further three floors below floor A, designated as floors B to D Down. Another incline connected B and C Down to the marshalling area, and a separate incline connected floors C and D Down. Output in the early years was quite low, but following Kellow's innovations, was between 5,000 and 6,000 tons per year but then declined until the quarry closed. At its peak, around 300 men were employed there, of whom some 70 stayed in barracks. Forced ventilation was used, and a large fan house was constructed near the entrance to the adit. It housed a Guibal fan, although described by Richards as a Guiblas fan, and experiments were also carried out with waterblast ventilation, using a vertical shaft between the chambers and the hillside. The Guibal fan was patented in Belgium by Guibal in 1862, and its <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> which surrounded the fan blades made it much superior to previous open-fan designs. Such fans were used extensively for mine ventilation throughout Britain.|$|E

The {{effects of}} {{deformation}} modulus, thickness {{and range of}} cushion layer on mechanical characteristics of <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> in hydropower station has been analyzed using the finite element program ANSYS and nonlinear contact theory. The result shows that when cushion layer scope and poisson ratio is fixed, as the elastic modulus of cushion layer decreases, the deformation and stress of <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> increases, surrounding concrete load-bearing ratio of water pressure reduces.

40|$|Abstract. The {{volume of}} {{concrete}} surrounding the <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> increases {{along with the}} increase of unit capacity of single-unit hydroelectric station. Once the <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> concrete structure works with crack, its bearing capacity and safety stability will decrease seriously. Owing to the action of contraction stress induced by temperature variation, the <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> concrete is often subject to cracking. There are a few temperature control researches on <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> concrete during construction in the past, more severe, there are few researches on the sensitivity analysis of parameters and measures on temperature control. For this reason, based on the finite element analysis software ANSYS, the <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> concrete of Xiluodu underground power plant is simulated. The temperature field and temperature stress field of different pouring temperature and concrete strength are analyzed and the temperature control measures with normal C 30 concrete and 293. 15 K casting are recommended to prevent cracks accordingly.

40|$|We {{construct}} analytically stationary global configurations {{for both}} aligned and logarithmic spiral coplanar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) perturbations in an axisymmetric background MHD disc with a power-law surface mass density Σ_ 0 ∝ r^-α, a coplanar {{azimuthal magnetic field}} B_ 0 ∝ r^-γ, a consistent self-gravity and a power-law rotation curve v_ 0 ∝ r^-β where v_ 0 is the linear azimuthal gas rotation speed. The barotropic equation of state Π∝Σ^n is adopted for both MHD background equilibrium and coplanar MHD perturbations where Π is the vertically integrated pressure and n is the barotropic index. For a scale-free background MHD equilibrium, a relation exists among α, β, γ and n such that only one parameter (e. g., β) is independent. For a linear axisymmetric stability analysis, we provide global criteria in various parameter regimes. For nonaxisymmetric aligned and logarithmic <b>spiral</b> <b>cases,</b> two branches of perturbation modes (i. e., fast and slow MHD density waves) can be derived once β is specified. To complement the magnetized singular isothermal disc (MSID) analysis of Lou, we extend the analysis to {{a wider range of}} - 1 / 4 <β< 1 / 2.

50|$|The cased {{ammunition}} is more advanced in development, partially {{due to the}} fewer technical difficulties and the fewer differences with standard ammunition. It has already reached the required technology readiness level of 5. As of 2008, the {{cased ammunition}} has been tested {{for a wide range}} of operating temperatures, and it has had over 9000 rounds fired (approximately 6500 rounds of Spiral 1 ammunition, and over 2000 of Spiral 2). The second spiral version of the cased ammunition produced a 33% weight reduction (falling just short of the program goal), while the ongoing development of the third <b>spiral</b> of <b>cased</b> ammunition has achieved a roughly 40% reduction. The third spiral is also 30% smaller than standard ammunition. The improvement by the third <b>spiral</b> of <b>cased</b> ammunition over the second spiral was achieved partially by compacting and consolidating the propellant (thereby allowing a smaller cartridge case and round). Having reached a sufficient technology readiness level, the Spiral 2 ammunition is being prepared for a contracted 2000 round delivery. The cased ammunition has shown itself as a virtually risk free option, with present and potential ability grounded in success. In addition, development of the cased ammunition firing weapon has significantly improved understanding of the weapon action and requirements. Cased telescoped ammunition for the LSAT light machine gun reached technology readiness level 7 after 25,000 rounds were fired in trials in 2011.|$|R

In {{consideration}} of the contact between the steel spiral casing and the peripheral reinforced concrete, a nonlinear analysis for the combined bearing structure of the JinPing-I preloading filling <b>spiral</b> <b>case</b> has been made with ANSYS. Contrasts of {{the stress of the}} reinforcing bars, the biggest width of the crack and the outspread section of the crack has been made with the different parameters of preloading pressure and reinforcement scheme, resulting in a reasonable preloading pressure and reinforcement scheme.

40|$|In rapid {{parallel}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, {{the problem of}} image reconstruction is challenging. Here, a novel image reconstruction technique for data acquired along any general trajectory in neural network framework, called ``Composite Reconstruction And Unaliasing using Neural Networks'' (CRAUNN), is proposed. CRAUNN {{is based on the}} observation that the nature of aliasing remains unchanged whether the undersampled acquisition contains only low frequencies or includes high frequencies too. Here, the transformation needed to reconstruct the alias-free image from the aliased coil images is learnt, using acquisitions consisting of densely sampled low frequencies. Neural networks are made use of as machine learning tools to learn the transformation, in order to obtain the desired alias-free image for actual acquisitions containing sparsely sampled low as well as high frequencies. CRAUNN operates in the image domain and does not require explicit coil sensitivity estimation. It is also independent of the sampling trajectory used, and could be applied to arbitrary trajectories as well. As a pilot trial, the technique is first applied to Cartesian trajectory-sampled data. Experiments performed using radial and spiral trajectories on real and synthetic data, illustrate the performance of the method. The reconstruction errors depend on the acceleration factor as well as the sampling trajectory. It is found that higher acceleration factors can be obtained when radial trajectories are used. Comparisons against existing techniques are presented. CRAUNN has been found to perform on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Acceleration factors of up to 4, 6 and 4 are achieved in Cartesian, radial and <b>spiral</b> <b>cases,</b> respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Our simulated results demonstrate the feasibility and merits of the proposed algorithm. Keywords: Cone-beam CT, nonstandard spiral scanning, PI-line, n-PI-window, backprojection-filtration (BPF).
