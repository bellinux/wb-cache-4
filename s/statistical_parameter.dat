50|$|With today's {{electron}} optics, {{electron beam}} widths can routinely {{go down to}} a few nm. This is limited mainly by aberrations and space charge. However, the feature resolution limit is determined not by the beam size but by forward scattering (or effective beam broadening) in the resist while the pitch resolution limit is determined by secondary electron travel in the resist. This point is driven home by the 2007 demonstration of double patterning using electron beam lithography in the fabrication of 15 nm half-pitch zone plates. Although a 15 nm feature was resolved, a 30 nm pitch was still difficult to do, due to secondary electrons scattering from the adjacent feature. The use of double patterning allowed the spacing between features to be wide enough for the secondary electron scattering to be significantly reduced. The forward scattering can be decreased by using higher energy electrons or thinner resist, but the generation of secondary electrons is inevitable. It is now recognized that for insulating materials like PMMA, low energy electrons can travel quite a far distance (several nm is possible). This {{is due to the}} fact that below the ionization potential the only energy loss mechanism is mainly through phonons and polarons, although the latter is basically an ionic lattice effect. Polaron hopping could extend as far as 20 nm. The travel distance of secondary electrons is not a fundamentally derived physical value, but a <b>statistical</b> <b>parameter</b> often determined from many experiments or Monte Carlo simulations down to < 1 eV. This is necessary since the energy distribution of secondary electrons peaks well below 10 eV. Hence, the resolution limit is not usually cited as a well-fixed number as with an optical diffraction-limited system. Repeatability and control at the practical resolution limit often require considerations not related to image formation, e.g., resist development and intermolecular forces.|$|E
