The engine {{was built by}} Blair & Co. Ltd., also in Stockton-on-Tees. The iron cargo ship was launched in June 1893 in Stockton. SS Athen was a <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> with a 1 x 3 cyl. triple expansion engine (serial No. 1149), consisting of two boilers and a single shaft. She managed 9 knots on her trial, and was 2,199 grt, whilst having dimensions of 277.5 and 37.5 feet. The ship was owned by A. C. de Freitas & Co. in Hamburg until 1901, when it was sold to Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt A.G. - Hamburg-Amerika Linie - HAPAG of Hamburg. It was sold again in 1903 to its third and final owners Gätjens & Jarke in Hamburg.|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{computational}} {{study on}} the hydrodynamic perfor- mance of twisted and untwisted rudders for a <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> are presented. Ship flow simulations are performed by using a hybrid RANSE/BEM model. Numerical predictions by RANSE and BEM solvers are validated through comparisons against ex- perimental data for the ship considered in the study. The com- parative analysis of untwisted and twisted rudders is carried out by fully–appended ship flow simulations at uniform ship speed and rudder angles between 0 and 20 degrees. Numerical results predict comparable manoeuvring capabilities for the alternative layouts, whereas the twisted design allows to mitigate negative pressure peaks observed on the untwisted rudder surface over a range of helm angles...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{the side effects of}} {{propellers}} cavitation, i. e. pressure pulses and radiated noise. These effects are gaining more and more importance for commercial ships for different reasons. Pressure pulses significantly affect comfort onboard, thus their reduction is of utmost importance for all ships carrying passengers. As regards the underwater radiated noise, in the last decade interest has shifted from navy applications to commercial ships, due to the concern for the rising background noise in the oceans. The propellers, generating noise directly in water, represent one of the main contributions to the overall underwater noise emitted from ships. Due to the complexity of the mechanisms of propeller noise generation, different complementary strategies have to be followed to properly analyze the problem, ranging from induced pressure pulses to broadband noise and cavitation. In the present work, part of the activities carried out in the framework of the collaborative EU FP 7 project AQUO (Achieve QUieter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www. aquo. eu) are reported. The paper presents the investigations carried out on a specific test case represented by a <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> research <b>vessel,</b> which is analyzed with three different strategies: numerical calculations, model scale investigations and fullscale measurement...|$|R
5000|$|Marine {{propellers}} {{are also}} known as [...] "screws". There are many variations of marine screw systems, including twin, contra-rotating, controllable-pitch, and nozzle-style <b>screws.</b> While smaller <b>vessels</b> {{tend to have a}} <b>single</b> <b>screw,</b> even very large ships such as tankers, container ships and bulk carriers may have <b>single</b> <b>screws</b> for reasons of fuel efficiency. Other vessels may have twin, triple or quadruple screws. Power is transmitted from the engine to the screw by way of a propeller shaft, {{which may or may not}} be connected to a gearbox.|$|R
40|$|With a view {{to improve}} {{reliability}} of the performance prognosis of modern merchant vessels in the preliminary design stage, model tank tests performed by the Vienna Ship Model Basin of the period from 1980 to 1995 have been analysed. The resistance test results are compared with the different statistical methods. The open water test results of stockpropellers are compared with the propeller efficiencies of the Wageninger B-screw series. For the model experiment results available a PC program for database-based ship trial prognosis has been developed. In addition to the database-based method a novel statistical method for estimating the ships resistance has been developed. This method is intended to enable estimating not only a mean resistance, but also the minimum resistance of good lines and the maximum resistance of poor lines. Furthermore formulas for estimating the wake factor, the thrust deduction factor and the relative rotative efficiency for <b>single</b> and twin <b>screw</b> <b>vessels</b> are presented. The novel statistical method for resistance and propulsion factors has been tested with a control group of ship models which recently have been tested at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA). (orig.)

This made her a small wooden frigate to a design by the Surveyor's Department of the Admiralty on 25 April 1847; {{she and her sister}} Highflyer were redesignated as corvettes in 1854. In common with other screw corvettes of the time, she was envisaged as a steam auxiliary, intended to cruise under sail with the steam engine available for assistance.

40|$|The {{problem of}} ship {{manoeuvrability}} has reached nowadays a significant consideration, both for merchant ships, with {{the adoption of}} IMO standards, and naval ships, with the production of various documents by NATO Specialist Teams. In literature many works regarding manoeuvrability of <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> slow/medium speed ships can be found, while a lack of information exists for what regards twin screw ships (cruise ships, RoRo ferries, megayachts, naval vessels), characterised by different form coefficients and more complex stern configuration due to appendages like skegs, shaft lines and brackets that can strongly affect manoeuvrability behaviour. In this hydrodynamic coefficients {{of a series of}} twin <b>screw</b> naval <b>vessels</b> have been evaluated considering different semi-empirical formulations proposed by various authors and standard manoeuvres (turning circle and zig-zag) have been simulated {{with the aid of a}} simulator tool. Discrepancies of predicted manoeuvres with respect to experimental full scale ones have been analysed considering parameters involving stern appendages and hull main dimensions in order to select most suitable regressions to study twin <b>screw</b> <b>vessel</b> manoeuvring performance in the earlier design stages. Moreover, linear hydrodynamic coefficients corrections related to stern appendages contribution have been developed on the basis of results of a system identification technique and of an analysis of a set of experimental data at PMM for a ship model equipped with different stern appendages configurations...|$|R
40|$|Simplified {{mathematical}} models {{based upon}} semi-empirical regression formulae describing forces and moments {{acting on the}} hull during manoeuvres are commonly used for the preliminary evaluation of ship steering capabilities. Many semi-empirical regressions have been developed, and are broadly adopted, for the manoeuvrability prediction of <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> slow/medium speed ships. Their application {{for the study of}} twin <b>screw</b> <b>vessels</b> (cruise ships, RoRo ferries, megayachts, naval vessels, for which dedicated regression formulae are scarce) manoeuvring capabilities could lead to misleading results. These ships are usually characterised by different hull forms and more complex stern configuration due to the presence of appendages like skegs, shaft lines and brackets, which can strongly affect manoeuvrability behaviour. In this work a novel procedure to properly account for the particular geometric and stern appendage characteristics of these kind of vessels is described. A thorough analysis has been performed on a ship model equipped with 13 different stern appendage configurations and new formulae have been developed in order to describe accurately their influence on ship manoeuvring behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Biodiesel is {{obtained}} by processing edible and non-edible oils. Due {{to the increase}} in demand for fuel and stringent emission norms, biodiesel is preferred as it meets the emission norms. To meet the exponentially growing demands in developing countries, continuous production is required which can be achieved by mechanical <b>screw</b> presses. Currently, <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> press is being widely used for extraction of oil. The problems associated with the <b>single</b> <b>screw</b> expeller is that, it requires three or more passes to expel oil from seeds, which increases the production time and are also less efficient. In this paper, a counter rotating twin screw expeller is designed for extraction of oil from the Pongamia pinnata seeds.
