Another childhood idol, Sammy Davis, Jr., had admired Jackson's black <b>sequined</b> jacket during the performance and later received it as a gift.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold <b>sequined</b> swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sequin</b> Tails: In this {{variation}} on fabric and neoprene tails, individual <b>sequins</b> are sewn onto a tail for decoration. Occasionally, <b>sequins</b> are sewn onto {{only a few}} areas {{to serve as a}} highlight; more commonly, they are sewn over the entire tail, and provide all of the tail's color and patterning. <b>Sequin</b> tails are time-intense to create, as each <b>sequin</b> must be sewn on by hand, and as a result these tails can be quite expensive. Variation is nearly unlimited due to the amounts and types of <b>sequins</b> available on the market.|$|R
30|$|Two {{detached}} <b>sequins,</b> both likely {{from the}} p.r. shoe, were examined by µ-FTIR, {{as well as}} a <b>sequin</b> still attached to the p.l. shoe. From the p.r. shoe, detached <b>sequin</b> 1 is in a relatively good condition, while detached <b>sequin</b> 2 has cracks and losses of its red coating. Results are consistent with the presence of a protein-based core (most likely gelatin) laminated on both sides with a thin layer of cellulose nitrate. The findings are in agreement with known compositions of gelatin-based <b>sequins</b> of similar age reported in the literature [7 – 10].|$|R
5|$|Cyrus has {{performed}} the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. Cyrus {{wore a black}} <b>sequined</b> cat suit during the performance. During this segment of the tour, a kiss cam was featured on the Jumbotron of the hosting arena. The performance also featured a red and white gingham horse during select shows. During a performance on February 22, Cyrus kissed recording artist Katy Perry {{in the middle of}} the track, which resulted in a minor conflict between the women. During a later showing on February 27, Cyrus invited Matt Peterson, who notably asked Cyrus to his high school prom through YouTube that January, onstage while she sang.|$|E

Borders, which were either simple or did not exist on early drapo Vodou, have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.The use of <b>sequins</b> in modern drapos dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing <b>sequin</b> costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of Rara band players with <b>sequins,</b> and in 1943 made a drapo Vodou for Damballa from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.He made the image from <b>sequin</b> lines on a satin background, and added random <b>sequins</b> surrounding the image. Fortine taught his techniques to <b>sequin</b> artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. The youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat {{in front of}} her face, while doves fly out of another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking in front of a red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, <b>sequined</b> hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of a shower of sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire breathers. The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E

25|$|The Western Costume Company in Hollywood {{claims to}} have made Garland's {{original}} slippers. While {{it is likely that}} Western would have been contracted to make some of The Wizard of Ozs many costumes, no records of the original slippers exist to either validate or disprove their claim. In 1989, to commemorate the movie's 50th anniversary, Western produced the only authorized reproductions. Hand-lasted on Judy Garland's original foot mold and completely <b>sequined</b> and jeweled, the reproduction slippers were nearly identical to the originals. Western planned a limited edition of 500 pairs at $5000 each, but halted the project after selling only 16 pairs. One of these pairs fetched $35,000 (including buyer's premium) at a November 25, 2013, auction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sequins</b> are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as spangles, paillettes, or diamantes, but technically differ. In costuming, <b>sequins</b> have a center hole, while spangles have the hole located at the top. Paillettes themselves are commonly very large and flat. <b>Sequins</b> may be stitched flat to the fabric, so that they do not move, and are less likely to fall off; or they may be stitched at only one point, so that they dangle and move easily, to catch more light. Some <b>sequins</b> are made with multiple facets, to increase their reflective ability.|$|R

25|$|To {{create the}} ruby slippers, the shoes were dyed red, then {{burgundy}} <b>sequined</b> organza overlays {{were attached to}} each shoe's upper and heel. The film's early three-strip Technicolor process required the sequins to be darker than most red sequins found today; bright red sequins would have appeared orange on screen. Two weeks {{before the start of}} shooting, Adrian added butterfly-shaped red strap leather bows. Each of the Art Deco-inspired bows had three large, rectangular, red-glass jewels with dark red bugle beads, outlined in red glass rhinestones in silver settings. The stones and beads were sewn to the bows, then to the organza-covered shoe.

40|$|RNA {{sequencing}} (RNA-seq) {{can be used}} {{to assemble}} spliced isoforms, quantify expressed genes and provide a global profile of the transcriptome. However, the size and diversity of the transcriptome, the wide dynamic range in gene expression and inherent technical biases confound RNA-seq analysis. We have developed a set of spike-in RNA standards, termed 2 ̆ 7 <b>sequins</b> 2 ̆ 7 (sequencing spike-ins), that represent full-length spliced mRNA isoforms. <b>Sequins</b> have an entirely artificial sequence with no homology to natural reference genomes, but they align to gene loci encoded on an artificial in silico chromosome. The combination of multiple <b>sequins</b> across a range of concentrations emulates alternative splicing and differential gene expression, and it provides scaling factors for normalization between samples. We demonstrate the use of <b>sequins</b> in RNA-seq experiments to measure sample-specific biases and determine the limits of reliable transcript assembly and quantification in accompanying human RNA samples. In addition, we have designed a complementary set of <b>sequins</b> that represent fusion genes arising from rearrangements of the in silico chromosome to aid in cancer diagnosis.
