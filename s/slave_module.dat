40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in systems and synthetic biology {{is the lack of}} modular composition. Modules change their behavior once connected, due to retroactivity. In this paper, we build upon our earlier results and provide a theorem establishing how the dynamics of a master <b>module</b> change once <b>slave</b> <b>modules</b> are present. We quantify the change in the dynamics of the master module due to interconnection as a function of measurable biochemical parameters. Based on this, we provide a bound on the difference between the trajectories of the connected system and those of the isolated system by employing contraction theory. Therefore, we obtain a measure of robustness, which helps evaluating the degree of modularity in a system, while providing guidelines for robust module design.

The {{objective of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} new calibration system for analog and smart digital pressure sensors, operable by only one person, and capable of calibrating local and remote sensors connected via RS 232 cables, Bluetooth or an 802. 11 b wireless LAN. It is proposed that the operator uses a portable calibration standard and a tablet PC to conduct the sensor calibration. In order to handle local sensors directly connected to the tablet PC and remote sensors connected to the tablet PC via a network capable application processor (NCAP), a dual module application is proposed and developed using LabVIEW. The application has a Master Module and a <b>Slave</b> <b>Module.</b> Both modules are able to connect to multiple digital sensors at the same time. The Master Module was designed to run on the operator's tablet PC offering an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the monitoring or calibration of any connected sensors.

The proposed control concept may lead to easier distributed control implementation of parallel dc–dc converters and distributed power systems, and may lead to redundancy that is achievable using droop method.

In this project, we design and implement an AXI-based system on the Nostrum NoC, which features a 2 D mesh topology and deflective routing. The main components we add to the Nostrum NoC are master and slave interfaces. The master interface conducts packetization, queuing and multiplexing. The slave interface performs de-packetization, queuing, de-multiplexing and, in particular, reordering of transfers. We also build master and <b>slave</b> <b>modules</b> to serve as traffic generators and sinks. One particular feature of the master module is that it can regulate traffic burstiness while generating traffic. All these models are implemented in VHDL at the RTL. The interface protocol of masters and slaves is the AXI from ARM. With the above components, we designed experiments to show the effect of traffic regulation. Our results show that higher burstiness traffic results in larger transfer delay and bigger backlog. We can conclude that the transfer delay and backlog can be controlled to some degree in a best-effort network via regulating the traffic burstiness. ...|$|R
