5000|$|The vehicle's {{controls}} {{are designed to}} work much like those of an ordinary truck. [...] However, they have multiple mechanisms for the driver to slow or stop the vehicle. Next to the traditional brake pedal {{there is a second}} foot pedal to activate a <b>secondary</b> <b>braking</b> system. There is a lever {{to the right of the}} steering wheel, called the [...] "retarding brake", used for less intense braking. Finally, the vehicle's drive-train will automatically change gears, while descending inclines, to help the driver keep its speed under control.|$|E

50|$|Secondly drivers newly {{allocated}} {{the type}} had not driven a vehicle of equivalent power before and most were not {{trained in the}} use of the semi-automatic gearbox which lacked the engine-braking effect of a 'solid' transmission. This resulted in many engine losses due to overspeeding, there was no easy way to control this as the pure 'fluid flywheel' form of transmission was used rather than a Leyland SCG-style lock-up clutch. Problems with the braking and transmission fed back on one another and exacerbated engine damage. PMT altered the change-speed control on some of its buses from electrical to pneumatic to slow down gearchanges but at the time and with the transmission system fitted there was no way to install an effective <b>secondary</b> <b>braking</b> system.|$|E

In order to control this sudden brake failures we have modified the conventional braking systems in automobiles by adding an extra safety brake to the engine shaft.

5000|$|The 470 series or 2-8-2 K-28 class {{locomotives}} {{were ten}} engines designed for freight service along the D&RG. They were {{built by the}} Schenectady Locomotive Works of the American Locomotive Company (Alco) in Schenectady, New York in 1923. The K-28s have 28000 lbf kN. of tractive effort, superheated, and the boilers are fed by two non-lifting injectors. Air brakes are 6-ET automatic and also feature a straight air <b>secondary</b> <b>braking</b> system for daily passenger trains. Due to their smaller size these engines are often used on the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule, and often for helper service or sectioned trains. Despite being smaller than the K-36 class locomotives, older, and less powerful, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing. Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard, as the clam shell-style firedoors tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft, and if any flues in the boiler are leaking, the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives. Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large [...] "heel" [...] pattern, generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible, and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors. This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet, which usually is hindered {{by the lack of}} draft between the grates and the arch brick. New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this because the art of reading a fire takes time to learn, and the amount of time working on the K-28 class locomotives is far reduced compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving in technique.Out of the original ten only three 470s remain, and all are owned by the D & S. The other seven were requisitioned by the United States Army in 1942 to be used on the White Pass & Yukon Route in Alaska during World War II. They were later dismantled for scrap in 1946.|$|E

5000|$|A {{band brake}} {{is a primary}} or <b>secondary</b> <b>brake,</b> {{consisting}} of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment to either prevent it from rotating (a static or [...] "holding" [...] brake), or to slow it (a dynamic brake). This application is common on winch drums and chain saws and is also used for some bicycle brakes.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the train}} has safely exited the mid-course brake run the train goes {{downhill}} into an underground tunnel. This underground tunnel houses the ride's [...] "triple down", where the train goes down three separate hills in complete darkness, picking up considerable speed in the process. After exiting the tunnel, the train races toward the station while staying {{to the left}} of the track on the outbound hills. This portion goes under the supporting steel for the first three hills, creating multiple headchopper effects, once again crossing under Thunderbird. The train then takes a right turn, crossing under the outbound track, before making a left turn and crossing under the outbound track again. At this point the train goes sideways again in the final 90Â° banked to the right. Once the train exits the banked turn it passes under the lift hill and takes a turn to the left. The ride's on-ride camera is located on the left side of the track near this turn. After the train passes the on-ride camera it goes uphill and over the base of the lift hill before making a diving right turn into an underground tunnel. This underground tunnel goes under the entrance and exit walkways to the ride; it is also located right next to the basement queues, where there is a viewing window where waiting guests can watch the train fly by. After exiting the tunnel the train makes a climbing right turn before quickly shifting to a diving left turn that takes riders into an underground tunnel under the Thanksgiving midway. Then, after exiting the tunnel, the train makes a climbing, sweeping turn to the right. Once the train exits the turn, it immediately enters the brake run to end the ride. If there is a train occupying the <b>secondary</b> <b>brake</b> run the train will wait in the primary brake run until it is clear. If it is clear, the train will continue on to the <b>secondary</b> <b>brake</b> run. If there are two trains operating, the train will wait in the <b>secondary</b> <b>brake</b> run until the second train has left the station. If not, the train will continue directly into the station at which point riders will unload.|$|R

With {{nearly all of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>braking</b> systems it is possible to obtain sufficient deceleration to meet legal requirements for the braking path. The critical point however is lateral stability. The report concludes with recommendations for legal requirements concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; tractors for semi-trailers should have a split braking system; and service brakes for motor vehicles and trailers (semi-trailers) should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|E

The shunter's crew had attempted to stop the train by applying the locomotive's <b>secondary</b> <b>brake</b> however this was overcome by the momentum of the moving wagons. The Driver's Safety Device (deadman's pedal) in the shunter was disabled by a feature that allowed the driver to leave his seat to observe the passage of the train in certain circumstances.

5000|$|The {{company had}} a number of firsts for the auto industry; these {{included}} dual brakes, the use of dashboard oil-pressure and generator warning lights, and the first balanced crankshaft, which allowed the Hudson straight-six engine, dubbed the [...] "Super Six" [...] (1916), to work at a higher rotational speed while remaining smooth, developing more power for its size than lower-speed engines. The Super Six was the first engine built by Hudson, previously Hudson had developed engine designs and then had them manufactured by Continental Motors Company. Most Hudsons until 1957 had straight-6 engines. The dual brake system used a <b>secondary</b> mechanical emergency <b>brake</b> system, which activated the rear brakes when the pedal traveled beyond the normal reach of the primary system; a mechanical parking brake was also used. Hudson transmissions also used an oil bath and cork clutch mechanism that proved to be as durable as it was smooth.|$|R
50|$|Hondaâs first street {{motorcycle}} with {{a combined}} braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This system was derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. Honda made several variations of the LBS system with differing levels of complexity and integration. The Honda CBR1000F and CBR1100XX and VFR800 featured what Honda called LBS II (now called Dual CBS), a system where both levers would activate both brakes through a system of secondary pistons and proportioning/delay valves. One front brake caliper was connected to a secondary master cylinder, and the caliper was allowed to rotate slightly to apply pressure to the piston in that <b>secondary</b> master cylinder. <b>Braking</b> force was translated into pressure that {{was sent to the}} rear brake cylinder. Only the two outer pistons in the front brake calipers were directly activated by the brake lever; the center piston received pressure from the rear pedal via the proportioning and delay valve.|$|R
40|$|Increasing incidences of {{fire from}} land {{conversion}} and residue burning in tropics {{is the major}} concern in global warming. Spatial and temporal monitoring of trends of fire incidences is, therefore, significant {{in order to determine}} contribution of carbon emissions from slash and burn agriculture. In this study, we analyzed time-series Terra / Aqua MODIS satellite hotspot products from 2001 to 2013 to derive intra- and inter-annual trends in fire incidences in Nagaland state, located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. Time-series regression was applied to MODIS fire products at variable spatial scales in GIS. Significance of change in fire frequency at each grid level was tested using t statistic. Spatial clustering of higher or lower fire incidences across study area was determined using Getis-OrdGi statistic. Maximum fire incidences were encountered in moist mixed deciduous forests (46 %) followed by <b>secondary</b> moist bamboo <b>brakes</b> (30 %). In most parts of the study area fire incidences peaked during March while in warmer parts (e. g. Mon district dominated by indigenous people) fire activity starts as early as during November and peaks in January. Regression trend analysis captured noticeable areas with statistically significant positive (e. g. Mokokchung, Wokha, Mon, Tuensang and Kiphire districts) and negative (e. g. Kohima and north-western part of Mokokchung district) inter-annual fire frequency trends based on area-based aggregation of fire occurrences at different grid sizes. Localization of spatial clusters of high fire incidences was observed in Mokokchung, Wokha, Mon,Tuensang and Kiphire districts. ...|$|R
40|$|The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has an {{in-house}} modification of EPA's PART 5 model {{for use in}} estimating respirable particulate matter (PM- 10) from vehicle exhaust. The update is named PART 5 -TX 1 and this paper describes the new model. To create PART 5 -TX 1, the PART 5 model was modified to incorporate the effects of emission control equipment deterioration for most types of vehicles. Relative to PART 5, the revised model provides an improved estimate of "in-use " emissions because only emissions data from "in-use " vehicles were used to develop its predictive equations. The database used for PART 5 -TX 1 is of chassis dynamometer data from over 600 light-duty cars and trucks and over 400 heavy-duty trucks and buses. The database is set up such {{that it can be}} easily updated and incorporated into the model as new in-use data are collected. Only direct exhaust emission factors were changed in PART 5 -TX 1. No attempt was made to change assumptions about <b>secondary</b> particulate formation, <b>brake</b> or tire wear, and dirt re-entrainment. In general, PART 5 -TX 1 predicts higher fleet-average emissions than EPA's PART 5. Other differences between PART 5 and PART 5 -TX 1 include: Â· updated particle size distribution estimates; Â· the ability to estimate the effect of fuel sulfur level; Â· estimates for the effects of a simple, opacity-based inspection and maintenance program for diesels or a "smoking vehicle " program for gasoline vehicles; and, Â· updated heavy-duty diesel vehicle conversion factors, vehicle registration distributions, and mileage accumulations (all from MOBILE 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Experiences with Advanced Cruise Control in traffic; {{a limited}} experiment. Advanced Cruise Control (ACC) is an {{ordinary}} cruise control {{in which the}} desired speed is installed manually, but in which the headway time to the vehicle in front is also taken into account. If the headway time becomes less than the installed critical threshold value, the system brakes the vehicle gradually. If the vehicle in front is no longer there, or the headway time {{is greater than the}} threshold value, the installed speed is again resumed. If the vehicle in front approaches at too high a speed, the system also brakes. This braking can occur by reducing speed, changing to a lower gear (in automatic gearboxes), or using the brakes. An ACC system is meant for use on rural roads during quiet periods. The system is not meant to avoid collisions during critical circumstances; it is nÃ³t an anti-collision system. While using an ACC system, the driver keeps the final responsibility; he/she can disengage the system at any time. Much research has been done in the use of ACC and any road safety effects, for example using computer simulations, with subjects in driving simulators, and in some experiments on a driving range or on the road. However, these experiments were all carried out with an experimental ACC. As far as we know, no research in the Netherlands or elsewhere in Europe has been done with a factory-installed ACC in real traffic. For this reason an explorative study was done with ACC in a Nissan Primera, that was willingly supplied by NISSAN Netherlands Ltd. The purpose was to get an impression of the first experiences with ACC, and to compare them with what was known from scientific reports. This impression can help indicate necessary supplementary research. Ten people participated in the experiment, and these were recruited from and via SWOV personnel. The test journeys lasted between one and two hours. After the test journey, a questionnaire was completed. The questions included were derived from the reports and previous test journeys. Because of the select sample and its limited size, the results only have an indicative character. In general, the ACC system was judged positively and it enjoyed support. The guidebook was judged positively, as was the ease of the switches. The position of the display, on the right-hand side above the dashboard, was found to be less positive; it distracted the attention. The legibility was also found not to be so good. Preference was given to a short headway time. The majority were of the opinion that ACC did not decrease the attention, but did ease the driving task. When rapidly approaching a slowly moving vehicle in front, the ACC system braked rather late and hard; the driver tends to brake earlier. When overtaking, the acceleration of the ACC system was rather sluggish, whereby there was the tendency to accelerate self. We recommend supplying a cd-rom or DVD with the guidebook, making it possible to conduct a test drive interactively behind a computer. A better position for the display is where, in most cars, the speedometer is situated. The symbols on the display should be larger and clearer. If the driver himself brakes and does not wait for the system, the brake system of ACC can serve as a <b>secondary</b> one. This <b>brake</b> system starts to work if the driver has not yet done so. With this, it is expected that safety will be promoted. When overtaking, the driver should accelerate to avoid unnecessarily hindering vehicles behind if the ACC acceleration is insufficient. Finally, we recommended that supplementary research be conducted in which ACC systems of various car manufacturers are tested during a longer period and with more participants...|$|R
