5|$|Outside of England and Wales, the {{decision}} {{has not been}} applied. In White v Shortall, the Supreme Court of New South Wales explicitly rejected Dillon's reasoning. Campbell J nonetheless reached the same conclusion (that a <b>settlor</b> could declare a valid trust of an unascertained parcel of shares {{that was part of}} a larger fund), albeit by different reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the <b>settlor</b> intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the <b>settlor,</b> something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E
5000|$|Most asset {{protection}} trusts established by U.S. <b>settlors</b> are considered [...] "grantor trusts" [...] under U.S. income tax law, meaning that all {{income of the}} trust is reportable on the grantor's (i.e., the <b>settlor's)</b> individual income tax return. Asset-protection trusts do not, in and of themselves, offer any tax advantages under U.S. income tax law.|$|R

5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the <b>settlor</b> to the trustees.|$|E
25|$|Revocable trust: A {{trust of}} this kind may be amended, altered or revoked by its <b>settlor</b> at any time, {{provided}} the <b>settlor</b> is not mentally incapacitated. Revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the US {{as a substitute for}} a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a person's final affairs after death.|$|E
25|$|No {{declaration}} of trust is the most straightforward form of resulting trust, and is created when a trust is created, but the <b>settlor</b> does not give the form in which the property is to be held. For example, the <b>settlor</b> might give property to the beneficiary to hold for life, but fail to explain what is {{to happen to the}} property when the holder dies. When this occurs, the property is held on resulting trust for the <b>settlor,</b> as in Vandervell v IRC. This also occurs where a trust is formed over property which requires formality, but is improperly created (for example, a land transfer that does not adhere to the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the concept}} of a {{protector}} developed in offshore jurisdictions where <b>settlors</b> were (perhaps understandably) concerned about appointing a trust company in a small, distant country as sole trustee of an offshore trust which is to hold {{a great deal of the}} <b>settlor's</b> wealth. However, protectors now form a part of mainstream tax planning in most jurisdictions which recognise trusts.|$|R

25|$|A {{discretionary}} trust in Canadian and English trusts {{law is a}} trust where the beneficiaries and/or their entitlements to the trust fund are not fixed, but {{are determined by the}} criteria set out in the trust instrument by the <b>settlor.</b> It is sometimes referred to as a family trust in Australia or New Zealand. Where the {{discretionary trust}} is a testamentary trust, it is common for the <b>settlor</b> to leave a letter of wishes for the trustees to guide them as to the settlor's wishes in the exercise of their discretion. Letters of wishes are not legally binding documents.|$|E
25|$|The trustee's {{right to}} do this, where it exists, is called a power of {{appointment}}. Sometimes, a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee, such as the <b>settlor,</b> the protector, or a beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|Spendthrift clauses: Trusts {{may be used}} {{to protect}} {{beneficiaries}} (for example, one's children) against their own inability to handle money. These are especially attractive for spendthrifts. Courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a <b>settlor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Testamentary trust (or Will Trust): A trust {{created in}} an individual's will {{is called a}} {{testamentary}} trust. Because a will can become effective only upon death, a testamentary trust is generally created at or following {{the date of the}} <b>settlor's</b> death.|$|R
5000|$|... is an English trusts law case, {{concerning}} {{the circumstances under}} which a trust will be held to be uncertain. It followed on from McPhail v Doulton, where the House of Lords affirmed that upholding the <b>settlor's</b> intentions was of paramount importance.|$|R
25|$|A {{resulting}} trust {{will also be}} found where the purposes of a trust have been completed, but there is excess property left over; for example, a trust by a <b>settlor</b> to provide for his children's university education. Judges and academics disagree over what should happen to the property; possibilities are {{that it should be}} held for the donors, that it should be held for the beneficiaries (as the donors intended to make an irrevocable gift) or that it should be given to the Crown as bona vacantia. A fourth suggestion is that the trustees take the surplus, as in Re Foord. The general rule was set out in Re Trusts of the Abbot Fund, where it was decided that excess funds will be held on {{resulting trust}} for the <b>settlor.</b> There are exceptions to this rule; the general rule is put aside if the court can find intention to benefit specific individuals, as in Re Osoba.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid trust: A hybrid trust {{combines}} {{elements of}} both fixed and discretionary trusts. In a hybrid trust, the trustee must pay {{a certain amount of}} the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the <b>settlor.</b> But the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property, once these fixed amounts have been paid out, is to be paid to the beneficiaries.|$|E
25|$|Resulting trust: A {{resulting}} trust {{is a form}} of implied trust which occurs where (1) a trust fails, wholly or in part, as a result of which the <b>settlor</b> becomes entitled to the assets; or (2) a voluntary payment is made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting. B becomes the {{resulting trust}}ee of A's payment.|$|E
50|$|A trust can be {{intentionally}} {{created during}} the <b>settlor's</b> life (inter Vivos) by declaration or transfer. A deceased estate is a testamentary trust which automatically arises {{on the death of}} the testator. Courts may also create trusts, such as constructive trusts, as an equitable remedy.|$|R
50|$|Belize, offers {{immediate}} {{protection from}} court action initiated by creditors which challenges the <b>settlor’s</b> {{transfer of property}} into the trust. However, due to the paucity of credible offshore banks in Belize, many trusts established in Belize hold assets with a second trustee or third-party financial institution in another country.|$|R
2500|$|Resulting trusts {{work on a}} {{principle}} of [...] "common intention". This {{is the idea that}} a resulting trust is a mix of the <b>settlor's</b> intention, and the trustee's knowledge that he is not intended to be the beneficiary. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, Gibson J expressed the principle as: ...|$|R
25|$|An owner placing {{property}} into trust {{turns over}} {{part of his}} or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the <b>settlor</b> is absent, incapacitated, or deceased. Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{beneficiaries}} are beneficial (or equitable) {{owners of}} the trust property. Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property, or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary's interest depends on {{the wording of the}} trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twenty-five years. The <b>settlor</b> has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.|$|E
25|$|Express trusts {{are those}} {{expressly}} declared by the <b>settlor.</b> Typically, {{this will be}} intended to create a trust, but there can be situations in which the settlor's intended actions create a trust accidentally, as in Paul v Constance. The creation of express trusts must involve four elements for the trust to be valid. These are capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity refers to the donor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. These are that the trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the <b>settlor</b> to the trustees. For chattels, this can simply be handing the property to them, while transfers of land and shares must be done in writing following certain prescribed forms.|$|E
40|$|Trusts {{that can}} operate {{for as many}} as a {{thousand}} years or even forever, typically {{for the benefit of the}} <b>settlor’s</b> descendants living from time to time, now and in the future, are all the rage in banking and estate-planning circles. Before 1986, when Congress passed the federal generation-skipping transfer tax (GST tax), <b>settlors</b> had little incentive and probably little desire to establish perpetual trusts, even though they were permitted to do so under the law of Wisconsin, South Dakota, or Idaho. The GST tax created an artificial incentive for the wealthy to establish such trusts. The origin of the perpetual-trust movement is the GST exemption, which is part of the GST tax. When Congress granted the GST exemption, it did not impose a durational limit on trusts that qualify for the exemption, but instead relied on state perpetuity laws to supply that limit. The reliance on state perpetuity laws was badly misplaced. At the instigation of state banking groups and estate-planning attorneys, states began to pass legislation allowing trust <b>settlors</b> to create perpetual trusts—trusts that can last for several centuries or even forever. With state perpetuity laws out of the way, the wealthy began creating perpetual trusts in significant numbers. This essay questions whether the state legislators who vote to authorize perpetual trusts and the wealthy who create them are thinking through what they are allowing or putting in place. The essay shows the folly of such trusts, primarily by producing a table projecting how, with each step down the generational ladder, the number of beneficiaries will proliferate and the <b>settlor’s</b> genetic connection with the beneficiaries will decline. The essay then points out that the primary responsibility for the perpetual-trust movement rests not with the state legislators or the wealthy, but with Congress. The primary responsibility for curtailing it also rests with Congress, but so far Congress has been decidedly uninterested in curtailing the duration of GST-exempt trusts...|$|R
