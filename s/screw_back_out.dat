40|$|Proximal humerus {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most common fractures. Intramedullary nailing is a valuable treatment option for displaced fractures. The treatment aim is anatomic reduction and stable fixation allowing an early functional after treatment. In this study, we describe the technique of third-generation nailing, characterized by: straight nail, multiple angular stable proximal fixation options (aimed at the area of optimal bone quality), calcar screw, multiplanar (angular stable) distal fixation. Of the 35 fractures (7, two-fragment fractures; 16, three-fragment fractures; and 12, four-fragment fractures), we observed 2 losses of reduction, 3 screw penetrations, and 1 calcar <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> <b>out.</b> In 4 patients, this led to a second operation (1 reversed shoulder prosthesis, 3 removals of 1 screw). We conclude that third-generation is a valuable option in the treatment of 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -part fractures of the proximal humerus. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the one-third-tubular plate construct to stabilize lateral malleolar fractures include; difficulty achieving adequate cancellous screw thread purchase {{in the bone}} of the distal fragment, with subsequent risk of the <b>screws</b> <b>backing</b> <b>out.</b> This can cause irritation and pain, and may require further surgery to remove the screw. We describe {{a variation of the}} standard technique that eliminates the risk of the distal lateral malleolar <b>screws</b> <b>backing</b> <b>out</b> and provides a lower profile construct. This has the potential advantages of reduced wound related problems and less postoperative pain and irritation...|$|R
30|$|No {{intraoperative}} femoral {{shaft fracture}} was encountered in this study. There were three cases of lag screw cutout in the IM nail group (Table  3). The intramedullary nail {{was changed to}} a SHS in one case. For the other two cases, the proximal screw was removed under local anesthesia. Lag screw back-out occurred in three patients of this group. In one case, it was the superior, and in two cases, the inferior <b>screws</b> <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> 3 – 4  months postoperatively. However, fracture healing was not impaired and screws were removed 2  months later under local anesthesia without any further complications. There were no implant fractures in this study.|$|R
30|$|Two biomechanical {{studies that}} {{directly}} compared {{the stability of}} single and dual lag screw implants used for treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures have shown favorable results for implants with dual lag screws. Kubiak et al. [25] in the first {{study found that the}} two implants showed equivalent rigidity and stability and that the dual lag screw implant had a significantly stronger fixation than the single lag screw one when loaded to failure in an unstable intertrochanteric hip fracture model. In the second study, [26] the fixation strength of the Endovis dual lag screw construct was found to be significantly greater than the classic SHS when multidirectional dynamic forces were used for loading. Additionally, double-proximal-screw cephalomedullary nails demonstrated significantly less rotation compared to the SHS. These findings support Ingman`s assumption that the increased rotational stability of the femoral head fixation established by two proximal screws would decrease femoral head cutout [27]. However, in the clinical setting, these biomechanical advantages are not associated with a decrease in complication rates [28, 29]. Our results similarly show no significant difference in cutout between the two implants. There were 5 cases of proximal screw cutout for the SHS group and 3 cases for the cephalomedullary nails; these were all unstable fractures. Moreover, the presence of dual lag screws has introduced a new type of complication, the so-called “Z-effect” and reverse “Z-effect” phenomena [30, 31]. These are axial migrations of the lag screws forward or backward, one at a time or simultaneously and following the same or, more often, the opposite directions. Characteristic screw migration patterns have been described in the literature as the Z-effect involves the lateral migration of the inferior screw, varus collapse of the fracture, and perforation of the femoral head by the superior screw. The reverse Z-effect involves the lateral migration of the superior screw accompanied by the medial migration of the inferior screw. However, in practice, sometimes only one screw actually migrates during the postoperative weight-bearing period. On reviewing the 3 migrations in this series, it was noted these were not typical Z-effect phenomena. In one case, the superior <b>screw</b> <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> 3  weeks postoperatively, and in the other 2 cases, only the inferior <b>screw</b> <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> 3  months after operation. All these 3 patients had unstable trochanteric fractures with comminution of the medial cortex. The reasons for screw migration observed in some types of fractures are still pending and require further investigation [30]. To prevent the so-called Z or reversed Z effects, Lin [32] emphasized the importance of inserting the inferior lag screw as close as possible to, or even right on, the inferior cortex of the femoral neck in order to achieve better anchoring of the screws to a bony area of increased density, thus preventing screw cutout.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the variety}} of {{treatment}} options, {{the question of the}} best treatment for intracapsular hip fracture in the elderly remains open. It has often been claimed that hip function following uneventful healing of a displaced femoral neck fracture will always be better than that following hip arthroplasty [16]. Internal fixation retains the femoral head and the natural hip joint, provided that the fracture unites and the head does not undergo avascular necrosis. The major complications include nonunion and avascular necrosis, which would require a salvage procedure with either hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty. Following fracture union, second anesthesia may still be required to remove <b>screws</b> that <b>back</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
