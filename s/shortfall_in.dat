5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> the coming 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from}} the outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E
5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E
5|$|SR209 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns {{had to be}} taken into account, including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E

Later, Beshear amended {{the call to}} include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} the part of SR905 between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road in April 2008, and from Brittania Boulevard to I-805 in July 2009.

The part between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road opened in December 2010. The interchange with I-805 began to be upgraded in April 2011, and the construction, which used $20million in federal funding, finished in February 2012. The final freeway segment of SR905 between I-805 and Britannia Boulevard opened on July 30, 2012. The entire cost of the project connecting I-805 to the border crossing was $441million.|$|E
5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E
40|$|Summary Despite their {{apparent}} gender?neutrality, most {{discussions of}} poverty have been {{premised on the}} concept of a male actor and of male?centred notions of well?being and agency. The assumption underpinning income/consumption and well?being measures is that <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> income/consumption translate into <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> choice, and are manifested <b>in</b> <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> well?being. However, gender introduces disjunctures into this process, with the result that these measures inadequately capture women's experience of poverty. The basic conundrum that plagues attempts to conceptualize the gender dimensions of poverty stems from the operation of the forces that create scarcity, on the one hand, and discrimination, on the other. The form in which women's poverty manifests itself depends on the cultural context far more than it does for men, suggesting that it cannot be understood through the same conceptual lens...|$|R

5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds {{to complete the}} Green Line, forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply.

During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E

40|$|JEL No. J 2 The {{interest}} in examining job security and job stability {{has been driven}} {{in part by the}} phenomenon of downsizing. The distinctiveness of downsizing, as opposed to more traditional layoffs, is that the job cuts do not necessarily appear to be driven by <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> demand but instead appear to be driven by the search for operating efficiencies. Despite the {{interest in}} downsizing, there has been essentially no serious investigation into its causes. I distinguish downsizing from job cuts associated with <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> demand and find that employment and management practices over which employers have control, such as severance pay and profit sharing, are important predictors of subsequent downsizing and more general job losses. Surprisingly, excess operating capacity is not necessarily related to more general job losses at the establishment level. I also examine the relationship between both job losses associated with <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> demand and downsizing and subsequent financial performance. The results suggest, among other things, that downsizing reduces labor costs per employee but also sales per employee. Job cuts associated with excess capacit...|$|R

5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
