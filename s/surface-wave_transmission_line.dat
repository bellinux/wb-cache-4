40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation into}} the launching of dipolar surface waves on a dielectric tube is presented. The source under consideration is a transversely oriented point electric dipole situated on the axis of the tube. It is found to excite only the dominant HE 11 mode. Phase and group characteristics {{as well as some}} field distributions are given for the source -free case; however, these are independent of the choice of the source, and are dependent only on the particular mode being excited. Surface-wave as well as radiated powers are obtained in terms of the current in the source dipole, and the launching efficiency of the surface waves is determined {{as a function of the}} tube radius, wall-thickness and permittivity of the material. Finally, comparisons are made between the dielectric tube and the solid rod which was investigated previously [27] as possible <b>surface-wave</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines,</b> and also the launching efficiencies for these two cases...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates a novel {{optoelectronic}} platform {{based on}} the integration of superconductive structures, such as thin films and micro-constrictions, with optical waveguides for ultra-fast and ultra-sensitive devices with applications including high-speed optical communications, quantum optical information processing, and terahertz (THz) devices and systems. The kinetic-inductive photoresponse of superconducting thin films will be studied as the basic optoelectronic process underlying {{the operation of the}}se novel devices. Analytical formulation for the non-bolometric response is presented, and experimental photodetection in YBCO meander-line structures will be demonstrated. A set of superconducting coplanar waveguides (CPW) are designed and characterized, which support the operation of the devices at microwave frequencies. Microwave-photonic devices comprising a microwave <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> and a light-sensitive element, such as a meander-line structure, are designed and measured for implementation of optically tunable microwave components. In order to support low-loss and low-dispersion propagation of millimeter-wave and THz signals in ultra-fast and wideband kinetic-inductive devices, <b>surface-wave</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> are proposed, incorporating long-wavelength Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) modes in planar metal-dielectric waveguides. The theory of superconducting optical waveguides, including analytical formulation and numerical methods, is developed in detail. The implementation of superconducting optical waveguides is discussed thoroughly, employing conventional dielectric-waveguide techniques as well as optical SPP modes. Superconductive traveling-wave photodetectors (STWPDs) are introduced as a viable means for ultra-fast and ultra-sensitive photodetection and photomixing. A modified <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> formalism is developed to model STWPDs, where light is guided through an optical waveguide and photodetection is distributed along a <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> As an appendix, a systematic approach is developed for the analysis of carrier transport through superconducting heterostructures and micro-constrictions within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework. The method is applied to study the role of Andreev reflection and Josephson-like phenomena in the current-voltage characteristics of inhomogeneous superconducting structures. I-V characteristics are experimentally demonstrated in YBCO micro-constrictions with potential applications in millimeter-wave and THz devices...|$|R
40|$|In-air test {{fixtures}} for beamline elements typically utilize an X-Y positioning stage, and a {{wire antenna}} excited by an RF source. In most cases, the antenna contains a standing wave, and is useful only for coarse alignment measurements in CW mode. A <b>surface-wave</b> (SW) based <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> permits RF energy {{to be launched}} on the wire, travel through the beamline component, and then be absorbed in a load. Since SW <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> employ travelling waves, the RF energy {{can be made to}} resemble the electron beam, limited only by ohmic losses and dispersion. Although lossy coaxial systems are also a consideration, the diameter of the coax introduces large uncertainties in centroid location. A SW wire is easily constructed out of 200 micron magnet wire, which more accurately approximates the physical profile of the electron beam. Benefits of this test fixture include accurate field mapping, absolute calibration for given beam currents, Z-axis independence, and temporal response measurements of sub-nanosecond pulse structures.

40|$|Nowadays, blackouts or sags of a {{conductor}} are threatening {{the safety and}} stable run of the power <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> These phenomena happen due to the environmental conditions which change over the time, such as aging or temperature variations, precipitation and hotspots of power <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> {{as a result of}} extreme weather conditions.
