5000|$|In {{its final}} {{form in the}} 19th century, common law {{pleading}} was terribly complex and slow by modern standards. The parties would normally go through several rounds of pleadings before the parties were deemed to have clearly stated their controversy, so that the case was [...] "at issue" [...] and could proceed to trial. A case would begin with a complaint in which the plaintiff alleged the facts entitling him to relief, then the defendant would file any one {{of a variety of}} pleas as an answer, followed by a replication from the plaintiff, a rejoinder from the defendant, a <b>surrejoinder</b> from the plaintiff, a rebutter from the defendant, and a surrebutter from the plaintiff. At each stage, a party could file a demurrer to the other's pleading (essentially a request that the court immediately rule on whether the pleading was legally adequate before they had to file a pleading in response) or simply file another pleading in response.|$|E

Their new criticisms are also refuted in the present <b>Surrejoinder,</b> whenever relevant {{for the results of}} our Letter. It is our understanding that, in their Comment and Rejoinder, Levin and Pakter do not provide any relevant contributions to the problem addressed in our previous work. We therefore consider the present discussion as closed. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Curtailing the Pleadings. The common-law {{system of}} {{pleading}} contemplated successive pleadings in alternation by each party until an issue was reached upon which one party assumed the affirmative {{and the other}} party the negative. This process was to be followed no matter what time was thereby consumed. Under the code system of pleading, however, the purpose {{is not so much}} to obtain a narrow issue, as to have each party 2 ̆ 7 s view of the facts on record as concisely and as quickly as possible. This difference in purpose led to a striking difference in attitude towards the reply to the answer under the two systems. At common law the replication was a necessary part of the hierarchy of pleadings whenever the plea contained matter in confession and avoidance, i. e., new matter. It was, however, but {{one of a series of}} pleadings and might be followed in turn by the rejoinder, the <b>surrejoinder,</b> the rebutter, the surrebutter and further pleadings, if necessary. The plan of the code, on the other hand, was to cut off the 1 leadings quite sharply at the reply or before. Under the original code, the plaintiff might reply to new matter; but under many modern codes the reply either is not available or is available only in a limited class of cases. The result is that the issue is more quickly arrived at under the codes, but it is presumably a broader and more general one...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the insights {{provided by a}} number of authors (Bhatia 1993, 2002, 2004; Bhatia / Candlin / Engsberg / Trosborg 2003; Bhatia / Gotti 2006; Candlin / Bhatia / Jensen 2002; Drew / Heritage 1992; Garzone 2003; Goodrich 1988; Gotti 2003; Maley 1994; Swales 1990, 1996, 2004; Tessuto 2003) to examine discourse and professional practices in employment tribunals first in a national and then in an international context. With a view to investigating legal discourse in different legal systems, the chapter examines the institutional constraints on discourse processes in employment cases at Employment Tribunals in the UK, the European Union Civil Service Tribunal in Luxembourg, and the International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT) in Geneva. Although in all cases the pragmatic function is the presentation of complaints by employees against their employers for the purpose of obtaining compensation or reinstatement, the procedural rules shaping the discourse are strikingly different, with consequent variation in generic structure and lexical content. In examining the institutional procedures and case materials, it is argued that Employment Tribunals in the UK, standing firmly in the common law tradition, provide for courtroom hearings in which the parties present their evidence orally, following the classic sequence of examination-in-chief and cross-examination. On the other hand, at the European Union Civil Service Tribunal (where cases may be heard in any of the 23 official languages of the EU, depending on the language of the application) and at the ILOAT, the proceedings (in English or French) bear a stronger resemblance to the civil law tradition, with most or all of the discourse taking the form of written pleadings. The jurisdiction of the EU Civil Service Tribunal is supranational, and that of the ILOAT international, dealing with complaints lodged by staff members respectively of EU and UN organizations. In the case of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, written pleadings may be accompanied by hearings. However, {{in the case of the}} ILOAT, the holding of courtroom hearings would require the parties to travel from all over the world. Partly due to this constraint, the discourse is structured in an entirely different manner compared to the national tribunal, with claims presented and argumentation constructed almost exclusively on the basis of written documents, in a genre chain (Fairclough 2003 : 31) consisting of the complaint, the defendant’s reply, the complainant’s rejoinder, the defendant’s <b>surrejoinder,</b> and finally the judgment. This enables the ILOAT to deal with cases entirely on the basis of written pleadings, with applications for hearings seldom allowed. An examination of the terminology in English in the three Tribunals, one national, one supranational, and one international, reflects significant divergences in legal cultures, as the parties seek to construct and interpret meanings while complying with the institutional constraints prevailing in each of the systems...|$|E
