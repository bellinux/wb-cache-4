5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Serbia, he was engaged in the {{organization}} of the Serbian church, especially regarding the structure of bishoprics, those that were situated on locales at the sensitive border with the Roman Catholic West. At the assembly in Žiča in 1219, Sava [...] "chose, from his pupils, God-understanding and God-fearing and honorable men, who were able in managing by divine laws and by tradition of the Holy Apostles, and keep the apparitions of the holy God-bearing fathers. And he consecrated them and made them bishops" [...] (Domentijan). Sava gave the newly appointed bishops law books and sent them to bishoprics in all parts of Serbia. It is unclear how many bishoprics he founded. The following bishoprics were under his administration: Zeta (Zetska), <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of Holy Archangel Michael in Prevlaka near Kotor; Hum (Humska), <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in Ston; Dabar-Bosna, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of St. Nicholas on the Lim; Moravica, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of St. Achillius in the Moravica region; Budimlja, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of St. George; Toplica, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of St. Nicholas in the Toplica region; Hvosno, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of the Holy Mother of God in the Hvosno region; Žiča, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Žiča, the <b>seat</b> of the Church; Raška, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Monastery of Holy Apostles Peter and Paul in Peć; Lipljan, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Lipljan; Prizren, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> Prizren. Among his bishops were Ilarion and Metodije. In the same year Sava published Zakonopravilo (or [...] "St. Sava's Nomocanon"), the first constitution of Serbia; thus the Serbs acquired both forms of independence: political and religious.|$|R

His father, Sir Leonard, had maintained the family <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> nearby Kirby Muxloe, but after 1471 William began to use Ashby de la Zouch as his primary residence.|$|E

5|$|Clifford's {{career was}} {{transformed}} when, on 22 May 1455, {{his father was}} killed fighting Richard, Duke of York and York's Neville allies, the earls of Salisbury and Warwick at the first Battle of St Albans. John Clifford was still under age at the time, and {{was not able to}} prove his age in order to obtain livery of his lands until 16 June 1456. He entered into his inheritance less than a month later, and was appointed a Justice of the peace in Westmorland. Clifford inherited the barony of Clifford, the family <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> Skipton Castle and the hereditary office of High Sheriff of Westmorland. He was summoned to Parliament on 30 July 1460.|$|E
5|$|Crawley Borough is coterminous {{with the}} {{parliamentary}} constituency of Crawley.

Laura Moffatt, {{a member of}} the Labour Party, was the MP for Crawley from 1997 to 2010; she was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson. In the 2005 general election, the winning margin was the slimmest of any UK constituency: Moffatt won by just 37 votes.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years later}} public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life. Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.|$|E

5|$|In the fallout, Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo.

5|$|Many {{men in the}} SWPA {{believed}} that the demobilisation process was too slow. On 10December 1945 4,500 men at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies staged a protest march demanding that shipping {{be made available to}} return them to Australia. Soldiers at Bougainville also complained about having to remain on the island after the war had ended, and Prime Minister Ben Chifley's plane was sabotaged in an apparent protest during his visit on 27December 1945. Minister for Defence Frank Forde was largely blamed for the slowness with which military personnel were being demobilised. As a result, he lost his <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> the 1946 election, though the Labor Party itself comfortably retained office.|$|E

50|$|Customers may {{instead be}} <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> the bar, and indeed if no {{customers}} can be <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> a table, then one customer must be <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> the bar that turn.

If you <b>seat</b> a customer <b>at</b> the bar then you will lose or gain points - the amount indicated on the bar stool. This is cleverly done, as the first five seats gain you points, so there's no harm in sitting there. However, the next fifteen seats have negative values, that increases across each row of seats, but then falls back at the start of the next row.
