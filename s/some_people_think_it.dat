6000|$|When, however, {{we turn to}} [...] "zeal" [...] or [...] "energy" [...] or [...] "go," [...] we do seem to {{be dealing}} with a simpler and more {{transmissible}} thing. Let us assume that in this matter there is a wide range of difference that may be arranged in a direct and simple scale in quantitative relation to the gross output of action of different human beings. One passes from the incessant employment of such a being as Gladstone at the one extreme, a loquacious torrent of interests and achievements, to the extreme of phlegmatic lethargy on the other. Call the former a high energetic and the latter low. Quite possibly it might be found that we could breed [...] "high energetics." [...] But before we did so we should have to consider very gravely that the [...] "go" [...] and [...] "energy" [...] of a man have no ascertainable relation to many other extremely important considerations. Your energetic person may be moral or immoral, an unqualified egotist or as public spirited as an ant, sane, or a raving lunatic. Your phlegmatic person may ripen resolves and bring out truths, with the incomparable clearness of a long-exposed, slowly developed, slowly printed photograph. A man who would exchange the slow gigantic toil of that sluggish and deliberate person, Charles Darwin, for the tumultuous inconsequence and (as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>it)</b> the net mischief of a Gladstone, would no doubt be prepared to substitute a Catherine-wheel in active eruption for the watch of less adventurous men.

The e-mails also describe or mention interactions with other characters from the novel, including Timothy Price (Bryce in the film version), Evelyn, Luis, Courtney, David, Detective Kimball, and Marcus.

50|$|When Abish {{sees that}} {{everyone}} has fainted she knows it {{is the result of}} the power of the Lord.

One of the people even attempts to kill Ammon while he lies in a faint, yet falls down dead when he lifts his sword. The people continue arguing and Abish is “exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.” She goes to the queen and tries to raise her and the queen wakes up and joyfully proclaims her conversion. The queen then wakes the king who also tells of his conversion and begins to teach his people about God. As a result, many more people are converted. Thus Abish eventually gets her wish that the people be converted by coming to see the miracle that had occurred. This event begins a chain of great conversion among the people of the Lamanites.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the townships, such as Alexandra and Diepsloot, {{are built}} along or by a {{tributary}} or river bank. This causes {{problems with the}} high density of people, poor access, and services. These areas are extremely dense with only tortuous, narrow access, few communal water points and banks of chemical toilets on the peripheries of the settlements. The settlements are beginning {{to be built in}} the old tributaries due to the continuing growth of the townships. With the houses in the dried up tributaries is a potential problem when a large storm comes and the tributary starts to fill up with water again or if there is a backup of sewerage coming into the tributary. The houses built in that area are all in danger of being destroyed by natural occurrences. As the area grew the tributaries were piped and a number of concrete aprons and gullies were constructed over the tributary to which the communal water points drain. The gullies were then choked with garbage and the tributaries appear to be substantially blocked but this will not hold off the water for very long if a flood came through. [...] Flooding is also an issue in the river bank areas where houses were built. These houses should be relocated but most places are running out of space to expand which is how those houses ended up in the area below the flood lines. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> could be a good thing to live next to s river {{in order to be able}} to use the water to do laundry and clean but most of the time the water in that area is so polluted and trashed that it is unsanitary for them to use due to all the local pollutant of nearby factories or plants.|$|E
