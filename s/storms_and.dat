5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. Neither CSU or WRC issued a forecast on the number of major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. In early 1985, WRC predicted 8named <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> 5hurricanes. The CSU forecast for April 1985 was 11named <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> 8hurricanes. This forecast was not revised in June. In their August outlook, CSU predicted 10named <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> 7hurricanes.|$|E

50|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event from the Raw brand was between Lance <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> William Regal and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) over the World Tag Team Championship. On the December 23 episode of Raw, the Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff forced Raw commentators Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler to wrestle in a tag team match against <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> Regal for making bad comments against Bischoff. Ross <b>and</b> Lawler defeated <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> Regal after interference by Dudley Boyz. As a result, on the January 6 episode of Raw, Bischoff forced Dudley Boyz to wrestle 3-Minute Warning (Rosey and Jamal), Rico and Batista in a Handicap match. <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> Regal avenged their loss by costing Dudley Boyz, the match. Later that night, <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> Regal defeated Booker T and Goldust for the World Tag Team Championship. This led to a title match between <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> Regal and Dudley Boyz at Royal Rumble.|$|R

5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the <b>storms,</b> <b>and</b> database quality issues.
