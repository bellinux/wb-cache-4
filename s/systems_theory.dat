5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems. In <b>systems</b> <b>theory</b> and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus {{may be related to the}} phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E

The first part of the chapter covers about General <b>System</b> <b>Theory</b> from Bertalanffy’s book “General <b>System</b> <b>Theory</b> ” [1]. In this book he shows that reductionism is completely wrong and modelling the system from the holistic viewpoint is the correct approach. One approach to looking at complex systems in a systemic perspective and a way to control the emerging patterns as well is demonstrated. 14. 1 General <b>System</b> <b>Theory</b> “System Theory ” represents a novel paradigm in scientific thinking [1].
