25|$|Tolerance varies for daily, regular {{caffeine}} {{users and}} high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200mg/day {{spread throughout the}} day) {{have been shown to}} produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. <b>Some</b> <b>coffee</b> drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>coffee</b> states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, {{passed laws}} like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, {{maintained}} small militaries, and fought fewer wars. Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism—namely, legal statues determining access to land, {{the background of}} the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.|$|E

According to tradition, she arrives {{in the company of a}} donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave <b>some</b> <b>coffee</b> for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo. They must not watch Santa Lucia delivering these gifts, or she will throw ashes in their eyes, temporarily blinding them.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some criticisms of fair trade {{specific}} to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of ethical consumerism. Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through {{the rise of the}} third wave coffee movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what <b>some</b> <b>coffee</b> roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end up selling to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can. Some scholars are concerned of the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.|$|E
500|$|George {{is excited}} {{when he finds}} that he and Jerry are having dates on the same night. Both of their dates go well {{up to the point}} that they have to say goodnight. George's date Carol (Tory Polone) asks George to come up to her place for <b>some</b> <b>coffee,</b> but George tells her that he can't drink coffee at night because it [...] "keeps [...] up". Once she leaves his car he realizes he made a mistake, as [...] "coffee" [...] is a {{euphemism}} for sex. Jerry's date Donna (Gretchen German) remarks that she likes a cotton Dockers commercial that Jerry absolutely hates, and with that ends his interest in her.|$|E
50|$|Fruity/Citrussy - This aroma is {{reminiscent}} of the odour and taste of fruit. The natural aroma of berries is highly associated with this attribute.

500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get <b>some</b> <b>coffee</b> and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E

2500|$|It {{seems that}} the Jesuits {{were the first to}} {{introduce}} seeds of coffee in the [...] "Nueva Granada" [...] (today Colombia) by the year 1723. The first experiments in growing coffee in Colombia are recorded in the 18th century.

2500|$|A nearby inn called Hacienda Gripiñas, has a {{trail that}} leads {{to the top of the}} mountain. Hacienda Gripiñas was a coffee plantation, but has been turned into a country inn. It {{actually}} still grows <b>some</b> <b>coffee.</b> The inn operates under a contract with the Government of Puerto Rico. The trails, however, are not well marked and often suffer damage from storms. While people can hike their way to the top of the mountain, there is a paved road {{that leads to}} the very summit.

[...] As the siblings headed back to their platforms, a crane winch malfunctioned, preventing Lijana from exiting the wire.

2500|$|Woodhouse Israel Cocoa Ltd v Nigerian Produce Marketing Board [...] AC 741 {{held that}} a {{contract}} {{for the sale of}} <b>some</b> <b>coffee</b> beans was agreed to be payable in pound sterling. The sellers mistakenly sent an invoice stating price was payable in Nigerian pounds. At the time the value of sterling and Nigerian pounds was equal. The buyers accepted the delivery and invoice without objection. Subsequently the value of the pound fell quite dramatically in relation to Nigerian pounds. The buyers then sought to revert to pound sterling as stated in the contract. The buyers conduct in accepting the invoice unquestionably amounted to an implied clear and unambiguous promise to accept on those terms.|$|E
2500|$|Scene 1 {{begins with}} Ally giving a short summary {{of what will}} happen in the scene. She then asks Dave to send a crew member to reset a rally car. At this moment Marty reverses the car into the set and parks {{it in front of the}} {{jewellery}} store. Before Marty has a chance to get out of the car, Morgan says action, and two criminals come onto the screen on a motorbike. Trevor jumps off and breaks into the jewellery store. The other remains outside until a police car comes drifting from the right hand side of the arena. When the other thief comes out to find the motorbike gone, he runs over to the rally car and opens the door to find Marty sitting inside. The thief then proceeds to throw Marty out of the car before jumping in himself and driving the car in donuts around Marty. Annoyed, Morgan cuts the scene and sends Marty to catering to get <b>some</b> <b>coffee</b> and donuts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first step}} in Europeans' wresting the means of {{production}} was effected by Nicolaes Witsen, the enterprising burgomaster of Amsterdam and member of the governing board of the Dutch East India Company who urged Joan van Hoorn, the Dutch governor at Batavia that <b>some</b> <b>coffee</b> plants be obtained at the export port of Mocha in Yemen, the source of Europe's supply, and established in the Dutch East Indies; the project of raising many plants from the seeds of the first shipment met with such success that the Dutch East India Company was able to supply Europe's demand with [...] "Java coffee" [...] by 1719. Encouraged by their success, they soon had coffee plantations in Ceylon, Sumatra and other Sunda islands. Coffee trees were soon grown under glass at the Hortus Botanicus of Leiden, whence slips were generously extended to other botanical gardens. Dutch representatives at the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Utrecht presented their French counterparts with a coffee plant, which was grown on at the Jardin du Roi, predecessor of the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris.|$|E
