5|$|In May 2016, the RAIB {{published}} {{a report on}} the incident, which largely blamed the incident on the train crew tampering with a safety <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise have safely brought the train to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Zeus had {{initially}} been proposed {{in an era}} when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the Soviet fleet was thought to contain a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number of missiles aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> use only 1200 missiles.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Allingham {{was in a}} {{reserved}} {{occupation and}} worked {{on a number of}} projects. Perhaps his most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> neutralise the mines and open the port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, however, {{following}} the discoveries by James Clerk Maxwell {{to the effect}} that electric measurements could not be explained in terms of the three fundamental units of length, mass and time, Giovanni Giorgi proposed a new standard <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> include a fourth fundamental unit to measure quantities in electromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|Route 17 {{has been}} the object of several studies {{exploring}} a Bergen BRT, a bus rapid transit <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> potentially alleviate some traffic congestion and decrease automobile dependency. While funding has not been identified, the potential routes of the system have centered around the vicinity radiating from the malls of Paramus.|$|E
5|$|Toyota Motor Company {{teamed up}} with Fujitsu Ten to develop an {{automatic}} warning system for hybrids and electric vehicles to alert pedestrians when the car is propelled by its electric motor. The companies also studied {{the development of a}} <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> change the alarm's tune and volume with the assistance of an obstacle-detection radar.|$|E

50|$|Its {{place in}} history is unusual, because while in {{intention}} it {{is analogous to the}} digital algorithmic composition <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> follow it, it was implemented entirely as an analog electronic machine.|$|R
5|$|Armada of the Damned was {{conceived}} as an action-adventure role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective {{and set in}} an open world environment based on the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. The player {{was to take the}} role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the Caribbean Sea and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada of the Damned was centered on a choice <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|When {{this report}} was received, McElroy then charged ARPA to begin {{studying}} long-term {{solutions to the}} ICBM defense, looking for <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> avoid the apparently insurmountable problem presented by the exchange ratio.|$|R
50|$|Tall wall trees, {{especially}} banyans, {{also improve}} air quality by filtering particulates and blocking heat emitted from automobiles and building-wide air conditioning <b>systems,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise be trapped between skyscrapers, generating air pollution.|$|R

5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summers}} of 1843 and 1844 Słowacki {{traveled}} to Pornic, a resort on the Atlantic coast in Brittany. It was there, in 1844, {{that he wrote}} Genezis z Ducha (Genesis from the Spirit). This work introduced his own philosophical <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have a visible influence on his works in his last decade. Around 1839 Słowacki put his capital into the Parisian stock market. He was a shrewd investor who earned enough from the investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.|$|E
5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{later become}} the {{classical}} standard for Mesopotamia {{were developed in}} parallel with writing during Uruk Period Sumer (c 4000 BCE). Studies of protocuneiform indicate twelve separate counting systems used in Uruk.|$|R
50|$|The Tiger was radically different. All {{previous}} CADO computers {{had been}} single-board <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> probably {{be familiar to}} anybody who has ever seen a modern motherboard; the parts were just bigger, and there were fewer of them.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} to eliminate perchlorate contamination. Current remediation technologies for perchlorate have negative downsides of high costs and difficulty in operation. Thus, there have been interests in developing <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> offer economic and green alternatives.|$|R
5|$|Saville succeeded Claire L. Chennault as America's leading fighter {{aircraft}} tactician. With Benjamin S. Kelsey, Saville co-wrote {{the technical}} specifications {{which led to}} the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. In 1949 he selected the North American F-86 Sabre as America's main defense fighter, and in 1950 he approved a guided air-to-air missile <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be carried aboard the proposed supersonic 1954 interceptor; the missile produced was the AIM-4 Falcon.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow the entry of new players.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} hired external help {{to address}} {{two of their}} initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former colleague at Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and {{also contributed to the}} game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural audio <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> generate sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on {{the size and shape of}} the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich.|$|E
5000|$|Trans-Global Highway, highway <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> link {{all six of}} the {{inhabited}} continents on Earth. The highway would network new {{and existing}} bridges and tunnels, improving not only ground transportation but also potentially offering a conduit for utility pipelines.|$|R
5000|$|Within a large {{movement}} like Nazism, [...] "it may not {{be especially}} shocking to discover" [...] that individuals could embrace different ideological <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> seem to be polar opposites. The religious beliefs of even the leading Nazis diverged strongly.|$|R
50|$|As city administrator, {{he helped}} oversee the {{management}} of a city grappling with budget shortfalls and the increasing demands of a fast-growing city. Atty. Ochoa headed the Finance Committee, among others, and implemented <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> drastically cut down unnecessary spending by the city government.|$|R
5|$|The {{precursor}} <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> form Dean was {{a stationary}} front {{situated in the}} northeastern Gulf of Mexico {{in the last week}} of July. On July 27, it developed a weak upper-level circulation indicated by reports from buoys in the Gulf, its structure was disorganized but {{was in the process of}} organizing. The system continued to organize early on July 28, and that afternoon it developed a surface circulation. The tropical depression that spawned Dean was thought to have formed at around 1800 UTC, July 28. It was later declared Tropical Depression Four that same day with the center located about 345miles (555km) southeast of New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|The <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} {{from the western}} end of a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high environmental pressures around it, Alicia remained a small system.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak said {{he plans}} to install a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> provide regular updates to {{families}} on the academic performance of their children and push them toward tangible improvement goals. In response to recent student violence problems at the William Allen High School, Zahorchak identified one of his priorities as strengthening the district's code of conduct and citizenship programs. He also announced he would seek to replace retiring teachers with highly skilled minority candidates, and would create incentive programs to lure top students into teaching positions if they agreed to spend at least five years teaching in Allentown schools.|$|E
50|$|Intergraph {{was founded}} in 1969 as M&S Computing, Inc., by former IBM {{engineers}} {{who had been working}} with NASA and the U.S. Army in developing <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> apply digital computing to real-time missile guidance. The company was later renamed to Intergraph Corporation in 1980.|$|R
50|$|The company {{originally}} {{grew out}} of the Westland Aircraft Company who in 1933 enabled the Houston Everest expedition to make the first ever flight over Mount Everest, using oxygen and heating systems - precursors of the <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> eventually be produced by Normalair.|$|R
5000|$|In the USSR, latinisation (латиниза́ция [...] ) was {{the name}} of the {{campaign}} during the 1920s-1930s which aimed to replace traditional writing systems for numerous languages with <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> use the Latin script or to create Latin-script based <b>systems</b> for languages <b>that</b> did not have a writing system.|$|R
