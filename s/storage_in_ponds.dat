30|$|Water {{management}} for paddy irrigation usually involves utilization of water available from different sources including river flow at different locations and water <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>ponds</b> and reservoirs. Within an irrigation district, available irrigation water of different tributaries {{can also be}} mutually conveyed to cope with severe droughts. Channels, ponds, reservoirs, and other flow intake and diversion structures together form a complex irrigation network. Success of irrigation management during droughts requires characterizing the spatiotemporal variation of streamflows at different stations and tools {{which can be used}} for assessing the effects of mitigation measures. Thus, the objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to develop a stochastic model which is capable of characterizing the spatiotemporal variability of multi-site streamflows within an irrigation district and (2) to demonstrate that a probabilistic risk assessment of potential mitigation practices can be conducted using the spatiotemporal streamflow simulation model.|$|E
40|$|The article {{demonstrates}} {{methods for}} identification {{and assessment of}} risks for efficient utilization and storage of floodwater, which can be utilized in middle and lower reaches of rivers. Firstly, the methods of analytic hierarchy process and principal component analysis were proposed, which can identify the main risk factors and associated losses during the storage of floodwater in ponds. The major factors of risk include uncertainty of benefit losses, uncertainty of calculation methods and parameters, long-term rainfall-runoff forecasting errors, scheduling decision, and implementation. Next, a two-dimensional estimation model used to get the risk rate of flood <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>ponds</b> during different stages of flood including scenarios with and without control measures is developed. The identified risk factors were applied on an event of rainfall (200 [*]mm) to evaluate the risk of flood storage in Cile pond. To conclude, the laws of risk in terms {{of space and time}} are demonstrated as follows: (1) in spatial dimension, the risk involved will be higher if flood storage capacity is great, and, (2) in temporal dimension, the risk involved will be higher if storage occurred earlier than anticipated. This article further concludes that if flood storage is greater, the risk loss associated with control measures will obviously be smaller than that without control measures...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the integration of}} cultural, economic and environmental requirements for fish production in Borno State, Nigeria. A reconnaissance survey was conducted transferring some selected Local Government Areas. 60 questionnaires were administered in the six Local Governments representing Southern Borno State with Biu and Shani, central Borno with Konduga & Jere and Northern Borno with Gubia and Kukawa respectively. There is no cultural constraint to fish production but about 63 % prefers to invest in other farming activities than in fish farming. 33 % are not aware that fish can be cultured apart from getting it from the wild. 35 % have the impression that fish farming ventures can be handled by government only. The economic earnings for fish production are high especially {{in some parts of}} Northern Borno, but the Local market potentials throughout the state are great. Nigeria has suitable soil for ponds apart from few locations at the central and Northern Borno that are made by sandy soil. Numerous perennial and seasonal rivers, streams, lakes, pools and flood plains adequate for fish culture especially in Southern Borno exist. The mean annual rainfall can result in some water <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>ponds.</b> In areas where the annual precipitation is less than 550 mm, exist few flow boreholes with potentials for fish production. The temperature regime may support growth and survival of fish even during the hottest months of the year (March, April and May).

40|$|Beaver ponds are surface-water {{features}} that are transient through space and time. Such qualities complicate the inclusion of beaver <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> local and regional water balances, and in hydrological models, as reliable estimates of surface-water storage are difficult to acquire without time- and labour-intensive topographic surveys. A simpler approach to overcome this challenge is needed, given the abundance of the beaver <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> North America, Eurasia, and southern South America. We investigated whether simple morphometric characteristics derived from readily available aerial imagery or quickly measured field attributes of beaver ponds {{can be used to}} approximate surface-water storage among the range of environmental settings <b>in</b> which beaver <b>ponds</b> are found. Studied were a total of 40  beaver ponds from four different sites in North and South America.

40|$|The Emilia-Romagna Adriatic coast {{represents}} a strategic economic asset for Italy {{because of its}} important environmental, historical and tourist value. An efficient environment protection and water resource management in this coastal zone is difficult because of the many events that during the last century caused the ingression of large volumes of brackish and saline water in the coastal aquifer. River mouth enlargement to accommodate for tourist marinas has caused extensive landward saltwater encroachment along rivers and canals. Tourist establishments along the coastline have destroyed the original sand dunes continuity and their natural barrier effect to beach erosion and saltwater intrusion. Strong natural and artificial subsidence, induced by gas winning and deep groundwater exploitation, caused most of this territory to drop below mean sea level and have modified the river regime and the normal groundwater flow. In this situation, a drainage system is necessary {{to lower the water}} table level and keep the land dry, so that trees roots stay above the saturated zone of the aquifer. The drainage system management, however, has not accounted for the proximity to the sea. The result is an unstable phreatic aquifer that is not able to contrast saltwater intrusion and is not beneficial to maintaining a healthy pine forests and avoiding soil salinization. Water table and surface isosalinity maps have been created by monthly monitoring data. These data show watertables below sea level and groundwater salinization; well testing and geo-electric surveys provided a detailed lithological characterization and the depth of the brackish-freshwater interface. Analytical and numerical modeling (WATBAL, SUTRA, MOCDENS 3 D, and SEAWAT) were used to calculate the water budget and study how past and present human activities have affected the saltwater intrusion process and how the predicted future sea level rise will further degrade the aquifer. The feasibility and effects of some alternative actions such as controlled drainage, freshwater <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>ponds</b> along the coast, artificial recharge, river bottom sills, optimization of the hydraulic infrastructure and coastal dune restoration have been examined. In addition, the interactions between surface and ground waters as a connected resource need to be further explored in order to find innovative strategies for coastal aquifer management. Finally, we stress how an integrated approach is necessary; history has shown that a disaggregated water management, the present fragmentation of water authorities and the lack of communications among different institutions and the stakeholders are the major threats to the coastal environment and its water resources...|$|E
40|$|In the Mekong delta, the Vietnamese {{government}} promoted integrated agriculture-aquaculture (IAA) farming {{systems as}} an example of sustainable agriculture. An important advantage of IAA-farming is the nutrient linkage between the pond and terrestrial components within a farm, which allows to improve resource use efficiency and income while reducing environmental impacts. This study monitored and analyzed water use in and nutrient flows through ponds that are part of an IAA-farming system. The goal was to improve the nutrient management of ponds which in turn lead to improved water and nutrient use efficiency of the whole IAA-farm. The study included three main parts: (1) understanding the context and characteristics of IAA-systems (chapters 2 and 3), (2) analyzing the performance of IAA-systems, suggesting and testing improvements (chapters 4 and 5), and (3) recommending procedures for the continuous upgrading of existing IAA-farming systems (chapter 6). The research was done on-farm in freshwater areas of the Mekong delta and followed a Participatory Learning in Action approach. Different multivariate statistical methods were applied for data analysis.   At community and household level, results showed that the type of IAA-farming systems applied was determined by a mixture of bio-physical, technological and socio-economic factors (chapter 2). Three major IAA-systems were identified: (1) low-input fish farming in fruit-dominated area (system 1), (2) medium-input fish farming (system 2), and (3) high-input fish farming (system 3) in rice-dominated areas. System 1 was commonly practiced in a rural and intensive fruit production area with fertile soils, while systems 2 and 3 were more frequent in peri-urban and in rice production areas with less fertile soils. In the study areas, poor farmers usually did not adopt IAA-farming. With good market accessibility, richer farmers tended to intensify fish farming. The principal factors why farmers did not start aquaculture were the inappropriateness of the technology available, lack of capital, insufficient land holding, poor access to extension services, limited farm management, and a fear of conflicts associated with pesticide use on crops. The main motivations to practice IAA-farming were increased farm resource uses, which resulted in improved income, a better supply of foods for home consumption and a reduction of the environmental impacts from the farming.   In low- and medium-input ponds, nutrient inputs, the accumulation of nitrogen (N), organic carbon (OC) and phosphorus (P) and environmental impacts were closely linked (chapter 3). Parameters related to nutrients input levels and water exchange rates in ponds explained most of the variability between farms. Parameters linked to agro-ecological sites, pond physical properties and livestock or human excreta inputs explained most of the remaining variability. A combination of these variables allowed to characterize three indicative integrated systems: (1) the low water-exchange-rate ponds in the fruit-dominated area, (2) the low water-exchange-rate ponds in the rice-dominated area receiving home-made feed, and (3) the high water-exchange-rate ponds in the rice-dominated areas receiving excreta. These systems concurred to a large extend with the systems identified on the basic of the community and household survey. In the rice-dominated area with deep ponds, more livestock or human wastes were supplied, and high water exchange rates were practiced. In these ponds, large excreta-OC loads reduced dissolved oxygen and increased total phosphorus concentrations in the water column and nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus accumulation in the sediments. In the rice-dominated area with wide ponds, more home-made feed was applied and low water-exchange rates were practiced, which resulted in a high phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity. On the contrary, in the fruit-dominated area fish were grown in shallow and narrow ditches with a low phytoplankton biomass and {{only a small fraction of}} the nutrient input accumulated in the sediments.   The water and nutrient budgets of a selected number of ponds, representing either low or high water-exchange systems were determined (chapter 4). The sluice-gate water inflow and outflow largely dominated the total pond water budgets, accounting for 72 - 97 % of the total water budget. On-farm livestock manures were the most important nutrient source for ponds. High water-exchange rate ponds received larger quantities of livestock and/or human excreta and had significantly higher volumes of water passing through ponds than low water-exchange rate ones. Only 5 - 6 % of the total N, OC and P inputs were retained in the harvested fish, but 18 - 91 % accumulated in the pond sediments, the rest was lost through pond water discharges. Fish yields and the quantity of nutrients accumulating in the sediments increased with increasing on-farm nutrient input levels at the cost of higher nutrient discharges. Its was concluded that farmers need to manage water and nutrient flows between the pond and the other IAA-farm components with the goals to maximize productivity and profitability while minimizing nutrient discharges of the farm as a whole.   Excreta were the principle type of nutrient input applied to ponds in the study areas. Therefore, the economic and nutrient discharge tradeoffs stemming from the use of livestock and human excreta were analyzed (chapter 5). Data collected during three consecutive production years were combined in the analysis. Results showed that increased excreta input levels resulted in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, higher water exchange rates practiced, and increased discharge of chemical oxygen demand (COD), N, P and total suspended solids (TSS). Fish yields and the accumulation of N, OC and P in pond sediments, however, increased with increasing excreta input levels. Through regression analysis, it was predicted that with an input of 5 kg N ha - 1 day - 1, a fish yield of 8379 kg and an economic return of 52 million VND ha - 1 yr - 1 will be obtained while about 2057 kg COD, 645 kg N, 213 kg P and 39203 kg TSS ha - 1 yr - 1 will be discharged from the farm. At this input level, about 9 % of input-N will be retained in harvested fish, 52 % will accumulate in the sediments and 39 % will be discharged. Further development of IAA-farming practices should focus on reducing nutrient discharges while maintaining favorable economic returns.      In brief, this study demonstrated that the adoption of one type of IAA-system by farmers is determined by a mixture of factors at different scales ranging from the individual pond to community or village level. Within each IAA-system, the pond fulfils multiple roles, in part influenced by the existing resource base, agricultural development pathways and the household's goals and aspirations. An important function of ponds is the trapping and storage of nutrients for subsequent reuse within IAA-systems, which otherwise would be lost. Optimizing nutrient <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>ponds</b> also concurs with best management practices from an environmental and economic point of view. The key challenge to the further development and optimization if IAA-farming is to balance economic, environmental and social interests within a highly dynamic setting of the Mekong delta today...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cranberry bogs make up an {{important}} part of the landscape, economics, and cultural heritage of SE Massachusetts. Because cranberry bogs use ponds and rivers as water sources and as discharge points, the control of runoff of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to surface waters from cranberry farming is a concern for the health and management of fresh and estuarine waters in watersheds where cranberry bogs occur. We quantified the movement of N and P into and out of three cranberry bogs in the Weweantic and Wareham River Watersheds during one water year and annual cropping cycle. We combined measurements of water flow with measurements of dissolved and particulate N and P concentrations in different components of the annual farming cycle to estimate N and P input-output balances. Water budgets varied widely among bogs. Two bogs showed net movement of groundwater into the bog, one of which had very high inflow, and the third bog had net water flow into groundwater. Two bogs exhibited small net N imports (0. 1 and 2. 0 kg N ha- 1) in fluvial exchanges and one bog exhibited substantial N export (12. 6 kg N ha- 1). Between 73 and 77 % of all fluvial N exports exited in surface water during non-flood baseflows. Bogs exported between 2. 1 and 4. 5 kg P ha- 1 in fluvial exchanges and 55 and 81 % of all P export occurred during non-flood baseflows. High variability of net N exchange likely arose from the hydro-geographical setting in which the bogs occurred. The variation in the magnitude and direction of P exchanges was much less and depended less on bog setting. Given the finding of that most annual export of N and P occurred in surface water flows during times that water was not actively pumped onto or released from bogs, water management specifically aimed at N and P removal from the small but steady outflow of surface water during non-flood periods could be beneficial. Management might include additional <b>storage</b> time <b>in</b> <b>ponds</b> or increased naturalization of stream channels...|$|R

This system is traditionally used as the final disposal of this waste or constitutes a previous stage before being processed by cogeneration or anaerobic digestion processes. A laboratory-scale pond with a total volume of 520 l was used. The experiment was carried out between December 2002 and August 2003 covering a total period of 269 days. During the experiment, the variations of temperature (outside and inside the pond), the effective volume of the OMSW <b>in</b> the <b>pond,</b> moisture content, total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), the total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), total volatile acids (TVA), pH and cumulative methane production {{as a function of}} the operation time were evaluated. The experimental results obtained showed that the characteristics of the two-phase OMSW <b>in</b> the <b>pond</b> were dependent on the time of operation and temperature. During the experiment, three periods were clearly observed and differentiated: (a) An initial period with a rapid reduction of moisture content and effective volume, with an increase of TS, VS and TCOD removals, a decrease of pH and an increase of TVA and methane production until day 21. (b) A second period of slow decrease of moisture content and effective volume, due to the decrease of the ambient temperature. This period took place between day 21 and days 120 – 150 of assay, and it was characterised by a slight change in the OMSW properties.

The proposed model, based on the use of polynomial equations, took into account the influence of the temperature and fit adequately into the experimental results obtained.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to verify}} the productive efficiency of thermally and mechanically modified wheat {{in comparison to the}} non-modified wheat <b>in</b> experimental fish <b>ponds.</b> The experiment was conducted <b>in</b> <b>storage</b> <b>ponds</b> of Třeboň Fisheries Ltd. and took place along 120 days <b>in</b> 8 rectangular <b>ponds.</b> Four treatments were used: thermally wheat, thermally and pressed wheat, non-modified wheat, and control without feeding. Each treatment was run in duplicate. Fish were fed three times a week {{early in the morning and}} in the same part of the storage pond. Every month, fish were harvested and some parametres were recorded (weight, length and fat content). Then, fish were restocked. The results of the productive indicators at the end of the experiment have proved a positive influence of thermal and mechanical modifications on the productive efficiency. The highest productive efficiency was achieved by the carps which have been fed by thermally and pressed wheat: Food convertion ration (FCR) was 2. 17 - 0. 17; Food Convertion efficiency (FCE) was 0. 47 - 0. 04; and Specific Growth Rate (SGR) was 0. 63 - 0. 06 %. d- 1. Fish fed with thermally treated wheat reached values for FCR of 2. 32 - 0. 16; FCE of 0. 44 - 0. 04; and SGR of 0. 60 - 0. 06 %. d- 1. Finally, the lowest productive efficiency was found at the wheat without any modifications (FCR: 2. 38 - 0. 10; FCE: 0. 43 - 0. 02; SGR: 0. 58 - 0. 07 %. d- 1). Therefore, thermal and mechanical modifications of wheat are positive modifications to improve production efficiency in market carp farming...|$|R

40|$|Challenging {{impact of}} climate change to both human {{well-being}} and ecosystems was reported in numerous studies. In addition, protected areas of wetlands, which are maintained in agricultural purposes, often are exposed to climate-related management pressures, which multiply environmental management problems. To face those challenges, EU environmental directives, such as Water Framework Directive, Habitat Directive and Bird Directive provide frameworks for mitigation of possible negative, climate - and management-related impacts to ecosystems. However, {{the lowest level of}} environmental law implementation which is usually related to decisions of local authorities, fails to fulfil requirements of EU environmental directives by mismatched interpretation of law rules, e. g. “good ecological status” of rivers stated in Water Framework Directive and “favourable status of habitats” stated in Habitat Directive. In our study we present exemplary trees of decision making in protected areas in Biebrza Valley, NE Poland. Analysed examples refer to mire meadow drainage and construction of <b>storage</b> <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> close neighbourhood of boundaries of the national park. We reveal, that orientation-dependent interpretation of environmental acts fails to fulfil the requirements of adaptive management. We reveal, that the lowest level of environmental law implementation requires more concise procedures and more supervision from environmental specialists, as the “good” status is frequently unfavourable for the environmen...|$|R

40|$|Pig dung {{was used}} as manure at 18 and 36 t/ha/year in carp polyculture (without {{supplementary}} feeding) for 270 days. It was observed that pig dung at both the levels did not degrade the physico-chemical properties (pH, dissolved oxygen and alkalinity) of water. The nutrient (phosphates and nitrates) level of water was higher <b>in</b> manured <b>ponds</b> than control ponds (no manuring, only supplementary feeding).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, an attempt {{has been made}} to culture the giant tiger shrimp, P. monodon <b>in</b> six <b>ponds</b> each with 0. 8 ha near Alagankulam village of Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu. The {{salinity}} of the six ponds was ranging between 16 - 30 ppt and pH was 7. 6 to 8. 0. Minimum 3. 9 ppm dissolved oxygen and maximum 4. 2 ppm was recorded during the culture period. The temperature was ranging between 27 to 30 C and the transparency was 35 to 50 cm. Harvesting was carried out <b>in</b> <b>ponds</b> 1, 2 at DOC 142 and 3, 4 at DOC 143 and 5, 6 at DOC 149. Average body weights of the ponds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are 38. 46, 40. 00, 40. 00, 37. 00, 38. 46 and 37. 00, respectively. Highest survival 76 % was recorded <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> 4 and the lowest survival 68 % recorded <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> 1. The average survival for all six ponds was calculated as 72 %. Maximum production was reported <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> 2 (2, 154 kg) and minimum was <b>in</b> the <b>pond</b> 1 (1, 874 kg). The total production <b>in</b> all <b>ponds</b> was 11, 998 tons. The average body weight and average daily growth was calculated as 38. 49 and 0. 26 g, respectively <b>in</b> all <b>ponds.</b> The maximum amount of feed was consumed by the shrimps <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> 2 (2, 940) and minimum was <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> 1 (2, 550). The FCR for all ponds were 1. 36. Maximum net profit was obtained from pond 2 (Rs. 3, 91, 940) and minimum was <b>in</b> the <b>pond</b> 1 (Rs. 2, 69, 492). So it is confirmed that 12 m - 2 is an ideal stocking density for the culture of P. monodon as evidenced from the net profit Rs. 19, 18, 710.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{merits of}} {{fertilizing}} warmwater fish ponds with dry organic manure were studied from October, 1964 to November, 1965 using two experimental <b>ponds</b> <b>in</b> the Willamette Valley. One pond (pond II) was fertilized with urea and single superphosphate {{and the other}} (pond III) was fertilized with dried manure {{as well as with}} urea and single superphosphate. A study of the important environmental variables and the growth and production of largemouth black bass, Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede), was employed in an attempt to test the effects of fertilization with manure. The addition of manure to pond III failed to produce any striking effects in the physical and chemical characteristics in the pond; however, some reduction in the dissolved oxygen content of the bottom water of pond III, as compared with pond II, was noted. Nearly equal biomasses of limnetic microcrustaceans were observed <b>in</b> the <b>ponds</b> {{during the course of the}} experiment. The added manure first appeared to stimulate the abundance and weights of chironomid larvae and pupae and then depress them. Numbers and biomasses of these insects <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> III were more than double those of pond II during the early portion of the experiment. After the spring emergence periods they became greatly reduced <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> III as compared with pond II. The mean weights of the three size classes of largemouth bass <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> II were greater at every sampling period compared with the corresponding size classes <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> III. The survival of adult bass was higher <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> II than that of pond III. The differences in growth and mortality of bass between the two ponds was thought to be due to the reduction <b>in</b> chironomids <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> III <b>in</b> the latter portion of the experiment and the larger populations of the rough-skinned newt, Taricha granulosa granulosa (possible competitor with bass) <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> III. The addition of steer manure to pond III appeared to be of little value in respect to bass production. The production of bass on an acreage basis was more than doubled <b>in</b> <b>pond</b> II over that of pond III, leading to the rejection of the hypothesis that addition of organic matter in the form of dry composted steer manure would increase the production of largemouth bass...|$|R
