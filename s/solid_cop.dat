5000|$|Another detective from Eve's division, Homicide. A very able police officer, {{he begins}} making regular {{appearances}} in Conspiracy in Death. He was originally {{a member of}} the anti-crime division, but transferred over to Homicide well before his first appearance. He enjoys teasing Eve about anything he can, usually relating to her relationship with Roarke and associated changes; despite this teasing Roarke views Baxter as a <b>solid</b> <b>cop</b> and easygoing person. This did not, however, prevent a short altercation between Roarke and Baxter in Conspiracy in Death: when Baxter is responsible for interviewing Eve as a suspect in a homicide, Roarke punches him in the face. Whenever Eve has a fairly large team for a big investigation, she brings Baxter in. He is a bachelor and is described as being good looking; however, he has not been romantically tied to any particular person. Baxter enjoys playing the field. He is nicknamed [...] "Horny Dog" [...] by Eve and the other members of her unit.|$|E
40|$|Activated carbon {{developed}} from agricultural waste orange peel (COP) was prepared. COP was characterized using Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), and BET. COP has surface area and mean pore diameter of 225. 6 [*]m 2 [*]g− 1 and 22. 40 [*]nm, respectively. The removal of violet B (VB) and violet 5 R (V 5 R) from aqueous solutions by COP was investigated. The effect of operational parameters such as contact time, pH, initial dye concentration, and adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of dyes was investigated. Maximum dye was removed within 30 min of contact time at pH > 7. Two common models, the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, were used to investigate the interaction of dye and COPs. The isotherm evaluations revealed that the Langmuir model provides better fit to the experimental data than the Freundlich model. The adsorption of VB and V 5 R onto COP was followed by pseudo-second-order kinetic model with a good correlation (R 2 > 0. 99). Activation energies 5. 47 and 29. 7 [*]KJ[*]mol− 1 were determined for violet B and violet 5 R, respectively. The rate of adsorption of violet 5 R was faster than that of violet B (kV 5 R>kVB). The prepared COP could thus be used as promising adsorbent for removal of organic dyes, especially azo dye, from polluted water. The <b>solid</b> <b>COP</b> could be conveniently regenerated after adsorption...|$|E
40|$|South Africa {{surprised}} many when it {{pledged to}} reduce emissions by 34 per cent in 2020 and 42 per cent in 2025 a day before the Copenhagen Climate Summit of December 2009 (COP 15). The position taken by South Africa was in conflict {{with that of the}} Africa Group. South Africa was also involved in crafting the Copenhagen Accord, a political agreement concluded outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to address the interests of a few countries, including Brazil, China, India and the USA. Leading to COP 16 in Cancún 2010, South Africa forged a tripartite alliance with Denmark and Mexico in order to push for a <b>solid</b> foundation for <b>COP</b> 17, that took place in Durban in 2011. To tease out the thinking with regard to expectations for COP 17, South Africa called for a wish list from negotiating parties that were meeting in Bonn in June 2011. The views that emerged from the Bonn meeting show that South Africa has a big challenge in bridging the gap between the developed and developing countries. This article analyses South Africa’s role in climate negotiations with a view to presenting the challenges – from Copenhagen 2009, via Cancún 2010, to Durban 2011. The work also argues that being the host of COP 17 implies that South Africa’s role in climate negotiations was more focused on facilitation. The world expected a breakthrough in Durban, especially regarding the second Kyoto Protocol commitment period. Institute for Corporate Citizenshi...|$|R
40|$|Flavonoids {{have been}} {{suggested}} to protect against chronic lung disease. We studied intake of catechins, flavonols, and flavones in relation to pulmonary function and COPD symptoms in 13, 651 adults from three Dutch cities examined from 1994 to 1997. Dietary intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire, and flavonoid intake was calculated using specific food composition tables. Pulmonary function (FEV 1) was determined by spirometry and COPD symptoms by questionnaire. Associations were presented for the fifth versus the first quintile of intake (Q 5 -Q 1), adjusted for age, height (for FEV 1 only), sex, smoking, BMI, and energy intake. Smoking was strongly associated with COPD, independent of dietary effects. Average catechin, flavonol, and flavone intake was 58 mg/d (SD = 46) with tea and apples as main sources. Total catechin, flavonol, and flavone intake was positively associated with FEV 1 (βQ 5 -Q 1 = 44 ml, 95 ␌l = 18 - 69) and inversely associated with chronic cough (ORQ 5 -Q 1 = 0. 80, 95 ␌l = 0. 66 - 0. 97) and breathlessness (ORQ 5 -Q 1 = 0. 74, 95 ␌l = 0. 58 - 0. 94), but not chronic phlegm. Catechin intake was independently associated with FEV 1 (βQ 5 -Q 1 = 130 ml, 95 ␌l = 101 - 159) and all three COPD symptoms (ORQ 5 -Q 1 = 0. 60 - 0. 72, p < 0. 001). Flavonol and flavone intake was independently associated with chronic cough only. Solid fruit, but not tea, intake was beneficially associated with COPD. Our results suggest a beneficial effect of a high intake of catechins and <b>solid</b> fruits against <b>COP...</b>|$|R
