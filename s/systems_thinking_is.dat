25|$|One way to {{understand}} the motivation behind systems engineering is {{to see it as}} a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems. Keeping this in mind, the principles of systems engineering holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al. can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> employed at all levels. Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics & communications require systems engineers as part of their team.|$|E

2500|$|Moreno {{developed}} a specific and highly structured form of group therapy known as psychodrama (although the entry on psychodrama claims {{it is not}} a form of group therapy). Another recent development in the theory and method of group psychotherapy based on an integration of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> Yvonne Agazarian's systems-centered therapy (SCT), which sees groups functioning within the principles of system dynamics. Her method of [...] "functional subgrouping" [...] introduces a method of organizing group communication so it is less likely to react counterproductively to differences. SCT also emphasizes the need to recognize the phases of group development and the defenses related to each phase in order to best make sense and influence group dynamics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{question}} of what <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> adds to the field of global health. Observing that elements of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>are</b> already common in public health research, the article discusses which of the large body of theories, methods, and tools associated with <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>are</b> more useful. The paper reviews the origins of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking,</b> describing a range of the theories, methods, and tools. A common thread is the idea that the behavior of systems is governed by common principles that can be discovered and expressed. They each address problems of complexity, which is a frequent challenge in global health. The different methods and tools are suited to different types of inquiry and involve both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The paper concludes by emphasizing that explicit models used in <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> provide new opportunities to understand and continuously test and revise our {{understanding of the nature of}} things, including how to intervene to improve people’s health.

50|$|Ecoliteracy {{concerns}} {{understanding the}} principles of organisation of ecosystems and their potential application to understanding {{how to build a}} sustainable human society. It combines the sciences of systems and ecology in drawing together elements required to foster learning processes toward a deep appreciation of nature and our role in it. <b>Systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> the recognition of the world as an integrated whole rather than a collection of individual elements. Within systems thinking, basic principles of organization become more important than the analysis of various components of the system in isolation. Ecological literacy and systems thinking implies a recognition of the manner in which all phenomenon are part of networks that define the way that element functions. <b>Systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> necessary to understand complex interdependence of ecological systems, social systems and other systems on all levels.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of <b>system</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> that every action {{triggers}} a reaction. In system dynamics this reaction is called feedback. There {{are two types}} of feedback - reinforcing feedback and balancing feedback. Sometimes a feedback (or a reaction) does not occur immediately - the process contains delays. Any system can be drawn as a diagram set up with circles of causality - including actions, feedbacks and delays.|$|R

50|$|DSRP theory {{posits that}} the mind-body problem and symbol {{grounding}} problem that causes a disconnect between {{our knowledge of}} physical things and the physical world (the basis of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking)</b> <b>is</b> resolved because our universal DSRP cognitive structures evolved within the boundaries and constraints of the physical, chemical, and biological laws.

5000|$|<b>Systems</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>is</b> a core {{principle}} to any business concerned with sustainability and the environment. It is {{an approach to}} problem solving that studies how something interacts with its environment as a whole, whether that be social, economic or natural. This {{is in contrast to}} a linear thinking model, which would isolate a problem and study only its directly related processes to find solutions. It consists of the notion that in order to understand vertical problems (looking deeply at one particular issue), you must understand and evaluate the horizontal environment as a whole (the entire system and its interrelated functions). As it pertains to business is best illustrated in the book Entrepreneurship and Sustainability by Andrea Larsen,"Systems thinking applied to new ventures reminds us that companies operate in complex sets of interlocking living and non-living, including markets and supply chains as well as non-living systems.... Taking a systems perspective reminds us that we are accustomed to thinking of business in terms of discrete units with clear boundaries between them. We forget that these boundaries exist primarily in our minds or as legal constructs." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{manner of}} {{analysis}} is {{a companion to}} the systems thinking discipline that is defined as any process of estimating or inferring how local policies, actions, or changes influences {{the state of the}} neighboring universe. It is an approach to problem solving that views [...] "problems" [...] as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to present outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of the undesired issue or problem.1 <b>Systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> a framework that is {{based on the belief that}} the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. The only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the part in relation to the whole.2 Standing in contrast to Descartes's scientific reductionism and philosophical analysis, it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system.|$|E
