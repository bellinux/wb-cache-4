50|$|Cholinergic {{receptor}}, nicotinic, alpha 6, {{also known}} as nAChRα6, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CHRNA6 gene. The CHRNA6 gene codes for the α6 nicotinic receptor subunit that is found in certain types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found primarily in the brain. Neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α6 subunits are expressed on dopamine-releasing neurons in the midbrain, and dopamine release following activation of these neurons {{is thought to be}} involved in the addictive properties of nicotine. Due to their <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> on dopaminergic neurons, α6-containing nACh receptors have also been suggested as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

The novel aspect of this case is the <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> to the bone marrow of lymphoplasmacytoid cells secreting IgA kappa morphologically identical to the cells infiltrating the salivary glands. The serum of the patient contained large amounts of immunoglobulin-anti-immunoglobulin immune complexes. By gel filtration chromatography it was shown that the immune complexes formed a peak of molecular weight 680 kilodaltons. The immune complexes were dissociable under acidic conditions. The immunoglobulin with rheumatoid activity was characterised as monoclonal IgA kappa protein. Treatment with plasmapheresis combined with immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide reduced the serum viscosity with concomitant clinical improvement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Barrett's {{esophagus}} (BE) {{represents a}} {{major risk factor}} for esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC). For this reason, patients with BE are subjected to a systematic endoscopic surveillance to detect initial evolution towards non-invasive neoplasia (NiN) and cancer, that eventually occurs only in {{a small fraction of}} BE patients. This study was aimed to investigate the possible role of glutathione-S-transferase-omega 1 (GSTO 1), a recently discovered member of the glutathione-S-transferase family, as a progression marker in the Barrett's disease in order to improve the diagnosis of NiN in BE and to understand the mechanisms of the progression from BE to AC. We investigated the expression and subcellular localization of GSTO 1 in biopsies from patients with BE and in human cancer cell lines subjected to heath shock treatment. A <b>selective</b> nuclear <b>localisation</b> of GSTO 1 was found in 16 / 16 biopsies with low- or high-grade NiN, while it appeared in only 4 / 22 BE biopsies without signs of NiN (P< 0. 0001). Among biopsies of BE without NiN, diffuse (nuclear and cytoplasmic) staining was found in 5 / 22 cases, while <b>selective</b> cytoplasmic <b>localisation</b> was found in 13 / 22. The 6 cases with indefinite grade of NiN were equally divided between nuclear, cytoplasmic and diffuse staining (2 each, respectively). Experiments in vitro showed that in human HeLa cancer cells, GSTO 1 translocates into the nucleus as a consequence of heath shock. These findings suggested that the nuclear translocation of glutathione-S-transferase-omega 1 could be involved in the stress response of human cells playing a role in the cancer progression of Barrett's esophagus. Its immunohistochemical detection could represent a useful tool in the grading of Barrett's diseas...|$|R
40|$|Starting from {{identifying}} the appearance, the maintenance, {{and the increase}} of industrial imbalance in the Land of Bârsa, {{in this study we}} focused on both the industrialisation process, with its four evolutionary stages (<b>localisation,</b> <b>selective</b> concentration, regional polarisation, and mobility) and on the existing industrial disparities. Year 1990 was the starting point for increasing these disparities with a significant impact on economy, population, the settlement system, and the environment. Some of the factories were shut down, others underwent bankruptcy, and industry changed its evolutionary trend to a rapid decline. The “deindustrialisation” syntagm covers the new path followed by industry during the transition period, from a centralised economy to a market-oriented one that was supported by industrial reorganisation and privatisation. Either for the former or for the latter, the main purpose was the same: diminishing and eliminating the present industrial imbalances...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Biomedical Technology) The {{uncontrolled}} growth of {{cells in the}} body {{is often associated with}} cancer. It constitutes a major health problem {{and is one of the}} leading causes of death in the world. Cancers of the lung, breast, colon/rectum and prostate are no longer only associated with developed countries but are the most common occurring cancers worldwide. Breast cancer is the leading cancer faced by women in South Africa as well as in the world. Conventional cancer therapies often result in uncertain outcomes with numerous side effects and may be associated with limited therapeutic advantage. This has led to the development of safer and better treatment regimes with improved therapeutic outcomes. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment used for a wide range of conditions, including cancer. This treatment utilises a photosensitiser (PS), a light activated chemotherapeutic agent, and light of a specific wavelength and power density. It is based on the <b>selective</b> tumour <b>localisation</b> of the PS and the ability to generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of light. The generation of ROS causes permanent damage to the tumour cells resulting in cancer cell death. The distinctive criteria when comparing different PDT modalities is the choice of PS as the treatment outcomes are greatly influenced by the light dependent properties of the chemotherapeutic agent. Phthalocyanines are second generation PSs used in PDT. Effects of members of this PS family have been studied and they exhibited good photosensitising properties including lack of cytotoxicity in the absence of light, extended retention times in the tumour and high triplet lifetime of singlet oxygen species...|$|R
40|$|Liposomal drug {{delivery}} enhances the tumour <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> and may improve the uptake compared to free drug. However, the drug distribution within the tumour tissue {{may still be}} heterogeneous. Degradation of the extracellular matrix is assumed to improve the uptake and penetration of drugs. The effect of the ECM-degrading enzyme hyaluronidase on interstitial fluid pressure and microvascular pressure were measured in human osteosarcoma xenografts by the wick-in-needle and micropipette technique, respectively. The tumour uptake and distribution of liposomal doxorubicin were studied on tumour sections by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The drugs were injected i. v. 1 [*]h after the hyaluronidase pretreatment. Intratumoral injection of hyaluronidase reduced interstitial fluid pressure in a nonlinear dose-dependent manner. Maximum interstitial fluid pressure reduction of approximately 50 % was found after injection of 1500 [*]U hyaluronidase. Neither intratumoral nor i. v. injection of hyaluronidase induced any changes in the microvascular pressure. Thus, hyaluronidase induced a transcapillary pressure gradient, resulting in a four-fold increase in the tumour uptake and improving {{the distribution of the}} liposomal doxorubicin. Hyaluronidase reduces a major barrier for {{drug delivery}} by inducing a transcapillary pressure gradient, and administration of hyaluronidase adjuvant with liposomal doxorubicin may thus improve the therapeutic outcome...|$|E

Recently there is great interest {{for the development of}} nanotheranostic systems with multimodal live real-time imaging ability. Novel multimodal multifunctional iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4) saturated lactoferrin (FebLf) nanocapsules/nanocarriers (FebLf NCs) nanoformulation was fabricated. Anti-cancer nanotheranostic ability in human xenograft colonic adenocarcinoma model was conducted in vivo by employing near infrared flouroscence (NIRF) real time live mice imaging technology. FebLf NCs showed spherical morphology with 50 to 80 nm size with super paramagnetic property and exhibited profound in vivo anti-tumour efficacy, leading to regression of the xenograft colonic tumour growth over a 90 day trial period. NIRF real time imaging revealed <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> patterns of the FebLf NCs at the tumour site causing tumour growth inhibition. In turn, ex vivo NIRF imaging of mice organs showed enhanced tumoural uptake and biodistribution at the vital organs including spleen, intestine, kidney, and intestine. Low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs), ferroportin, ferritin receptor based in vivo internalisation mechanisms and iron metabolism regulation were observed. Histopathological analysis revealed obsolute non-toxic nature of FebLf NCs in mice tissues. These observations summate biocompatible, multimodal anticancer activity of novel FebLf NCs for real time cancer therapeutic imaging leading to targeted colonic adenocarcinoma therapy...|$|E

Tans word die antimonaatioon merendeels gebruik vir die presipitering van intrasellulêre kalsium in kalsiumlokaliseringstudies. Die grootste probleem wat egter ondervind word met die gebruik van die antimonaatioon in kalsiumlokaliseringstudies, is die selektiwiteit van die antimonaatioon vir kalsium in die teenwoordigheid van die ander intrasellulêre katione. Met verskeie x-straalanalises en keleringstudies is daar aangetoon dat die antimonaatioon-presipiteringsreaksie onder bepaalde reaksiekondisies, tog spesifiek kan wees vir kalsium. ’n Transmissie- elektronmikroskopie-metode vir die selektiewe lokalisering van intrasellulêre kalsium in die neutrofiel deur die antimonaatioon word bespreek. Daar word aangetoon dat kalsium wel selektief gepresipiteer kan word deur die antimonaatioon onder bepaalde eksperimentele toestande. The {{antimonate}} ion {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} 1962 by Komnick for the precipitation of intracellular sodium ions. The antimonate ion can, however, also precipitate other cations and can be employed in subcellular calcium localisation studies. The greatest difficulty encountered with such subcellular calcium localisation studies is the selectivity of the antimonate ion for calcium in the presence of the other intracellular cations. Various x-ray analyses and chelation studies have shown that the antimonate precipitation reaction can be specific for calcium under appropriate conditions. A transmission electron microscopy method for the <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> of intracellular calcium in the neutrophil with the antimonate ion is discussed.

40|$|Immunotargeting of PLAP-expressing tumours was {{studied for}} two radioiodinated, highly {{specific}} anti-PLAP monoclonal antibodies, 7 E 8 and 17 E 3, differing 10 -fold in affinity, {{as well as}} for 7 E 8 F(ab') 2 fragments. An anti-CEA monoclonal antibody or anti-CD 3 F(ab') 2 fragments were used as controls. Specific and non-specific targeting was examined in nude mice simultaneously grafted with PLAP-positive tumours derived from M 04 1 - 4 cells, and CEA-positive tumours, derived from 5583 -S cells. Results indicated that (1) M 04 1 - 4 tumours, with a stable expression of PLAP on the plasma membrane, represent a useful new in vivo model for immunodirected tumour targeting; (2) differences in antibody affinity for PLAP in vitro are not reflected in antibody avidity for tumour cells in vivo; and (3) excellent <b>selective</b> and specific <b>localisation</b> of the PLAP-positive tumours is achieved when 7 E 8 F(ab') 2 fragments are used. The high tumour/blood ratios (10. 7 ± 3. 9 at 46 h after injection) were due to a much faster blood clearance of 7 E 8 F(ab') 2 fragments. At this time point, the mean tumour/non-tumour tissue ratio was as high as 34. 5, and the mean specific localisation index was 29. 0. As expected, the F(ab') 2 fragments provided high tumour imaging efficiency on gamma camera recording. These data imply important potentials of the PLAP/anti-PLAP system for immunolocalisation and therapy in patients, but also emphasise that in vitro criteria alone are not reflected in in vivo tumour localisation capacities of antibodies...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Clinical {{staging of}} {{patients}} with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is crucial for the choice of treatment. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are typically recommended and used for staging of the cervical lymph nodes (LNs). Although ultrasonography (US) is a non-expensive, accessible and non-ionising imaging modality this method is not consistently used. This study aimed to investigate if addition of US of patients classified as clinically LN negative (cN 0) by CT and/or MRI, increases the detection of LN metastases. Also, we aimed to identify which of the sonographic characteristics: echogenicity, border, shape, appearance of hilum and nodal blood-flow pattern best detect metastases in this patient group. METHOD: Fifty-one patients with OSCC classified as cN 0 by CT/MRI were consecutively included and prospectively examined with US prior to sentinel node biopsy or <b>selective</b> neck dissection. <b>Localisation,</b> size and sonographic characteristics were registered for each LN and compared with the pathological findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for different size measurements and sonographic characteristics. RESULTS: We found that short axial diameter was the best size criterion for detection of metastases. However, the sonographic characteristics were better predictors than size and the presence at least four of the sonographic characteristics: hypo-echoic or heterogeneous appearance; irregular border; spherical shape; absence of nodal hilum; and peripheral nodal blood-flow resulted in a sensitivity of 43. 8; specificity 91. 4; PPV 70. 0; and NPV 78. 0. The number {{of patients with}} occult metastases decreased from 16 out of 51 (31 %) to nine out of 51 (18 %). Three patients (6 %) were over-staged by US. CONCLUSION: The addition of US to the clinical work-up of patients with cN 0 OSCC increases the detection of metastases, thus US potentially reduces {{the number of patients}} requiring a secondary neck surgery after sentinel node biopsy...|$|R
40|$|The {{start of}} the digital {{revolution}} came through the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) in 1959 followed by massive integration onto a silicon die by means of constant down scaling of individual components. Digital systems for certain applications require fault-tolerance against faults caused by temporary or permanent influence. The most widely used technique is triple module redundancy (TMR) {{in conjunction with a}} majority voter, which is regarded as a passive fault mitigation strategy. Design by functional resilience has been applied to circuit structures for increased fault-tolerance and towards self-diagnostic triggered self-healing. The focus of this thesis is therefore to develop new design strategies for fault detection and mitigation within transistor, gate and cell design levels. The research described in this thesis makes three contributions. The first contribution is based on adding fine-grained transistor level redundancy to logic gates in order to accomplish stuck-at fault-tolerance. The objective is to realise maximum fault-masking for a logic gate with minimal added redundant transistors. In the case of non-maskable stuck-at faults, the gate structure generates an intrinsic indication signal that is suitable for autonomous self-healing functions. As a result, logic circuitry utilising this design is now able to differentiate between gate faults and faults occurring in inter-gate connections. This distinction between fault-types can then be used for triggering selective self-healing responses. The second contribution is a logic matrix element which applies the three core redundancy concepts of spatial- temporal- and data-redundancy. This logic structure is composed of quad-modular redundant structures and is capable of <b>selective</b> fault-masking and <b>localisation</b> depending of fault-type at the cell level, which is referred to as a spatiotemporal quadded logic cell (QLC) structure. This QLC structure has the capability of cellular self-healing. Through the combination of fault-tolerant and masking logic features the QLC is designed with a fault-behaviour that is equal to existing quadded logic designs using only 33. 3...|$|R
40|$|Immunohistochemical {{study showed}} <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> of human {{epidermal}} growth factor (hEGF) to the synovial lining layer. Although the synovial lining layer of the rheumatoid, osteoarthritic, and traumatic joints was hEGF positive, hEGF staining was especially dense at the rheumatoid synovial lining layer; the staining increasing linearly according {{to the degree of}} stratification of the lining layer (r = 1). Human {{epidermal growth factor}} was ultrastructurally localised to cytoplasm, especially to rough endoplasmic reticulum, of the synovial lining fibroblast-like (type B) cell. Only the cell surface of macrophage-like (type A) cells was hEGF positive. When different histological variables were compared with each other a positive correlation was found between hEGF staining of the synovial lining layer and the degree of neovascularisation of rheumatoid synovium (r = 0. 72). Although some lymphocytes were weakly hEGF positive, neovascularisation did not correlate with the extent of lymphocyte infiltration or of hEGF staining of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte infiltration or hEGF staining of lymphocytes did not correlate with hEGF staining of the synovial lining layer, whereas the lymphocyte infiltration correlated positively with the extent of perivascular accumulation of lymphocytes (r = 0. 89). These findings suggest that (a) hEGF is synthesised by and secreted through endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus from the synovial lining type B cell; (b) hEGF is at least partially responsible for the pathogenesis of stratification of the rheumatoid synovial lining layer, and perhaps of neovascularisation of the rheumatoid synovium, whereas it is not responsible for lymphocyte accumulation to the rheumatoid synovium...|$|E
40|$|Poly(fl uorene) {{conjugated}} polyelectrolyte (CPE) -di-ureasil organic ? inorganic composites {{have been}} prepared using a versatile sol ? gel processing method, which enables <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> of the CPE within the di- ureasil matrix. Introduction of the CPE during the sol ? gel reaction leads to a homogeneous distribution of the CPE throughout the di-ureasil, whereas a post-synthesis solvent permeation route leads {{to the formation of}} a con fi ned layer of the CPE at the di-ureasil surface. The CPE and the di-ureasil both function as photoactive components, contributing directly to, and enhancing the optical properties of their composite material. The bright blue photoluminescence exhibited by CPE-di-ureasils is reminiscent of the parent CPE; however the distinct contribution of the di-ureasil to the steady-state emission pro fi le is also apparent. This is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield to > 50 %, which is a direct consequence of the synergy between the two components. Picosecond time-correlated single photon counting measurements reveal that the di-ureasil e ff ectively isolates the CPE chains, leading to emissive trap sites which have a high radiative probability. Moreover, intimate mixing of the CPE and the di-ureasil, coupled with their strong spectral overlap, results in e ffi cient excitation energy transfer from the di-ureasil to these emissive traps. Given the simple, solution-based fabrication method and the structural tunability of the two components, this approach presents an e ffi cient route to highly desirable CPE-hybrid materials whose optoelectronic properties may be enhanced and tailored for a targeted application...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{monoclonal}} antibody A 33 recognises a tumour-associated antigen on human colorectal carcinoma, and has undergone preliminary evaluation {{in the clinic}} where <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> to hepatic metastases has been demonstrated [Welt et al. (1994) J. Clin. Oncol. 12, 1561 - 1571]. A 33 and an A 33 tri-fab fragment (TFM) were labelled with 90 Y via a stable macrocyclic ligand for biodistribution and therapy studies in nude mice bearing SW 1222 colon carcinoma xenografts. Biodistribution studies demonstrated tumour localisation for both A 33 IgG and TFM with low bone, liver and kidney levels. Clearance of TFM from the blood was much faster than IgG and this led to lower tumour accumulation for TFM but superior tumourblood ratios. The maximum per cent injected dose per g localised to tumour was 35. 9 % + 5. 3 % for A 33 IgG and 12. 9 % + 4. 6 % for A 33 TFM with tumour-blood ratios at 48 h after administration of 5. 6 + 1. 8 and 29. 2 + 9. 8 respectively. Autoradiography studies with 1251 I-labelled A 33 IgG and TFM demonstrated a homogeneous distribution within tumour tissue which was not observed with other anti-colorectal tumour antibodies. TFM penetrated into the tumour tissue more rapidly than IgG. In therapy studies, a single dose of 90 Y-A 33 IgG (250 1 Ci per mouse) or 90 Y-A 33 TFM (300,uCi per mouse) led to complete regression of 2 -weekold tumour xenografts with long-term tumour-free survivors.

40|$|Angiogenesis is a {{characteristic}} feature of tumours and other disorders. The human monoclonal antibody L 19 - SIP targets the extra domain B of fibronectin, {{a marker of}} angiogenesis expressed {{in a range of}} tumours. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whole body distribution, tumour localisation and the potential of radioimmunotherapy with the L 19 -small immunoprotein (SIP) in colorectal tumours. Two colorectal tumour models with highly different morphologies, the SW 1222 and LS 174 T xenografts, were used in this study. Localisation and retention of the L 19 -SIP antibody at tumour vessels was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry and Cy 3 -labelled L 19 -SIP. Whole body biodistribution studies in both tumour models were carried out with 125 I-labelled L 19 -SIP. Finally, 131 I-labelled antibody was used to investigate the potential of radioimmunotherapy in SW 1222 tumours. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed extra domain B expression in the tumour vasculature. Immunofluorescence demonstrated localisation and retention of injected Cy 3 -labelled L 19 -SIP at the abluminal side of tumour vessels. Biodistribution studies using a 125 I-labelled antibody showed selective tumour uptake in both models. Higher recorded values for localisation were found in the SW 1222 tumours than in the LS 174 T (7. 9 vs 6. 6 [*]%ID[*]g− 1), with comparable blood clearance for both models. Based on these results, a radioimmunotherapy study was performed in the SW 1222 xenograft using 131 I-Labelled L 19 -SIP (55. 5 [*]MBq), which showed selective tumour uptake, tumour growth inhibition and improved survival. Radio- and fluorescence-labelled L 19 -SIP showed <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> and retention at vessels of two colorectal xenografts. Furthermore, 131 I-L 19 -SIP shows potential as a novel treatment of colorectal tumours, and provides the foundation to investigate combined therapies in the same tumour models...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} type of thyroid cancer, {{differentiated}} thyroid cancer (DTC), is diagnosed by radioactive iodine whole body scanning (WBS) and treated with radiotherapy using iodine- 13 I C 31 I). The success of this diagnosis/treatment approach relies on the relatively <b>selective</b> <b>localisation</b> of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) in cells of the thyroid gland. However, in some de-differentiated thyroid cancers, NIS expression is lost. This results in the inability of WBS to stage the disease and it also decreases the effectiveness of treatment with 131 I. A number of reports have shown that de-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, however, continue to express thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). TSHR is, therefore, a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of radioiodine resistant de-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In this study an anti- TSHR mono clonal antibody (mAb 9) and human recombinant TSH (rhTSH) were radio labelled and evaluated for their potential use in the diagnosis and treatment of radioiodine resistant thyroid cancer. A number of radiolabelling methods and quality control experiments were initially carried out to ensure high purity radiolabelled mAb 9 and rhTSH were produced. In vitro studies were conducted to assess the binding affinity of 125 I_mAb 9, lllIn-mAb 9 and 125 I_rhTSH to the TSHR in thyroid cancer cell lines, TPC-I,FTC- 133, and FRTL 5, and in a TSHR transfected cell line, GPI. SPECT/CT aJimal studies were performed in mice to investigate whether 125 I_mAb 9, 111 In-mAb 9 and 125 I_rhTSH bound to TSHR in the thyroid of mice in vivo. 125 I_mAb 9, 11 lIn_mAb 9 and 125 I_rhTSH bound to GPI cells but did not bind specifically to the TSHR in FTC- 133, TPC-I and FRTL 5 cells {{as well as to the}} thyroid of normal mice in vivo. Radiolabelled mAb 9 and radiolabelled rhTSH are therefore unlikely to be of use in the diagnosis and treatment of radioiodine resistant de-differentiated thyroid cancer.

A transient drop in {{white blood cell count}} was observed with both IgG and TFM but was significantly more pronounced with IgG. The cell count fell to 8. 4 % of control for IgG, whereas with TFM cell counts fell to 51 % of control before recovery. These results indicate that the more rapid blood clearance of 90 Y-TFM confers reduced toxicity compared with 90 Y-IgG although similar therapeutic effects are achieved. When the dose of 90 Y-IgG was adjusted to give the same dose to tumour achieved with 300 microCi 90 Y-TFM, a lesser therapeutic effect was observed. This may be owing to more rapid tumour penetration achieved with TFM. Both A 33 IgG and TFM demonstrated potent anti-tumour effects against human tumour xenografts in this mouse model system. The stability of these 90 Y-labelled conjugates and their effective tumour penetration are promising for the development of humanised reagents for clinical studies...|$|E
