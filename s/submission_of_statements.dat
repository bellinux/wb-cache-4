30|$|Regarding {{the sample}} selection, we use data on firms from three countries: Spain, France and the UK We only keep their {{financial}} data for 2008 because of two reasons. First, the main variable {{in all our}} analyses will be constructed using the information on status, which is only available for 2010. This makes panel data an unfeasible structure for the sample, since the variation in the main variable will happen across sections, but not across time. Second, {{because of the time}} lag in the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>statements</b> by firms, the Orbis database is characterised by a typical time lag of 2 years (Ribeiro et al. 2010), which implies that coverage (in number of companies with complete records) for 2009 and 2010 is very poor, leaving 2008 as the best choice. While this time gap could be problematic, it alleviates a simultaneity bias that may arise if the bankruptcy process or the alternative insolvency procedure affects the company’s financials (e.g. a foreclosure on some of the firm assets or a debt haircut), as our regressors will be lagged twice. We also apply some filters to clean the data. We exclude state-owned companies, non-profit organisations and membership organisations. To avoid double-counting of information we eliminate all consolidated accounts for which unconsolidated information exists. Finally, we remove inconsistent observations 24 and extreme values. Our final sample has more than 560, 000 firm-level observations.|$|R

40|$|WCOP' 99 is {{the fourth}} event {{in a series of}} highly {{successful}} workshops, which took place in conjunction with every ECOOP since 1996, focusing on the important field of component-oriented programming (COP). COP has been described as the natural extension of object-oriented programming to the realm of independently extensible systems. Several important approaches have emerged over the recent years, including CORBA, COM (COM+, DCOM, ActiveX, DirectX, [...] .), JavaBeans. A component is not an object, but provides the resources to instantiate objects. Often, a single component will provide interfaces to several closely related classes. Hence, COP is about architecure and packaging, besides interoperation between objects. After WCOP' 96 focused on the fundamental terminology of COP, the subsequent workshops expanded into the many re- lated facets of component software. WCOP' 99 shall emphasis architectural design and construction of component-based systems beyond ad-hoc reuse of unrelated components. To enable lively and productive discussions, the workshop will be limited to 25 participants. Depending on the actually submitted positions papers, the workshop will be organized into three or four subsequent mini-sessions, each initiated by a presentation of two or three selected positions and followed by discussions.
