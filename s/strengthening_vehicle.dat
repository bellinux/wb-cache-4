50|$|The W116 {{models were}} large luxury sedans. The W116 was larger {{on the outside}} than the W108/W109 series it replaced, but had similar {{interior}} capacity, as the additional bulk was driven by several new and aforementioned engineering developments on car safety and occupant protection in a crash. The W116 introduced other improved passive safety features into the vehicle design, including a <b>strengthened</b> <b>vehicle</b> occupant shell. It {{was one of the}} first cars to be available with ABS, a driver's airbag supplemental restraint system (but not available at the vehicle's initial launch). Also, the W116 was the first mass production passenger vehicle offered with a turbocharged diesel engine.|$|R
50|$|Privateer racing {{teams in}} Japan {{would use the}} AE85 and convert it to an AE86 since it is much cheaper by {{performing}} an engine swap. Using modifications such as a bolt-on turbo or supercharger, racers can <b>strengthen</b> their <b>vehicle</b> while keeping the light weight of the AE85 body.|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{performance}} of a company within a network of companies is neither a simple nor straightforward activity. In a networked enterprise, aside from traditional performance indicators based on quantifiable (physical) metrics, {{it is also important to}} capture performance measures denoting the quality of customer and partner relations. These factors are, however, much harder to quantifiably measure and compare. Furthermore, it is challenging to utilize a relationship performance measure as part of a decision support mechanism. This is due to the fact that connecting the measure to a meaningful business strategy can be difficult. This paper shows how the domain knowledge of experts regarding performance can be modeled using fuzzy logic. We further demonstrate that this modeled knowledge can be used to develop business strategies based on both quantitative metrics and less tangible satisfaction measures. This approach is applied within the freight logistics domain to illustrate how the knowledge of human planners may be captured to <b>strengthen</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing decision support systems...|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} of the KV-13 {{was made in the}} spring of 1942, but in the fall of that year tests showed a lack of mechanical reliability and demonstrated the need to <b>strengthen</b> the <b>vehicle's</b> armour and to equip it with the new three-seat turret. While production of two modified prototypes incorporating these modifications began in December 1942, work on the KV-13 as a medium tank was discontinued in favour of continuing the production of the T-34. The further development of the project using two modified KV-13 prototypes led to the creation in 1943 of the IS-1 heavy tank.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Since 2013, fog-haze weather occurs {{frequently}} in China, which arouses great concern in society. Fog-haze has {{a close relationship}} with the accumulation of mass contaminants, adverse weather conditions and regional transport of contaminants. The uncertainty pollutants source and “contribution rate ” covers a mystical veil for fog-haze weather. Persistent fog-haze weather will harm people's health, hinder the smooth running of the transport system, break the eco-system balance, and even undermine the credibility and good international image of the government. Haze control should be based on sound environmental law. Optimize the energy structure, <b>strengthen</b> the <b>vehicle</b> management as soon as possible, and make efforts to implement joint prevention and raise public participation. Under the country’s efforts, getting rid of fog-haze predicament is just around corner...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} urban road transport development and challenges in energy consumption in China. It relates sustainable urban road transport development with energy consumption and environmental management. It analyzes the main challenges related to urban road transport development: energy security, low efficiency in energy utilization, and unsustainable environmental management. It also discusses necessary technological and policy initiatives {{to deal with these}} challenges: e. g., promoting the development and dissemination of cleaner vehicle technologies, substitution of LPG, CNG, LNG and biofuels for gasoline and diesel, <b>strengthening</b> regulations on <b>vehicle</b> emissions, expediting public transport development, and the effective management of the soaring private car...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} descriptive {{analysis of}} the road tax performance in the CR in connection to relevant legal amendments to the Act No. 16 / 1993 Coll. Data on road tax from 1993 to 2011 were {{used in this analysis}} and are available from the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic. Road tax in the Czech Republic represents {{only a small part of}} the total tax revenue and its collection provides insufficient funds for maintenance and development of road infrastructure in the Czech Republic. Road tax collection is expected to grow in the future as a result of ongoing replacement and modernization of vehicle fleet, growing number of <b>vehicles,</b> <b>strengthening</b> of environmental aspects of taxes and internalisation of costs of transport...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSimultaneous {{development}} of photovoltaic generation and electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>strengthens</b> the solicitations on the electric power system. This paper investigates the possible synergy between these players to jointly improve the production predictability while ensuring a low carbon mobility. It {{stands for a}} step towards a quantification of its economic and environmental fallout. First a context is described for a PV-EV collaboration. Then this is gathered into an optimization problem. Grid commitment constraints, battery aging and mobility needs are here considered from the environmental {{point of view of}} equivalent primary energy. Finally, a resolution method is presented which achieve an time-efficient optimization of the power flow for each vehicle, based on upstream computed charging policies. It relies on a stochastic modeling of both vehicles availability and forecast error of the PV production. The resolution framework is the stochastic dynamic programming, coupled with on-line minimization so as to avoid the curse of dimensionality. The proposed resolution enables to compute optimal power flow for each vehicle, even among large fleets. The emphasis is here set on a versatile resolution method which could take over many detailed objective functions...|$|R
60|$|And if, as we {{have good}} reason to believe, recitative arose by degrees out of {{emotional}} speech, it becomes manifest that by a continuance of the same process song has arisen out of recitative. Just as, from the orations and legends of savages, expressed in the metaphorical, allegorical style natural to them, there sprung epic poetry, out of which lyric poetry was afterwards developed; so, from the exalted tones and cadences in which such orations and legends were delivered, came the chant or recitative music, from whence lyrical music has since grown up. And there has not only thus been a simultaneous and parallel genesis, {{but there is also a}} parallelism of results. For lyrical poetry differs from epic poetry, just as lyrical music differs from recitative: each still further intensifies the natural language of the emotions. Lyrical poetry is more metaphorical, more hyperbolic, more elliptical, and adds the rhythm of lines to the rhythm of feet; just as lyrical music is louder, more sonorous, more extreme in its intervals, and adds the rhythm of phrases to the rhythm of bars. And the known fact that out of epic poetry the stronger passions developed lyrical poetry as their appropriate <b>vehicle,</b> <b>strengthens</b> the inference that they similarly developed lyrical music out of recitative.|$|R
5000|$|The high speed, agility, and {{uncomplicated}} servicing {{and repair}} (thanks {{to the commercial}} Ford T chassis) were among {{the advantages of the}} vehicle. The armoured vehicles managed In spite of the extra weight of the armour, the vehicles managed well in heavy terrain, and were also able to cross relatively weak bridges on account of their low mass in comparison to other armoured vehicles. The Ford Tf C was really small in comparison to other armoured vehicles of the era, being for example half the size of the Austin-Putilov, and offered a smaller target. Nevertheless, the consequence was that Ford Tf C were very cramped inside, and the driver had to steer from a squatting position. Another problem was engine overheating during longer cross-countrydrives, or with let down cooler armour plating. Also the springs were overloaded in spite of <b>strengthening,</b> but the <b>vehicle</b> was urgently required and the advantages offset the defects. In 1921 Tanski offered to build another series of 30 vehicles; however, this was rejected, because the war was over and no other armoured vehicles were required. 12 Fords Tf C armored vehicles outlasted the war and were in use until 1931. Some had proper names such as [...] "Osa" [...] (wasp), [...] "Mucha" [...] (fly), and [...] "Komar" [...] (mosquito) painted on their armor.|$|R
