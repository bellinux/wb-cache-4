25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and prostate cancer is poor. In light of this the rate of prostate cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk of prostate cancer. Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although additional research is needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer. Consuming fish may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates of prostate cancer with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, <b>soy,</b> <b>beans</b> and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced cancers.|$|E

Phytoestrogen like isoflavon and genistein can inhibit 17 -β-hidroksisteroidoksidoreduktase which is also need to sintesize testosteron. Purpose: To prove that <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> extract can decrease Balb/c male mice spermatogenesis. Method: This study was an experimental study, using post test only control group design which use 36 Balb/c male mice as a subject, then, they were divided into 4 groups randomly, so every group contains of 9 mice. The first group (K) only get standard food, another group were given standard food and also <b>soy</b> <b>bean</b> extract with the dose for second group (A) 260 mg/day/mice, for third group (B) group 520 mg/day/mice, for fourth group (C) 780 mg/day/mice.

After that, Balb/c male mice were terminated on the 22 nd day, then were made testical image to be examine and given a score to the spermatogenesis according to Johnsons criteria. Results: Mean score for spermatogenesis in K group is the highest, and decreasing in A group. B and C group have the lowest score of spermatogenesis.
