50|$|Approaches {{to privacy}} can, broadly, {{be divided into}} two categories: free market, and {{consumer}} protection.31 In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.Stereotyping occurs because any analysis of real populations needs to make approximations and place individuals into groups. However, if conducted irresponsibly, stereotyping can lead to a variety of ethically undesirable results. In the American Marketing Association <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ethics,</b> stereotyping is countered by the obligation to show respect ("acknowledge the basic human dignity of all stakeholders").|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present an {{analysis}} of the language used by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) on its website (NED, 2008). The specific focus of the analysis is on the NED's high usage of the word “should” revealed in computer assisted corpus analysis using Leximancer.

In other words, its systematic institutional use can be read as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics,</b> of how the NED thinks the world ought to behave. As an ostensibly democracy-promoting institution, and one with a clear agenda of implementing American foreign policy, the ethics of NED are worth understanding.

40|$|The {{insights}} I {{have gained}} through my insider/out-sider experiences have {{lead to some}} very philosophical questions for which I have no obvious answers. For exam-ple: As a profession that increasingly emphasizes evidence-based practice, where is the balance between publishing only {{the best and most}} rigorous scholarship and mentor-ing the next generation of authors and reviewers? Where does the journal fit in finding this balance? Questions such as these ones will require discussion and debate with a range of stakeholders. Consequently, and for the time being, I have channeled my insights into initiating some key changes in CJOT infrastructure. Some of the changes that you will see in the coming year include: • New author guidelines and an author checklist that include more explicit details about cover letters, man-uscript length and organization, and required manu-script content (e. g., <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> approval for research studies, inclusion of key messages); • Supplementary guidelines for authors to use in the final preparations of their manuscripts, after their paper has been accepted for publication. These guide-lines will address issues such as format and font of headings, final checklists for reference formats, etc.; • A reviewer kit and new review forms to further enhance the ability of reviewers to be constructive, comprehensive, and address both methodological details as well as the bigger picture of what is impor-tant in our field; and • A series of new or revised policies on issues such as appeals, disposition of manuscripts, authorship, review processes, and copyediting. My transition and participant observation will go on for some time, and my questions and the issues that they raise will only become more complex as the nuances of this position become more apparent. I hope that some of the changes my transition has instigated with enhance the CJOT experience for readers, authors and reviewers...|$|E
40|$|Almost global {{acknowledgement}} of environmental crisis and social inequity suggest a secular revision of Kantian moral philosophy embracing sustainability. By eschewing subjective preferences {{as the foundation}} of morality Kant avoids an aspect of corporate responsibility that has otherwise proved intractable. Corporations, as artificial and disembodied agents, cannot depend on desires or intuitions to guide their actions. Kant 2 ̆ 7 s moral theory avoids subjective preferences that arbitrarily exclude our environments, communities or future generations from moral relevance and corporations from moral responsibility. Kant says: 2 ̆ 7 Let no one think that here the trivial 2 ̆ 7 quod tibi no vis fieri, etc. 2 ̆ 7 [Don 2 ̆ 7 t do unto others what you don 2 ̆ 7 t want done to yourself] can serve as a standard or principle. 2 ̆ 7 The problem with this golden rule, which the empirical tradition takes as the central <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>ethics,</b> is that it bases morality on shared preferences. In the process the golden rule excludes our environments from moral consideration and corporations from the scope of moral accountability: Neither corporate nor environmental preferences are commensurate with those of humans. In place of this biblical injunction Kant offers a law whose effect Kantians have characterised by the adage 2 ̆ 7 What if everyone did that? 2 ̆ 7 Kant 2 ̆ 7 s moral law uses the proscriptive universalization implicit in moral language and practice to make efficacy the basis of morality. Strictly, the only practical conclusion that Kant 2 ̆ 7 s argument leads to is that agents 2 ̆ 7 moral action is defined by the universalizability of their maxims and reciprocally, that universalizability is defined by agents 2 ̆ 7 ability to choose actions. Used as a test of right actions, Kant 2 ̆ 7 s moral law is very sensitive {{to the way in which}} proposed actions that provide it content are described. Contrary to recent interpretation, Kant 2 ̆ 7 s maxims are not teleological descriptions; they functionally describe those aspects of an action that are intended to serve interests. Act descriptions put to the test that fail to capture the relevant intention proclaim 2 ̆ 7 Do as I say, not as I do 2 ̆ 7 and are not maxims. Moral appraisal of any sort implies a procedural sanction against self-deception that avoids false moral judgements: Honesty effectively corrects for bias in describing maxims, allowing immoral proposed actions to be proscribed. Kant notes that 2 ̆ 7 the proposition, 2 ̆ 7 Honesty is the best policy 2 ̆ 7 is beyond all refutation, and is the indispensable condition of all policy 2 ̆ 7. By introducing glosses on the kinds of actions humans propose to the moral law Kant 2 ̆ 7 s theory guides corporate action towards sustainability. Kant argues that the idea of reason shared by humanity at any time is the core of political theory and ethics. Kant 2 ̆ 7 s anthropology means that the limits of moral consideration remain open: By asking 2 ̆ 7 How would it look to others? 2 ̆ 7 maxims consider all interests (including non-human interests) and the process of universalization ensures that consideration extends both forwards and backwards in time. Imposing this moral law on corporations can be justified on pragmatic grounds, it is sensitive to environmental, historical and cultural contexts as well as the implications for future generations: Corporate 2 ̆ 7 Virtue is its own reward 2 ̆ 7. As a moral proscription test the moral law self-corrects through honesty and improved understanding. As we get to know more about the impact of corporate actions on other species or ecologies, on the future and on other cultures the process of universalization adjusts providing a self-correcting definition of what makes corporate actions unsustainable: A moral law for the jungle...|$|E

It was the first international code <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> enacted in the public relations field. Many public relations leaders of the time saw public relations as a force for social progress and a bulwark against oppressive regimes in the Communist world and military dictatorships.

Using sources from the IPRA archive, the paper explores the evolution of the Code, its implementation and modification. A feature of the debate within IPRA about the Code was whether it was a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> ideals to which members should aspire or a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> standards. The view of prominent IPRA members from Anglo-American countries was that the Code, while laudable, was unenforceable. There are, however, no archived records of disciplinary action against members.
