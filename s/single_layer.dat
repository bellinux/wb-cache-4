It is {{found that a}} ZnO thin film less than three Zn-O layers prefers a planar graphite-like structure to the wurtzite structure. ZnO <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> are much more flexible than graphite <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> in the elasticity and stronger than boron nitride <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> in the piezoelectricity. Single-walled ZnO nanotubes (SWZONTs) can exist in principle because of their negative binding energy. The piezoelectricity of SWZONTs depends on their chirality. For most ZnO nanotubes except the zigzag type, twists around the tube axis will induce axial polarizations. A possible scheme is proposed to achieve the SWZONTs from the solid-vapor phase process with carbon nanotubes as templates. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|MoS 2 <b>single</b> <b>layers</b> have {{recently}} emerged as strong competitors of graphene in electronic and optoelectronic device applications {{due to their}} intrinsic direct bandgap. However, transport measurements reveal the crucial role of defect-induced electronic states, pointing out the fundamental importance of characterizing their intrinsic defect structure. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is able to image atomic scale defects in MoS 2 <b>single</b> <b>layers,</b> but the imaged defect structure {{is far from the}} one probed in the electronic devices, as the defect density and distribution are substantially altered during the TEM imaging. Here, we report that under special imaging conditions, STM measurements can fully resolve the native atomic scale defect structure of MoS 2 <b>single</b> <b>layers.</b> Our STM investigations clearly resolve a high intrinsic concentration of individual sulfur atom vacancies, and experimentally identify the nature of the defect induced electronic mid-gap states, by combining topographic STM images with ab intio calculations. Experimental data on the intrinsic defect structure and the associated defect-bound electronic states that can be directly used for the interpretation of transport measurements are essential to fully understand the operation, reliability and performance limitations of realistic electronic devices based on MoS 2 <b>single</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn. The variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded. Spores are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, hyaline (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5µm. They are covered in a gelatinous sheath. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14µm. Pleurocystidia (found on the tube walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8µm. Cheilocystidia (on the tube edges) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8µm. Caulocystidia {{at the top of}} the stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25–45 by 10–15µm; at the stipe base, the caulocystidia are 30–40 by 7–23µm and are mostly club-shaped to roughly spherical to tear-shaped.

Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} peridium may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E
