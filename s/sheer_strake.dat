25|$|This design, {{and that}} of its near {{relative}} the trunk deck ship, were said to maximize strength, allowing larger vessels and reduced the amount of steel needed for construction. In reality, {{it is more likely}} that the geometry inhibited the development of cracks in the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> but vessels to this design were not any lighter than conventional vessels due to their unique geometry. In operation their hull form promoted self-trimming of homogenous cargo and inhibited shifting. The design also called for a cellular double bottom, which was the probable reason for claims of the type's exceptional hull strength, but it also raised the centre of gravity of the cargo. A higher centre of gravity increased the roll period and reduced the violence of rolls. But loading heavy cargo too high, and failing to properly ballast the bottom tanks, raised the centre of gravity and led to instability. This led to accidents, a Board of Trade investigation, and cautions from Doxford on proper loading. The design also was inconvenient, as the narrowness of the turret made for smaller cargo hatches and restricted habitation spaces in the superstructure atop the turret.|$|E
50|$|In wooden boats, the gunwale remained, mounted inboard of the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake,</b> {{regardless}} {{of the use of}} gunnery. In modern boats, it is the top edge of the side where there is usually some form of stiffening.|$|E
50|$|Inboard of the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> {{the heavier}} gunwale is {{similarly}} bent in {{along the line}} of the sheer. This part of the work is finished by fitting the breast hook and quarter knees. Swivel or crutch chocks are fitted as appropriate to the gunwale, the thwarts fitted down onto the rising and held in position by knees up to the gunwale and perhaps down onto the stringer. The structure of gunwale, rising, thwart and thwart knees greatly stiffens and strengthens the shell and turns it into a boat. There are several ways of fixing the rubbing strake but in a clinker boat, it is applied to the outside of the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{their ship}} trials, several changes were made. The four ships {{were given a}} {{retractable}} bow spar in 1938-1939, which changed their lengths, from 114m (374 ft) to [...] between perpendiculars, and 119m (390 ft) to [...] overall. All four ships were initially fitted with a staukeil, a short keel that had a shallow wedge shaped cross section, under their transoms, {{in order to improve}} their turning circles. These were removed in 1940-1942. Although they initially all had forecastle <b>sheer</b> <b>strakes</b> on each side, in 1938 this was changed to a narrow spray deflector on their undersides, between their forwardmost 12.7 cm gun, and their anchor hawse. During this time, their sterns were also changed, being raised by [...] and extended by [...] Between 1937 and 1938, Z2 Georg Thieles spray deflector was wider on its foreship, but after this it was the same as the other three ships of its class. The four ships had their original upper bridge with a half-round front face removed in 1938, which was replaced with a new bridge, which was vaguely pentagonal in shape. In mid-1941, Z4 Richard Beitzen was fitted with a FuMO 24/25 and a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel.|$|R
50|$|In {{building}} a simple pulling boat, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost and perhaps transom are assembled and securely set up. In normal practice, {{this will be}} the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the garboard, bottom, bilge, topside and <b>sheer</b> <b>strakes</b> are planked up, held together along their lands by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge {{at the end of the}} strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat's passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.|$|R
5000|$|The Lockwood's nine-log {{bottom is}} original, using locally-harvested pitch pine timbers. The keel log is 6 in thick, with four outer logs {{on each side}} {{tapering}} to 2.5 in. The logs are connected with wrought iron bolts. The hull form is round-bottomed with a sharp entry and stern making her double-ended, and derives its shape from the original log canoe prototype. A [...] "patent stern" [...] is framed above the sternpost to widen the rear deck area. Framing and planking is used above the logs to add freeboard, with oak transverse frames 24 in apart from the keel log to the top <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> supporting 1.5 in oak planking. The <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> is oak, 2.5 in by 8 in. Planking is fastened with galvanized bolts. The centerboard, which allows better performance to windward while retailing a shallow draft, {{is located in a}} pine trunk fastened to the keel log. Decking is 2¼" [...] × 4" [...] fir laid fore-and-aft, supported on beams joining the frames. A king plank, composed of two 3½" [...] × 4" [...] boards, runs beneath the deck from the stem to the hatch abaft the foremast. A main hatch is located amidships between the masts, and a small cabin is abaft the mainmast. A small box for the steering gear is at the extreme stern.|$|E
50|$|McDougall's {{design has}} been likened to a cigar with bent up ends. The <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> (vertical hull sides) of a {{conventional}} vessel met the horizontal weather deck at a right-angle gunwale; a whaleback hull had a continuous curve above the waterline from the vertical to the horizontal to where the sides met inboard. The bow and stern were nearly identical in shape, both conoid, truncated to end in a relatively small disc. The superstructure atop the hull was in or on round or oval “turrets”, so-named because of their resemblance to gunhouses on contemporary warships. Cabins, decks, and other superstructure were often mounted atop these turrets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b> In old vessels, a rubbing strake was built in just below a carvel <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b> It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the rubbing strake {{was applied to the}} outside of the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b> The strakes adjacent to the garboard are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake, often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would strengthen a piece of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining off process.|$|E

5000|$|During the long, bitter {{weeks of}} the Iwo-Okinawa operations, the United States fleet {{suffered}} more damage {{than at any other}} time in its history. , beached and abandoned after being hit by a suicide plane during the Mindoro landings of November 1944, was patched, refloated, and towed to Ulithi for temporary repairs by Piedmont which would permit her return to the United States under her own power. On 20 April [...] made port with a 3-by-5-foot hole in her <b>sheer</b> <b>strake,</b> port side, for repair by Piedmont. , having suffered extensive damage to her port side bridge structure during a collision with a carrier while refueling, came alongside 1 May. The most badly battered of the battle damaged ships serviced by Piedmont at Ulithi was [...] which came alongside 4 May. Her entire bridge superstructure was a mass of tangled wreckage, a bomb explosion had blown a 15-by-15-foot hole in her starboard side, main deck; her forward stack had been completely destroyed; extensive bomb damage extended down to her second platform; and her interior and fleet radio room had been destroyed. Numerous dead had still to be removed from the wreckage. All repairs effected were temporary and on 24 May Hazelwood sailed for the United States and a Navy yard rebuilding.|$|E
40|$|History {{shows that}} the {{combination}} of stresses and pressure in a vessel can cause failure and lead to huge losses, examples of this are the ‘Prestige accident’ (November 2002) and the ‘Energy Concentration accident’ (July 1980). In {{the oil and gas industry}} structures are often mobilized on the deck of a vessel, transported to a specific location offshore and installed on the seabed. Occasionally these structures are quite large, resulting in their sticking out from the deck. A side plate in the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> area needs to be evaluated, as stresses from the protruding structure, and stresses and pressure from the vessel’s global loads, gives in-plane stresses and out-of-plane pressure. In this study, the aim is to establish a simplified approach for estimating stresses that arise from a vessels global loads, evaluate how much these stresses might influence the plate capacity and conclude whether these stresses should be included in a plate capacity check in Subsea 7. At this time, researchers such as Paik, Owen and Mansour are considered as wellestablished researchers in naval society, and their studies will be used to reach a method for finding the arising stresses on plate that occur because of the global vessel loads. The stresses will be estimated by idealizing the vessel as a hull girder and applying beam theory combined with recommendations from Det Norske Veritas. The study {{shows that the}}re are several key factors to establish these stresses and these factors will be estimated numerically and by computer software. The study shows that a stiffened side plate that is subjected to in-plane and out-ofplane stresses and pressure can experience failure modes when the structure on deck results in large stresses. In this study a stiffened plate capacity checks will be evaluated based on Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and NORSOK standards and recommended practices, and are considered as state-of-the-art approaches. The study concludes that both the magnitude of the global stresses and the stiffened plate’s characteristics are key factors in determining how much the global stresses influence the capacity of a specified plate...|$|E
