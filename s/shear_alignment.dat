40|$|The alignment, {{ordering}} and {{rotation of}} elongated granular particles was studied in shear flow. The time {{evolution of the}} orientation {{of a large number}} of particles was monitored in laboratory experiments by particle tracking using optical imaging and x-ray computed tomography. The experiments were complemented by discrete element simulations. The particles develop an orientational order. In the steady state the time and ensemble averaged direction of the main axis of the particles encloses a small angle with the streamlines. This <b>shear</b> <b>alignment</b> angle is independent of the applied shear rate, and it decreases with increasing grain aspect ratio. At the grain level the steady state is characterized by a net rotation of the particles, as dictated by the shear flow. The distribution of particle rotational velocities was measured both in the steady state and also during the initial transients. The average rotation speed of particles with their long axis perpendicular to the <b>shear</b> <b>alignment</b> angle is larger, while shear aligned particles rotate slower. The ratio of this fast/slow rotation increases with particle aspect ratio. During the initial transient starting from an unaligned initial condition, particles having an orientation just beyond the <b>shear</b> <b>alignment</b> angle rotate opposite to the direction dictated by the shear flow.

40|$|ABSTRACT: While high <b>shear</b> <b>alignment</b> {{has been}} shown to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) -polymer composites, this method does not allow for control over the electrical and dielectric properties of the composite and of-ten results in degradation of these properties. Here, we report a novel method to actively align SWNTs in a polymer matrix, which permits control over the degree of alignment of the SWNTs without the side effects of <b>shear</b> <b>alignment.</b> In this process, SWNTs were aligned via AC field-induced dipolar interactions among the nanotubes in a liquid matrix followed by immobilization by photopolymerization under continued application of the electric field. Alignment of SWNTs was controlled as a function of magnitude, frequency, and application time of the applied electric field. The degree of SWNT alignment was assessed using optical microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy, and the morphol-ogy of the aligned nanocomposites was investigated by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The structure of the field induced aligned SWNTs was intrinsically different from that of shear aligned SWNTs.

At low-temperature and low polymer concentrations the unimers are dissolved as individual Gaussian chains. At temperatures close to ambient, the hydrophobic nature of PPO causes aggregation of the polymers into spherical micelles. The aggregation number is relative small close to the critical micellation temperature, and increases markedly with temperature. The micellar volume fraction increases roughly linearly with temperature, until either a saturation is reached, where all polymers are part of a micelle, or the volume fraction reaches the critical value for hard-sphere crystallization. At higher temperatures the aggregates transform from spherical form to rod-like micelles, causing first melting of the cubic structure, and subsequently crystallization into a phase of hexagonally ordered rods...|$|R

If the temperature (T) is high, {{we find a}} disordered phase in which the mean length (L) of polymers is small. A first-order transition separates it from a low-T phase in which (L) is larger and the semiflexible polymers are aligned enough to yield nematic ordering. Disordered, glassy states can be obtained at low T; we study these by an MC analogue of scanning calorimetry (Menon et al. (1993, 1995, 1999)).

40|$|We {{describe}} the capillary flow behavior of gels of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) containing droplets of fibrils and the <b>shear</b> flow <b>alignment</b> of beta-lg fibers in dilute aqueous solutions. Polarized optical microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy {{are used to}} show that capillary shear flow {{does not affect the}} fibril droplet sizes in the beta-lg gels, the system behaving in this respect as a solution of compact colloidal particles under shear flow. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on dilute aqueous solutions indicates that the fibers can be initially aligned under capillary <b>shear,</b> but this <b>alignment</b> is lost after 18 min of shear. Transmission electron microscopy experiments on the samples studied by SAXS suggest that the loss of orientation is due to a shear-induced breakup of the swollen fibril network. Dynamic and static light scattering on dilute beta-lg fibril aqueous solutions are used to show that before shear beta-lg fibrils behave as strongly interacting semiflexible polymers, while they behave as weakly interacting rods after 18 min of capillary shear...|$|R

Based on the tube model of semiflexible polymers, we predict that large finite shear deformations strongly affect the average tube width and curvature, thereby exciting considerable restoring stresses. In contrast, the associated <b>shear</b> <b>alignment</b> is moderate, with little impact on the average tube parameters, and thus expected to be long-lived and detectable after cessation of shear. Similarly, topologically preserved hairpin configurations are predicted to leave a long-lived fingerprint {{in the shape of}} the distributions of tube widths and curvatures.

Investigations using synthetic seis-mograms computed for a zero-offset VSP in an anisotropic half-space address the frequency-independent part of this problem to determine how much uncertainty can be tolerated for simple ampli-tude and orientation variations in the source and geophone compo-nents whilst still maintaining a shear wave polarization estimated for the faster split shear wave accurate to within 5 ” or less.

40|$|We discuss {{methods for}} {{performing}} weak lensing using radio observations to recover {{information about the}} intrinsic structural properties of the source galaxies. Radio surveys provide unique information that can benefit weak lensing studies, such as HI emission, which {{may be used to}} construct galaxy velocity maps, and polarized synchrotron radiation; both of which provide information about the unlensed galaxy and can be used to reduce galaxy shape noise and the contribution of intrinsic alignments. Using a proxy for the intrinsic position angle of an observed galaxy, we develop techniques for cleanly separating weak gravitational lensing signals from intrinsic alignment contamination in forthcoming radio surveys. Random errors on the intrinsic orientation estimates introduce biases into the <b>shear</b> and intrinsic <b>alignment</b> estimates. However, we show that these biases can be corrected for if the error distribution is accurately known. We demonstrate our methods using simulations, where we reconstruct the <b>shear</b> and intrinsic <b>alignment</b> auto and cross-power spectra in three overlapping redshift bins.

The director rotates uniformly in the shear flow toward the Leslie alignment angle as probed by in situ flow conoscopy. The Leslie alignment angle becomes progressively closer to the flow direction as temperature decreases, corresponding to a decrease of the tumbling parameter λ with increasing order parameter S.

40|$|Shear is an {{effective}} method to create long-range order in micro- or nanostructured soft materials. When simple shear flow is applied, particles or polymer microdomains tend to align in the shear direction to minimize viscous dissipation; thus, transverse alignment (so-called log-rolling) is not typically favored. This is the first study to report the transverse alignment of cylinder-forming coil&# 8211;coil block copolymers. Poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate), PS&# 8211;PMMA, where the PS blocks form the matrix, can adopt a metastable PMMA hemicylindrical structure when confined in a thin film, and this hemicylindrical structure can orient either along the shear direction or transverse to the shear direction depending on the shearing temperature. A monolayer of PS&# 8211;PMMA forming full cylinders exhibits log-rolling alignment.

These differences may lead to surface characteristics of curtain coated papers that {{are very different from}} those obtained by conventional coating methods. Due to these differences, printing attributes of curtain coated papers are crucial to their acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the absence of <b>shear,</b> pigment <b>alignment</b> is not as strong as in other conventional coating processes.

The supramolecules consist of nearly symmetric polystyrene-b-poly(4 -vinylpyridine) diblock copolymers with pentadecylphenol side chains hydrogen bonded to the poly(4 -vinylpyridine) blocks. The polystyrene blocks, accounting for approximately 20 % (w/w) of the supramolecules, are segregated in hexagonally ordered cylinders inside a matrix formed by the comb-shaped poly(4 -vinylpyridine) -based blocks. The matrix further self-organizes in a layered structure below the order-disorder transition temperature of 70 °C. Thus, a cylinder-within-lamellar morphology is formed. Imposing shear leads to considerable alignment of both structures. The cylinders align along the shear flow with the (10) plane parallel {{with respect to the}} shear plane. The matrix layers align perpendicular to the cylinders, transverse to the flow.

We here use linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy under <b>shear</b> <b>alignment</b> to characterize interactions between the LCP poly(3 -thiophene acetic acid) (PTAA) and amyloid fibrils. The positive signature in the LD spectrum of amyloid-bound PTAA suggests that it binds in the grooves between adjacent protein side-chains in the amyloid fibril core, parallel to the fibril axis, similar to thioflavin-T and congo red. Moreover, using LD we record the absorption spectrum of amylokl-bound PTAA in isolation from free dye showing a red-shift by ca 30 nm compared to in solution. This {{has important implications for}} the use of PTAA as an amyloid probe in situ and in vitro and we demonstrate how to obtain optimal amyloid-specific fluorescence read-outs using PTAA. We use the shift in maximum absorption to estimate the fraction of bound PTAA at a given concentration. PTAA binding reaches saturation when added in 36 times excess and at this concentration the PTAA density is 4 - 5 monomer units per insulin monomer in the fibril. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in LD intensity can be related to alterations in persistence length of amyloid fibrils resulting from changes in solution conditions, showing that this technique is useful to assess macroscopic properties of these biopolymers.
