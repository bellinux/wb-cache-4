40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to empirically examine whether the United States' {{imposition}} of a <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restraint distorts foreign exports and thus affects world trade flows. We first develop a theoretical model of worldwide trade in which {{the imposition of a}} <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restraint by one country - an antidumping duty or a safeguard measure - causes significant distortions in world trade flows. We then empirically test this model by investigating the effect of US <b>special</b> <b>import</b> restraints on Japanese exports of roughly 3500 commodities into 29 countries between 1992 and 2001. Our estimation of a fixed-effects model of Japanese exports yields evidence that US import restraints both deflect and depress Japanese export flows. Imposition of a US antidumping duty against Japan deflects trade: export growth to non-US trading partners rises by 11 to 22 percentage points. The simultaneous imposition of a US antidumping duty against both Japan and a third country depresses trade: Japanese export growth to the third country falls by 0 to 18 percentage points. The magnitude of the trade depression effect is also larger when the US imposes an antidumping duty against a third country but not against Japan. A US safeguard measure leads Japanese export growth to third countries to rise 12 to 15 percentage points. Trade; Exports; Antidumping duties...|$|R
