40|$|The {{first three}} essays examine whether {{strategic}} precommitment to advertising investment by an established firm can prevent a new firm from entering a homogeneous-product market under various assumptions. In Essay 1, I consider the question {{under the assumption}} that (1) advertisements contain product and <b>seller</b> <b>information,</b> and (2) firms compete in prices or quantities after sequentially advertising. I show that when firms compete in prices after advertising, an incumbent can not prevent entry through advertising. When firms do in quantities, an incumbent can optimally by underinvesting in advertising. This finding implies that an incumbent 2 ̆ 7 s ability to deter entry through this type of advertisements is sensitive to whether firms compete in prices or quantities. In Essay 2, 1 handle the question {{under the assumption that}} (1) advertisements contain product and <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> and influence consumer evaluation of products, and (2) firms set a price after sequentially advertising. Unlike my prediction in Essay 1, I demonstrate that an incumbent can optimally impede entry by investing more in advertising than when it is a monopolist. This suggests that the presence of consumer persuasion through advertising seems critical to whether overinvestment in advertising can optimally deter entry. In Essay 3, I investigate the question under the assumption that (1 a) advertisements contain product and <b>seller</b> <b>information,</b> (1 b) the relative exposure frequencies to competing advertisements influence consumer evaluation of brands, and (2) firms compete in prices after sequentially advertising. In such an environment, I show that optimal entry deterrence involves excessive, repetitive advertisements by an incumbent. Therefore, repetitively informing consumers of the same information can be justified as a reasonable economic decision by a firm. Essay 4 examines the strategic choice of advertising content by firms. I focus on a case where duopolists simultaneously choose negative or positive advertising and an advertising level in a market for vertically and horizontally differentiated products. Unlike the previous result that when price is exogenous, the firm selling a relatively high-quality product runs positive advertisements, and the firm selling a relatively low-quality product runs negative advertisements, I show that when price is endogenous, both firms may engage in negative advertising. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of legal {{enforcement}} procedures for the participants of open electronic marketplaces, trust and reputation systems are central for resisting against threats from malicious agents. Such systems provide mechanisms for identifying the participants who disseminate unfair ratings. Reputation systems [4] are a particularly effective approach for buyers to evaluate sellers. In such systems, if a certain buyer does not have adequate personal experience with some candidate sellers, it will disseminate queries to other buyers (also called advisers) to inquire information about the sellers. Based on the reporting of <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> provided by the advisers, the buyer can then model {{the reputation of the}} sellers. However, in open environments, advisers may untruthfully report information about seller reputation because of their internal dispositions being deceitful or malicious. Also, it is possible that some of the honest participants are victimized {{as a consequence of the}} poor judgement of these systems.

40|$|In {{electronic}} markets, <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> {{is often}} obscured or unavailable, which current theories of reputation and opportunism contend will motivate opportunistic behavior. We investigate how reputable and opportunistic behaviors are motivated in online auctions. This exploratory study examines irregular bidding, which {{occurs when a}} bidder makes a bid for an item in an auction, yet that bidder could have won with the same bid or a lower bid in a different auction that is selling an identical item at the same time. Two possible motivations for irregular bidding are (1) shill bidding, where a seller secretly bids on his own item irrespective of other identical items {{that are available to}} opportunistically increase revenues, and (2) seller preference, where sellers build good reputations and buyers are willing to pay price premiums for these sellers ’ products. Rare coin auction data were collected in 2001, with 5, 031 bids in 1, 313 auctions from 2, 015 bidders and 480 sellers, and in 2005 - 2006, with 25, 029 bids in 1, 802 auctions from 5, 850 bidders and 342 sellers.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the use (and non-use) of list price {{information in the}} process of marketing commercial real estate. As far as we are aware, this has not been addressed in the literature. While housing market research suggests that list prices can serve as a strong anchor and/or signal, list price information is included in less than one-third of the commercial property sales and is less likely to be included as part of the sellers’ offering information for larger multi-tenant properties. Given the potentially powerful effect of list prices (first offers) on outcomes, the non-use of list price information is a puzzle. We speculate that the limited use of list prices {{may be due to the}} sellers’ interests in both maintaining their informational advantage and not truncating higher than expected offers, especially during periods of economic growth or with more complex properties. Using a two-stage selection correction model, we find that office properties which provide list price information are, on average, associated with lower price outcomes (ceteris paribus) and that these outcomes vary by price cohort and economic condition. It is important to note, however, that while these findings identify a correlation, they do not necessarily imply causation (i. e., that the use of list prices ‘cause’ transaction prices to be lower). Our results support the notion that asymmetric information and signaling (i. e., the conveyance of property and/or <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> that may affect the likelihood of sale) play a dominant role in explaining the sellers’ strategic non-use of list price information in the commercial property market...|$|E
40|$|Despite the ubiquitousness of {{standard}} form contracts {{in the world}} of consumer transactions, there is no consensus as to how these contracts ought to be constructed. Some courts continue to treat form contracts as if they were classically negotiated contracts. Others attempt {{in a variety of ways}} to factor in the reality that consumers entering into these contracts are not able to negotiate the terms and almost always sign these documents, which are presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, without reading them. This article posits that the cause of this continued confusion over form contracts is due to a basic failure of courts to adhere to fundamental principle of contract law, that a contract is interpreted according to the objective understanding of the parties. If courts would acknowledge that the reasonable drafters of form contracts do not expect the consumer to have read the multiple pages of a form contract, then courts would conclude a reasonable drafter would not understand the signing of the contract as indicating assent to unexpected and unfair terms. Instead, using the objective theory of contracts, courts facing a consumer form contract should consider the following questions: 1) What terms would a seller reasonably expect were known and understood by the non-drafting party? 2) What subordinate terms were pointed out or explained by the seller? 3) Was information conveyed by the seller, either directly, by an agent or by advertisements, to create a reasonable expectation in the consumer? 4) What would the reasonable seller have assumed was the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in entering into the transaction? 5) Did the consumer communicate to the <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> indicating a particular understanding of the terms of the contract? 6) Is a clause favoring the drafter reasonably tailored to accomplish a legitimate purpose? 7) Does an unknown one-sided clause deal with issues beyond the realm of contemplation of the reasonable consumer at the time of contracting...|$|E

What selling procedure can arise as an equilibrium {{of the game in}} which the seller strategically chooses mechanisms conditional on his information? We characterize the set of equilibrium outcomes and establish that ex-ante revenue-maximizing mechanisms are in this set. There is generally a continuum of revenue-ranked equilibrium outcomes. Focusing on the revenue-maximizing equilibrium, we show that the seller, in general, benefits from private information and does not benefit from committing to a disclosure or a certification technology.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop {{efficient}} and practically useful Bayesian methods for statistical inference in structural second-price auctions. The models are applied to a carefully collected coin auction dataset with bids and auction-specific characteristics from one thousand Internet auctions on eBay. Bidders {{are assumed to be}} risk-neutral and symmetric, and compete for a single object using the same game-theoretic strategy. A key contribution in the thesis is the derivation of very accurate approximations of the otherwise intractable equilibrium bid functions under different model assumptions. These easily computed and numerically stable approximations are shown to be crucial for statistical inference, where the inverse bid functions typically needs to be evaluated several million times. In the first paper, the approximate bid is a linear function of a bidder's signal and a Gaussian common value model is estimated. We find that the publicly available book value and the condition of the auctioned object are important determinants of bidders' valuations, while eBay's detailed <b>seller</b> <b>information</b> is essentially ignored by the bidders. In the second paper, the Gaussian model in the first paper is contrasted to a Gamma model that allows intrinsically non-negative common values. The Gaussian model performs slightly better than the Gamma model on the eBay data, which we attribute to an almost normal or at least symmetrical distribution of valuations. The third paper compares the model in the first paper to a directly comparable model for private values. We find many interesting empirical regularities between the models, but no strong and consistent evidence in favor of one model over the other. In the last paper, we consider auctions with both private-value and common-value bidders. The equilibrium bid function is given as the solution to an ordinary differential equation, from which we derive an approximate inverse bid as an explicit function of a given bid. The paper proposes an elaborate model where the probability of being a common value bidder is a function of covariates at the auction level. The model is estimated by a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm and the results point strongly to an active influx of both private-value and common-value bidders.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the holdup problem that arises when the investing party must purchase a necessary input from a second party. Consistent with many real-world settings, we suppose that the investing party must sink its investment prior to purchasing the necessary input, but before contracting with the seller of this input (e. g., a firm that contracts for necessary distribution access only after developing its new product). We study how the result-ing holdup problem {{is affected by the}} <b>seller’s</b> <b>information</b> about the investing party’s likely returns from its investment.

Further, depending on the distribution of types, loss-aversion can reduce the severity of the impossibility problem. However, the result cannot be reversed. Turning to the design of optimal mechanisms, we show that in both revenue and welfare maximizing mechanisms the designer optimally provides the agents with full insurance in the money dimension and with partial insurance in the trade dimension. In fact, when the stakes are large, loss-aversion can eliminate trade altogether. We show that all results display robustness to the exact specification of the reference point and provide some results on general mechanism design problems...|$|R

Public company financial statements are audited by Certified Public Accountants (USA), Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) or Chartered Accountants (UK and Canada) and overseen by a government regulator. Alternatively, private firms do not have government oversight—unless operating in a regulated industry—and are usually not required to have their financial statements audited. Moreover, managers of private firms often prepare their financial statements to minimize profits and, therefore, taxes. Alternatively, managers of public firms tend to want higher profits to increase their stock price.

40|$|Information {{about a new}} or non-frequently {{purchased}} {{product is}} often produced by {{both sides of the}} market. We construct a monopoly pricing model consisting of both <b>seller’s</b> <b>information</b> disclosure and consumer’s information acquisition. The presence of consumer search, which lowers the probability of making sales, creates incentive for the monopolist to deter search. In contrast with most previous literature, we show that, partial information disclosure arises in equilibrium when the search cost is low. As the search cost increases to medium level, the monopolist hides information but lowers the price to prevent consumers from searching. When the search cost is very high, the monopolist charges high price and hides information. The equilibrium price is thus non-monotonic in search cost. Information disclosure and consumer search co-exist only when the search cost is low, and thus complement each other. We show that transparency policies on advertising cannot improve social welfare. Nevertheless, they benefit consumers {{in a wide range of}} values of the search costs by improving matching quality and reducing the expense of searching. But for some medium levels of search costs, transparency policies hurt consumers due to the induced high price in equilibrium...|$|R

The study is led at the Marseilles wholesale fruits and vegetables wholesale market, which {{represents one of the}} main hubs of supply for retailers. All transactions take place through one-to-one interactions between retailers and whole <b>sellers.</b> <b>Information</b> about prices and quantities can be acquired through interactions linked to transactions, as well as from relations with other retailers or friendly wholesale sellers. Being regularly on the market, each participant has a set of regular relations that enables them to have either regular and trustful interactions or to choose a typically market-oriented search of their products. The time each retailer has on the market is very important to determine its attitude, its ability to reproduce its network, either as a calculative attitude or just to add pleasure to its work. In this paper, the model enables us to stress the importance of the use of time for two populations of retailers: faithful ones and selfish ones. The impact on diffusion is evaluated in relation to shortages and destructions of goods that indicate a bad circulation of information in the market.

40|$|Summary. We {{consider}} amonopolist selling {{durable goods}} to consumers with unit demands but different preferences for quality. The seller can offer items of different quality {{at the same}} time to induce buyers to self-select, as in Mussa-Rosen (1978), but is not artificially constrained to offer only one such menu. Instead the seller can offer without precommitment a sequence of menus over time. In the two-buyer case where the <b>seller</b> has complete <b>information</b> about each buyer's marginal valuation for quality, the seller's profits exceed what can be obtained from a single menu and sometimes approximate the profits of a perfectly discriminating monopolist. In companion papers (Bagnoli et al., 1990, 1992), we show that these conclusions continue to hold (1) in the infinite-horizon case with any finite number of buyers and (2) in two-period examples where the <b>seller</b> has incomplete <b>information</b> about buyer preferences. 1...|$|R
