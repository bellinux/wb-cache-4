5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the <b>Slender</b> Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the <b>Slender</b> Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, <b>Slender</b> Man is otherworldly, with motives {{that are often}} difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the <b>Slender</b> Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the <b>slender</b> boy, and many <b>slender</b> girls, the adjective <b>slender</b> does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E

5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the <b>Slender</b> Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing <b>Slender</b> Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the <b>Slender</b> Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the <b>Slender</b> Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as <b>slender</b> lorises (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most {{closely related to the}} <b>slender</b> lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the <b>slender</b> and slow lorises of today.|$|E
5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was <b>slender</b> and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a <b>slender</b> shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and <b>slender.</b> Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was <b>slender</b> and inwards curved, the tibia was <b>slender</b> and twisted, and the fibula was <b>slender</b> and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was <b>slender</b> and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E

500|$|Sallekhana (...) {{means to}} {{properly}} 'thin out', 'scour out' or 'slender' the passions {{and the body}} through gradually abstaining from food and drink. Sallekhana {{is divided into two}} components: Kashaya Sallekhana (slenderising of passions) or Abhayantra Sallekhana (internal <b>slendering)</b> and [...] Kaya Sallekhana (slenderising the body) or Bahya Sallekhana (external <b>slendering).</b> It is described as [...] "facing death voluntarily through fasting". According to Jain texts, Sallekhana leads to Ahimsa (non-violence or non-injury), as a person observing Sallekhana subjugates the passions, which are the root cause of Himsa (injury or violence).|$|R

5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the <b>Slender</b> Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} <b>Slender</b> Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the <b>Slender</b> Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{the giant}} sauropods {{can be divided}} into two categories: the shorter but stockier and more massive forms (mainly titanosaurs and some brachiosaurids), and the longer but <b>slenderer</b> and more {{light-weight}} forms (mainly diplodocids).|$|R

40|$|The {{boundary}} layer flow across a <b>slendering</b> stretching sheet has gotten awesome consideration {{due to its}} inexhaustible pragmatic applications in nuclear reactor technology, acoustical components, chemical and manufacturing procedures, for example, polymer extrusion, and machine design. By keeping this in view, we analyzed the two-dimensional MHD flow across a <b>slendering</b> stretching sheet within the sight of variable viscosity and viscous dissipation. The sheet {{is thought to be}} convectively warmed. Convective boundary conditions through heat and mass are employed. Similarity transformations used to change over the administering nonlinear partial differential equations as a group of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Runge-Kutta based shooting technique is utilized to solve the converted equations. Numerical estimations of the physical parameters involved in the problem are calculated for the friction factor, local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. Viscosity variation parameter and chemical reaction parameter shows the opposite impact to each other on the concentration profile. Heat and mass transfer Biot numbers are helpful to enhance the temperature and concentration respectively.
