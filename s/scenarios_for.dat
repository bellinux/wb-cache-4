5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> the crime, or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case.|$|E
5|$|Even in the 1960s {{articles}} were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than {{life for the}} seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published.|$|E
5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E

The combination of increasing employment ratios and increasing size of the non-employed population and migration pressure is also predicted for Morocco by the business-as-usual <b>scenario</b> <b>for</b> both periods and by the open economies <b>scenario</b> <b>for</b> the period 2025 – 2035. This is also predicted by the closed economies <b>scenario</b> <b>for</b> Algeria for the period 2015 – 2025.|$|R

5|$|The {{work on the}} game's {{scenario}} {{was split}} between four writers. Shōsuke Miyake drafted the game's overall storyline {{as well as the}} <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Sango, Ruri, and Lucy; Nagare Makura wrote the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Manaka and Yuma; Takeshi Marui for Karin and Yūki; and Munemitsu for Konomi and Tamaki. Likewise, the game's character designs were split amongst four artists. Misato Mitsumi provided the character designs and illustrations for Konomi and Yuma; Hisashi Kawata for Lucy and Karin; Tatsuki Amazuyu for Tamaki and Manaka; and Takeshi Nakamura for Sango, Ruri, and Yūki. The game's music was composed by Shimokawa, Junya Matsuoka, Shinya Ishikawa, Kazue Nakagami, and Michio Kinugasa.|$|E
5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> {{the future of}} the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of weapons from science fiction. The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose, thus making each useful in different <b>scenarios.</b> <b>For</b> example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two weapons at once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E

5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> {{the end of the}} Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|In Rewrite Harvest festa!, {{there are}} six {{separate}} scenarios, one for each heroine. The player is initially given the choice to play the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia from a character selection screen. Once these three scenarios are completed, the routes for Sizuru and Akane become available, and after those two are completed, Kagari's scenario is made available. After the completion of Kagari's scenario, a dungeon exploration role-playing minigame called Rewrite Quest becomes available.|$|E
5|$|One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e is Tactics' third title, after Moon and Dōsei. Ones {{production}} was headed by YET11, the pseudonym of Tsutomu Yoshizawa, who {{also contributed to}} the music in the game. Planning was led by Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario with fellow writer Naoki Hisaya. Maeda wrote the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Mizuka, Rumi and Mayu, while Hisaya wrote the routes for Misaki, Mio and Akane. Art direction was done by Itaru Hinoue who also worked on the computer graphics along with aritsts Miracle Mikipon and Shinory. In addition to YET11, the soundtrack was composed by Shinji Orito, OdiakeS, M.S. and Ishisan.|$|E

5|$|Pile and her co-writers {{initially}} used {{battery packs}} to represent characters, moving them around {{on her desk}} to develop <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> the show. The decision to make the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's output {{was large}} and varied. Between 1909 and 1941 he wrote thirty-six novels, five volumes of short stories, two {{original}} plays and three volumes of memoirs. His range included disturbing studies of the macabre, children's stories and historical fiction, most notably his Herries Chronicle series, set in the Lake District. He worked in Hollywood writing <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films in the 1930s, and played a cameo in the 1935 version of David Copperfield.|$|E
5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin {{inserted}} {{a new chapter}} VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and {{could not have been}} produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes {{on one side and the}} camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E
5|$|Tayutama {{was first}} {{released}} for Windows on July 11, 2008 in both limited and regular editions. The limited edition contained the game itself, a vocal collection CD, an official fan book, character portraits, {{and a phone}} strap; the regular edition did not contain the aforementioned extras. A fan disc of Tayutama, titled Tayutama: It's Happy Days, was released on May 29, 2009 in both limited and regular editions. The limited edition of It's Happy Days contained the game itself and a visual fan book with short summaries of the game's characters, illustrations, conception materials, and {{an interview with the}} game's development team. 5pb. released an Xbox 360 version of the original game on November 5, 2009. The Xbox 360 version contains remastered graphics, additional music, and additional <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> Nue, a supporting female character being promoted to a heroine. It was released in both limited and regular editions, and the limited edition contains the game itself, a phone strap, and a drama CD adaptation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E

5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the player assumes {{the role of}} Yukito Kunisaki and the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> the three heroines are {{available}} in {{what is called the}} Dream story arc. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ryūya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player. Upon the completion of the Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Air without the erotic content.|$|E
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> all five heroines and {{additional}} smaller scenarios {{are available in}} {{what is called the}} School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
5|$|With {{three weeks}} {{remaining}} {{in the regular season}} and two other Atlantic Division teams also with one loss, there were 120 possible <b>scenarios</b> <b>for</b> the four tied teams. On Nov.13, Florida State defeated Clemson 16–13, eliminating one of the four tied teams from contention for the divisional championship. The following week, Florida State defeated Maryland, 30–16, eliminating another contender. The divisional championship came down to the final week. Because Florida State was playing nonconference rival Florida, the division was decided by the matchup between NC State and Maryland. Hours after Florida State defeated Florida 31–7, NC State lost to Maryland, giving Florida State the Atlantic Division championship and a bid to the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
