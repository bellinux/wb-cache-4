50|$|In modern {{digital imaging}} systems and high-definition televisions, {{especially}} those that comply with <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standards</b> and practices, only square pixels are used for broadcast and display. However, some formats (ex., HDV, DVCPRO HD) use non-square pixels internally for image storage, {{as a way to}} reduce the amount of data that must be processed, thus limiting the necessary transfer rates and maintaining compatibility with existing interfaces.|$|R
50|$|An SDTV image {{outside the}} {{constraints}} of the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standards</b> requires no non-proportional scaling with 640 pixels (as defined by the adopted IBM VGA standard) for every line of the image. The display and pixel aspect ratio is generally not required with the line height defining the aspect. For widescreen 16:9, 360 lines define a widescreen image and for traditional 4:3, 480 lines define an image.|$|R

50|$|<b>SMPTE</b> <b>standard</b> ST2064, {{published}} in 2015, provides technology {{to reduce or}} eliminate lip-sync errors in digital television. The standard utilizes audio and video fingerprints taken from a television program. The fingerprints can be recovered and used to correct the accumulated lip-sync error.

(According to some reports, a mooted 750-line (720p) format (720 progressively scanned lines) was viewed by some at the ITU as an enhanced television format rather than a true HDTV format, and so was not included, although 1920×1080i and 1280×720p systems {{for a range of}} frame and field rates were defined by several US <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standards.)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternate}} form {{of color}} bars is the 100% Color Bars pattern, or RGB pattern (sometimes called full field bars), {{which consists of}} eight vertical bars of 100% intensity, and {{does not include the}} castellation or luminance patterns. Like the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standard</b> ("75%") pattern, the color order is white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue, but with an additional column of saturated black. This pattern is used to check peak color levels and color saturation as well as color alignment. The 100% pattern is not as common or as useful as the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standard</b> 75% pattern, but many pieces of test equipment generate both patterns, and can be selected to generate either one. Many professional cameras can be set to generate a 100% pattern for calibration to broadcast or recording equipment, especially in a multi-camera installation where all camera signals must match. There is another 75% pattern that consists of the same eight columns as the 100% pattern, but at 75% intensity. This pattern is very seldom used.|$|E
50|$|Although users {{loved the}} {{wider range of}} {{reproducible}} colors, those familiar with the SMPTE 240M specifications contacted Adobe, informing the company that it had copied the values that described idealized primaries, not actual standard ones. The real values were much closer to sRGB's, which avid Photoshop consumers did not enjoy as a working environment. To make matters worse, an engineer had made an error when copying the red primary chromaticity coordinates, resulting in an even more inaccurate representation of the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The NHK {{system was}} {{standardized}} in the United States as Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (<b>SMPTE)</b> <b>standard</b> #240M {{in the early}} 1990s, but abandoned later on when it {{was replaced by a}} DVB analog standard. HighVision video is still usable for HDTV video interchange, but there is almost no modern equipment available to perform this function. Attempts at implementing HighVision as a 6 MHz broadcast channel were mostly unsuccessful. All attempts at using this format for terrestrial TV transmission were abandoned by the mid-1990s.|$|E

5000|$|A 3:2 {{pattern is}} {{identical}} to the one shown above except that it is shifted by one frame. For instance, a cycle that starts with film frame B yields a 3:2 pattern: B-B-B-C-C-D-D-D-A-A or 3-2-3-2 or simply 3-2. In other words, there is no difference between the 2-3 and 3-2 patterns. In fact, the [...] "3-2" [...] notation is misleading because according to <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standards</b> for every four-frame film sequence the first frame is scanned twice, not three times.|$|R

50|$|SMPTE 367M, {{also known}} as SMPTE D-11, is the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>{{standard}}</b> for HDCAM. The standard specifies compression of high-definition digital video. D11 source picture rates can be 24, 24/1.001, 25 or 30/1.001 frames per second progressive scan, or 50 or 60/1.001 fields per second interlaced; compression yields output bit rates ranging from 112 to 140 Mbit/s. Each D11 source frame is composed of a luminance channel at 1920 x 1080 pixels and a chrominance channel at 960 x 1080 pixels. During compression, each frame's luminance channel is subsampled at 1440 x 1080, while the chrominance channel is subsampled at 480 x 1080.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Committee on Television Technology, Working Group on Studio Monitor Colorimetry, {{adopted the}} SMPTE C (Conrac) {{phosphors}} for general use in Recommended Practice 145, prompting many manufacturers {{to modify their}} camera designs to directly encode for SMPTE [...] "C" [...] colorimetry without color correction, as approved in <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standard</b> 170M, [...] "Composite Analog Video Signal — NTSC for Studio Applications" [...] (1994). As a consequence, the ATSC digital television standard states that for 480i signals, SMPTE [...] "C" [...] colorimetry should be assumed unless colorimetric data {{is included in the}} transport stream.|$|E
5000|$|The Case Research Lab {{sound system}} {{influenced}} many industry standards, such as {{location of the}} optical sound 20 frames {{in advance of the}} image it accompanies. [...] The current <b>SMPTE</b> <b>standard</b> for 35 mm sound film is +21 frames for optical, but a 46-foot theatre reduces this to +20 frames; this was originally done partly to ensure the film runs smoothly past the sound head, but also to ensure that no Phonofilm could again be played in theaters — the Phonofilm system being incompatible with Case Research Lab specifications — and also to ease the modification of projectors already widely in use.|$|E
25|$|Both the HD and SD serial {{interfaces}} provide for 16 channels of embedded audio. The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods— SD uses the <b>SMPTE</b> 272M <b>standard,</b> whereas HD uses the <b>SMPTE</b> 299M <b>standard.</b> In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48kHz, 24-bit audio channels {{along with the}} video. Typically, 48kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but extendable to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 digital audio interface. These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.|$|R
