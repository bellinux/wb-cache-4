40|$|Finland as {{a society}} is facing major {{challenges}} due to ageing and financial difficulties of municipalities. According to many authorities the Nordic welfare state has come to its end in Finland. Therefore, Finnish municipalities are forced to develop new methods to maintain the good quality of public services. In this paper, we argue that the most efficient method to achieve this {{is to develop a}} regional <b>service</b> <b>cluster,</b> which means radical changes {{in the role of the}} municipality. Instead of producing all the services themselves, municipalities should act as leaders of the regional <b>service</b> <b>cluster.</b> The leader role demands that municipalities concentrate on their core activity and create strategic partnership arrangements with private service providers to take care of the related support activities. So far, co-operation with private service providers has mostly been limited to purchasing without any common goal. Nonetheless, acting in network requires more strategic co-operation between the actors. Public sector actors should be responsible and control the whole network, for example creating it, finding partners and evaluating the outcome. The research includes the development process of the social and health care sector reform in P 4 ij 4 t-H 4 me province, Finland, a case which we analyze using the framework of the regional service sector. In this reform, the hospital district is transforming into a new organizational structure which includes all the services of social affairs and health. It is a pilot project in Finland. The purpose of the research study is to create concrete tools how to develop, govern and measure the impacts of regional <b>service</b> <b>cluster.</b> The main research questions are: - What kinds of ways of action and rules should the developer network pursue? - How democratic processes can be assured in the network service structure? - How municipalities' ownership is managed in the long run? - How the efficient development of human resources and services is taken care of in this network structure? - How the efficient management of the non-public service providers' network should be governed? The framework can be used in every occasion when municipalities are developing new ways of maintaining their responsibilities of organizing different services to their inhabitants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Rapid {{developments}} in network systems of business service {{have resulted in}} more reliance on distributed computing, typified by “subscriber/push ” architectures. Unfortunately, frequent and unexpectable network failures were routine, and downtime was not in hours, but in days. High availability {{has become the most}} important factor decreasing business risk and improving Quality of <b>Service.</b> <b>Cluster</b> technology has solved the non-stop problem on Local Area Network. However, most technologies including cluster today fail to ensure the non-stop Internet service based on Routers.

In this work, we modeled and developed a non-stop Internet service system based on a new quorum system...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of a}} decentralised, self-organising service-oriented {{architecture}} {{seems to be more}} and more plausible than the traditional registry-based ones in view {{of the success of the}} web and the reluctance in taking up web service technologies. Automatically clustering Web Service Description Language (WSDL) files on the web into functionally similar homogeneous service groups can be seen as a bootstrapping step for creating a service search engine and, at the same time, reducing the search space for service discovery. This paper proposes techniques to automatically gather, discover and integrate features related to a set of WSDL files and cluster them into naturally occurring service groups. Despite the lack of a common platform for assessing the performance of web <b>service</b> <b>cluster</b> discovery, our initial experiments using real-world WSDL files demonstrated the great potential of the proposed techniques...|$|E

Our design also supports the deployment of service clusters in multiple data centers through membership proxies which update membership information incrementally so that membership communication across data centers is minimized as much as possible. We compare our approach with other two alternatives: an all-to-all multicasting approach and a gossip based approach.

40|$|It has {{now been}} {{recognised}} that services {{play a vital role}} in advanced industrial economies. In most European Union (EU) member states service activities now provide around two-thirds of all jobs and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and even higher proportion of total firms.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} network elements in the Internet are the routers which do relaying of IP packets. Because of growth of the Internet routers currently experience serious problems in relaying traffic in a satisfying speed. The idea of switching Internet traffic flows has recently been introduced and a new technology called IP switching has emerged. Several differing technological solutions have been suggested. In this paper we describe and compare two methods in flow-based IP switching to make the decisions whether to switch internet traffic flows to separate ATM-connections. Traffic measurements are made in two networks of varying size and based on a specific three-stage flow analysis we suggest that the decision to switch should be made as flexible as possible due to the expected diversity of traffic profiles {{in different parts of the}} network. This way the optimal <b>service</b> <b>cluster</b> could be switched and router resources could be optimally utilized. A simple model to determine workload to an IP switch is introduced. Using this model we see that the workload of the flow setup component and the routing component may be optimized, if we use flexible methods to determine the flows that are to be separately switched...|$|E

Searching space can be reduced and responding flexibility will also be improved by adopting <b>service</b> <b>cluster</b> as the unit of service response. Simple evolution and merging evolution were put forward to handle the evolution of atomic Web services. Meanwhile, a formal model and the quality computing method for service processes built by service clusters were presented based on the logic Petri nets. Two types of evolution patterns including dot isomorphic evolution and chain isomorphic evolution were proposed to evolve service processes. The algorithms for different isomorphic evolution patterns of atomic service and service processes were designed in the paper. Simulation experiments were conducted on 10000 Web services with different process patterns. Compared with the traditional service request and response schema, the efficiencies of service discovery and isomorphic evolution are improved greatly in our proposed method...|$|E
