He resigned his seat in 1850 thorough the mechanism of accepting the <b>Stewardship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural environment, {{and its relationship}} to other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy within Chabad about Schneerson's will, as he named no successor. He did however write one legal will, which was signed before witnesses, whereby he transferred <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> major Chabad institutions {{as well as}} all his possessions to Agudas Chassidei Chabad.|$|R

5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's flora. Scottish Natural Heritage is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{important}} trees species and specimens; a Grand Fir in Argyll is the tallest tree in the United Kingdom and the Fortingall Yew may be the oldest tree in Europe. The Arran Whitebeams, Shetland Mouse-ear and Scottish Primrose are endemic flowering plants and there {{are a variety}} of endemic mosses and lichens. Conservation of the natural environment is well developed and various organisations play an important role in the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's flora. Numerous references to the country's flora appear in folklore, song and poetry.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Tiruvannamalai {{came under}} the {{dominion}} of the Nawab of the Carnatic. As the Mughal empire came to an end, the Nawab {{lost control of the}} town, with confusion and chaos ensuing after 1753. Subsequently, there were periods of both Hindu and Muslim <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple, with Muraru Raya, Krishna Raya, Mrithis Ali Khan, and Burkat Ullakhan besieging the temple in succession. As European incursions progressed, Tiruvannamalai was attacked by French Soupries, Sambrinet, and the English Captain Stephen Smith. While some were repelled, others were victorious. The French occupied the town in 1757 and it {{came under the}} control of the British in 1760. In 1790, Tiruvannamalai town was captured by Tippu Sultan, who ruled from 1750–99. During the first half of the 19th century, the town came under British rule.|$|E

40|$|Accountability is {{instrumental}} {{for ensuring}} that a trusting relationship exists between shareholders {{and management of}} corporations in order {{that there will be}} enhanced investor confidence. Towards this end, corporate governance measures are instituted to make the executives or management of business organizations accountable for their <b>stewardships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational resources or shareholders’ investments. It is against that backdrop that the Securities and Exchange Commission in Ghana has also developed a code on best practices on corporate governance. However, {{the extent to which the}} provisions in the code are consistent with the theoretical and empirical literature is unknown. This paper, therefore, sought to explore whether or not gaps exist between the corporate governance policy and practices in Ghana and extant literature. This paper achieves this by examining characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board as they exist in Ghana in relations to the literature. The characteristics examined in this paper include responsibilities, optimal size, independence, board composition, and audit and compensation committees of boards. Recommendations are made based on the literature to address gaps that exist. ...|$|R
