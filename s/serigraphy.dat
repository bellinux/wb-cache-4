She returned to acting in the late 1970s, appearing in several bit parts, including in Richard Benjamin's My Favorite Year (1982) and Wildcats (1986).|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Self Help {{began an}} [...] "Experimental Screenprint Atelier", a {{workshop}} in fine art <b>serigraphy.</b> <b>Serigraphy</b> was {{a technique that}} was more expensive and required greater expertise than the silkscreening. As such, it represented {{a departure from the}} Chicano sensibility of rasquachismo, or a humorous sense of pride in being able to make do with limited resources. Nonetheless, it gave artists greater latitude for individual expression, and created a higher-quality product, which resulted in greater prestige for both the artists and the center. The shift was also a means to concentrate the center's resources, which were becoming limited due to Reagan Administration-era cutbacks in social spending. The production of higher-quality works also opened up the possibility of funding Self Help activities through the sales of prints. Stephen Rose was the first master printer, Oscar Duardo the second, and José Alpuche the third and current.|$|E

[...] These stamps were printed by Cartor S.A., France using a special silk screen printing process known as <b>serigraphy.</b> It {{was the first time}} that this process was used to make a stamp. A sheetlet with stamp impression and a description of the event at the bottom was also released. The 500 copies printed were distributed to guests and dignitaries.|$|E

40|$|Producción CientíficaDisposable {{screen-printed}} sensors {{have been}} modified with enzymes {{and used to}} form a bioelectronic tongue dedicated to the discrimination between different grape varieties. The multisensory system combined <b>serigraphied</b> electrodes modified with carbon, platinum, gold, graphene, Prussian blue and nickel oxide nanoparticles (M-SPE) covered with glucose oxidase (M-GOX-SPE) or tyrosinase (M-Tyr-SPE). The M-GOX-SPE and M-Tyr-SPE sensors produced a variety of responses due to the different behavior of the electron mediators of the six screen-printed materials used for the electro-catalysis of the glucose and phenols by means of glucose oxidase and tyrosinase. This variety of responses, together with the capability of the sensors to detect glucose or phenols, allowed the bioelectronic tongue developed here to discriminate between the juices obtained from different varieties of grape. Partial least-squares (PLS- 1) multivariate calibration of electrochemical data has been successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of glucose and polyphenols in musts. The discrimination capability shown by this array of cheap and single-use sensors {{was similar to that}} found in other complex bioelectronic tongues. The lower price, ease of use and portability of the modified screen-printed electrode system makes the bioelectronic tongue developed here an alternative tool {{that can be used in}} situ in the vineyard block.

The first serigraphs produced by the studio were Eva Makk's [...] "Snowflakes" [...] and Americo Makk's [...] "Matching Strength." [...] The serigraphs of selected paintings were numbered and signed and were typically given runs of 100 to 275 editions. The Makks were presented with awards from Screen Printing Association International (SPAI) in 1991 for [...] "On Wings" [...] by Eva Makk, 1992 for [...] "High Camp" [...] by Americo Makk, 1993 [...] "Quartet" [...] by Eva Makk, and 1994 [...] "Rolling Clouds" [...] and [...] ""Silver with Gold" [...] both by Americo Makk.
