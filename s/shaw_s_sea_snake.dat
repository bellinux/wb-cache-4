The other freshwater <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> species is Laticauda crockeri.|$|R
50|$|Acalyptophis is a genus of <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> {{containing}} a single species, Acalyptophis peronii, {{commonly known as}} the spiny-headed seasnake, Peron's <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> or the horned <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> endemic to the western tropical Pacific Ocean. It is the only <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> with spines on the head. Like other members of the family, Hydrophiidae or Elapidae, it is venomous.|$|R
50|$|Hydrophis platurus, {{commonly}} known as the yellow-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> yellowbelly <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> or pelagic <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of snake from the subfamily Hydrophiinae (the <b>sea</b> <b>snakes)</b> found in tropical oceanic waters around the world, excluding the Atlantic Ocean. It was {{the only member of the}} genus Pelamis but recent molecular evidence suggests that it is more closely related to the species of the genus Hydrophis.|$|R
50|$|Hydrophis lapemoides is {{a species}} of snake in the family Elapidae known {{commonly}} as the Arabian Gulf <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> and Persian Gulf <b>sea</b> <b>snake.</b> This <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> is native to the Indian Ocean from the Persian Gulf to the coasts of Thailand.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors was the extreme rarity of this species. In {{more than a decade of}} local <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> research only 9 rough-scaled <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> have ever been found. Meanwhile the same researchers had encountered some 10,000 individuals of other <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> species in the same time period. Even if a rough-scaled <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> was nearby it would likely be difficult to see due to the low visibility of its murky habitat. The rough-scaled <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> had managed to avoid being serendipitously discovered by local fishermen trawling for prawns the way many other <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> species are commonly caught. This can likely be attributed to the snakes' preference for the shallow rocky waters of local estuaries that are not fished for prawns.|$|R

5000|$|Belcher's <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Hydrophis belcheri), {{which many}} times is mistakenly called the hook-nosed <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Enhydrina schistosa), has been erroneously popularized {{as the most}} venomous snake in the world, due to Ernst and Zug's {{published}} book Snakes in Question: The Smithsonian Answer Book from 1996.Associate Professor Bryan Grieg Fry, a prominent venom expert, has clarified the error: [...] "The hook-nosed myth was due to a fundamental error in a book called Snakes in Question. In there, all the toxicity testing results were lumped in together, regardless of the mode of testing (e.g. subcutaneous vs. intramuscular vs intravenous vs intraperitoneal). As the mode can influence the relative number, venoms can only be compared within a mode. Otherwise, it's apples and rocks." [...] Belcher's <b>sea</b> <b>snake's</b> actual LD50 (recorded only intramuscularly) is 0.24 mg/kg and 0.155 mg/kg, less lethal than other <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> such as the olive <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Aipysurus laevis) 0.09 mg/kg and the most toxic intramuscularly, recorded of the <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> - the black-banded robust <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Hydrophis melanosoma) 0.082 mg/kg. The black-banded robust <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> has also been tested subcutaneously registering at 0.111 mg/kg. {{more than four times}} less toxic than the inland taipan's venom. In the LD50 subcutaneous test it is actually Dubois' <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Aipysurus duboisii) which has the most toxic venom of any of the <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> tested, registering at 0.044 mg/kg. This is still nearly half as lethal as the inland taipan's venom.|$|R

40|$|Marine snakes of the {{subfamily}} Hydrophiinae are obligate ocean dwellers, {{unlike their}} amphibious counterparts, the sea kraits (Laticaudinae), {{and as such}} they are {{often referred to as}} ‘true 2 ̆ 7 <b>sea</b> <b>snakes.</b> This specialization means that the presence of a true <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> on a beach is atypical and likely indicates disease or injury. Traumatic injuries such as eye, jaw, and spinal lesions have been observed in stranded <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> and may present as acute injury or progress to chronic debilitation. Diseases, such as neoplasia, leukemia, and parasite overburden, have also been seen in wild <b>sea</b> <b>snakes,</b> and these animals may present similarly.

5000|$|The yellow-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> as {{the name}} implies, has a {{distinctive}} bicolor pattern with a yellow underbelly and brown back, making it easily distinguishable from other <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> species. Yellow-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>snakes,</b> like many other species of <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> are fully adapted to living their whole lives at sea: mating, eating and giving birth to live young (ovoviviparous). Adaptations to aquatic life include the reduced ventral scale size, laterally compressed body and paddle-tail for swimming, valved nostrils and palatine seal for excluding seawater, and cutaneous gas exchange for prolonging dive times. This species can uptake up to 33% of its oxygen requirements through the skin while diving and swimming at {{the surface of the}} water. <b>Sea</b> <b>snakes</b> also have a special salt gland located in the lower jaw that was formerly believed to filter out salt from the surrounding seawater [...] but has been found not to be used for that purpose, as <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> drink fresh water only.|$|R

40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>snake</b> {{envenomation}} is {{a serious}} occupational hazard in tropical waters. In Malaysia, the beaked <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Hydrophis schistosus, formerly known as Enhydrina schistosa) and the spine-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Hydrophis curtus, formerly known as Lapemis curtus or Lapemis hardwickii) are two commonly encountered species. Australian CSL <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> antivenom is the definitive treatment for <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> envenomation; it is unfortunately extremely costly locally and is not widely available or adequately stocked in local hospitals. This study investigated the cross-neutralizing potential of three regionally produced anti-cobra antivenoms against the venoms of Malaysian H. schistosus and H. curtus. All three antivenoms conferred paraspecific protection from <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> venom lethality in mice, with potency increasing in the following order: Taiwan bivalent antivenom < Thai monocled cobra monovalent antivenom < Thai neuro polyvalent antivenom (NPAV). NPAV demonstrated cross-neutralizing potencies of 0. 4 mg/vial for H. schistosus venom and 0. 8 mg/vial for H. curtus, which translates to a dose of less than 20 vials of NPAV to neutralize an average amount of <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> venom per bite (inferred from venom milking). The cross-neutralization activity was supported by ELISA cross-reactivity between NPAV and the venoms of H. schistosus (58. 4 %) and H. curtus (70. 4 %). These findings revealed the potential of NPAV as a second-line treatment for <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> envenomation in the region.
