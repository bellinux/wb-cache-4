Note: all quad VTRs have a procamp so as to obtain a standardized output from a recording. Ampex procamps were occasionally used to clean-up, hence to standardize network feeds.|$|R

40|$|Google {{maintains}} many servers and {{employs a}} file <b>level</b> <b>sync</b> method with applications {{running in a}} different parti-tion than the base Linux distribution that boots the machine and interacts with hardware. This experience report first gives insights on how the distribution is setup, and then tackles the problem of doing a difficult upgrade from a Red Hat 7. 1 image snapshot with layers of patches to a Debian Testing based distribution built from source. We will look at how this can actually be achieved as a live upgrade and without ending up with a long “flag day ” where many machines are running totally different distributions, which would have made testing and debugging of appli-cations disastrous during a long switchover period. Like a coworker of mine put it, “It was basically akin to upgrading Red Hat 7. 1 to Fedora Core 16, a totally unsup-ported and guaranteed to break upgrade, but also switching from rpm to dpkg in the process, and on live machines. ” The end of the paper summarizes how we designed our packaging system for the new distribution, {{as well as how}} we build each new full distribution image from scratch in a few minutes.
