One form of {{apparatus}} which I purpose having arranged, is to {{have several}} discs superposed; the discs are to be metallically connected, alternately at the edges and at the centres, by means of mercury; and are then to be revolved alternately in opposite directions, i.e. the first, third, fifth, &c. to the right hand, and the second, fourth, sixth, &c. to the left hand; the whole being placed so that the discs are perpendicular to the dip, or intersect most directly the magnetic curves of powerful magnets.

5000|$|Distribution - Vitaphone records {{had to be}} {{distributed}} along with film prints, and shipping the records required a whole infrastructure apart from the already-existing film distribution system. The records would start to suffer from audible wear after an estimated 20 playings (a check box system on the label was used to keep count) and were then supposed to be replaced with a fresh set. Damage and breakage were inherent dangers, so a spare <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> was usually kept on hand, further adding to the costs.|$|E

Chilled Euphoria is a great <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> for relaxation." [...] He concluded, [...] "if pure ambient is too relaxing, almost sedate for you, then Chilled Euphoria could quite possibly be the perfect disc for that late-night gathering with friends.

50|$|Setting up a {{sequence}} of cameras to photograph the movement of a subject as it progresses in locomotion originally created chronophotographs. This could be done via tripwire or electrically timed shutter release attached to each individual camera. The photographer then paired together {{a sequence}} of twelve different wet-plate photographic prints of the subject in motion. The subject could range from a running horse to a human descending stairs, or inanimate objects being thrown, launched, or falling. To overlap the phases of movement on a single plate, like the work of Marey and Demeny, a photographer would fix a single plate by using strips of celluloid for each separate, irregular image. Marey also later developed a device, shaped {{in the manner of}} a gun as its purpose was to photograph short sequences of the natural movement of birds during their flight, which took twelve successive photographs on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs.</b> The disc contained 12 openings around its circumference. In front of this disc was a second disc pierced with a slit. Pressing the trigger of the gun began a mechanism to rotate the discs. The disc carrying the 12 frames rotated 1/12 of a revolution while the disc carrying the shutter slit revolved once, so that each of the 12 openings appeared in turn behind the lens and was exposed through the slit. 3 When printed, it gave the same effect as his layering process. (Eventually, Marey was able to photograph on actual rolls of film and project the frames in sequence.) Depending on the purpose of the chronophotograph, it could later be affixed to any of several devices either to be displayed in motion or to compare phases of motion in layers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Let P be a Poisson {{process of}} {{intensity}} {{one in the}} infinite plane R 2. We surround each point x of P by the open disc of radius r centred at x. Now let Sn be a fixed disc of area n, and let Cr(n) be the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> which intersect Sn. Write E k r for the event that Cr(n) is a k-cover of Sn, and F kr for the event that Cr(n) may be partitioned into k disjoint single covers of Sn. We prove that P(E k r F kr) ≤ cklog n, and that this result is best possible. We also give improved estimates for P(Ekr). Finally, we study the obstructions to k-partitionability in more detail. As part of this study, we prove a classification theorem for (deterministic) covers of R 2 with half-planes that cannot be partitioned into two single covers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{precipitation}} hardening superalloy Haynes® 282 ® to be repaired by multi-pass {{gas tungsten arc welding}} is investigated in this study. The repair welding has been carried out on forged discs having four pre weld heat treatments, resulting in different grain sizes and precipitate structures of the base material. Another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> has additionally been put through a post weld heat treatment. The tendency to form cracks in the heat-affected zone and the fusion zone has been investigated metallographically. No cracks in the base metal heat-affected zone were found, whereas solidification cracks were present in the weld fusion zone of all tested conditions. While high heat input during welding increased cracking by a factor of 1. 5, none of the heat treatments had a measurable influence on the cracking behaviour. Voids with solid state crack-like appearance turned out to be aluminium-rich oxides being present from the deposition of previous weld deposit layers...|$|E

Trepreau and other authors gave sufficient conditions for M to be a manifold in a neighborhood of a given disc. We give conditions for M_q to be a manifold. When this conditions are satisfied {{we look at the}} map on M given by ϕ→ϕ(0), and we describe the image of its differential, (in particular we determine its dimension). We then do the same for the map ϕ→ϕ(- 1) on M_q. For example we find as a corollary that if S has only minimal points, then there exists an open dense subset Omega in M such that the restriction of the map ϕ→ϕ(0) to Ω is an open map with value in C^N. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{migration}} of small mass planets in 3 D radiative disks. Indeed, migration of small planets {{is known to be}} too fast inwards in locally isothermal conditions. However, thermal effects could reverse its direction, potentially saving planets in the inner, optically thick parts of the protoplanetary disc. This effect has been seen for masses larger than 5 Earth masses, but the minimum mass for this to happen has never been probed numerically, although it is of crucial importance for planet formation scenarios. We have extended the hydro-dynamical code FARGO to 3 D, with thermal diffusion. With this code, we perform simulations of embedded planets down to 2 Earth masses. For a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> parameters for which outward migration has been shown in the range of $[5, 35]$ Earth masses, we find that the transition to inward migration occurs for masses in the range $[3, 5]$ Earth masses. The transition appears to be due to an unexpected phenomenon: the formation of an asymmetric cold and dense finger of gas driven by circulation and libration streamlines. We recover this phenomenon in 2 D simulations where we control the cooling effects of the gas through a simple modeling of the energy equation. Comment: 17 pages, 20 figures, accepted.

40|$|On the 27 th of November 2011, in Bali, Indonesia, UNESCO {{approved}} the inscription of the Portuguese musical genre, fado on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Fundamental to the submission of fado to the UNESCO's committee - which was {{ratified by the}} Lisbon Municipality on the 12 th of May 2004 - was a particular collection of 78 rpm discs, recorded {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century that included recordings which were virtually forgotten for almost 50 years. This collection was “discovered” outside Portugal in 1993, by a Portuguese collector, and from the moment it was recognized as “Portuguese patrimony” by the official entities, it underwent a very interesting process of transformation according to the ways in which it was regarded by different agents and addressed by distinct discourses. Within this process of transformation – which can be seen as a conceptual metamorphosis -, are the voices and speeches of politicians, music collectors, scholars, journalists and fado singers (fadistas). This paper intends to analyze the historical process through which the collection of commercial recordings was “repatriated” and institutionalized in Portugal.
