40|$|Electroreceptors (ampullary organs) of the {{transparent}} catfish (Kryptopterus bicirrhus) {{lie in the}} epidermis, and contain <b>spherical</b> <b>receptor</b> cells that receive purely afferent innervation from the lateral line nerve. Section of this nerve causes rapid degenerative changes {{to occur in the}} receptors. Fine structural alterations occur in the receptor cell synapses and nerve fiber 6 â€“ 12 h postoperatively. Disruption of the receptor cells begins by 18 h and most are lost by 48 h. By 72 h supporting cells and secretory cells also show marked degeneration, and by 96 h they may be totally lost. The rapid degeneration of the electroreceptor organs of Kryptopterus should make them a useful preparation for analysis of neurotrophic functions...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic rate {{constants}} of binding {{were estimated}} for four biochemically relevant molecular systems by {{a method that}} uses milestoning theory to combine Brownian dynamics simulations with more detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The rate constants found using this method agreed well with experimentally and theoretically obtained values. We predicted the association rate of a small charged molecule toward both a charged and an uncharged <b>spherical</b> <b>receptor</b> and verified the estimated value with Smoluchowski theory. We also calculated the kon rate constant for superoxide dismutase with its natural substrate, O 2 -, in a validation of a previous experiment using similar methods but {{with a number of}} important improvements. We also calculated the kon for a new system: the N-terminal domain of Troponin C with its natural substrate Ca 2 +. The kon calculated for the latter two systems closely resemble experimentally obtained values. This novel multiscale approach is computationally cheaper and more parallelizable when compared to other methods of similar accuracy. We anticipate that this methodology will be useful for predicting kinetic rate constants and for understanding the process of binding between a small molecule and a protein receptor...|$|E
40|$|We {{determine}} the ligand current {{into a single}} <b>spherical</b> cell whose <b>receptors</b> become permanently blocked after binding ligands. Initially the cell is placed in a medium which contains ligands at uniform concentration. The analytical solution for the ligand distribution is obtained {{in terms of an}} integral over the solution at the cell surface. For the solution at the cell surface a nonlinear integral equation is derived which is solved numerically. We {{determine the}} time-dependent ligand current into the cell and the average number of free receptors in the cell surface as a function of tim...|$|R
