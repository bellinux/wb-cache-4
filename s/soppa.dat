A well-known example is the Dead Sea, where the possibility of massive development of microbial blooms is determined by the excessively high concentrations of mag-nesium and calcium and phosphate is the limiting inorganic nutrient, not only for the alga Dunaliella but also for the halophilic Archaea in blooms that occa-sionally develop in the lake when condi-tions become favorable (Oren, 1983). It is therefore not surprising that members of the Halobacteriaceae have developed mechanisms to use not only phosphate ions but other phosphorus sources as well.

40|$|Charge {{transfer}} excitations can {{be described}} within TD-DFT, not only by means of long-range corrected exchange functionals but also {{with a combination of}} wave function theory and TD-DFT based on range separation. The latter approach enables a rigorous formulation of multi-determinantal TD-DFT schemes where excitation classes, which are absent in conventional TD-DFT spectra (like for example double excitations), can be addressed. This paper investigates the combination of both the long-range MCSCF and <b>SOPPA</b> ansätze with a short-range DFT (srDFT) description. We find that the combinations of <b>SOPPA</b> or MCSCF with TD-DFT yield better results than could be expected from the pure wave function schemes. For the Time-Dependent MCSCF short-range DFT ansatz (TD-MC-srDFT) excitation energies calculated over a larger benchmark set of molecules with predominantly single reference character yield good agreement with their reference values, and are in general comparable to the long-range corrected functional CAM-B 3 LYP. The SOPPA-srDFT scheme is tested for a subset of molecules used for benchmarking TD-MC-srDFT and performs slightly better against the reference data for this small subset. Beyond the proof-of-principle calculations comprising {{the first part of this}} contribution, we additionally studied the low-lying singlet excited states (S 1 and S 2) of the retinal chromophore. The chromophore displays multireference character in the ground state and both excited states exhibit considerable double excitation character, which in turn cannot be described within standard TD-DFT, due to the adiabatic approximation. However, a TD-MC-srDFT approach can account for the multireference character, and excitation energies are obtained with accuracy comparable to CASPT 2, although using a much smaller active space.

This coupling constant exhibits a strong dependence on the C-C and C-F distances, and its small positive value results from a sensitive balance of paramagnetic spin-orbit (PSO) and spin-dipole (SD) terms. The three other unique FCCF coupling constants 1 J(C-C), 1 J(C-F), and 2 J(C-F) have also been reported and compared with experimental data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{establish}} whether the so called “soup trilogy”, med en burk <b>soppa</b> (2001), konservöppnare bok (2003) and på burklös mark (2005), written by Swedish-speaking Finn Stefan Hammarén is to be considered as surrealism or not. The methods used to determinate this is close reading, a technique used for finding a text’s distinguishable traits, and comparative analysis. First of all, the criteria of surrealist literature found in André Breton’s (1896 - 1966) Surrealist Manifesto, and other sources, {{as well as the}} criteria for the surrealist literary technique cut-up are presented and evaluated accordingly. Secondly, close reading is applied on one page from each volume in Hammarén’s trilogy and the results are presented together with an attempt to interpret the meaning of the analyzed texts, as well as a short introduction to each book. The results from the close readings are then compared with the evaluated criteria of surrealist literature in an attempt to understand whether Hammarén’s “soup trilogy” is to be considered as surrealism. Reading Hammarén’s trilogy can surely feel as a surreal experience and it is understandable why some people would assume that it therefore is surrealism. However, since the presented criteria of surrealist literature is more focused on the source of creativity, the process of blending the conscious self and the unconscious self with the intent of removing any kind of self censorship, it is nearly impossible to make any assumptions on whether Hammarén’s trilogy is to be considered as surrealism simply by studying the end result of his writing. Even though the results suggest that any surrealist techniques are highly unlikely to have been used in the creation of Hammarén’s trilogy one would need to either interview Hammarén himself, or study his creative process in detail, to answer the essay’s question more thoroughly...|$|E

The mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown. In this study, we report the influence of UN on excitation-contraction coupling, Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR) in particular, and transverse (t) -tubule structure. UN was induced in male Lewis rat hearts by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from the transplanted hearts after 4 wk and studied using whole-cell patch clamping, confocal microscopy, and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Recipient hearts were used as control (C). UN reduced the volume of cardiomyocytes by 56. 5 % compared with C (UN, n= 90; C, n= 59; P< 0. 001).

Confocal studies showed irregular distribution of the t tubules (power of the normal t-tubule frequency: UN 8. 13 ± 1. 12 × 105, n= 57 vs. C 20. 60 ± 3. 174 × 105, n= 56; P< 0. 001) and SICM studies revealed a profound disruption to the openings of the t tubules and the cell surface in unloaded cardiomyocytes. We show that UN leads to a functional uncoupling of the CICR process and identify disruption of the t-tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum interaction as a possible mechanism. —Ibrahim, M., Al Masri, A., Navaratnarajah, M., Siedlecka, U., <b>Soppa,</b> G.

40|$|The {{transition}} from balanced growth to the stationary phase induces {{changes in the}} morphology and physiology of most bacteria {{with the aim of}} preparing the cells to withstand unfavorable conditions (Nystrom, 2004; Siegele and Kolter, 1992). In Archaea, the third domain of life, many species are extremophiles, meaning that they have adapted their physiology to optimally live in environments with conditions that are lethal for most life forms. The effect of the growth stage in archaeal physiology has been investigated to a limited extent (Lange et al., 2007) and may reveal conserved as well as novel strategies of adaptation. The accurate regulation of gene expression is essential in all living cells for the adaptation to different environmental conditions (<b>Soppa,</b> 2006). In the haloarchaea (optimum growth at ＞ 2 M NaCl) growth phase-dependent gene expression has been investigated through genomewide analysis of transcription and/or translation in the neutrophilic species Haloferax volcanii and Halobacterium salinarum (Facciotti et al., 2010; Lange et al., 2007). These studies showed that a signifi cant fraction of genes were subjected to differential transcriptional and/or translational control; however, neither the fractions nor the identity of the regulated genes were conserved between these archaea.

40|$|Our {{team has}} {{expertise}} in ocean optics in situ measurements {{and the development}} of algorithms to derive phytoplankton characteristics from satellite ocean colour. Since 2007 we participated in 13 Atlantic and Pacific cruises to acquire bio-optical in-situ measurements. These data are used to extract information on phytoplankton composition (Taylor et al. 2011, Zindler et al. 2012, Taylor et al. 2013), but also for validation and parameterization of radiative transfer models and satellite retrievals (Sadeghi et al. 2012). Particularly, we have specialized on evaluating specifically ocean colour algorithms in the polar oceans (Cherkasheva et al. 2013, Cherkasheva et al. revised at JMS, <b>Soppa</b> et al. 2013). For the Sentinel- 3 validation campaign our objective is to validate ocean color level- 2 products of OLCI with in-situ measurements. We want to validate chlorophyll conc., water leaving radiances or remote sensing reflectances, Kd 490, absorption coefficients (phytoplankton, CDOM), POC conc. and PAR with data from the below stated in-situ measurements obtained during various campaigns. Most of our validation campaigns within early operation of Sentinel- 3 OLCI will focus on the high latitudes (at 60 °N-> 80 °N and 45 ° to 70 °S; funding secured for three RV POLARSTERN cruises in 2015 - 2016), but we will also sample at a coastal site at the Costa Brava, Alfacs Bay, Spain (with a local boat and from a raft) and in the Peruvian upwelling (with RV SONNE-II Jul-Aug 2015). Specifically the following parameters will be measured either continuously throughout the campaigns or at specific stations only at surface or in the whole profile: Apparent optical properties from radiometers (TRIOS RAMSES) deployed above and in-water; inherent optical properties from absorption (determined for CDOM, particulate, phytoplankton, total separately) measurements from water samples at stations and continuous attenuation and total absorption measurements during a transect at the surface and at stations in the profile or with TRIOS VIPER or ACS (WET labs); phytoplankton pigment conc. determined with HPLC and particulate organic carbon conc. with C/N Analyzer determined at water samples as mentioned above. In the presentation we will give an overview of our previous ocean colour validation work and give an overview on the planned validation campaigns for OLCI. We will also present the PANGAEA data base where so far all our published in situ data were uploaded. ...|$|E
