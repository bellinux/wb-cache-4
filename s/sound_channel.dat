5|$|A 3D Classics {{remake of}} Kid Icarus was {{published}} for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The remake features stereoscopic 3D along with updated graphics including backgrounds, which the original lacked. It also {{uses the same}} save system as the Family Computer Disk System version does, {{as opposed to the}} Password system from the NES version. The 3D Classics version also utilizes the Family Computer Disk System's music and sound effects (utilizing the extra <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> not available in the NES version).|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{version was}} imported by Bergsala AB into Scandinavian countries {{in small amounts}} and was re-titled Mr. Gimmick. It was released on 19 May 1993. Unlike its Japanese counterpart, this version features nine lives instead of four to counter the game's extreme difficulty. The game also contains downgraded music {{due to the lack}} of an expanded <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> chip. Since the European cartridge is encoded for PAL region, the game will not work properly on a North American NTSC NES due to graphical glitches, but an identical NTSC prototype ROM has been leaked online which functions properly.|$|E
500|$|Based near Riga at {{the time}} of the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Kirov was trapped in the Gulf of Riga by the rapid enemy advance. She {{supported}} minelaying sorties by Soviet destroyers in the western half of the Irben Strait on the evenings of 24–25 and 26–27 June. Off-loading her fuel and ammunition to reduce her draft, she passed through the shallow Moon <b>Sound</b> <b>Channel</b> (between Muhu island and the Estonian mainland) with great difficulty, and managed to reach Tallinn by the end of June. Kirov provided gunfire support during the defense of Tallinn and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from Tallinn to Leningrad at the end of August 1941. For most of the rest of the war she was blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad. She was damaged by a number of German air and artillery attacks, most seriously on 4–5 April 1942 when she was hit by three bombs and one [...] shell that damaged all six 100mm AA guns, the aft funnel, the mainmast, and killed 86 sailors and wounded 46. Repairs took two months during which her catapult was removed; a lighter pole mainmast was fitted and her anti-aircraft armament increased. After Leningrad was liberated in early 1944, Kirov remained there, and took no further part in the war except to provide gunfire support for the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid–1944.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first of}} these were basic systems with poor {{performance}} developed by Electro-Voice (EV-4/Stereo-4) and Dynaco (Dynaquad (DY)). A so-called matrix format, it utilized four <b>sound</b> <b>channels</b> which were [...] "encoded" [...] into two stereo album tracks.

500|$|In February 1986, Nintendo {{released}} {{the game as}} the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, all the text was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that {{was not included in}} the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, [...] "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons. The cartridge version made use of the Memory Management Controller chip, specifically the MMC1 model. The MMC could use bank-switching, allowing larger games than had been previously possible. They also allowed for battery-powered RAM, which let players save progress for the first time on any cartridge-based system or game.|$|E

50|$|The VRC6 (Virtual Rom Controller) is an {{advanced}} MMC chip from Konami, supporting bank switching for both program code and graphics {{as well as}} a CPU cycle-based IRQ counter, which can also act as a scanline counter. The chip also contains support for three extra <b>sound</b> <b>channels</b> (two square waves of eight duty cycles each, and one sawtooth wave). It is used in Akumajō Densetsu (the Japanese version of Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse), while the Western version uses the MMC5 from Nintendo. Since the Nintendo Entertainment System does not allow cartridges to add additional <b>sound</b> <b>channels,</b> the Famicom version's soundtrack was reworked to follow those specifications; thus, the soundtrack on the Western version is implemented by the five <b>sound</b> <b>channels</b> built into the stock NES.|$|R
2500|$|If Flight 370 had {{impacted}} {{the ocean}} hard, resulting underwater sounds {{could have been}} detected by hydrophones, given favourable circumstances. Sound waves can travel long distances in the ocean, but sounds that travel best {{are those that are}} reflected into the 'deep sound channel' usually found between 600–1,200m beneath the surface. Most of the sound generated by an aircraft impacting the ocean would travel straight down to the seabed, making it unlikely that any of these sounds would be reflected into the deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> unless the seabed sloped. Sounds from pieces of the aircraft imploding at depth {{would be more likely to}} travel in the deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] "The combination of circumstances necessary to allow [...] would have to be very particular", according to Mark Prior, a seismic-acoustic specialist at the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), who also explains that [...] "given the continuing uncertainty regarding the fate of MH370, underwater acoustic data still has the possibility of adding something to the search." [...] When an Airbus A330 hit the Atlantic Ocean at speed of , no data relating to the impact was detected in hydroacoustic recordings, even when analysed after the location of that aircraft was known. As with the analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data, the hydroacoustic analysis uses the data in a way very different from that originally intended.|$|E

50|$|Project Mogul was {{conceived}} by Maurice Ewing who had earlier researched the deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> {{in the oceans}} and theorized that a similar <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> existed in the upper atmosphere: a certain height where the air pressure and temperature result in minimal speed of sound, so that sound waves would propagate and stay in that channel due to refraction. The project involved arrays of balloons carrying disc microphones and radio transmitters to relay the signals to the ground. It was supervised by James Peoples, who was assisted by Albert P. Crary.|$|E

5000|$|The SOFAR channel (short for Sound Fixing and Ranging channel), or deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> (DSC), is a {{horizontal}} layer {{of water in}} the ocean at which depth the speed of sound is at its minimum. The SOFAR channel acts as a waveguide for sound, and low frequency sound waves within the channel may travel thousands of miles before dissipating. [...] This phenomenon {{is an important factor in}} submarine warfare. The deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> was discovered and described independently by Maurice Ewing, Stanley Wong and Leonid Brekhovskikh in the 1940s.|$|E

50|$|In oceanography, a sofar bomb (Sound Fixing And Ranging bomb), {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as a sofar disc, is a long-range position-fixing system that uses explosive sounds in the deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> of the ocean to enable pinpointing of the location of ships or crashed planes. The deep <b>sound</b> <b>channel</b> is ideal for the device, as the minimum speed of sound at that depth improves the signal's traveling ability. A position is determined from the differences in arrival times at receiving stations of known geographic locations. The useful range from the signal sources to the receiver can exceed 3000 mi.|$|E
