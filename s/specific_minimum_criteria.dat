40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the number and types of chairs available for patient use; to establish <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> of appropriate chairs; and to assess the suitability of available chairs to seat patients admitted to medical wards. Methods: Audit of chairs available in medical wards in a tertiary referral public hospital was conducted. All chairs relevant to patient use were photographed and counted. An expert panel determined <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> of appropriate seating for older patients from functional, occupational health and safety, ergonomic, infection control and usability view points. Numbers of chairs meeting the <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> level was recorded and was expressed {{as a percentage of}} the number of required chairs (hospitalized patients able to be sat out of bed). Results: A total of 270 chairs with 36 different types identified. The majority, 231 (85 %) chairs, did not meet the <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria.</b> Thirty-nine chairs met the <b>minimum</b> <b>criteria</b> for patients to sit in. 113 (66 %) patients were unable to sit out bed. Conclusion: This study identified that there were insufficient appropriate chairs available for patients to sit out of bed in this facility. This has potential implications for functional ability of the patients, particularly for the older person. Griffith Health, School of Rehabilitation SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Tang and Xu [Biometrika 101 (2014) 333 - 350] {{applied the}} <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> to {{selecting}} optimal designs for screening quantitative factors. They provided a statistical justification showing that <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> minimizes contamination of nonnegligible kth-order {{effects on the}} estimation of linear effects for k= 2, [...] .,r, where r is {{the strength of a}} design. Unfortunately, this result does not hold for k>r. In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical connection between β-wordlength patterns and contaminations (on the estimation of linear effects) and reveal that the <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> is not necessarily equivalent to the <b>minimum</b> contamination <b>criterion</b> for ranking designs. We prove that they are equivalent only when the number of factors of a design equals the strength plus one. We emphasize that the <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion,</b> in fact, sequentially minimizes the contamination of nonnegligible kth-order effects on the estimation of the general mean, not on the estimation of linear effects. Therefore, the <b>minimum</b> contamination <b>criterion</b> should be more appropriate than the <b>minimum</b> β-aberration <b>criterion</b> for selecting optimal designs for screening quantitative factors...|$|R
