2500|$|Luchadores are {{traditionally}} more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the United States, who more often rely on power and hard strikes to subdue their opponents. The difference in styles {{is due to}} the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that luchadores in the cruiserweight division (peso semicompleto) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Luchadores execute characteristic high flying attacks by using the wrestling ring's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds. Rings used in lucha libre generally lack the <b>spring</b> <b>supports</b> added to U.S. and Japanese rings; as a result, lucha libre does not emphasize the [...] "flat back" [...] bumping style of other professional wrestling styles. For this same reason, aerial maneuvers are almost always performed to opponents outside the ring, allowing the luchador to break his fall with an acrobatic tumble.|$|E
2500|$|As in a coil-spring {{suspension}} design, the FRP mono-leaf <b>spring</b> <b>supports</b> {{the weight}} of the vehicle. However, the FRP leaf springs differ from steel coils and traditional steel multi-leaf springs in a number of significant ways. The FRP plastic springs have 4.3–5.5 times the strain energy storage per weight, compared to steel. This results in a lighter spring for a given application. The single FRP mono-leaf front spring used on the fourth-generation Corvette is 33percent of {{the weight of}} an equivalent set of coil springs. Comparing FRP to conventional steel leaf springs in similar applications, the weight saved is even greater. The third-generation Corvette offered an optional FRP mono-leaf spring {{as an alternative to the}} standard multi-leaf steel spring, the [...] steel spring being replaced by a [...] FRP spring. Volvo claims a weight savings of [...] by using a FRP spring in the rear suspension of its second-generation XC90, compared to designs using coil springs. In addition to the reduction in vehicle weight, {{the weight of the}} spring is partly unsprung mass.|$|E

The spring is compressed by weight W to the operating position of the isolator, as shown in Figure 1. The stiffness of the isolator is K=KS-KN where KS is the spring stiffness and KN is the magnitude of a negative-stiffness which {{is a function of}} the length of the bars and the load P.

50|$|The {{honeycomb}} structure reduces bending {{due to the}} breadboard's own weight, {{so it can be}} tilted and forces applied via the soft <b>spring</b> <b>supports</b> accelerate the table as a whole without misalignment. Breadboards can therefore be used in mobile applications, such as on airplanes. Also, one can bolt a breadboard onto an optical table, build up a module of the experiment on it, and then transfer the module as a whole onto another table without the need to realign the components on the breadboard. Similarly, custom-built optical devices are assembled and aligned on breadboards, which are then enclosed in a case and shipped to the customer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{quenching}} problem of electromagnetic vibration of the inverter motor stator. The iron stator of the inverter motor is modeled by a perfect circular ring. Single or two <b>spring</b> <b>supports</b> are set on the circular ring to quench the forced vibration caused by the rotating distributed electromagnetic force. Moreover, single or two Houde dampers are installed {{on the outside of}} the circular ring. The solutions of forced vibration are obtained by the theoretical analysis. The following were made clear; (1) By setting single or two <b>spring</b> <b>supports</b> with 10 percent spring constant of the mode to be quenched on the stator, the resonant amplitude of the stator decreases to one half. When two <b>spring</b> <b>supports</b> are used, the best setting positions are those that make the angle between loops of the mode to be quenched. (2) By setting not only single spring support on the stator but also setting two Houde dampers in the suitable positions, those exist several ones depending on the position of spring support, the vibration of motor stator is quenched over wide frequency region around resonance.
