5|$|Severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic {{damage and}} {{flooding}} from Lake Okeechobee {{that prompted the}} Army Corps of Engineers to build a dike around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout <b>southern</b> <b>Florida.</b> Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and <b>Southern</b> <b>Florida</b> Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.|$|E

5|$|As the {{precursor}} tropical disturbance crossed <b>southern</b> <b>Florida,</b> it dropped light rainfall of over 1 inch (25 mm) in the Miami area. Later, as a developing tropical depression, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern Louisiana; one station near Galliano reported over 3 inches (76 mm) of precipitation. Hurricane Anita produced a storm tide of 2 feet (0.6 m) above normal in Grand Isle, {{which resulted in}} hundreds of families being asked to leave their homes.|$|E
5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby to {{pass through}} the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, with one computer model predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area.

Debby dissipates before hitting the area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across <b>southern</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beginning on September7, {{hurricane}} watches {{were put}} in place for the Florida coast from Key West to Melbourne. The next day, the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from Key West to Key Largo, with hurricane watches raised on the west coast northward to Fort Myers, and gale warnings issued from Key Largo to Vero Beach. By September11, hurricane warnings were in effect for <b>southern</b> <b>Florida</b> from Daytona Beach on the east coast to Cedar Key on the west coast, including Lake Okeechobee. Gale warnings were in place northward from Cedar Key to St. Marks, as well as from Daytona Beach northward to Savannah, Georgia. Evacuations in the Florida Keys disrupted traffic along the Overseas Highway. The Air Force evacuated 90Boeing B-47 Stratojets from Homestead Air Reserve Base. At Cape Canaveral, the threat of the storm caused the launching of two missiles to be postponed. Most flights out of Miami International Airport were canceled during the storm's approach. Officials closed schools in Miami and the Florida Keys, and recommended residents in low-lying areas of the Florida Keys and southwestern Florida to evacuate. Ultimately, about 12,000people in <b>southern</b> <b>Florida</b> sought refuge in storm shelters, two of which were damaged during the storm. In Miami-Dade County alone, there were 77storm shelters housing 10,000people.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to <b>Southern</b> <b>Florida</b> as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
