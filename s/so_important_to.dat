5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E
5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Joseph identified himself for other reasons.

The crew was also supposed to follow a very strict procedure while preparing the practice HTP torpedo for firing.|$|E
25|$|Jobs agreed, and Rubinstein {{assembled}} and managed {{a team of}} hardware and software engineers to ready the product on a rushed, eight-month schedule. The team’s engineers needed to overcome a number of hurdles, including {{figuring out how to}} play music off a spinning hard drive for more than 10 hours without wiping out a battery charge. Rubinstein’s production contacts proved invaluable, too; the iPod’s sleek, minimalist design, with its high-gloss, engraveable metal back, was a mass-manufacturing triumph. The success of the first-generation iPod was almost overnight. By 2004 the business became <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Apple that the iPod was spun off into its own division, which Rubinstein took over.|$|E

Her feedback became <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> him that, after the critics lambasted his Fifth Symphony, she provided him with the support to persevere with his composing. Von Meck died believing these letters had all been destroyed. However, when Tchaikovsky received her request to do so, he assured her that he had destroyed them, but then filed that letter with all the rest for posterity to find.|$|E

25|$|Although Pullen {{was able}} {{to play the piano}} in almost any style, the {{attribute}} that had made his contributions <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the wide-ranging music of Mingus was his ability to place extremely precise singing runs or glissandi over heavy chords, reminiscent of traditional blues, while never losing contact with the melodic line. His technique for creating these runs, where he seemed to roll his right hand over and over along the keys, received much comment from critics, was studied by pianists, and heavily filmed and investigated, but could never be totally explained, even by Pullen, who had developed it. His piano technique can be seen on the DVDs Mingus At Montreux 1975 and Roots Salutes The Saxophones.|$|E

The house sits in the Ponce Historic Zone.

25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's Dis Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E

25|$|While {{the art of}} wine making {{reached the}} Hellenic {{peninsula}} by about 2000 BC, the first alcoholic beverage to obtain widespread popularity {{in what is now}} Greece was mead, a fermented beverage made from honey and water. However, by 1700 BC, wine making was commonplace. During the next thousand years wine drinking assumed the same function so commonly found around the world: It was incorporated into religious rituals. It became important in hospitality, used for medicinal purposes, and became an integral part of daily meals. As a beverage, it was drunk in many ways: warm and chilled, pure and mixed with water, plain and spiced. Alcohol, specifically wine, was considered <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the Greeks that consumption was considered a defining characteristic of the Hellenic culture between their society {{and the rest of the}} world; those who did not drink were considered barbarians.|$|E
25|$|A Japanese {{animated}} {{television series}} named Ninja Scroll: The Series aired in Japan in 2003 {{and ran for}} 13 episodes. The series is a stand-alone sequel to the film; however, many references {{suggest that it is}} indeed a continuation. In the series, Jubei gets {{caught in the middle of}} a battle between the Kimon clan and the Hiruko clan. He meets up with the Light Maiden Shigure, a young lady whose village was destroyed by the Kimon clan and whom Jubei was charged with delivering a Dragon Stone to. The duo are joined by Tsubute (a young thief) and Dakuan (Tokugawa shogunate spy), and together they try to find out why both the Kimon and the Hiruko clan are after her and why the Dragon Stone she carries is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> them.

25|$|Yom Kippur is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance is expected of every Jewish man or woman above the age of bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the Torah (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do eat on this day are encouraged to eat as little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur {{is considered}} more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.|$|E
