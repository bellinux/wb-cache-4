5|$|We were {{informed}} of {{the prospect of a}} shortening in food rations. 300 grams of meat or sausage per week. Once the Führer asserted he had the right to require sacrifices because he himself was ready to accept any personal sacrifice.

5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E
5|$|Marta {{continues}} {{running in}} the direction she believes will lead back to Pleasant Valley, swimming across Middle Fork River, crossing the nearby highway and railroad tracks, and running through various woodlands in between. Pausing only to drink water and tend her paws, she crosses Pyramid Peak and swims across the Hungry Horse Reservoir, before a week without food and exhaustion cause her to collapse on the shore. After resting, she continues her run, though hunger now spurs her to pause to hunt when she can but she eventually collapses by Flathead Lake, where she remains unconscious for days. Meanwhile, unskilled at hunting and without the adults {{to teach them how}} to survive, Annie and Sula slowly <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death. Oldtooth reaches Middle Fork Valley, where illness and his lame foot drive him to hunt local livestock. He is shot and killed by a human.|$|E

5|$|Several emu {{specimens}} {{belonging to}} the different subspecies were sent to France, both live and dead, {{as part of the}} expedition. Some of these exist in European museums today. Le Naturaliste brought one live specimen and one skin of the mainland emu to France in June 1803. Le Géographe collected emus from both King and Kangaroo Island, and at least two live King Island individuals, assumed to be a male and female by some sources, were taken to France in March 1804. This ship also brought skins of five juveniles collected from different islands. Two of these skins, of which the provenance is unknown, are presently kept in Paris and Turin; the rest are lost. In addition to rats, cockroaches, and other inconveniences aboard the ships, the emus were incommoded by the rough weather which caused the ships to shake violently; some died as a result, while others had to be force fed so they did not <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death. In all, Le Géographe brought 73 live animals of various species back to France.|$|E

The U.S. also covered up genocide of East Ukraine in 1932-1933, that killed between 4 and 6 millions of Ukrainians {{and in the midst}} of it established a diplomatic relationship with the USSR.

25|$|February 10 - After {{losing the}} eastern part of Cuba to the revolutionaries and {{witnessing}} the outbreak of insurrection in the western provinces, Spanish Army General Arsenio Martínez-Campos y Antón is replaced as Governor of Cuba by General Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí. Weyler begins a policy of recontratación ("reconcentration"), in which the people in rebel-held areas are rounded up and placed in concentration camps. Weyler brings with him more than 200,000 Spanish Army troops, and organizes 50,000 peninsulars and Cubans into a pro-Spanish militia. About 400,000 people are placed in concentration camps with little provision made for food, housing, clothing, sanitation, and medical care, and the local economy collapses in areas where the camps are created. Tens of thousands of Cubans <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death or die from disease.|$|E
25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% wheat bran while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed oyster shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will lose {{more than one-third of}} their weight before they <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|E

25|$|He {{lived with}} his mother in Mecca for three years until she took him to Yathrib to visit some {{relatives}} (uncles from the mother side), and she died on the way back. Now orphaned, Muhammad, aged 6, was passed into the custody of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, who was eighty years old. According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died. Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians who took care of the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca. Although Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death, it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time.|$|E
25|$|BC {{was perhaps}} the hardest Canadian {{province}} hit by the depression. Although Vancouver managed to stave off bankruptcy, other cities in the Lower Mainland were not so lucky, such as North Vancouver and Burnaby. Vancouver also {{happened to be the}} target destination for thousands of transients – unemployed young men – who traveled across Canada looking for work, often by hopping on boxcars. This {{was the end of the}} line and had for years been a “Mecca of the Unemployed” because, as some cynically joked, it was the only city in Canada where you could <b>starve</b> <b>to</b> death before freezing to death. “Hobo jungles” sprouted up in the earliest days of the depression, where men built makeshift shanty towns out of whatever they could find (or steal). The largest of these was shut down allegedly for being unsanitary. Vancouver was also the launching pad for the Communist-led unemployed protests that frequented the city throughout the decade, culminating in the relief camp strike and the On-to-Ottawa Trek in 1935. Communist agitators and their supporters also led strikes in other industries, most notably the 1935 waterfront strike, and organized a large proportion of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion from Vancouver to fight fascism in the Spanish Civil War as Canada’s (unofficial) contribution to the International Brigades.|$|E
