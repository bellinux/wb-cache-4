5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the game in Spain, modifications to the traditional rules have appeared regionally, creating variations.

Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, {{the beginning of the}} 800m. <b>Similar</b> <b>rules</b> apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.|$|E

5|$|Tute {{originated}} in Italy. The game {{belongs to the}} same family as Brisca and has <b>similar</b> <b>rules</b> in gameplay and final count of points. The {{name of the game}} originated from the Italian word Tutti (all), the declaration that a player announces when holding the four kings. The game spread to Spain during the 19th century, brought back by Spanish troops who returned from missions in Italy. As the popularity of the game increased, its name was modified over time by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game {{became one of the most}} popular in Spain, leading to the later appearance of regional variations of the game.|$|E
