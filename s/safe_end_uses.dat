40|$|AbstractDissimilar metal {{welded joints}} {{are used in}} primary water systems of {{pressurized}} water reactor in nuclear power plant. They are mainly used to connect the ferritic steel pipe-nozzles of the pressure vessels such as reactor pressure vessels, steam generators and pressurizers with the austenitic stainless steel <b>safe</b> <b>end.</b> Thus, maintaining integrity of such joints is critical to ensure their safe service. As local wall thinning may probably appear at <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> to due to erosion and corrosion, assessment methods with local wall thinning are urgently needed. In this paper, three-dimensional finite element analysis models with and without considering local wall thinning were built for dissimilar metal welded joints connected the <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> to pipe-nozzle of the reactor pressure vessel. A detailed analysis {{has been carried out}} to the limit load research of this structure. Results show that the bending load is the main factor influencing the stress distribution change and limit load. According to finite element results, the depth of local wall thinning should be the most important factor influencing limit load solution, while circumferential local wall thinning shows very small variation. Based on the finite element results prediction equations of limit loads for <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> with local wall thinning have been proposed...|$|R

From 1998 to 2010, ten outbreaks implicated undercooked not-ready-to-eat entrées. In each outbreak, affected individuals prepared entrées in a microwave oven, did not follow recommended cooking instructions, and failed to take the internal temperature of the cooked product. This dissertation surveyed grocery stores for product availability, evaluated consumers’ preparation practices of raw, breaded, frozen chicken entrées, and validated on-package label instructions. The survey of retail revealed that several manufacturers fail to provide consumers clear preparation instructions. A video capture system was used to observe food preparation practices of 41 consumers– 21 primary meal preparers and 20 adolescents–in a mock domestic kitchen using uncooked, frozen, breaded chicken products, and determined if differences exist between consumers’ reported safe food handling practices and actual food handling behavior as prescribed on product labels. Differences between self-report and observed food safety behaviors were identified between groups. Many participants reported owning a food thermometer (73 percent) and reported using one when cooking raw, breaded chicken entrées (19. 5 percent); however, only five participants (12. 2 percent) were observed measuring the final internal temperature with a food thermometer despite instructions on the product packaging to do so. Food handling errors identified during the meal preparation sessions were then mimicked in a controlled laboratory setting to determine the impact of such deviations on end-product temperature. For all products, highly variable internal temperatures were recorded across entrées when prepared in a 600 W microwave oven. Microwave cooking of raw breaded poultry products is unpredictable in achieving uniform target end-point temperatures; however, a 1000 W microwave oven consistently produced a <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> product. Data collected through direct observation more accurately reflected consumer food handling behaviors than data collected through self-reported surveys. Low wattage microwave ovens failed to produce a <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> product. Processors should validate instructions for not-ready-eat entrées using a range of microwave ovens rather than a single wattage, develop a unique set of instructions for entrées, and provide consumers clear cooking instructions that result in a <b>safe</b> <b>end</b> product...|$|R

The analysis of <b>end</b> <b>use</b> data can reveal the predictors of water demand for different <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> (for example, household demographics, washing machine efficiency), thus enabling the government and water businesses to implement targeted communication strategies and rebate programs. This paper represents the first research outputs of the South East Queensland Residential <b>End</b> <b>Use</b> Study (SEQREUS), including a winter 2010 <b>end</b> <b>use</b> breakdown, assessment {{of the influence of}} different demographic and appliance/fixture efficiency categories, and winter average day diurnal patterns of <b>end</b> <b>uses.</b> <b>End</b> <b>Use</b> Analysis Approach Smart metering has enhanced the capture, transfer, storage and analysis of high-resolution water consumption data (Stewart et al. 2010).

40|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of domestic}} water consumption flow-trace data into <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event categories still remains a complex challenge {{to be resolved}} {{in the field of}} urban water management. Domestic <b>end</b> <b>use</b> studies currently utilise software and analyst experience to disaggregate flow data into <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events (e. g. faucet, dishwasher, toilet, etc.),which often requires in excess of two hours per home to disaggregate two weeks of flow data. An existing available database of <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events for over 200 households located in South-east Queensland (SEQ), Australia was utilised {{for the purpose of this}} study, which ultimately aims to automate the trace analysis process. One of the first research issues to be addressed in this research was to develop a prototype that encapsulates the wide variation in pattern characteristics for each <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event, in order to reduce unnecessary computation and memory resource required to analyse the entire <b>end</b> <b>use</b> database. To achieve this aim, the study employed the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. The outcome of this practice is a series of prototypes representing the predominant domestic water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events in a household (e. g. shower, clothes washer, etc.). Future work will employ the prototypes in an artificial network model to automate the <b>end</b> <b>use</b> disaggregation process.

ANOVA as well as multiple regression analysis statistical techniques were utilised to reveal the determinants (e. g. household makeup, shower fixture efficiency, income, education, etc.) of household shower consumption. Results of a series of one-way independent ANOVA extended into linear multiple regression models revealed that females, children in general and teenagers in particular, and the showerhead efficiency level were statistically significant determinants of shower <b>end</b> <b>use</b> consumption. Eight-way independent factorial ANOVA extended into a three-tier hierarchical linear multiple regression model, was used to create a shower <b>end</b> <b>use</b> forecasting model, and indicated that household size and makeup, as well as the showerhead efficiency rating, are the most significant predictors of shower usage. The generated multiple regression model was deemed reliable, explaining 90. 2 % of the variation in household shower <b>end</b> <b>use</b> consumption.

Fort Hood, with over 5000 buildings was determined to have representative samples of nearly all of the major building types in use on DoD installations. These building types at Fort Hood include: office, administration, vehicle maintenance, shop, hospital, grocery store, retail store, car wash, church, restaurant, single-family detached housing, two and four-plex housings, and apartment building. Up to 11 <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> were developed for each prototype, consisting of 9 electric and 2 gas; however, only electric <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> were reconciled against known data and weather conditions. The electric <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> are space cooling, ventilation, cooking, miscellaneous/plugs, refrigeration, exterior lighting, interior lighting, process loads, and street lighting. The gas <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> are space heating and hot water heating. Space heating energy-use intensities were simulated only. The EDA was applied to 10 separate feeders from the three substations at Fort Hood. The results from the analyses of these ten feeders were extrapolated to estimate energy <b>use</b> by <b>end</b> <b>use</b> for the entire installation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to disaggregate water flow data {{collected}} from high resolution smart water meters into different water <b>end</b> <b>use</b> categories. The data was obtained from a sample of 252 residential dwellings located within South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. An integrated approach was used, combining high resolution water meters, remote data transfer loggers, household water appliance audits and a selfreported household water use diary. Disaggregating water flow traces into a registry of <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events (e. g. shower, clothes washer, etc.) is predominately a complex pattern matching problem, which requires a comparison between presented patterns and those contained with a large registry of categorised <b>end</b> <b>use</b> events. Water flow data collected directly from water meters includes both single (e. g. shower event occurring alone) and combined events (i. e. an event which comprises of several overlapped single events). To identify these former mentioned single events, a hybrid combination of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) provided the most feasible and accurate approach available. Additional <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event physical context algorithms have been developed to aid accurate <b>end</b> <b>use</b> event categorisation.
