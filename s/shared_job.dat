40|$|The thesis {{contains}} {{a description of}} the current situation in combining work and family. Principally, the work focuses on women with small children who are recipients of parental allowance or maternity pay and on the system of family support, in particular, the new three-speed systém of parentel allowance. It also addresses issues faced by mothers upon their re-entry on the labour market. The work´s aim was to establish the extent to which patente take advantage of the option to select the period for which they would benefit from parental allowance and the factors influencing their choice. In order to obtain the data required, women on maternity or parental leave and allowance specialists of the state social support department at the Labour Office in Beroun have been interviewed. Quantitative as well as qualitative research methods have been used. Mothers provided information in questionnaires filled in independently by respondents, semi-controlled interviews with individual specialists have been used to obtain information from the allowance specialists at the Labour Office. The finding that resulted from the work is that, out of the three possible alternatives, the three-year alternativ eis the most frequent choice and the two-year alternative is selected by the lowest number of women. The employability of women and the number of children they take care of are the most important criteria affecting thein choice. Low interest in the two-year-olds. Therefore, predominantly women planning another child in the upcoming period who will have to resolve the situation during their next parental leave opt for the two-year alternative. The influence of the mother´s education on the choice of an alternative has not been confirmed. In order to allow mothers with small children to make full use of the new three-speed system and to accomplish the desired effect, i. e. increase in female employment rates, I would recommend, first of all, regulating the ``nurseries`` in a new way, introducing part-time jobs and <b>shared</b> <b>job</b> positions. Without these measures, the new system cannot work efficiently...|$|E

It is also possible that <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> can make an employee feel less adequate over time and cause less productivity over time. If the <b>job</b> <b>share</b> arrangement is not effective, the transition period to finding another partner could be disruptive and detrimental to the remaining employee. If proper communication and effort does not happen between the <b>job</b> <b>share</b> participants, <b>job</b> <b>share</b> can be a negative experience because the coworkers can not be held accountable to the same expectations, shifting the delicate balance of the <b>job</b> <b>share</b> arrangement.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the career experiences of women primary teachers who <b>job</b> <b>share.</b> It explores how <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> fits into overall working patterns and examines whether it fulfils the personal and professional needs of teachers. It investigates how successful <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> is seen as being in practice and explores the potential advantages and disadvantages of <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> for teachers and for schools. The study examines the claims made for <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> as a means of advancing the cause of equality in the workplace. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with twenty women primary teachers who <b>job</b> <b>shared.</b> The role of <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> in their careers was examined {{and the extent to which}} it satisfied personal and professional expectations explored. The career experiences of <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> teachers were further investigated through a questionnaire sent to a sample of teachers who had previously <b>job</b> <b>shared.</b> This provided a retrospective and longer term account. All of these experiences were then situated within the wider contexts in which teaching operates. For this, documentary and policy analysis were undertaken, and semistructured interviews were conducted with headteachers and parents, and key informants at local and national level. The research found that <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> is successful in meeting the personal needs of the women primary teachers. Teachers spoke of the balance in their lives which this working arrangement helped them to achieve. In terms of the professional dimension, the study found that experiences of <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> in practice were positive. For teachers the affective rewards of being with children and feeling competent and skilled in daily work were high. Feelings of acceptance within the workplace culture were positive; building and sustaining relationships with parents and, in particular, with colleagues, which was viewed as a salient part of the job of primary teaching, was possible whilst <b>job</b> <b>sharing.</b> As a result, schools were seen to be gaining by employing experienced and motivated individuals who were able to make positive contributions. However, some difficulties were found with the professional and career development of <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> teachers. The study concludes that <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> is not deleterious to women teachers' careers. It is far less harmful than other forms of part-time teaching although, as yet, it is not challenging full-time teaching as the dominant work model...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> for registrars at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, {{by seeking}} responses {{from members of}} the relevant medical teams. DESIGN [...] A questionnaire was sent to all 126 medical staff within the hospital (and three managers in medical administration) asking their views on <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> for registrars. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Whether <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> should continue, who should do it, at what stage of training, and the effects on patient care. RESULTS [...] Among the 77 respondents (60 %) there was broad support for the continuation of <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> at the hospital: only 5 of 37 consultants and 2 of 19 non-job sharing registrars rejected the idea (with a further 4 consultants uncertain). 43 % Of the consultants who had worked with <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> registrars thought continuity of care was adversely affected.

50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>sharing</b> {{became even}} more {{prevalent}} during the 2000s, as women have succeeded professionally in greater numbers and proportionally seek out alternative work arrangements. in the early 2000s, two important factors began to push the <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> movement. The access to information became increasingly easy to access and the demographics in the workforce began to change. The birth of the World Wide Web {{made it easier for}} companies and <b>job</b> <b>share</b> participants to share information through web tools like email, instant messaging, web portals, online databases and multi-user domains, these web tools allowed employees to share work in a more collaborative environment and in an asynchronous manner. The ever-changing demographics in the United States also drove the <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangement. With most of the baby boomer generation leaving the United States workforce and retiring, generation X and Y transitioned their lifestyles to an even better balance between family and work. Gender has also impacted the work force demographics: in 2004, women made up 59% of the workforce, with 50% of them in management professional positions. The banking, insurance, teaching and library professions are cited as more commonly using <b>job</b> <b>sharing.</b> Some companies that use <b>job</b> <b>sharing</b> include New York Life Insurance Company, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, and Walgreens drugstores.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} load <b>sharing</b> and <b>job</b> scheduling in {{a network}} of workstations (NOW). Along with traditional methods of load <b>sharing</b> and <b>job</b> scheduling, it also examines methods referred to as epoch load sharing and epoch scheduling respectively. Epoch load sharing evenly distributes the load among workstations with job migration that occurs {{only at the end}} of predefined intervals. The time interval between successive load sharing events is called an epoch. The objective is {{to reduce the number of}} times that global system information is needed to make allocation decisions, while at the same time achieving good overall performance and fairness of individual job service. In the epoch scheduling case, processor queues are rearranged only at the end of epochs. The objective is to find an epoch that minimizes the number of queue rearrangements, while being fair and producing good system performance.
