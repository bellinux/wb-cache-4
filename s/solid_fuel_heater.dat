40|$|An air {{monitoring}} program was conducted during 2005 {{to measure the}} impact of wood smoke from <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>heaters</b> in a Melbourne residential suburb where there is extensive use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>heaters.</b> A number of air pollutants including fine and course particles, organic air toxics benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen were monitored to determine the impact on air quality. Air quality was assessed by comparing the monitoring results to national and State air quality policy objectives and advisory reporting standards. Measured levels were also compared to other EPA air monitoring sites in Melbourne. The study found the main impact to air quality was caused by particles measured during April and May by coarse particles from surrounding soil and mainly by fine particles from wood smoke. Elevated fine particle levels were measured on nine days during June, highest concentration of 43 µg/m³ being measured. Multielemental analysis by Ion Beam Analysis was also undertaken to characterise the fine particles. Measured levels were also compared to other EPA air monitoring sites in Melbourne.

A peer-reviewed study carried out by the University of New England found winter woodsmoke causes 8.8 additional visits per day to GPs in Armidale for respiratory complaints, i.e., about 750 additional visits per year.

A local retired doctor (now Associate Professor at the UNE Medical school) said he is so concerned by the wood smoke situation, he urges people with respiratory problems to leave town.|$|R

The company went on to produce New Zealand’s first electric stove in 1925 but struggled to modernise its operations. In 1955, Auckland company Fisher and Paykel Ltd acquired H. E. Shacklock Ltd. and it continued to dominate the New Zealand domestic appliance market through the era of Government protectionism.

40|$|Abstract: Frequent use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> as thrust {{generating}} {{energy source}} in modern day space vehicle systems {{has created a}} need to assess their serviceability for long term storage under various conditions. <b>Solid</b> <b>fuel</b> grain, {{the most important part}} of any <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> system, responds viscoelastically to any loading condition. For the assessment of the service life of any <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> system, the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> grain has to be structurally evaluated in applied storage conditions. Structural integrity of the grain is exceptionally significant to guarantee the successful operation of the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> system. In this work, numerical simulations have been performed to assess the mechanical stresses and strains induced in an HTPB based <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> grain during service life employing ABAQUS standard FEA software using 4 -node bilinear quadrilateral elements. For finite element analysis (FEA), typical 2 -D and π/nth axisymmetric section of 5 -point (n) star grain geometry is considered.

The simulation results are compared with the analytical results for the same grain geometry.

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{households}} in low and middle income countries, including in India, use <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> (coal/coke/lignite, firewood, dung, and crop residue) for cooking and heating. Such fuels increase child mortality, chiefly from acute respiratory infection. There are, however, few direct {{estimates of the}} impact of <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> on child mortality in India. Methods We compared household <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> use in 1998 between 6790 child deaths, from all causes, in the previous year and 609 601 living children living in 1. 1 million nationally-representative homes in India. Analyses were stratified by child's gender, age (neonatal, post-neonatal, 1 - 4 years) and colder versus warmer states. We also examined the association of <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> to non-fatal pneumonias. Results <b>Solid</b> <b>fuel</b> use was very common (87 % in households with child deaths and 77 % in households with living children). After adjustment for demographic factors and living conditions, solid-fuel use significantly increase child deaths at ages 1 - 4 (prevalence ratio (PR) boys: 1. 30, 95 %CI 1. 08 - 1. 56; girls: 1. 33, 95 %CI 1. 12 - 1. 58). More girls than boys died from exposure to <b>solid</b> <b>fuels.</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>fuel</b> use was also associated with non-fatal pneumonia (boys: PR 1. 54 95 %CI 1. 01 - 2. 35; girls: PR 1. 94 95 %CI 1. 13 - 3. 33). Conclusions Child mortality risks, from all causes, due to <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> exposure were lower than previously, but as exposure was common <b>solid,</b> <b>fuel</b> caused 6 % of all deaths at ages 0 - 4, 20 % of deaths at ages 1 - 4 or 128 000 child deaths in India in 2004. <b>Solid</b> <b>fuel</b> use has declined only modestly in the last decade.

40|$|Background: India {{contributes}} 24 % of {{the global}} annual child deaths due to acute respiratory infections (ARIs). According to WHO, nearly 50 % of the deaths among children due to ARIs is because of indoor air pollution (IAP). There is insufficient evidence {{on the relationship between}} IAP from the use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> and incidence of life threatening respiratory illnesses (LTRI) in children in India. Methods: Panel data of children born during 2001 - 02, from the Young Lives Study (YLS) conducted in India during 2002 and 2006 - 07 was used to estimate the impact of household use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking on LTRI in children. Multivariable two-stage random effects logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of suffering from LTRI among children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> relative to children from households using other fuels (Gas/Electricity/Kerosene). Results: Bivariate results indicate that the probability of an episode of LTRI was considerably higher among children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking (18 %) than among children from households using other fuels (10 %). Moreover, children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> in both the rounds of YLS were more likely to suffer from one or more than one episode of LTRI compared to children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> in only one round. Two-stage random effects logistic regression result shows that children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> were 1. 78 (95 % CI: 1. 05 - 2. 99) times as likely to suffer from LTRI as those from households using other fuels. Conclusion: The findings of this paper provide conclusive evidence on the harmful effects of the use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking on LTRI in India.
