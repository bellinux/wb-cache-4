40|$|Supplier {{selection}} {{is an important}} problem in supply chain management (SCM), and has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers. Most previous research on supplier {{selection is}} based on the assumption that a single product is required. For the few supplier selection models for multiple products, they handled the problem on a product-by-product manner. In such cases, the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products which could impact the choice of cooperative suppliers is not taken into account. However, it is practical for the purchasing company to procure multiple products simultaneously and benefit from the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products. It is necessary to incorporate the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products in multi-product supplier selection. This thesis presents a multi-product supplier selection model incorporating the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products. The model is composed of three sub-models, i. e., the synergy determination sub-model, the supplier pre-selection sub-model and the negotiation-based final selection sub- model. As the agent-based technology is a natural tool for modeling distributed systems, the proposed multi-product supplier selection model is realized as a multi-agent system (MAS) with agents representing the relevant parties and functions of the proposed model. Agents of the MAS are able to interact with each other through the respective agent interaction protocols defined specifically for the three sub-models. The synergy determination sub-model is to determine the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products. The term complementarity is used to represent the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products. The product complementarity measure criteria are formulated based on the activities of automobile manufacturers. Complementarity measure methods are then proposed. The product bundle determination algorithm is presented to generate preferred product bundles. The interaction of agents involving in the sub-model is governed by the synergy determination protocol. The supplier pre-selection sub-model is to shortlist the qualified and competitive suppliers for multiple products. The pre-selection criteria catering for the multi-product environment are formulated. Both the general characteristics and performances of suppliers, and the capabilities supporting multi-product transactions are included in the pre-selection criteria. The TOPSIS-based supplier pre-selection algorithm is established to evaluate suppliers on these criteria. The interaction of agents involving in the sub-model is governed by the pre-selection protocol. The negotiation-based final selection sub-model is to select the cooperative suppliers for multiple products. In order to cater for the multi-product environment, multiple bids are allowed in the negotiation model. The corresponding bid utility function and negotiation strategies are presented. The B&B-based winner determination algorithm is presented to determine the cooperative suppliers. The hybrid protocol of combinatorial procurement auction and multi-bilateral bargaining is established to govern the interaction of agents in the sub-model. A case study has been executed to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and usefulness of the supplier selection model for multiple products with <b>synergy</b> <b>effect.</b> The results indicate that the proposed supplier selection model is able to select suppliers for multiple products simultaneously and incorporate the <b>synergy</b> <b>effect</b> between products. In addition, the agent interaction protocols and related algorithms used in the agent-based system supporting the multi-product supplier selection model are suitable and effective. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

50|$|Strategic fit {{can also}} be used to {{evaluate}} specific opportunities like M&A opportunities. Strategic fit would in this case refer to how well the potential acquisition fits with the planned direction (strategy) of the acquiring company. In order to justify growth through M&A transactions the transaction should yield a better return than Organic growth. The Differential Efficiency Theory states that the acquiring firm will be able increase its efficiency in the areas where the acquired firm is superior. In addition the theory argues that M&A transactions give the acquiring firm the possibility of achieving positive <b>synergy</b> <b>effects</b> meaning that the two merged companies are worth more together than the sums of their parts individually. This is because merging companies may enjoy from economics of scale and economics of scope. However, in reality many M&A transactions fails due to different factors, one of them being lack of strategic fit. A CEO survey conducted by Bain & Company showed that 94% of the interviewed CEO’s considered the strategic fit to be vitally influential in the success or failure of an acquisition. A high degree of strategic fit from can potentially yield many benefits for an organization. Best case scenario a high degree of strategic fit may be the key to a successful merger, an efficient organization, <b>synergy</b> <b>effects</b> or cost reductions. It is a vital term and it should be taken into consideration when evaluating a company’s strategy and opportunities.|$|E
