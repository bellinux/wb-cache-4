In 1998-9 he portrayed Simon Horton, younger brother of David Horton in the British sitcom The Vicar of Dibley for two episodes; Stevyn Colgan said that his imposing height was [...] "used to great comic effect" [...] in this role when he became the love interest of 5' 0" [...] (1.52m) tall Reverend Geraldine Granger (Dawn French). From March 1999, Mantle played Victor in Jan Sargent's production of The Price at the Bristol Old Vic. Ian Shuttleworth of the Financial Times describes Mantle's Victor as a character who [...] "sacrificed a promising academic career in science to become a cop on the beat simply {{in order to keep}} his shattered father" [...] and said that [...] "Clive Mantle expresses his obstinacy <b>through</b> <b>gritted</b> <b>teeth</b> and cold, civil smiles rather than letting it loose", also remarking that both he and his wife Esther (played by Susan Wooldridge) seemed several years too young for their roles.|$|R

5000|$|When hosting his {{children}}'s hour, Nasse-setä tried to, often <b>through</b> <b>gritted</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{present an}} image of a child-loving jovial uncle, but often failed to conceal the disgust he felt towards children and sometimes even flat-out verbally insulted his young audience. He often appeared to use intoxicants, often behind the scenes but sometimes also in plain view: In one sketch, he crouched behind his desk to smoke a cigarette during the show, in another—while trying to do magic tricks—he claimed his alcoholic beverage to be a [...] "magic drink" [...] helping him to perform the tricks, and in one sketch he had created a chime instrument out of half-empty liquor bottles and had to repeatedly [...] "tune" [...] his instruments by sipping from the bottles. He was also known to ask children to send him ten-markka bills or photographs of their mothers. At one time, Nasse-setä explained how he had ended up as host of a children's show: on the day when he was at a career fitting test, the meters were out of order.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an article}} for Radio Times in April 2014 about 'grey power' in television, Buerk {{referred}} to presenters {{who had gone to}} employment tribunals over claims of age discrimination. Several older female presenters have won cases over wrongful dismissal. Buerk wrote: [...] "If you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice, I can't see why you should keep it when you don't." [...] Quoting a comment by Anne Robinson ("The viewers don't want to watch ugly") he speculated: [...] "She seemed to say it <b>through</b> <b>gritted</b> <b>teeth,</b> or at least a flawless but strangely taut face - a sign perhaps that she had taken her own advice to stop complaining and work on staying attractive." [...] He did though quote Angela Rippon who spoke positively about older people (including herself) being able to continue their careers in television. Responding to Buerk in The Guardian, presenter Miriam O'Reilly, who won her case for unfair dismissal on age grounds in 2011, asserted: [...] "The rules that apply to women in TV don't apply to men. Men can age, women can't. Women have to be attractive, men don't." ...|$|R
5000|$|Trencher has a {{very dry}} and gruff tone, with an almost [...] "been there, done that" [...] mentality. As Giffen put it [...] "he'd have already killed himself if he weren't already dead" [...] Trencher has been {{described}} by Keith Giffen as being a more blue collar working man type character, as opposed to his other character Lobo, which Trencher has at times been labeled a knock off. His job as a repo-man, collecting souls, also conveys the general unpleasantness of his position, implying that he has good reason to hate his messy, un-respected and thankless job. Trencher almost never displays overt rage, in many ways his anger is illustrated by the more imposing he becomes as a character the more annoyed he gets at not accomplishing his task. The Images of Shadowhawk issues illustrate this well, where Trencher's frustration over Shadowhawk's constant intervention with every attempt he makes to eliminate his target, leading to him devastating an entire hospital in an attempt to remove Shadowhawk from the equation. He also never quite ever opens his mouth when he speaks, preferring to talk <b>through</b> <b>gritted</b> <b>teeth,</b> often {{out of the side of}} his mouth, he is rarely seen without a cigarette.|$|R

50|$|As {{with his}} c. 1800 Charles IV of Spain and His Family, the Spanish king is portrayed in full pomp and finery, albeit <b>through</b> barely {{concealed}} <b>gritted</b> <b>teeth.</b> Ferdinand {{is shown in}} the center middle-ground, seated at a raised table and flanked by trembling associates. To his left sits Miguel de Lardazibal, minister for the Indies, who was imprisoned the following September and forced into exile by the crown. Before these men, the assembly members are massed in two groups divided left and right by carpet. An expanse of light spills across the floor, spread before the absolute monarch, and lit from a source situated near the viewer of the painting. While the work was painted on commission and intended to hang in the ceremonial hall in which it was set, it highlights in an unflattering manner the centrality and impotent grip of the king. To art historian Albert Boime, the painting shows a monarch who rules not through respect, but through last resort; absolute power and fear.|$|R
