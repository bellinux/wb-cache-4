25|$|About 4pm, with no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the pā, Cameron {{ordered an}} assault by 300 men—a {{combined}} force of Naval Brigade under Commander Hay and 43rd Regiment, led by Lieutenant-Colonel H.G. Booth—who ran in four abreast with fixed bayonets. Another 300 men followed {{at a distance}} as a reserve. Some in the initial British assault force were shot {{as they entered the}} main pā, and inside the redoubt more fell as they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Māori armed with shotguns and tomahawks. A lull of about five minutes occurred, during which time Captain G.R. Greaves, who was with the leading files of the assault party, left the pā and reported to Cameron that the redoubt had been captured and that British casualties were light.|$|E

25|$|The First or Dark World, , {{was small}} and {{centered}} on an island floating {{in the middle of}} four seas. The inhabitants of the first world were the four , the Coyotes, the four rulers of the four seas, mist beings and various insect and people, the latter being the Air-Spirit People. The supernatural beings First Woman and First Man came into existence here. Coyote sees First Man burning crystal which is a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> then Coyote sees First Woman burning turquoise which is a sign of death. Coyote then decides to ask both if they want to meet each other and both agreed. Then Coyote gathers both of them and met for the first time. The various beings started fighting with one another and departed by flying out an opening in the east.|$|E
25|$|For dead donors, {{the process}} begins with verifying {{that the person}} is hopelessly dead, {{determining}} whether any organs could be donated, and obtaining consent for the donation of any usable organs. Normally, nothing is done until the person has already died, although if death is inevitable, it is possible to check for consent and to do some simple medical tests shortly beforehand, to help find a matching recipient. The verification of death is normally done by a neurologist (a physician specializing in brain function) that is not involved in the previous attempts to save the patient's life. This physician {{has nothing to do with}} the transplantation process. Verification of death is often done multiple times, to prevent doctors from overlooking any remaining <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> however small. After death, the hospital may keep the body on a mechanical ventilator and use other methods to keep the organs in good condition. Donors and their families are not charged for any expenses related to the donation.|$|E
25|$|The proverb Ngam jam, o yas jam (rain in peace! Sow in peace) is {{the first}} word Serer farmers utter during the first rain. It is also the way the Serers wish each other happy New Year. As well as an expression, it also a {{religious}} prayer. The first rain of the season is a pact between the transcendent power and humanity. It is a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> which continues to be transmitted by this tutelary power, which has long respected the pact. Custom dictates that, the first three steps on the damp earth of the first rain to be made barefooted in order to connect with mother nature. The father or {{the mother of the}} family would be given a calabash of the water of the first rain, for the whole family to drink. This water is holy and is viewed as sacred which would protect them from all misfortunes that may occur during the rainy season. Under the Saas tree, containers were placed under it to collect the water that touches the tree. This water was used for bathing as a sign of protection.|$|E

500|$|In situ {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, {{has suggested that the}} Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form. Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride. The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light. A recent analysis of martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.6 ppm , 1.4 ppm , and 16 ppm , most likely of Martian origin. The [...] suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines, such as [...] or , produced both by UV oxidation of Cl and X-ray radiolysis of [...] Thus, only highly refractory and/or well-protected (sub-surface) organics or life forms are likely to survive.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life,</b> a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E

[...] He also had kind words for Tapiola, describing it as [...] "a beautiful work", and among others, Sibelius's Third, Fourth, and Fifth symphonies.|$|E

2500|$|The Christian {{symbolism}} of the olive branch, invariably carried by the dove, derives from Greek usage {{and the story of}} Noah in the Hebrew Bible. [...] The story of Noah ends with a dove bringing a freshly plucked olive leaf (Hebrew: עלה זית alay zayit), a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> after the Flood and of God's bringing Noah, his family and the animals to land. [...] Rabbinic literature interpreted the olive leaf as [...] "the young shoots of the Land of Israel" [...] or the dove's preference for bitter food in God's service, rather than sweet food in the service of men. and neither represented peace in Jewish thought, but the dove and olive branch acquired that meaning in Christianity.|$|E

2500|$|At 09:40 {{the signal}} to {{withdraw}} was sent to all the assault forces - [...] "Vanquish 1100 hours". This presented great difficulties for the LCAs as they were designed best to beach on rising tides and the tide would not rise again for some hours. A few soldiers managed to swim out and {{be picked up by}} friendly craft but many more were killed in the attempt. Unarmoured craft could not come near the beach because the fire was too heavy. Several LCAs went in to evacuate troops, including the four surviving craft of the 10th LCA Flotilla, but suffered due to the intense fire from mortars and machine-guns; two 10th Flotilla craft were sunk. When Ferguson saw that there was no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> on the beach, he reluctantly obeyed an order to withdraw. Only one craft, LCA 209, managed to touch down on Blue Beach for the evacuation and while taking wounded aboard it was unable to raise its ramp before it pushed off the beach. Grenades and mortar bombs added more casualties, and with men hanging on to LCA 209's sides, mortar bombs finally sank it. By 08:30 the Royal Regiment had surrendered.|$|E

2500|$|The tide {{suddenly}} {{turned in the}} dockers' favour when carters on the railway company quays refused to transport goods unloaded from the ships by the Dublin blackleg dockers. On 4 July after submitting a general pay claim, Larkin called the thousand remaining carters of Belfast, who were employed by the 60 firms of the Master Carriers Association, out on a sympathy strike. Gallaher and the other employers had no means of getting their merchandise out of the port. The Belfast Newsletter commented on the situation with the following words: [...] "It was remarkable to see the stagnation which existed from the Custom House to the Clarendon Dock. With the exception of an isolated van or lorry driven by the obvious amateur, there was scarcely a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> or movement". Soon afterwards engineers and boilermakers were striking; workplaces {{all over the city}} stopped production and shut down. The strike escalated into bitter violence when shipyard workers burnt company vans, hurled rocks at the police and attacked blacklegs with [...] "shipyard confetti" [...] which consisted of rivets, nuts and bolts. Blackleg workers had to be billeted aboard a ship in the Belfast Lough for their own safety.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 3 March 1921, the Singaporean {{passenger}} ship [...] grounded on the White Rocks off Lamock Island, Swatow, China, and was wrecked {{with the loss of}} an estimated 900 to 1,000 lives. The steamer [...] discovered the wreck on the morning of 4 March and rendered assistance, rescuing 45 survivors before steaming to Swatow to seek additional help for Hong Moh. Upon receiving word of the disaster, the British consul at Swatow informed the British Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong, who in turn broadcast a wireless message requesting ships to come to Hong Moh′s aid. Foxglove arrived on the scene late on 5 March but was unable to locate the wreck in the darkness. The Royal Navy light cruiser [...] joined Foxglove on the scene at dawn on 6 March, and the two ships located Hong Moh and began to rescue additional survivors, with Foxglove taking 28 or 48 (sources differ) survivors on board before having to depart late in the afternoon to refuel. Carlisle remained on the scene until 8 March, leaving only when there was no further <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> board the wreck of Hong Moh; she then proceeded to Hong Kong with 221 survivors aboard.|$|E
