2500|$|After {{an adverse}} event occurs, each country {{has its own}} {{way of dealing with}} the incident. In Canada, a quality {{improvement}} review is primarily used. A quality improvement review is an evaluation that is completed after an adverse event occurs with the intention to both fix the problem, as well as preventing it from happening again.

Healthcare providers have an obligation to disclose any adverse event to their patients because of ethical and professional guidelines.

2500|$|While Chrono Cross {{on a whole}} {{generally}} received {{very positive}} reviews, including some publications, like GameSpot, giving it a perfect score, critics were divided on how Squaresoft handled the game's cast. David Zdyrko of IGN strongly praised the game's character accent system, stating he was impressed that [...] "Square {{was able to give}} each of the game's 40-plus playable characters different characteristics and, in many cases, distinct accents and speech patterns. The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game." [...] Zdyrko felt that the accent system helped validate the choice to make the cast so big, concluding that the accents [...] "...combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game {{plays an important role in}} the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals. The character development isn't the best you'll find in an RPG, but it's better than most." [...] GameSpot's Andrew Vestral similarly praised the cast, stating, [...] "Surprisingly, Chrono Cross seemingly endless supply of characters works to its benefit, not its detriment...Every last one of the 40-plus members is a unique, story-driven, and valuable contributor. Unlike many cast-of-thousands RPG epics, each character in Chrono Cross is an interesting and worthy addition to your team. Everyone has a beautiful character model, excellently animated attacks, and three unique [...] "limit break" [...] type special skills. There's even a miniquest or special requirement for every character's best skill...you'll never add someone to your party and wonder, [...] "Why is this character in the game?" [...] There are no disposable placeholders in Chrono Cross." [...] Vestral did concede that much of the Chrono Trigger fan-base disapproved of the concept of 40+ characters prior to release, but he argued the way the game handled should dispel any such concerns. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution also acknowledged the concerns with the large cast as well, but felt that players would see more value in the characters once their respective dedicated sidequests were played. The <b>staff</b> <b>review</b> at RPGFan also praised the cast, not only for its size and character development, but for the unique scenario of allowing the player to recruit some characters, and then have them interact with alternate versions of themselves due to the game's alternate dimension scenario. Similarly, in a Kotaku retrospective on the game by Peter Tieryas, he stated that he initially [...] "didn’t feel the characters were as rich or interesting as the ones in Chrono Trigger", he grew more positive of the cast upon realizing that [...] "Cross wasn’t trying to recreate the closer, more intimate adventure of Trigger. Cross was about a huge cast of characters and the implications of their existence, how one death, or life, impacts the universe around them." ...|$|E
