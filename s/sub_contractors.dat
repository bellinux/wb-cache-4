The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

5000|$|The Cullen Report {{into the}} Ladbroke Grove rail crash saw safety culture as [...] "the way we {{typically}} do things around here"; this would imply that every organisation has a safety culture - just some {{a better one}} than others. The concept of 'safety culture' originally arose in connection with major organisational accidents, where it provides a crucial insight into how multiple organisational barriers against such accidents can be simultaneously ineffective: [...] "With each disaster that occurs {{our knowledge of the}} factors which make organisations vulnerable to failures has grown. It has become clear that such vulnerability does not originate from just ‘human error’, chance environmental factors or technological failures alone. Rather, it is the ingrained organisational policies and standards which have repeatedly been shown to predate the catastrophe."However it is now also applied (with less certain validity) to individual accidents, and hence has come to relate to a full range of safety behaviors from the wearing of PPE (or not), the quality of delivery of a tool box talk, the quality of shopfloor response to fault conditions - or (what is frequently the main concern for major accidents) the extent to which safety considerations influence high level meetings and management decisions. A new starter or recently arrived <b>sub</b> <b>contractor</b> will soon pick up what the local norms are and be heavily influenced by them. If a tipping point of around 90% compliance is observed then these individuals will be highly likely to comply too - but if these individuals observe a 50:50 split then they may feel they have free choice as whatever they do they won't stand out.|$|R

40|$|Bakgrund: Forskningen kring projekt har under senare år ökat i omfattning. En anledning är att projektorganiseringen utgör ett sätt att samla ett antal specialister för att få dem att samverka mot ett gemensamt mål. Utöver de interna relationer som uppstår i projekt förekommer det även involvering av interorganisatoriska {{partners}} i samarbetet vilket är speciellt vanligt i byggprojekt som karaktäriseras av en hög grad av interorganisatorisk specialisering. Problemformuleringar: Den utpräglade specialiseringen inom byggprojekt fordrar som all annan typ av specialisering, samordning och koordinering av resurser med den skillnaden att det här handlar om samordning över de organisatoriska gränserna. Det som denna studie behandlar är därför de relationer byggföretag har till sina underentreprenörer i samband medbyggprojekt. Fokus ligger på hur företag kan samverka vertikalt i förädlingskedjan för att på detta sätt uppnå konkurrensfördelar. Syfte: Syftet med denna magisteruppsats är att utforska styrning och kontraktering av interorganisatoriska relationer för projektbaserad byggverksamhet. Utöver detta är syftet att specificera en optimala relationen mellan byggherre och underentreprenör för de fall som studien omfattar. Avgränsningar: Studien har avgränsats till att endast innefatta relationen mellan byggherre och underentreprenör. Genomförande: Studien har genomförts med grund i kontraktsansatsen genom intervjuer på två byggföretag med olika strategi, storlek och geografisk placering. Resultat: Resultatet visar att en optimal relation mellan byggherre och underentreprenör är avhängigt av i vilken grad samverkan kan ledan till utveckling hos de båda parterna. Alltför omfattande outsourcing av tjänster kan vara negativt precis som alltför täta relationer. Därför är situationen helt avgörande. Ger även stöd åt- samt utvecklar Alvesson&Lindkvists teori om ekonomisk kooperativa klaner. Background: Business research {{focusing on}} {{different aspects of}} project work has recently increased. One reason is that project teams {{can be used as}} an effec- tive means of getting specialists from different parts of a business to work to- wards a common goal. In addition to the internal project relations that charac- terize project work, some businesses have also shown evidence of involving ex- ternal parties in projects. This is particularly common for construction projects where a large number of firms enter a project in order to achieve a high degree of interorganizational specialisation. Purpose: The high extent of specialization within the construction industry in- creases the need for coordination of resources among participating firms. This thesis relates to this coordination with special regard to the relation between contractor and sub-contractor and the involvement of subcontractorsin the verti-cal dimension of the supply chain. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore the procurement phases related to the involvement of subcontractors in con-struction projects. Further, the study aims at specifying the optimal relations between main- and <b>sub</b> <b>contractor</b> for the construction firms researched. D elimitation: This thesis is solely focusing on the relations between main con- tractor and sub-contractor and is not dealing with other parties involved in con-struction projects. Realization: The research material for this thesis has been obtained through in- terviews with employees of two Swedish construction firms that differ in strat- egy, size and geographical location. Conclusion: The concluding remarks of the study indicate that the optimal rela- tion between main- and <b>sub</b> <b>contractor</b> is highly dependent on in what ways the relations may lead to long-term development for the parties. A high extent of outsourcing from the main contractor as well as too extensive partnering rela- tions may lead to substantial disadvantages in development for both firms. Therefore the environment in which the main contractor is operating is of great importance to the decision on how to handle subcontractor relations. The study also gives insights into the clan literature and supports and extends the theory of economic cooperative clans, developed by Mats Alvesson&Lars Lindkvist...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years people has {{become more aware of}} issues {{regarding}} corporate social responsibility. This has led to a more thorough control of big multinational companies, which are often held account of violating social, ethical and environmental values. The term most often used for this is corporate social responsibility (CSR). H&M is a Swedish multinational company and the concept of H&M is fashion to a low price. The material most often used in producing clothes is cotton. Cotton is the most sprayed crop and a great amount of water, pesticides and inorganic fertilizers are used in order to get better and bigger harvests leading to a negative impact on both environment and people working in the production chain. Organic cotton is a great alternative {{and a growing number of}} consumers are asking for clothes made out of organic cotton. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate whether H&M is taking responsibility for the social, ethical and environmental parts of CSR and how H&M uses organic cotton in their clothes. The thesis also accounts for the role of the consumer and other stakeholders regarding demand of organic cotton.   Methods used are literature studies and interviews conducted by phone and e-mail. The results show that the overall impression is that H&M as a company is taking several actions in order to take responsibility. By using organic cotton in collections on all departments and by supporting a number of non governmental organizations (NGO) H&M has had a positive development and is now seen as one of the most successful companies regarding CSR. H&M has integrated a stakeholder perspective in their activities which shows that the company is putting focus not only at the consumers but also at other important stakeholders. H&M should however focus more on local sustainability, in order to help sustain a positive development in developing countries multinational companies such as H&M need to take a bigger responsibility and attend so that a bigger profit remains in the <b>sub</b> <b>contractor</b> countries...|$|R
