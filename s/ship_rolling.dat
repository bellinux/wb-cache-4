Nettie was, he knew, a very capable young woman, and Appleby, he fancied, a gentleman, which was, in the meanwhile, sufficient for him. A friendship may also be made rapidly at sea, and on the seventh day out he asked Appleby a question.

I am sorry to say that I don't think the fellow is alone. Two or three times I have fancied that I caught a glimpse of a sail on our {{starboard}} quarter. I could not swear to it, but I don't think I was mistaken, and I called the captain's attention that way, just before he went down ten minutes ago, and he thought he saw it, too. However, as {{there was nothing to be}} done, he went down for a caulk. He had not left the deck since noon, yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|The men {{had been}} without food or drink since leaving Helium, {{and they had been}} hurled about and buffeted in their {{lashings}} until all were worn to exhaustion. There was a brief lull in the storm during which one of the crew attempted to reach his quarters, after releasing the lashings which had held him to the precarious safety of the deck. The act in itself was a direct violation of orders and, {{in the eyes of the}} other members of the crew, the effect, which came with startling suddenness, took the form of a swift and terrible retribution. Scarce had the man released the safety snaps ere a swift arm of the storm-monster encircled the <b>ship,</b> <b>rolling</b> it over and over, with the result that the foolhardy warrior went overboard at the first turn.|$|E
60|$|There {{was that}} {{assisting}} {{at the church}} service on board another steamship, one Sunday, in a stiff breeze. Perhaps on the passage out. No matter. Pleasant to hear the ship's bells go as like church-bells as they could; pleasant to see the watch off duty mustered and come in: best hats, best Guernseys, washed hands and faces, smoothed heads. But then arose a set of circumstances so rampantly comical, that no check which the gravest intentions could put upon them would hold them in hand. Thus the scene. Some seventy passengers assembled at the saloon tables. Prayer-books on tables. <b>Ship</b> <b>rolling</b> heavily. Pause. No minister. Rumour has related that a modest young clergyman on board has responded to the captain's request that he will officiate. Pause again, and very heavy rolling.|$|E

2500|$|As the gale {{rose in the}} Strait, First Officer George W. Doney was {{in command}} at the pilot house, while Captain Roberts was resting in his cabin. [...] As the <b>ship’s</b> <b>rolling</b> increased, Captain Roberts, realizing the ship was in distress, came to the pilot house. Chief Engineer Scott A.

60|$|Our passage {{out in the}} Delaware {{was very}} rough, the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> heavily. It {{was the first time}} she had been at sea, and it {{required}} some little time to get her trim and sailing. She turned out, however, to be a good vessel; sailing fairly, steering well, and proving an excellent sea-boat. We went into Algesiras, where we lay only twenty-four hours. We then sailed for Mahon, but were met by orders off the port, to proceed to Leghorn and land our passengers. I have been told this was done on account of the Princess of Musignano's being a daughter of the ex-King of Spain, and it was not thought delicate to bring her within the territory of the reigning king. I have even heard that the commodore was offered an order of knighthood for the delicacy he manifested on this occasion, which offer he declined accepting, as a matter of course.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the great}} discoveries of this admirable Inquiry is the fascination of the davits. All these people {{positively}} can't get away from them. They shuffle about and groan around their davits. Whereas the obvious {{thing to do is}} to eliminate the man-handled davits altogether. Don't you think that with all the mechanical contrivances, with all the generated power on board these ships, it is about time to get rid of the hundred- years-old, man-power appliances? Cranes are what is wanted; low, compact cranes with adjustable heads, one to each set of six or nine boats. And if people tell you of insuperable difficulties, if they tell you of the swing and spin of spanned boats, don't you believe them. The heads of the cranes need not be any higher than the heads of the davits. The lift required would be only a couple of inches. As to the spin, there is a way to prevent that if you have in each boat two men who know what they are about. I have taken up on board a heavy ship's boat, in the open sea (the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> heavily), with a common cargo derrick. And a cargo derrick is very much like a crane; but a crane devised ad hoc would be infinitely easier to work. We must remember that the loss of this ship has altered the moral atmosphere. As long as the Titanic is remembered, an ugly rush for the boats may be feared in case of some accident. You can't hope to drill into perfect discipline a casual mob of six hundred firemen and waiters, but in a ship like the Titanic you can keep on a permanent trustworthy crew of one hundred intelligent seamen and mechanics who would know their stations for abandoning ship and would do the work efficiently. The boats could be lowered with sufficient dispatch. One does not want to let rip one's boats by the run all at the same time. With six boat-cranes, six boats would be simultaneously swung, filled, and got away from the side; and if any sort of order is kept, the ship could be cleared of the passengers in a quite short time. For there must be boats enough for the passengers and crew, whether you increase the number of boats or limit the number of passengers, irrespective of the size of the ship. That is the only honest course. Any other would be rather worse than putting sand in the sugar, for which a tradesman gets fined or imprisoned. Do not let us take a romantic view of the so-called progress. A company selling passages is a tradesman; though from the way these people talk and behave you would think they are benefactors of mankind in some mysterious way, engaged in some lofty and amazing enterprise.|$|E
6000|$|We have {{at present}} in port the model warship of Great Britain. She {{is called the}} CURACOA, and has the nicest set of {{officers}} and men conceivable. They, the officers, are all very intimate with us, and the front verandah {{is known as the}} Curacoa Club, and the road up to Vailima is known as the Curacoa Track. It was rather a surprise to me; many naval officers have I known, and somehow had not learned to think entirely well of them, and perhaps sometimes ask myself a little uneasily how that kind of men could do great actions? and behold! the answer comes to me, and I see a ship that I would guarantee to go anywhere it was possible for men to go, and accomplish anything it was permitted man to attempt. I had a cruise on board of her not long ago to Manu'a, and was delighted. [...] The goodwill of all on board; the grim playfulness of - quarters, with the wounded falling down at the word; the ambulances hastening up and carrying them away; the Captain suddenly crying, 'Fire in the ward-room!' and the squad hastening forward with the hose; and, last and most curious spectacle of all, all the men in their dust- coloured fatigue clothes, at a note of the bugle, falling simultaneously flat on deck, and the ship proceeding with its prostrate crew - QUASI to ram an enemy; our dinner at night in a wild open anchorage, the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> almost to her gunwales, and showing us alternately her bulwarks up in the sky, and then the wild broken cliffy palm-crested shores of the island with the surf thundering and leaping close aboard. We had the ward-room mess on deck, lit by pink wax tapers, everybody, of course, in uniform but myself, and the first lieutenant (who is a rheumaticky body) wrapped in a boat cloak. Gradually the sunset faded out, the island disappeared from the eye, though it remained menacingly present to the ear with the voice of the surf; and then the captain turned on the searchlight and gave us the coast, the beach, the trees, the native houses, and the cliffs by glimpses of daylight, a kind of deliberate lightning. About which time, I suppose, we must have come as far as the dessert, and were probably drinking our first glass of port to Her Majesty. We stayed two days at the island, and had, in addition, a very picturesque snapshot at the native life. The three islands of Manu'a are independent, and are ruled over by a little slip of a half-caste girl about twenty, who sits all day in a pink gown, in a little white European house with about a quarter of an acre of roses in front of it, looking at the palm-trees on the village street, and listening to the surf. This, so far as I could discover, was all she had to do. 'This is a very dull place,' she said. It appears she could go to no other village for fear of raising the jealousy of her own people in the capital. [...] And as for going about 'tafatafaoing,' as we say here, its cost was too enormous. A strong able-bodied native must walk {{in front of her and}} blow the conch shell continuously from the moment she leaves one house until the moment she enters another. Did you ever blow the conch shell? I presume not; but the sweat literally hailed off that man, and I expected every moment to see him burst a blood-vessel. We were entertained to kava in the guest-house with some very original features. The young men who run for the KAVA have a right to misconduct themselves AD LIBITUM on the way back; and though they were told to restrain themselves on the occasion of our visit, there was a strange hurly-burly at their return, when they came beating the trees and the posts of the houses, leaping, shouting, and yelling like Bacchants.|$|E
50|$|Hulls {{have several}} elements. The bow is the {{foremost}} {{part of the}} hull. Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel {{is at the very}} bottom of the hull, extending {{the entire length of the}} ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a <b>ship's</b> <b>rolling</b> motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.|$|R
5000|$|Another key {{component}} of dedicated container-ship design {{is the use of}} cell guides. [...] Cell guides are strong vertical structures constructed of metal installed into a ship's cargo holds. [...] These structures guide containers into well-defined rows during the loading process and provide some support for containers against the <b>ship's</b> <b>rolling</b> at sea. [...] So fundamental to container ship design are cell guides that organizations such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development use their presence to distinguish dedicated container ships from general break-bulk cargo ships.|$|R

50|$|Fame {{came to him}} in the 1890s, {{when his}} {{pioneering}} Theory of oscillating motions of the ship, significantly extending William Froude's rolling theory, became internationally known. This was the first comprehensive theoretical study in the field. In 1898 Krylov received a Gold Medal from the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, the first time the prize was awarded to a foreigner. He also created a theory of damping of <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> and pitching, and was the first to propose gyroscopic damping which now is the most common way of damping the roll.|$|E
50|$|Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Aniwa {{cleared the}} port of New York shortly after midday on 29 December 1918 bound for Gibraltar. As the days wore on, the weather {{remained}} fairly rough, with the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> easily in the long swells, and she took water forward and aft; a leak in the after storeroom occupied the attention {{of at least one}} man for nearly an entire day on 7 January 1919. Soon thereafter, problems with her condenser and boilers forced her to put into the Azores on 10 January 1919 for voyage repairs.|$|E
40|$|Transporting {{passengers}} from Toronto to popular summer recreation areas and carrying fresh fruit from the Niagara Pennisula was good {{business for the}} Niagara, St. Catherines, and Toronto Navigation Company. The company ordered the "Dalhousie City" from the Collingwood Shipbuilding Company, Collingwood, Ontario, Canada. She was launched June 24, 1911. She was modified just before 1920. Bilge keels were added to prevent the <b>ship's</b> <b>rolling</b> in a heavy sea, and her propellor was redesigned to increase her speed. She was sold in 1950 to the Lake Shore Lines, renamed the "Island King II and used as an excursion ship around Montreal. She burned November 14, 1960 at Lachine, Quebec...|$|R
60|$|So {{the sailor}} still lay {{out of sight}} in his bunk, which was in the extreme angle of the forecastle, behind the bowsprit-bitts--two stout timbers rooted in the ship's keel. An hour or two afterward, some of the men {{observed}} a strange odor in the forecastle, which was attributed to the presence of some dead rat among the hollow spaces in the side planks; for some days before, the forecastle had been smoked out, to extirpate the vermin overrunning her.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1628, the captain {{responsible}} for supervising construction of the ship, Söfring Hansson, arranged for the ship's stability to be demonstrated for the Vice Admiral responsible for procurement, Klas Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran {{back and forth across}} the upper deck to start the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling,</b> but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsise. According to testimony by the ship's master, Göran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible.|$|E
50|$|Mohawk {{was laid}} down at White's Isle of Wight {{shipyard}} on 1 May 1906 and launched on 15 March 1907. Mohawks sea trials showed {{that she was}} fast, reaching a speed of 34.916 kn, well {{in excess of the}} required 33 kn. Seakeeping was poor, however, with the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> badly, and Mohawk had to be rebuilt with a raised forecastle to give acceptable seakeeping. Mohawk was completed in June 1908. It had been realised during construction that the armament of the Tribals was too light, so it was decided to strengthen the armament of the first five ships, including Mohawk, by adding another two 12-pounder guns. This was done to Mohawk following acceptance by the Royal Navy.|$|E
60|$|It {{was there}} that we lay upon that glorious afternoon. If we chose to roll upon our right sides, the whole weald lay in front of us, with the North Downs curving away in olive-green folds, with here and there the snow-white rift of a chalk-pit; if we turned upon our left, we {{overlooked}} the huge blue stretch of the Channel. A convoy, as I can well remember, was coming up it that day, the timid flock of merchantmen in front; the frigates, like well-trained dogs, upon the skirts; and two burly drover line-of-battle <b>ships</b> <b>rolling</b> along behind them. My fancy was soaring out to my father upon the waters, when a word from Jim brought it back on to the grass like a broken- winged gull.|$|R

5000|$|Aircraft directors, {{as their}} name implies, are {{responsible}} for directing all aircraft movement on the hangar and flight decks. They are enlisted Aviation Boatswain's Mates. They are colloquially known as Bears and those {{who work in the}} hangar go by the term Hangar Rat. On some carriers, commissioned officers known as flight deck officers also serve as aircraft directors. During flight operations or during a flight deck [...] "re-spot", there are typically about 12-15 yellowshirts on the flight deck, and they report directly to the [...] "handler". Although aircraft directors are often used at airports ashore, their function is particularly crucial in the confined flight deck environment where aircraft are routinely taxied within inches of one another, often with the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> and pitching beneath. Directors wear yellow and use a complex set of hand signals (lighted yellow wands at night) to direct aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} the atmosphere of pre-war Pearl Harbor, the producers staged the film in Hawaii and used current naval facilities. Many active duty military members stationed in Hawaii {{and members of the}} local population served as extras during the filming. The set at Rosarito Beach in the Mexican state of Baja California was used for scale model work as required. Formerly the set of Titanic (1997), Rosarito was the ideal location {{to recreate the}} death throes of the battleships in the Pearl Harbor attack. A large-scale model of the bow section of [...] mounted on a gimbal produced an authentic rolling and submerging of the doomed battleship. Production Engineer Nigel Phelps stated that the sequence of the <b>ship</b> <b>rolling</b> {{out of the water and}} slapping down would involve one of the [...] "biggest set elements" [...] to be staged. Matched with computer generated imagery, the action had to reflect precision and accuracy throughout. In addition, to simulate the ocean, the film crew used a massive stadium-like [...] "bowl" [...] filled with water. The bowl was built in Honolulu, Hawaii and cost nearly $8 million. Today the bowl is used for scuba training and deep water fishing tournaments.|$|E

50|$|In many ways, the new {{satellite}} capability on the Annapolis {{paved the}} way for future communications in the Navy and later for worldwide communications. During this infancy, satellites were low orbiting meaning that satellites were available only for short durations; often measured in 5-15 minute intervals. Geostationary satellites were not available for military use until some years later. Although the satellite tracking capability was a success, it did have its problems in these early periods. The use of unproven gyroscopes to keep the satellite dish stable due to the <b>ship's</b> <b>rolling</b> and pitching in stormy and salty conditions while tracking the low orbiting satellites was a challenge for the electronics crew, often spending many hours tweaking and adjusting the equipment. During UNREP (Underway replenishment) operations with another ship, the satellite equipment was secured due to safety concerns because of its high power emissions.|$|R
