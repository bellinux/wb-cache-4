40|$|Cercospora leaf <b>spot</b> of <b>olives</b> is {{a serious}} defoliating disease {{attributed}} to Pseudocercospora cladosporioides. Although the disease is well distributed throughout olive growing regions of the world, its epidemiology and population structure remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the genetic variability of Spanish isolates of P. cladosporioides using DNA sequence data from the ITS region, as well as two protein-coding genes, actin and calmodulin. Phylogenetic data obtained here support P. cladosporioides as closely related to other Pseudocercospora species that cluster within Mycosphaerella. Spanish isolates clustered in two clades: isolates from Catalonia were different from those collected in Andalusia. However, isolates appeared to be genetically relatively homogeneous, suggesting that chemical control of this disease via a managed spraying programme may prove a viable option for controlling the disease in Spai...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{one-step}} RT-PCR protocol to detect and identify {{each of the eight}} viruses most commonly found in olive trees namely: Arabis mosaic virus (Ar-MV), Cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Olive leaf yellowing associated virus (OLYaV), <b>Olive</b> latent ring <b>spot</b> virus (OLRSV), <b>Olive</b> latent virus- 1 (OLV- 1), Olive latent virus- 2 (OLV- 2), and Strawberry latent ring spot virus (SLRSV). We have as-sayed 345 samples collected from olive fields in Italian areas in which national and local olive tree cultivars and selections are grown. The average percentage virus in-fection of olive trees was 32. 8 %. Among the eight virus-es assayed, only OLYaV (20. 9 %), SLRSV (7. 8 %) and CLRV (4. 9 %) were detected. The most common virus was OLYaV, which was found at a high percentage in southern Italy.

50|$|Wanting to {{find out}} the {{connection}} between Killer Croc and her mother, Olive explains everything to Maps, Pom, and Colton, the three promising to help Olive. Maps figures that the only place Croc could be hiding is in the North Hall, though the group needs Colton's fireworks bag to get through a blocked tunnel to the hall, which is in the headmaster's office. Luckily, a dance was being held that night, creating a diversion for the group. On their way to the North Hall, <b>Olive</b> <b>spots</b> a figure she assumes is Batman following them, and shoots it out of the sky with a crossbow she took from the headmaster's office. Olive finds it is the blonde boy, Tristan, who has been affected by the Langstrom Virus, causing him to sometimes become a mutated half-bat creature. He explains that he knows Olive from the night the North Hall burned down when she was sleepwalking and he flew down to save her.|$|R
40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the effect of climatic {{conditions}} on the development of peacock leaf <b>spot</b> of <b>olive,</b> field-operational models predicting disease outbreaks are lacking. With the aim of developing such models, a 10 -year survey was conducted to relate leaf infection to climate parameters that can be easily monitored in the field. As outbreaks of disease are known to be linked to rain, models were evaluated for their ability to predict whether infection would occur following a rain event, depending on air temperature and duration of relative humidity above 85 %. A total of 134 rain events followed by confirmed leaf infection and 191 rain events not followed by detectable infection were examined. The field data were adequately fitted (both specificity and sensitivity > 0 Æ 97) with either a multilayer neural network or with two of six tested regression models describing high boundary values of high humidity duration, above which no infection occurred over the temperature range, and low boundary values below which no infection occurred. The data also allowed the selection of a model successfully relating the duration of latent period (time between infection and the first detection of leaf spots) as a function of air temperature after the beginning of rain (R 2 > 0 Æ 98). The predictive abilities of these models were confirmed during 2 years of testing in commercial olive orchards in southern France. They should thus provide useful forecasting tools for the rational application of treatments and foster a reduction in fungicide use against this major disease of olive...|$|R
2500|$|In Europe, {{clutches}} {{are typically}} laid in April, and usually contain {{five or six}} eggs but clutches with as few as three {{and as many as}} ten have been recorded. The eggs are laid in early morning usually at daily intervals. On average the eggs of the nominate species measure [...] and weigh [...] Small for the size of the bird, they are typically pale blue-green with close specks and <b>spots</b> of <b>olive</b> brown, but show much variation in ground and marking. The eggs are incubated for 21–22 days by the female who is fed on the nest by the male. The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes. They are brooded by the female for the first 5–10 days and fed by both parents. Initially the parents eat the faecal sacs of the nestlings but as the chicks grow larger they defecate {{on the edge of the}} nest. The nestlings open their eyes 7 to 8 days after hatching. Their body feathers start to appear after around 8 days and the primary wing feathers after 10 days. For several days before they are ready to leave the nest the chicks clamber around the nearby branches. They fledge at around 27 days. The parents then continue to feed the chicks for several more weeks. They also protect the chicks from predators as their ability to fly is poor making them very vulnerable. On average only 3 or 4 chicks survive to fledge successfully. Some nests are lost to predators but an important factor causing nestling mortality is starvation. Magpie eggs hatch asynchronously and if the parents have difficulty finding sufficient food the last chicks to hatch are unlikely to survive. Only a single brood is reared unless disaster overtakes the first clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{height of}} the shell varies between 10 mm and 15 mm. The solid, {{imperforate}} shell has a conical shape.

The sutures are linear, becoming a trifle impressed around the body whorl. The about 7 whorls are planulate, densely spirally striate, the striae stronger on the base. The penultimate whorl is a trifle projecting above the suture. The body whorl is obtusely subangular at the periphery. The aperture is triangular-ovate.

40|$|Rockfishes of {{the genus}} Sebastes {{comprise}} {{one of the most}} important and heavily utilized groups of commercial and recreational fishes occurring off California. In this study, carried out primarily in the 1980 s, we examined various aspects of life history for the nearshore rockfishes and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod off central California. The following species of rockfishes were those primarily considered within this study: black, black-and-yellow, blue, canary, China, copper, gopher, grass, green <b>spotted,</b> kelp, <b>olive,</b> rosy, starry, vermilion, yelloweye, and yellow-tail. During the study, 21 species of rockfish and 8 additional species of fish, including cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod, were tagged and released to study patterns of movement. Of 7332 tagged fish, 197 (3 %) representing 15 species, were recaptured. Of these, only three species (canary and yellowtail rockfishes and lingcod) manifested substantial movement. Most nearshore rockfishes appear to be highly residential. Age and growth parameters were determined for 15 species of rockfish. Whole otoliths were the primary structure utilized for ageing. Most nearshore rockfishes examined appear to have lifespans of moderate longevity, with maximum ages between 20 and 30 years. Weight-length relationships were calculated for 16 species of rockfish and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod. Reproductive patterns were determined for 18 species of rockfish and size at sexual maturation for 17 of these species. The majority of nearshore rockfishes appear to release larvae during the winter-spring period. However, timing of larval extrusion is species specific and must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General food habits were described for 11 species of rockfish. An Appendix, summarizing life-history characteristics for the 17 most commonly encountered species in this study, is included. We conclude that the nearshore rockfishes are a valuable marine resource to the State of California and should be managed with the realization that, as with many of the world's fishery resources, they are vulnerable to human impacts and over exploitation...|$|R
