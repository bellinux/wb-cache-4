40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate a 1600 -pound, six-legged, gasoline- powered, self-contained, man-carrying, hydraulically-actuated, walking ma-chine built by Sutherland, Sproull and Associates. We were interested in the task of programming the control computer, the problems of operator control, and the performance of the vehicle. The walking machine presents two technical problems. The first is how best to permit the operator to control it. A control stick and two foot pedals provide operator inputs, and we connected them in various ways to give the driver control of the machine's path, direction, and speed. In addition, we experimented with different algorithms to select the particular uses of particular legs. The second technical problem posed by the walking machine comes about be-cause of the topology of the hydraulic circuits that actuate it. Rather than using a separate servomechanism for each joint, the hydraulic circuits of this machine permit actuators from several of its joints to be made a part of a single hydraulic circuit. Parallel connections of actuators permit leg to share load equally; series connections force them to move synchronously. By <b>setting</b> <b>valves</b> to establish series and parallel hydraulic circuits, the control computer can obtain coordinated joint motions without further direct action. We learned {{a great deal about the}} strengths and weaknesses of this approach to leg coordination. -. [...] -Our general methodology was direct experimentation. The machine was used for experiments with walking from October 1982 until August 1983. We operated the machine in a parking lot adjacent to the laboratory that housed it. Three operators became reasonably adept at controlling it. We made two video tapes of its operation and had numerous demonstrations for government, industry, and academic visitors. This report presents the technical results of this work. In order to avoid duplica-tion of material already published, this report presumes its reader to be familiar with the material covered in the book, A Walking Robot, which describes the machine...|$|E
40|$|Management {{and supply}} of water in an urban water {{distribution}} system is a complex process, which include various complexities like pressure variations across the network depending on topography, demand variations depending on customers’ requirement and unaccounted water etc. Applying automatic control methods to water distribution systems {{is a way to}} improve the management of water distribution. There have been some attempts in recent years to develop optimal control algorithms to assist in the operation of complex water distribution systems. The difficulties involved by these hydraulic systems such as non-linearity, and diurnal demand patterns make the choice of a suitable automatic control method a challenge. For this purpose, this study intends to investigate the applicability of different controllers which would be able to meet the targets as quickly as possible and without creating undue transients. As a first step towards application of different controllers, PD and PID linear controllers have been designed for pump control and valve control in water distribution systems. Then a Dynamic Inversion based nonlinear controller has been designed by considering the non-linearities in the system. Here, different cases considering the effects of initial conditions used, linearization methods used, time step used for integration and selection of gains etc., have been studied before arriving at best controller. These controllers have been designed for both the flow control problems and level control problems. It is found that Dynamic Inversion-based nonlinear controller outperforms other controllers. It is well known that the performance of controllers is much dependent on the tuning of the gains (parameters). Thus in this study various alternative techniques such as Ziegler [...] Nichols rules (ZNPID), Genetic algorithms (GAPID) and fuzzy algorithms (FZPID) have been studied and a comparative study has been made Although with all the three gain tuning methods, required states have reached their target values, but the responses vary much in reaching to final targets. The self-tuned FZPID controller outperforms other two controllers, especially with regard to overshoots and the time taken to tune the gains for each problem. Further, an optimal DI controller is developed for the over determined case with more controls and less targets. Energy loss is considered as an objective function and normal DI controller equations are considered as constraints. Hence, an attempt is made to reduce the energy minimization in water distribution system by formulating an optimal control problem using optimal Dynamic Inversion concept. Finally, leakage reduction model is developed based on excessive pressure minimization problem by locating valves optimally as well as by <b>setting</b> <b>valves</b> optimally. For this purpose, optimization problem is solved using Pattern search algorithms and hydraulic analysis is carried out using EPANET program...|$|E

50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} <b>valve</b> setup (when <b>setting</b> <b>valve</b> clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled.|$|R

But instead of having both <b>sets</b> of <b>valves</b> open at the start of each ignition, only the trouble-free valves would be used.
