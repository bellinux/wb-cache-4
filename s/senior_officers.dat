5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th {{century was}} the corps of protectores, which contained cadet <b>senior</b> <b>officers.</b> Although protectores {{were supposed to be}} soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice to admit to the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of <b>senior</b> <b>officers).</b> The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school and pool of staff officers available to carry out special tasks for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector would normally be granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Thảo's main partner Phát headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base — the country's {{military}} headquarters — {{to capture}} {{it with an}} assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops. At the time, most of the <b>senior</b> <b>officers</b> had been in meetings with American officials at Tan Son Nhut {{since the start of the}} morning, and Khánh left at 12:30. The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator was supposed to have closed the gate so Khánh would be held up, but left them open. Some of the other <b>senior</b> <b>officers</b> in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control.|$|E

5|$|De la Colonie {{was one of}} the few to escape, but the Elector of Bavaria {{had lost}} many of his best troops which was to have a {{profound}} effect on the ability of the Franco-Bavarian forces to face the Allies in the rest of the campaign. Very few of the men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector's and Marsin's army. Included amongst this number, however, were the Comte d'Arco and his second-in-command, the Marquis de Maffei, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the Battle of Blenheim. Of the 22,000 Allied troops engaged, over 5,000 had become casualties, overwhelming the hospitals that Marlborough had set up in Nördlingen. Amongst the Allied fatalities were six lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, and 28 brigadiers, colonels and lieutenant-colonels, reflecting the exposed positions of <b>senior</b> <b>officers</b> as they led their men forward in the assaults.
