25|$|Young {{was born}} John Inglis Young in Bridgeton, Glasgow, Scotland, {{and his family}} emigrated to Australia, {{arriving}} in Sydney on Australia Day (26 January) 1962 when he was aged 11. After finishing schooling, he started an apprenticeship as a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker.</b> Initially performing as John Young, his first involvement in music began in late 1967 when he formed a band, Elm Tree, with schoolmates.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} {{fourteen}} he became interested in aeronautics after reading novels by Jules Verne. He {{is known to have}} written a letter to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1923. He studied at an Odessa trade school, where he learned to be a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker.</b> After graduation he apprenticed at a hydraulics fitting plant. He was first trained as a fitter, then moved to lathe operator.|$|E
25|$|The Davis–Bacon Act {{was entered}} into the United States Code as 40 U.S.C. §§ 276a-276a-5, but has now been re-codified as 40 U.S.C. 3141-3148. The Act covers four main areas of construction: residential, heavy, buildings, and highway. Within these areas are further classifications, {{including}} craft positions such as plumber, carpenter, cement mason/concrete finisher, electrician, insulator, laborer, lather, painter, power equipment operator, roofer, <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> truck driver, and welder.|$|E
50|$|In July 1959, {{the union}} {{merged with the}} rival National Union of <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Braziers to form the National Union of <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Coppersmiths.|$|R
5000|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1836 as a split from the [...] "Dublin Tinsmiths and <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> Society". It {{remained}} very small for many years, with only forty members in 1896. It affiliated to the National Amalgamated Society of <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers,</b> but when in 1920 that federation became the National Union of <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Braziers, it became independent again, adopting the name National Union of <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Gas Meter Makers. In 1967, it adopted its final name, and by 1970 it had 943 members.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> members {{assisted}} {{in the building of}} buildings, experimental machinery, and atomic weapons-making equipment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of the Manhattan Project. In 1946, the <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> became one of the founding members of the Atomic Trades and Labor Council.|$|R
25|$|Walker {{left school}} {{to work at}} a factory and on a river boat, then joined the United States Merchant Marine at the age of 17 in the last months of World War II. After leaving the Merchant Marine, he worked doing odd jobs in Brownwood, Texas, Long Beach, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada, where he worked as a doorman at the Sands Hotel. Walker was also {{employed}} as a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> and a nightclub bouncer.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 white sheet metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, {{one of six}} {{children}} of a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> Taaffe first joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, before joining the Labour Party where he was attracted to the radical element in the Liverpool Labour Party.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of metal moldings in buildings {{also created a}} problem for the union. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America claimed jurisdiction over trim and moldings, which had previously been made of wood. The carpenters' union had won a jurisdictional award from an arbitrator in New York City in the spring of 1909. But the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> demanded that the Building Trades Department (BTD) of the AFL issue a ruling. By a 3-to-1 majority, delegates to the Building Trades convention voted in favor of the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers.</b> The carpenters, then the second-largest union in the AFL, withdrew from the Building Trades and initiated a series of jurisdictional strikes against the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> at job sites nationwide. The BTD retaliated by asking AFL president Samuel Gompers to revoke the carpenter's union charter. Instead, Gompers led the AFL executive council in demanding that the BTD reinstate the carpenters' union. The Building Trades did so in 1910, but continued to vote in favor of the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> Workers' claims on work. The carpenters' union disaffiliated again. The carpenters' union continued to conduct strikes against the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers,</b> and increasingly won the support of building contractors and local building trades councils. The National Board of Jurisdictional Awards also voted in favor of the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers.</b> But the pressure by the much larger carpenters' union proved too great, and the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> conceded jurisdiction over interior work in 1926.|$|R
2500|$|In the November 1996 {{election}} he defeated retired <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> Gordon B. Sherman, winning 84% of the vote. He {{advocated for}} the expansion of the urban growth boundary, including bringing in the South Hillsboro Reserve area. [...] "I view the city as a living, breathing thing. And if it doesn't grow, it dies. I think growth was necessary to keep the town alive and healthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dean {{graduated}} from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts {{in political science}} in 1971. As a freshman, he requested specifically to room with an African-American. The university housing office complied and Dean roomed with two Southern black students and one white student from Pennsylvania. One of Dean's roommates was Ralph Dawson, {{the son of a}} <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> in Charleston, South Carolina and today a New York City labor lawyer. Dawson said of Dean: ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1962, James {{moved to}} England, {{where he made}} his home. During his first three years in London, he shared a flat with the Australian film {{director}} Bruce Beresford (disguised as [...] "Dave Dalziel" [...] {{in the first three}} volumes of James' memoirs), was a neighbour of Australian artist Brett Whiteley, became acquainted with Barry Humphries (disguised as [...] "Bruce Jennings") and had a variety of occasionally disastrous short-term jobs (<b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> library assistant, photo archivist, market researcher).|$|E

It merged with the competing National Society of Coppersmiths, Braziers and <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> in 1959, renaming itself the National Union of <b>Sheet</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Coppersmiths. Following its 1967 merger with the Heating and Domestic Engineers' Union, it took its final, lengthy name.|$|R
2500|$|Taylor {{was born}} to Doug and Liz Taylor on 13 August 1960 in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. He left school {{at the age of}} 16 and after holding a few jobs {{including}} as a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> he would spend most of his early working days making ceramic toilet roll handles, for which he earned £52 a week. [...] Although he liked to play darts as a child, he never took up the game seriously until 1986 when he moved into a terraced house in Burslem, living near to Eric Bristow's pub the Crafty Cockney.|$|E
2500|$|Tobin {{immigrated to}} Boston, Massachusetts, in 1890.

2500|$|Gehrig {{was born}} in 1903 at 309 East 94th Street in the Yorkville {{neighborhood}} of Manhattan; he weighed almost [...] at birth. He was the second of four children of German immigrants, Christina Foch (1881–1954) and Heinrich Gehrig (1867–1946). His father was a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> by trade who was frequently unemployed due to alcoholism, and his mother, a maid, was the main breadwinner and disciplinarian in the family. His two sisters died {{at an early age}} from whooping cough and measles; a brother also died in infancy. From an early age, Gehrig helped his mother with work, doing tasks such as folding laundry and picking up supplies from the local stores. Gehrig spoke German during his childhood. In 1910, he lived with his parents at 2266 Amsterdam Avenue in Washington Heights. In 1920, the family resided on 8th Avenue in Manhattan. His name was often anglicized to Henry Louis Gehrig and he was known as [...] "Lou" [...] so {{that he would not be}} confused with his identically named father, who was known as Henry.|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} {{began to}} resolve itself on September 4. After submitting his membership application on August 28, Foster took the next step, {{which was a}} four-hour written and manual examination by Industrial arts instructors at the Max Hayes Trade School (a Cleveland public high school). Foster failed the tests. On September 11, the union declined to admit Foster as a member. After a stormy three-hour membership meeting, UFM officials demanded to see the tests and test scoring results, and threatened to picket on August 19 if UFM leaders felt the test was inaccurately administered or graded. Local 65 agreed to show UFM officials the test and test results, per the August 4 agreement. At a five-hour meeting on September 13 in Mayor Locher's office, UFM's representative (George A. Oden, chair of the industrial arts department as Patrick Henry Junior High School) found that Foster was tested fairly. Concerns were raised about the test administration, however. Ellsworth H. Harpole, executive secretary of Cleveland Community Relations Board and a former <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> agreed to retest Foster on the manual test. [...] To ensure a fair administration of the test, Thomas E. McDonald, business manager for the BCTD; Emile Bourge, a representative from the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity; and George Doler, {{a representative of the}} Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, were permitted to attend the manual retest. Local 65 membership agreed to the retest.|$|E
