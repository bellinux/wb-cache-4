40|$|AbstractMonthly gravity {{solutions}} of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) reveal {{three areas}} in Antarctica with striking interannual mass trends. The positive mass trend in Enderby Land, East Antarctica, is poorly understood because of uncertainties {{in the surface}} ice-sheet mass balance, post-glacial rebound (PGR), and processing of GRACE data. In this study, we compare the GRACE mass trends with values estimated from in situ <b>snow-stake</b> measurements, and Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data. The mass trends estimated from ICESat data show a strong correlation with GRACE mass trends. In contrast, the <b>snow-stake</b> data show discrepancies with temporal variations in GRACE mass, especially in 2006. The discrepancies are probably associated with basal ice-sheet outflow, which is difficult to observe using snow stakes. We conclude {{that the bulk of}} the GRACE mass trend can be explained by snow accumulation and basal ice-sheet outflow...|$|E

40|$|Glaciological {{observations}} {{were conducted in}} 2012 and 2013 at the SIGMA-A site on the northwest Greenland ice sheet (78 ° 03 ’ 06 ”N, 67 ° 37 ’ 42 ”W, 1490 m a. s. l.) {{as part of the}} Snow Impurity and Glacial Microbe effects on abrupt warming in the Arctic (SIGMA) project. 　The meteorological conditions during the two {{observations were}} quite different. 　The meteorological condition during the 2012 observation period was warm, and heavy rainfall occurred during the observation period, thus the snow was very wet. 　In contrast, the meteorological condition during the observation period in 2013 was cold, with a blowing snow event, thus the snow was quite dry. The glaciological observations in 2012 consisted of 1) <b>snow-stake</b> measurements, 2) snow pit observations, 3) grain size observations for validation of satellite-derived snow products, 4) snow specific surface area measurements using a near-infrared camera, 5) snow sampling for chemical analyses, and 6) drilling of firn cores with a hand auger. 　The glaciological observations in 2013 consisted of 1) <b>snow-stake</b> measurements, 2) snow pit observations, and 3) snow sampling for chemical analyses...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} annual layers for {{reconstructing the}} past environment at annual resolution from ice cores, we employed <b>snow-stake</b> data back to 1972, tritium content, solid electrical conductivity measurements (ECM) and stratigraphic properties for the 73 m ice core at the H 72 site, east Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. The average annual surface mass balance at H 72 is 307 mm a- 1 w. e. {{during the last}} 27 years from continuous accumulation data, 317 mm a- 1 w. e. according to the densification model and 311 mm a- 1 w. e. according to the average surface mass balance for 167 years based on annual-layer counting. The ECM age is closely coincident with tritium age, and corresponds with the <b>snow-stake</b> record back to AD 1972 from the surface to 15 m depth. The H 72 ice core is dated as AD 1831 by ECM at 73. 16 m depth. The time series of yearly surface mass balance at H 72 shows an almost constant 311 mm a- 1 w. e. for the last 167 years. The oxygen-isotope records indicate a significant trend to lower values, with negative gradient of 1. 7 (100 years) - 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} micrometeorological data {{collected}} at Halley Research Station, Antarctica, to estimate monthly totals of snow sublimation. Direct sublimation from the snow surface is calculated using bulk-transfer formulae, while the sublimation of blowing snow is estimated using {{a model for}} suspended-particle number density and individual particle sublimation rates. During the winter months, sublimation losses are negligible, but between November and March sublimation removes around 25 % of the snowfall. Surface sublimation and sublimation of blowing snow make roughly equal contributions to this total. Estimates of sublimation using micrometeorological data agree well with estimates made from daily <b>snow-stake</b> measurements...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} an {{underlying}} assumption in many studies that near-surface layers imaged by ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{can be interpreted as}} depositional markers or isochrones. It has been shown that GPR layers can be approximately reproduced from the measured electrical properties of ice, but these material layers are generally narrower and more closely spaced than can be resolved by typical GPR systems operating in the range 50 - 400 MHz. Thus GPR layers should be interpreted as interference patterns produced from closely spaced and potentially discontinuous material layers, and should not be assumed to be interpretable as precise markers of isochrones. We present 100 MHz GPR data from Lyddan Ice Rise, Antarctica, in which near-surface (< 50 m deep) layers are clearly imaged. The growth of the undulations in these layers with depth is approximately linear, implying that, rather than resulting from a pattern of vertical strain rate, they do correspond to some pattern of snowfall variation. Furthermore, comparison of the GPR layers with <b>snow-stake</b> measurements suggests that around 80 % of the rms variability in mean annual accumulation is present in the GPR layers. The observations suggest that, at least in this case, the GPR layers do approximate isochrones, and that patterns of snow accumulation over Lyddan Ice Rise are dominated by extremely persistent spatial variations with only a small residual spatial variability. If this condition is shown to be widely applicable it may reduce the period required for measurements of surface elevation change to be taken as significant indications of mass imbalance...|$|E
