A total 132 of (96 females and 36 males) of Cobb 500 broiler breeder chicken, 45 weeks old were used in this study. These birds were randomly distributed equally into four dietary treatments with three replicates each. Each treatment group constituted of 32 females and 12 males. Treatment groups were as following: T 1 : Birds fed the basal diet without any addition (0 Zn) (control), T 2 : Birds fed diet supplemented with 50 mg Zn (pure zinc) /kg of diet, T 3 : Birds fed diet supplemented with 75 mg Zn (pure zinc) /kg of diet and T 4 : Birds fed diet supplemented with 100 mg Zn (pure zinc) /kg of diet. Hens were artificially inseminated with semen from the same treatments during 51, 54, 57, 60, 63 and 66 weeks of bird ages.

40|$|The sialic acids (Sias) are {{a uniquely}} {{diverse group of}} sugars that are {{ubiquitous}} {{on a wide range}} of glycoproteins and glycolipids. They are peripherally located on the glycan structures that these molecules display: presenting salient features for molecular interactions. Sialosides have recently been identified in both human and bovine cervical mucins (Andersch- Björkman et al. 2007; Pluta et al. 2012; Tharmalingam et al. unpublished) and are modulated during the oestrous cycle in cows (Tharmalingam et al. unpublished) suggesting a dynamic and responsive role in regulating the environment within the female reproductive tract (FRT). Recent proteomic and transcriptional studies have identified Siglecs, protein that bind specifically to Sias, in both human and bovine sperm (Lalancette et al. 2008; Peddinti et al. 2008; Ma et al. 2012; Amaral et al. 2013) and these are possible sperm surface Sialic acid (SA) binding proteins. In this study, Siglec proteins have been identified at specific locations on bovine, human and ovine sperm. They are also widely expressed on the epithelium of the bovine male reproductive tract (MRT) and the glandular components of the male accessory glands. In associated work, soluble or shed Siglec isoforms have also been provisionally identified as components of epididymal and seminal fluid (Hazem AlMhanna, personal communication). The influence of Sias on <b>sperm</b> mucus <b>penetration</b> was investigated and an unconjugated form of SA (Neu 5 Ac) increased mucus penetration in a dose dependent manner indicating a specific SA-mediated effect interaction between sperm and cervical mucus.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study effects of macromolecules on stallion sperm capacitation and fertilization as determined by penetration of bovine zona-free and equine partially zona-removed oocytes. Stallion sperm were capacitated in TYH medium (modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate) supplemented with either 1 mg/mL of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) or 4 mg/ mL of BSA. Capacitation was induced with 8 bromoadenosine cyclic monophosphate (8 BrcAMP; 0. 5 mM) alone or in combination with 0. 1 μM of ionomycin. Intraspecies gametes were co-incubated in TYH/PVA or TYH/ BSA for 18 to 20 h. For zona-free bovine oocytes, penetration rate (35 %) with the combination of 8 BrcAMP and ionomycin in PVA-containing medium was higher (P < 0. 05) than any treatment in BSA-containing medium (5 to 6 %). A similar study was conducted using equine oocytes with partially removed zonae. Sperm capacitated and used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in PVA-containing medium had higher penetration rates (P < 0. 01) than sperm in BSA-containing medium (54 vs. 11 %). The effect of equine preovulatory follicular fluid on bovine oocyte penetration was assessed. Bovine oocytes were matured in tissue culture medium- 199 with 0, 20, 50, or 100 % equine preovulatory follicular fluid, and 1 IU/mL of equine chorionic gonadotropin. Stallion sperm were treated with 8 BrcAMP + ionomycin in PVA- or BSA-containing media. The penetration rates of bovine zona-free oocytes by stallion sperm were again higher with PVA (47 %) than BSA (18 %; P < 0. 01). Penetration rates of oocytes matured in 100 % follicular fluid were higher (P < 0. 05) than for oocytes matured with 0 % follicular fluid. The effects of equine follicular fluid and PVA/BSA during sperm capacitation on standard bovine IVF were examined. Culture of bovine oocytes with equine follicular fluid did not affect oocyte maturation or penetration rates after IVF. Bovine sperm capacitated with heparin in PVA-containing medium yielded lower (P < 0. 05) fertilization rates than those capacitated in BSA-containing medium when incubated with both zona-intact and zona-free bovine oocytes. In summary, PVA was superior to BSA for ionophore-induced capacitation of equine <b>sperm</b> for <b>penetration</b> of zona-free bovine oocytes or partially zona-removed equine oocytes, but not for standard bovine IVF with bovine sperm.

50|$|Clomifene citrate (or clomid) is the {{medication}} {{which is most}} commonly used to treat anovulation. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to respond {{as if there was}} an estrogen deficit in the body, in effect increasing the production of gonadotrophins. It is relatively easy and convenient to use. Clomifene appears to inhibit estrogen receptors in hypothalamus, thereby inhibiting negative feedback of estrogen on gonadotrophin production. It may also result in direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It also has an effect on cervical mucus quality and uterine mucosa, which might affect <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> and survival, hence its early administration during the menstrual cycle.

40|$|Abstract. In porcine oocytes, the {{function}} of the zona pellucida (ZP) with regard to <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> or prevention of polyspermy is not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the ZP on <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> during in vitro fertilization (IVF). We collected in vitro-matured oocytes with a first polar body (ZP+ oocytes). Some of them were freed from the ZP (ZP − oocytes) by two treatments (pronase and mechanical pipetting), and the effects of these treatments on <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> parameters (<b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> rate and numbers of penetrated sperm per oocyte) were evaluated. There was no evident difference in the parameters between the two groups. Secondly, we compared the <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> parameters of ZP+ and ZP − oocytes using frozen-thawed epididymal spermatozoa from four boars. <b>Sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> into ZP+ oocytes was found to be accelerated relative to ZP − oocytes. Thirdly, we evaluated the <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> of ZP+ and ZP − oocytes at 1 − 10 h after IVF (3 h gamete co-incubation). The proportions of oocytes penetrated by sperm increased significantly with time in both groups; however, the number of penetrated sperm per oocyte did not increase in ZP − oocytes. Finally, we performed IVF using ZP − oocytes divided into control (3 h) and prolonged gamete co-incubation (5 h) groups. Greater numbers of sperm penetrated in the 5 h group than in the control group. These results suggest that the ZP and oolemma are not competent factors for prevention of polyspermy in our present porcine IVF system. However, it appears that ZP removal is one of the possibilities for reducing polyspermic penetration in vitro in pigs...|$|E

All subjects were investigated and, if necessary, treated {{for any kind of}} cervicitis or vaginitis prior to starting cervical mucus study. The subjects had not used hormonal contraception for at least three months prior to investigation. They were counseled to use condoms during this study and also to refrain from intercourse during the period of cervical mucus sampling. Follicular development and endometrial thickness were analyzed by transvaginal sonography. Cervical mucus examination, <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> test, and transvaginal sonography were performed during the control cycle and during the first cycle of Uniplant use. Blood samples were taken for the measurement of estradiol, LH, and progesterone. Cervical mucus and <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> tests were evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. In the treated cycle, when cervical mucus reached a score of 8 – 10, Uniplant was inserted, independent of the day of the cycle. Cervical mucus was then collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h later until a marked change in volume, consistency, ferning, spinnbarkheit, and cellularity was observed. All samples were also used for <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> test. Preovulatory estradiol and LH peak decreased significantly compared to pre-implant insertion. Progesterone levels were within the normal limit. Cervical mucus and <b>sperm</b> <b>penetration</b> tests were not affected by Uniplant in the first 12 h.

40|$|Spawned-out gametes {{were used}} {{throughout}} the experiments. The observation was made under a phase-contrast microscope. Sperm of Mytilus edulis undergo acrosome reaction by various stimuli, e. g., contact with eggs or glass surface, addition of egg-sea water, etc. Main morphological changes involved in the reaction are the complete breakdown of the acrosome and the protrusion of a long (12 p) filament in its place(Figure 1,A,B). In case of fertilization, the sperm react in the acrosomal region when they come into actual contact with the vitelline membrane. It was found that a substance which dissolves the vitelline membrane is released by {{the breakdown of the}} acrosome. The filament, though not detected as such, is believed to extend into the egg cytoplasm. A penetrating filament can be observed in case the sperm react on the "vitelline membrane and perivitelline layer preparation" which is obtained by rupture of the (fertilized or unfertilized) egg. Sperm entrance proceeds normally when the tail of fertilizing sperm is markedly harmed by a short exposure to hypotonic (30 %) sea water immediately after attachment. It is postulated that the fertilizing spermatozoon is passively drawn into the egg with the aid of the filament by a certain dynamical system operating in the egg. The supernumerary spermatozoa also react at the egg surface, the filament likewise penetrating through the egg cortex. In 10 - 15 seconds after the attachment of the sperm head to the vitelline membrane, the spermatozoa are detached by 4 - 6,u; the filament is clearly visible between the egg and the detached spermatozoa. The detachment does not occur in killed eggs. In a rather dense solution of acrosome substances, not only the vitelline membrane but the perivitelline layer are dissolved away. In such naked eggs, entrance and detachment of sperm occur normally. It may be postulated that the detachment of the supernumerary sperm is also executed with the aid of the acrosome filament by a force produced in the egg protoplasm. The detachment is regarded as a morphological representation of the block to polyspermy. A dynamical system is activated in the egg by a stimulus of (fertilizing) <b>sperm.</b> The <b>penetration</b> of the acrosome filament is indispensable for the full establishm' ent of the block to polyspermy. Sperm which have undergone the acrosome reaction before contact with eggs lose their fertilizing capacity (Table 1). The egg has a jelly-hull about 10 μ in the thickness. The jelly is supposed to increase the irritability of spermatozoa, to react on the vitelline membrane and thus facilitates fertilization (Table 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{candidates}} {{have been proposed}} as zona pellucida-binding proteins. Without precluding a role for any of those candidates, we focused on mouse sperm protein ZP 3 R/sp 56, which is localized in the acrosomal matrix. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the role of ZP 3 R/sp 56 in mouse fertilization. We expressed recombinant ZP 3 R/sp 56 as a secreted protein in HEK 293 cells and purified it from serum-free, conditioned medium. In the presence of reducing agents, the recombinant ZP 3 R/sp 56 exhibited a molecular weight similar to that observed for the native ZP 3 R/sp 56. Reminiscent of the native protein, recombinant ZP 3 R/sp 56 formed a high molecular weight, disulfide cross-linked oligomer consisting of six or more monomers under non-reducing conditions. Recombinant ZP 3 R/sp 56 bound to the zona pellucida of unfertilized eggs but not to 2 -cell embryos, indicating that the changes that take place in the zona pellucida at fertilization affected the interaction of this protein with the zona pellucida. The extent of in vitro fertilization was reduced in a dose-dependent manner when unfertilized eggs were preincubated with recombinant ZP 3 R/sp 56 (74 % drop at the maximum concentrations assayed). Eggs incubated with the recombinant protein showed an absence of or very few sperm in the perivitelline space, suggesting that the reduction in the fertilization rate is caused by the inhibition of <b>sperm</b> binding and/or <b>penetration</b> through the zona pellucida. These results indicate that sperm ZP 3 R/sp 56 is important for sperm-zona interactions during fertilization and support the concept that the acrosomal matrix plays an essential role in mediating the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida...|$|R
