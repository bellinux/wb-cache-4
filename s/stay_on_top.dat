25|$|When Strom {{started his}} career in the NBA, he felt the most {{important}} aspect was to get the play right. Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that officials should admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, he brought up the idea of limited use of instant replay for shots made {{at the end of a}} period ("buzzer beaters") and three-point attempts. The NBA eventually adopted the use of instant replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002–03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style. As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1977–78 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988–89 NBA season. Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.|$|E

500|$|On its release, Amarte Es un Placer was {{met with}} mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis [...] gave it two-and-a-half out of five stars, noting that from the title [...] "one can deduce that the {{material}} consists of romantic music, mostly {{in the form of}} ballads". He felt that the horn sections on [...] "Sol, Arena y Mar" [...] and [...] "Quiero" [...] gave the songs a [...] "jazzy, sophisticated, adult-leaning feel" [...] and called [...] "Te Propongo Esta Noche" [...] "one of the album's most interesting songs". However, he criticized the inclusion of [...] "overblown ballads", citing [...] "No Me Fío" [...] as an example. Promis called the production [...] "flawless" [...] and concluded that ballads are [...] "what the fans have come to expect" [...] from Miguel. John Lannert of Billboard magazine was not impressed with the record; he panned [...] "Sol, Arena y Mar" [...] as a [...] "vapid, uptempo dance number". While Lannert regarded [...] "Soy Yo" [...] and [...] "Dormir Contigo" [...] as a [...] "pair of moving romantic ballads" [...] that could help the disc <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the Billboard Latin charts, he opined {{that it was time for}} Miguel to record an English-language disc and have Mariah Carey and her producers assist with the album. Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant felt that when the ballads [...] "pile on", it was like a [...] "Telemundo soap-opera overkill". Nonetheless, Catlin praised Miguel's [...] "timing" [...] on the uptempo songs and said his vocals makes the dance tunes more [...] "exciting".|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavior}} of Balaur. Because of the lack of skull material, it is impossible to determine by the shape of the teeth whether Balaur was a carnivore or a herbivore. The original description assumed it was carnivorous because it had been found that it was closely related to Velociraptor. Csiki speculated in 2010 that it may {{have been one of the}} apex predators in its limited island ecosystem, because of larger theropods not even the teeth have ever been found in Romania. He also believed that it likely used its double sickle claws for slashing prey, and that the atrophied state of its hands indicates that it probably did not use them to hunt. One of the original discoverers indicated that it [...] "was probably more of a kickboxer than a sprinter" [...] compared to Velociraptor, and was probably able to hunt larger animals than itself. However, more recent studies by Denver Fowler and others have shown that the foot anatomy of paravians like Balaur indicate that they used their large claws to grip and pin prey to the ground while flapping with their proto-wings to <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of their victim. Once it was worn out, they might have proceeded to feast while it was still alive as some modern birds of prey still do. Due to the shape of the claws, they would not have been effective in slashing attacks. The very short, fused metatarsus of Balaur and enlarged first claw, strange even by dromaeosaur standards, are thought to be consistent with these newer studies, lending further support to the idea that Balaur was a predator.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{just before}} the start of NBC's {{coverage}} of the World Series, Don Ohlmeyer, president of the network's West Coast entertainment division and former executive producer for NBC Sports, came under fire after publicly announcing that he hoped that the World Series would end in a four-game sweep. Ohlmeyer believed that baseball now lacked broad audience appeal (especially {{in the aftermath of the}} 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike). As opposed to teams from the three largest television markets (New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) in the U.S., the 1997 World Series featured the matchup of the upstart Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, which made their second World Series appearance in three years. In addition, Ohlmeyer feared that the World Series would disrupt NBC's efforts to attract enough viewers for its new fall roster in order to <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the ratings heap. Ohlmeyer said [...] "If the A channel called, I'd take the call." [...] Game 5 fell on a Thursday, which had long been the highest rated night on NBC's schedule, if not on all of television.|$|E
