5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting {{each other with a}} separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS <b>space-based</b> <b>observatory.</b> This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} the Hubble Space Telescope {{can be traced back}} as far as 1946, to the {{astronomer}} Lyman Spitzer's paper [...] "Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory". In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a <b>space-based</b> <b>observatory</b> would have over ground-based telescopes. First, the angular resolution (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by diffraction, rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as seeing. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5–1.0arcseconds, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05arcsec for a telescope with a mirror 2.5m in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observe infrared and ultraviolet light, which are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Progress {{toward the}} {{development}} of effective, practical solutions to <b>space-based</b> <b>observatory</b> scheduling problems within the HSTS scheduling framework is reported. HSTS was developed and originally applied {{in the context of}} the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) short-term observation scheduling problem. The work was motivated by the limitations of the current solution and, more generally, by the insufficiency of classical planning and scheduling approaches in this problem context. HSTS has subsequently been used to develop improved heuristic solution techniques in related scheduling domains and is currently being applied to develop a scheduling tool for the upcoming Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) mission. The salient architectural characteristics of HSTS and their relationship to previous scheduling and AI planning research are summarized. Then, some key problem decomposition techniques underlying the integrated planning and scheduling approach to the HST problem are described; research results indicate that these techniques provide leverage in solving <b>space-based</b> <b>observatory</b> scheduling problems. Finally, more recently developed constraint-posting scheduling procedures and the current SWAS application focus are summarized...|$|E
