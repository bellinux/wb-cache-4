5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not undergone FGM, but in 2000 <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had,</b> while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E

5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the resources to deal with large increases {{in the number of}} patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E

50|$|Advertisers are {{increasingly}} using the mobile Web {{as a platform}} to reach consumers. The total value of advertising on mobile was 2.2 billion dollars in 2007. A {{recent study by the}} Online Publishers Association, now called Digital Content Next (DCN), reported that about one-in-ten mobile Web users <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> made a purchase based on a mobile Web ad, while 23% <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> visited a Web site, 13% <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> requested more information about a product or service and 11% <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> gone to a store to check out a product.|$|R
5|$|Birmingham's fire {{department}} refused orders from Connor {{to turn the}} hoses on demonstrators again, and waded through {{the basement of the}} Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to clean up water from earlier fire-hose flooding. White business leaders met with protest organizers to try and arrange an economic solution but <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no control over politics. Protest organizers disagreed, saying that business leaders were positioned to pressure political leaders.|$|E
5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, May {{confirmed}} that pre-production work was continuing. He said the band had approved {{a team to}} start filming later in 2011, and Baron Cohen's eagerness had been the key to progress. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen {{dropped out of the}} role due to creative differences with the members of Queen. May <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> parted on good terms and said that the band had felt Cohen's presence would have been distracting.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{and some}} of his {{siblings}} <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been physically and psychologically abused by their father, Joseph Jackson. In 2003, Joseph admitted to whipping them as children, but has emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.|$|E
5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} of defiance, {{in the context of the}} {{campaign}} against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E

Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E

At 4:30a.m. on December 17, more than 18 hours behind schedule, the 1st SS Panzer Division rolled out of Lanzareth and headed northwest for Bucholz Station. The entire timetable of their advance on the River Meuse and Antwerp had been seriously slowed, allowing the Americans precious hours to move in reinforcements.|$|E

A barman <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> offered him $500 to do it; after a complex series of claims and counter-claims, the charges were dropped when a witness {{retracted}} his statement. Eddy attributed the allegation to a plot by former students to undermine sales of the second edition of Science and Health, just published. Her lawyer had to apply for an attachment order against her house to collect his fee.|$|E
