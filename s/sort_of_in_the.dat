500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E

5000|$|Haggard {{had loved}} Lefty Frizzell's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] since he {{first heard the}} song took a stab at {{recording}} it {{towards the end of}} his tenure with Capitol Records in the mid-seventies with unsatisfactory results. That version, which {{can be found on the}} box set Hag: The Studio Recordings 1969-1976, is more lighthearted and whimsical than the one Haggard would record in 1983, which possesses a delicate melancholy that somehow becomes uplifting mainly because of Haggard's masterful delivery of the words. The song topped the Billboard country singles chart, as did [...] "Someday When Things Are Good," [...] a song co-authored by Haggard and his wife Leona Williams. It also proved to be prophetic, as the couple would divorce that year. Williams had also written Haggard's recent hit [...] "You Take Me For Granted," [...] but Williams, who replaced Haggard's previous wife Bonnie Owens in the Strangers, had creative aspirations of her own that were not always appreciated by her husband. As Haggard wrote in his 1981 autobiography Sing Me Back Home, [...] "I'd reached the point in my career where I felt in charge of my music...When Leona tried to make a suggestion, I resented it. She resented my resentment. So it went. She kept saying she felt like an outsider...I couldn't understand why she got so upset by the press leaning toward good ol' Bonnie and the snide remarks about Leona coming in and breaking up my 'happy home.'" [...] The divorce would instigate a personal landslide for Haggard, who would spend the rest of the decade losing himself in a fog of alcohol and drugs, although initially it did not prevent him from scoring #1 hits. In fact, That's The Way Love Goes was his third hit LP for Epic in two years, not counting two separate duet albums with George Jones and Willie Nelson. While discussing his own song [...] "Bad Boy" [...] in the liner notes to Great Days: The John Prine Anthology, John Prine admitted, [...] "Around that time, I fell under the spell of Merle Haggard's songwriting.

40|$|This paper (Note 1) {{examines}} the form {{sort of in}} British men and women’s speech, and investigates {{whether there is a}} gender difference in the use of this form. We do so through corpus analysis of the British National Corpus (BNC). We contend there is no quantitative difference in the use of sort of in men and women’s speech. Contrary to general belief, we claim women do not use hedges more than men. However, there is a functional difference. Men and women use the item sort of for slightly different functions: in particular, women use these forms as politeness devices more often than men. The results of this study do not present any evidence to support the widespread claim that women use the forms sort of more than men do. There is no significant gender difference in the frequency of <b>sort</b> <b>of.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> light of these results, women’s allegedly greater usage of these forms could be regarded as persistent folklore. Furthermore, sort of has been treated mainly as a sign of powerlessness and uncertainty. Yet, this study indicates that it is a useful interpersonal resource, which both men and women seem to appreciate. When examining the affective function in greater detail, some marked gender differences emerge. The main finding is that positive affect is more common in women’s speech, whereas negative affect is clearly more frequent in men’s speech. In much of the research on gender differentiated conversational strategies, women’s language is presented as co-operative and men’s language as competitive. The results of this study show that, with respect to sort of, such a distinction cannot be drawn. Even if negative affect is more common in men’s than in women’s speech, by far the most instances of interpersonal function occur in essentially co-operative behaviour not only in women’s but also in men’s speech. This notion does not fit the description of men’s speech style being competitive and prone to conflict. Hence, {{the results of this study}} suggest that men use the marker sort of more co-operatively than many researchers allow for. </p...|$|E
