5000|$|Finally {{scales are}} applied. Slightly {{undersized}} holes {{incorporated into the}} inner surface enclose the bushings, which have truncated cone cross-section and are slightly undercut, forming a one-way interference fit when pressed into the generally softer and more elastic <b>scale</b> <b>material.</b> The result is a tight adhesive-free connection that nonetheless permits new identical-pattern scales to be quickly and easily applied.|$|E

40|$|There {{are over}} 1800 {{consumer}} products containing nanomaterials, which {{are defined as}} materials having at least one dimension less than 100 nm. At this <b>scale,</b> <b>materials</b> often take on novel properties compare to dissolved or larger <b>scale</b> <b>materials,</b> making them of interest to industry and of concern to environmental scientists.

50|$|The {{material}} {{used for}} multilayer systems is a bilayer of alternating elements, commonly Ni/Al, Al/Ti or Ti/a-Si. The metallic layer is usually 1 to 30 nm thick {{and can be}} arranged as horizontal or vertical nano <b>scale</b> <b>material</b> films and are {{a combination of a}} reactive and a low melting component. With increased bilayer thickness, the reaction velocity decreases and the reaction heat increases. Therefore, a specific balance between high reaction velocity and high reaction heat is necessary.|$|E

50|$|From 1845 to 1864 {{the factory}} was {{relatively}} inactive. In the latter year the Russell Manufacturing Company bought the property; in 1865 they erected the building {{immediately to the}} west of the original plant in a similar height, <b>scale,</b> <b>material,</b> and style. This was an auxiliary operation, complementing the main South Farms factories; Russell conducted manufacturing here for some ninety years. A plumbing products firm and then a lighting fixture company ran short-lived manufacturing operations here; the facilities were vacant in the late 1960s. Joseph J. Vinci bought the property in 1971. Several small businesses currently operate here, including a cabinetmaker, garment shop and welding outfit.|$|E

50|$|The School of Arts {{building}} is important {{as part of}} the network of Schools of Arts which sprang up in any town of consequence in Queensland during the 19th and early 20th centuries and were a measure of prosperity and progress. The <b>scale,</b> <b>material</b> and form of the building amply demonstrate the wealth and importance of Townsville as a regional centre at this period. Schools of Arts were community based and played a valuable educational and social role in the dissemination of information and the provision of facilities for lectures and meetings and the staging of events such as balls, plays and concerts. They were an important stage in the development of adult education in Queensland.|$|E
5000|$|An iwan (ایوان eyvān, إيوان Iwan, also spelled ivan, Turkish: eyvan) is a {{rectangular}} hall or space, usually vaulted, walled on three sides, with one end entirely open. The formal {{gateway to the}} iwan is called pishtaq, a Persian term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs. Since the definition allows for some interpretation, the overall forms and characteristics can vary greatly in terms of <b>scale,</b> <b>material,</b> or decoration. Iwans are most commonly associated with Islamic architecture; however, the form is Iranian in origin and was invented much earlier and fully developed in Mesopotamia around the third century CE, during the Parthian period of Persia.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{possible}} {{species of}} Cheirolepis are currently known. The type species, named in 1835, is C. trailli. Remains {{of this species}} have been found from Scotland and {{date back to the}} Eifelian and Givetian stages of the Middle Devonian. C. canadensis was described in 1881 from material found in Miguasha, Canada that dated back to the middle Frasnian stage of the Late Devonian. Two species, C. gracilis and C. gaugeri, have been found from Germany and Belarus in deposits that are of Givetian age. They were first described in 1973 from <b>scale</b> <b>material</b> that is now of questionable validity. Another species has been found from Belarus that lived during the Eifelian, and has been named C. sinualis. A new species has recently been described from a locality in Red Hill, Nevada deposited during the Mid-Late Devonian boundary. The specimen from which this species was named, consisting of scales and a lower jaw, was originally referred to C. canadensis. New, more complete specimens have shown it to be distinct from the type, although a species name is yet to be given for the remains.|$|E

50|$|The {{first factor}} is the {{nanometer}} length scale of goethite nanofibers in limpet teeth; at this length <b>scale,</b> <b>materials</b> become insensitive to preexisting flaws that would otherwise decrease failure strength.

50|$|Sintering is {{effective}} when the process reduces the porosity and enhances properties such as strength, electrical conductivity, translucency and thermal conductivity; yet, in other cases, {{it may be}} useful to increase its strength but keep its gas absorbency constant as in filters or catalysts. During the firing process, atomic diffusion drives powder surface elimination in different stages, starting from the formation of necks between powders to final elimination of small pores {{at the end of the}} process. The driving force for densification is the change in free energy from the decrease in surface area and lowering of the surface free energy by the replacement of solid-vapor interfaces. It forms new but lower-energy solid-solid interfaces with a total decrease in free energy occurring. On a microscopic <b>scale,</b> <b>material</b> transfer is affected by the change in pressure and differences in free energy across the curved surface. If the size of the particle is small (and its curvature is high), these effects become very large in magnitude. The change in energy is much higher when the radius of curvature is less than a few micrometres, which is one of the main reasons why much ceramic technology is based on the use of fine-particle materials.|$|E
30|$|In {{this work}} a new {{approach}} to computational material design has been presented and applied to multi-scale topological design of structural materials. A computational homogenization scheme for two scales (FE 2) has been considered to account for the impact of the lower <b>scale</b> <b>material</b> distribution on the global structural properties. This is done through the resulting point-wise homogenized elastic properties.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{testing of}} railway ballast poses {{practical}} difficulties because the particle size is often {{too large for}} most standard apparatus. There are therefore advantages in developing a <b>scaled</b> <b>material</b> whose behavior {{is representative of the}} full size material. A first stage in validating such an approach is to investigate whether the particle shape is affected by the change in scale. This paper sets out methods for evaluating form and roundness (aspects of shape) and proposes a new measure for evaluating roundness, termed ellipseness. These methods are then applied to a crushed rock railway ballast over a range of particle sizes. Statistical analysis demonstrates a measurable variation in the distributions of form and roundness with particle size over a range of sieve intervals, although the differences are slight and do not necessarily rule out the use of a <b>scaled</b> <b>material</b> for investigating the factors influencing macro mechanical behavior...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} nano-{{materials}} in materials science revealed that nanomaterials may have fantastic features due mainly to size-effect of the materials. For example, nano ceramics may have very high ductility at room temperatures and pressures, even though normal ceramics is easily deformed by brittle fracturing. What {{and how much}} do we know about the nature of nano or nano to micron <b>scale</b> geological <b>materials?</b> What factors contribute to their occurrence? How do they flow at geological conditions and how do they affect the rheology of rocks? Upper crustal deformation is characterized by low temperature flow of rocks under unsteady state, which results in progressive grainsize reduction and leads to the occurrence of micron to nano meter <b>scale</b> <b>materials</b> in fault zones. The examples of naturallydeformed upper crustal rocks presented in the paper help to unravel the importance of nano to micron <b>scale</b> rock <b>materials</b> during the low temperature flow of rocks...|$|R
