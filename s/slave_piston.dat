50|$|Hydraulic brakes {{transfer}} {{energy to}} stop an object, normally a rotating axle. In {{a very simple}} brake system, with just two cylinders and a disc brake, the cylinders could be connected via tubes, with a piston inside the cylinders. The cylinders and tubes are filled with incompressible oil. The two cylinders have the same volume, but different diameters, and thus different cross-section areas. The cylinder that the operator uses is called the master cylinder. The spinning disc brake will be adjacent to the piston with the larger cross-section. Suppose {{the diameter of the}} master cylinder is half the diameter of the slave cylinder, so the master cylinder has a cross-section four times smaller. Now, if the piston in the master cylinder is pushed down 40 mm, the <b>slave</b> <b>piston</b> will move 10 mm. If 10 newtons (N) of force are applied to the master piston, the <b>slave</b> <b>piston</b> will press with a force of 40 N.|$|E
50|$|This {{force can}} be further {{increased}} by inserting a lever connected between the master piston, a pedal, and a pivot point. If {{the distance from the}} pedal to the pivot is three times the distance from the pivot to the connected piston, then it multiplies the pedal force by a factor of 3, when pushing down on the pedal, so that 10 N becomes 30 N on the master piston and 120 N on the brake pad. Conversely, the pedal must move three times as far as the master piston. If we push the pedal 120 mm down, the master piston will move 40 mm and the <b>slave</b> <b>piston</b> will move the brake pad by 10 mm.|$|E
