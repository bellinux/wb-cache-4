40|$|Silent {{information}} regulator- 2 (SIR 2) proteins regulate lifespan {{of diverse}} organisms, but their distribution and {{roles in the}} CNS remain unclear. Here, we show that sirtuin 2 (SIRT 2), a mammalian SIR 2 homolog, is an oligodendroglial cytoplasmic protein and localized to the outer and juxtanodal loops in the myelin sheath. Among cytoplasmic proteins of OLN- 93 oligodendrocytes, �-tubulin was the main substrate of SIRT 2 deacetylase. In cultured primary oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs), SIRT 2 emergence accompanied elevated �-tubulin acetylation and OLP differentiation into the prematurity stage. Small interfering RNA knockdown of SIRT 2 increased the �-tubulin acetylation, myelin basic protein expression, and cell arbor complexity of OLPs. SIRT 2 overexpression had the opposite effects, and counteracted the cell arborization-promoting effect of overexpressed juxtanodin. SIRT 2 mutation concomitantly reduced its deacetylase activity and its impeding effect on OLP arborization. These results demonstrated a counterbalancing role of SIRT 2 against a facilitatory effect of tubulin acetylation on oligodendroglial differentiation. <b>Selective</b> SIRT 2 <b>availability</b> to oligodendroglia may {{have important implications for}} myelinogenesis, myelin–axon interaction, and brain aging.

40|$|Evolutionary {{constraint}} {{results from}} {{the interaction between the}} distribution of available genetic variation and the position of <b>selective</b> optima. The <b>availability</b> of genetic variance in multitrait systems, as described by the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix (G), {{has been the subject of}} recent attempts to assess the prevalence of genetic constraints. However, evolutionary constraints have not yet been considered from the perspective of the phenotypes available to multivariate selection, and whether genetic variance is present in all phenotypes potentially under selection. Determining the rank of the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix (P) to characterize the phenotypes available to selection, and contrasting it with the rank of G, may provide a general approach to determining the prevalence of genetic constraints. In a study of a laboratory population of Drosophila bunnanda from northern Australia we applied factor-analytic modeling to repeated measures of individual wing phenotypes to determine the dimensionality of the phenotypic space described by P. The phenotypic space spanned by the 10 wing traits had 10 statistically supported dimensions. In contrast, factor-analytic modeling of G estimated for the same 10 traits from a paternal half-sibling breeding design suggested G had fewer dimensions than traits. statistical support was found for only five and two genetic dimensions, describing a total of 99 % and 72 % of genetic variance in wing morphology in females and males, respectively. The observed mismatch in dimensionality between P and G suggests that although selection might act to shift the intragenerational population mean toward any trait combination, evolution may be restricted to fewer dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—High {{availability}} systems typically rely on redundant {{components and}} functionality to achieve fault detection, isolation and fail over. In the future, increases {{in error rates}} will make high availability important even in the commodity and volume market. Systems will be built out of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) with multiple identical components that can be configured to provide redundancy for high availability. However, the 100 % overhead of making all components redundant {{is going to be}} unacceptable for the commodity market, especially when all applications might not require high availability. In particular, duplicating the entire memory like the current high availability systems (e. g. NonStop and Stratus) do is particularly problematic given the fact that system costs are going to be dominated by the cost of memory. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called a duplication cache to reduce the overhead of memory duplication in CMPbased high availability systems. A duplication cache is a reserved area of main memory that holds copies of pages belonging to the current write working set (set of actively modified pages) of running processes. All other pages are marked as read-only and are kept only as a single, shared copy. The size of the duplication cache can be configured dynamically at runtime and allows system designers to trade off the cost of memory duplication with minor performance overhead. We extensively analyze the effectiveness of our duplication cache technique and show that for a range of benchmarks memory duplication can be reduced by 60 - 90 % with performance degradation ranging from 1 - 12 %. On average, a duplication cache can reduce memory duplication by 60 % for a performance overhead of 4 % and by 90 % for a performance overhead of 5 %.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Health Insurance Act in the Netherlands in 2006, insurers are incentivized to compete on price for basic health insurance, and on price and quality for supplementary insurance. It is possible for health insurers to implement a differentiated deductible since the first of January 2009. This paper describes an experiment. It is designed to study this differentiated deductible as a financial policy instrument. It focuses on the effect of selective contracting with positive incentives on the choice-behaviour of the insured. The goal {{of this study is to}} gain insight in the working mechanism of this financial policy instrument that is meant to reduce healthcare costs. The study is designed as a vignette study. The vignettes are presented in pairs of two to the respondents. The vignettes contain various elements including premium costs, deductible, degree of <b>selective</b> contracting and <b>availability</b> of quality-information (CQI). As the respondents in the design of this choice experiment have to choose between confronting health plans, it is understandable that they value these policies on their characteristics (so-called attributes). Subsequently, a statement can be formulated on the relative value assigned to these attributes by the respondents, clearly preferring one health plan over the other. Finally 99 respondents were included in our study. Logistic regression analysis was performed. This study shows that the deductible as choice-influencing instrument has less influence as age increases. The proclaimed cost savings of this deductible might be lower than expected. Generally, it can be concluded that healthier people are less likely to choose the extensive health plan. However, this effect reverses when the most extensive and less extensive are presented to the participants. The results thus show a clear demarcation in the preferences of consumers. A similar demarcation also has been found in the data concerning travel distance. When contracted care is within 30 minutes, this health plan is preferred over the more extensive and expensive one. However, this study also shows that this effect reverses when the travel distance increases to 45 minutes. Consumers in this situation are reluctant to choose selective care and choose for the extensive and expensive option. Premium costs have a negative effect. A health plan becomes less attractive when the price increases. In addition, an increase in the availability of CQI makes a health plan more attractive. It can be concluded from this study that the deductible as choice-influencing instrument seems to work for young and healthy people, provided that they do not have to travel more that 30 minutes...|$|R
