The functional diversity of the microbial community was analyzed via the activity of eight enzymes. Acid phosphomonoesterase was dominant across sites and depths, followed by L-leucine aminopeptidase and b-glucosidase. Structural [e. g. phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern] and functional microbial diversities were linked to each other at the nonwatered site, whereas amendment with nutrients (DOC, NO 3) by flooding uncoupled this relationship. Microbial biomass did not differ between sites, whereas microbial respiration was the highest at the watered sites. Hence, excess nutrients available due to artificial groundwater recharge could not compensate fr the limitation by others (e. g. phosphorus as assigned by acid phosphomonoesterase activity). Instead, at a similar microbial biomass, waste respiration via overflow metabolism occurred.

40|$|Exocellular {{electron}} transfer {{plays an important}} role in anaerobic microbial communities that degrade organic matter. Interspecies hydrogen transfer between microorganisms is the driving force for complete biodegradation in methanogenic environments. Many organic compounds are degraded by obligatory syntrophic consortia of proton-reducing acetogenic bacteria and hydrogen-consuming methanogenic archaea. Anaerobic microorganisms that use insoluble electron acceptors for growth, such as iron- and manganese-oxide as well as inert graphite electrodes in microbial fuel cells, also transfer electrons exocellularly. Soluble compounds, like humic substances, quinones, phenazines and riboflavin, can function as exocellular electron mediators enhancing this type of anaerobic respiration. However, direct {{electron transfer}} by cell-cell contact is important as well. This review addresses the mechanisms of exocellular electron transfer in anaerobic microbial communities. There are fundamental differences but also similarities between electron transfer to another microorganism or to an insoluble electron acceptor.

Our results also suggest that a comprehensive ecosystem management plan should consider the cumulative and hierarchical context of disturbance regimes to prevent reductions in ecological variability and ecosystem resilience, particularly in areas that are more sensitive to large disturbances.

We established a protocol for B. pseudomallei <b>soil</b> DNA isolation, <b>purification,</b> and quantification by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting a type three secretion system 1 single-copy gene. This assay was validated using 40 soil samples from Northeast Thailand that underwent parallel bacteriological culture. All 26 samples that were B. pseudomallei positive by direct culture were B. pseudomallei qPCR positive, with a median of 1. 84 × 10 (4) genome equivalents (range, 3. 65 × 10 (2) to 7. 85 × 10 (5)) per gram of soil, assuming complete recovery of DNA. This was 10. 6 -fold (geometric mean; range, 1. 1 - to 151. 3 -fold) higher than the bacterial count defined by direct culture. Moreover, the qPCR detected B. pseudomallei in seven samples (median, 36. 9 genome equivalents per g of soil; range, 9. 4 to 47. 3) which were negative by direct culture. These seven positive results were reproduced using a nested PCR targeting a second, independent B. pseudomallei-specific sequence. Two samples were direct culture and qPCR negative but nested PCR positive. Five samples were negative by both PCR methods and culture. In conclusion, our PCR-based system provides a highly specific and sensitive tool for the quantitative environmental surveillance of B. pseudomallei...|$|R
50|$|Critical Zone (CZ) is the “skin” of {{the earth}} that extends from the treetops to the bedrock that is created by life {{processes}} working at scales from microbes to biomes. The Critical Zone supports all terrestrial living systems. Its upper part is the bio-mantle. This is where terrestrial biota live, reproduce, use and expend energy, and where their wastes and remains accumulate and decompose. It encompasses the soil, which acts as a geomembrane through which water and solutes, energy, gases, solids, and organisms interact with the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. A variety of drivers affect this bio-dynamic zone, ranging from climate and deforestation to agriculture, grazing and human development. Understanding and predicting these effects is central to managing and sustaining vital ecosystem services such as <b>soil</b> fertility, water <b>purification,</b> and production of food resources, and, at larger scales, global carbon cycling and carbon sequestration.The CZ provides a unifying framework for integrating terrestrial surface and near-surface environments, and reflects an intricate web of biological and chemical processes and human impacts occurring at vastly different temporal and spatial scales. The nature of these data create significant challenges for inter-disciplinary studies of the CZ because integration of the variety and number of data products and models has been a barrier. On the other hand, CZ data provides an excellent opportunity for defining, testing and implementing Brown Dog technologies. In this context “unstructured” data is viewed broadly as consisting {{of a collection of}} heterogeneous data with formats that reflect temporal and disciplinary legacies, data from emerging low cost open hardware based sensors and embedded sensor networks that lack well defined metadata and sensor characteristics, as well as data that are available as maps, images and text.|$|R
40|$|Beitang is an ecologically {{engineered}} constructed wetland {{dominated by}} human activities and {{is composed of}} paddy fields, ponds, ditches, courtyards and other related ecological infrastructure with the functions of agricultural production, hydrological regulation, environmental cleanup and ecological agricultural regulation. The history of Beitang extends back more than 2500 years in China, and it plays {{a very important role}} in China&# 39;s agricultural development. This paper first reviews the history of the development of Beitang; then according to the historical structural features of Beitang, it summarizes Beitang as a pond-ditch-courtyard-farmland ecological engineering composed of constructed breakwaters, sluice gates, and water intakes; courtyards; and farmland and irrigation ditches with the functions of water collection, storage and conveyance. Under different terrain conditions, Beitangs exhibit different characteristics. For example, in flat areas featuring a larger pond capacity, longer shoreline and larger area of farmland, a Beitang can serve more rural areas; in hilly areas featuring a smaller pond capacity and smaller area of farmland, ditches serve as a very important structural unit that can connect ponds for water volume regulation between ponds, increase the irrigated area, and achieve gravity irrigation to as great an extent as possible. Moreover, the paper analyzes the hydrological, nutrient cycling and biological processes as well as other ecological processes associated with this type of pond-ditch-courtyard-farmland-system. The paper also proposes five ecosystem services of Beitang: hydrological regulation, ecological <b>purification,</b> <b>soil</b> and water conservation, production functions and biological diversity protection. Finally, the paper analyzes the reasons for the degradation of Beitang over the past 30 years from the perspectives of institutions, management, concepts and technology, and proposes corresponding countermeasures to protect and restore Beitang.
