Droplet size distribution in drift was also evaluated under various wind conditions. ^ The average evaporation losses determined by an electrical conductivity method, ranged from 1. 5 to 16. 8 {{percent of the total}} volume discharged by sprinklers. The results of the multiple regression analysis of the data indicated that average wind velocity and vapor pressure deficit were the most significant factors affecting the evaporation from the sprays. An exponential relationship between the evaporation loss and wind velocity was found. The relationship between the vapor pressure deficit and evaporation loss was also exponential. For the pressure levels used in this study, the operating pressure factor did not {{have a significant effect on}} evaporation from the sprays. ^ A comparison of the evaporation losses estimated by various theoretical and experimental equations for a given set of operating and climatic conditions showed that experimentally obtained prediction equations estimate greater evaporation losses than the theoretical equations. ^ Drift losses defined as the quantity of spray droplets passing through a plane perpendicular to the direction of wind a short distance downwind outside the sprinkler application pattern, ranged from 2. 0 percent at a wind velocity of 2. 68 m/s to 15. 1 percent at a wind velocity of 6. 71 m/s at an operating pressure of 310 kPa (45 psi) when the losses were measured at 21 m from the lateral. When the losses were determined at 26 m, the drift losses varied from 1. 5 percent to 10. 4 percent of the total volume discharged by the sprinklers. Drift losses increased in proportion to approximately the second power of the average wind velocity. Wind velocity is the predominant factor controlling the amount of drift from a given sprinkler system operated at a specified pressure. Drift losses decreased drastically with increasing distance from the lateral. ^ Combined <b>spray</b> <b>losses</b> ranged from 1. 8 to 29. 0 percent of the total volume discharged by the sprinklers, when the losses due to wind drift at 21 m were considered in the estimation of the combined losses. When the drift losses at 26 m were considered, the combined losses varied from 1. 7 to 22. 9 percent. On the average, 47 percent of the total losses were due to drift for wind velocities greater than 4. 0 m/s, and for wind velocities less than 4. 0 m/s, the drift losses consisted of 25 percent of the total losses. ^ In addition to <b>spray</b> <b>loss</b> determinations, an analysis of the droplet size distribution in the drift was made by applying the modified log-probability function called 2 ̆ 7 Upper Limit Equation 2 ̆ 7 to the observed droplet size data.

40|$|In the Canterbury region, New Zealand, {{water is}} a {{contentious}} issue when irrigation and dairy farming are involved. The Canterbury region accounts for 70 % of the total irrigated land area in New Zealand {{and is one of}} the most productive agricultural regions. Traditionally, water has been seen as an abundant resource, but growing water demands are now outstripping the supply of water, hence threatening the sustainability of agricultural productivity. In the long term, this problem may worsen as a result of climate change, which is predicted to increase water demands and reduce supply in many parts of Canterbury. In the recent and on-going expansion of irrigation systems, modern sprinkler irrigation methods, namely centre pivot and lateral spray irrigation technology, have replaced the old border-dyke systems. This has been due to the need to increase irrigation flexibility and efficiency to guarantee pasture growth for dairy production in dry periods. This conversion has resulted in a reduction of windbreaks to 2 m heights or sometimes led to 100 % removal of windbreaks so as to accommodate centre pivot or linear move irrigation systems. Removal of windbreaks or reduction of windbreak height may increase wind speed across a field. Both <b>spray</b> evaporation <b>loss</b> and evapotranspiration are a function of wind speed. Hence, any increase in wind speed may lead to an increase in irrigation requirements. There is little information currently available on outlining how reduction of windbreak height or the complete removal of windbreaks affects efficiency in water application. Thus, this research was done to quantify the effects of windbreaks on water savings under sprinkler irrigation systems in the Canterbury region under various climatic conditions. The research was done in three major steps: (1) <b>spray</b> evaporation <b>loss</b> (SEL) was measured under various climatic conditions for two typical spray nozzles(Nelson Irrigation Corporation Rotator R 3000 and Spinner S 3000 nozzles) to develop SEL prediction models; (2) wind speed reduction behind windbreaks was quantified for fields under various wind conditions; and (3) the effects of wind speed reduction by windbreaks was modelled for evapotranspiration, <b>spray</b> evaporation <b>loss</b> and irrigation. The results showed that an increase of wind speed, due to the removal of windbreaks or a reduction of height of windbreaks, leads to an increase in evapotranspiration and <b>spray</b> evaporation <b>losses</b> in irrigated agriculture. For the size of the fields considered in this study which are 80 m by 80 m (Site 1 with medium porosity windbreaks) and 120 m by 120 m (Site 2 with low porosity windbreaks), extra irrigation water of up to 14 % is needed in one growing season when windbreaks are reduced to 2 m in height. When windbreaks are completely removed from the field, extra irrigation water of up to 38 % and 64 % is needed when irrigating using the Rotator R 3000 nozzle and the Spinner S 3000 nozzle, respectively. Thus, reduction of water resource use can be achieved in irrigated agriculture if irrigation systems can be designed to operate under existing windbreaks. Other savings can follow, from reduced requirements for pumping, fuel and labour costs. Lastly, with future climate change projections showing that the Canterbury region will get windier and hotter, windbreaks can help mitigate water losses associated with sprinkler irrigatio...|$|R

40|$|Windbreaks {{are common}} {{features}} in flat agricultural landscapes around the world. The reduction in wind speed afforded by windbreaks is dictated by their porosity, location, height, and {{distance from the}} windbreak. The reduction in wind speeds not only reduces potential wind erosion; it also reduces crop evapotranspiration (ET) and provides shelter for livestock and crops. In the Canterbury plains of New Zealand there are over 300, 000 km of windbreaks which were first implemented as a soil conservation strategy to reduce wind erosion of prime agricultural land. Agriculture in the region has since changed to irrigated pasture cultivation for dairy production and windbreaks are being cut down or reduced to heights of 2 m to allow for large scale centre-pivot irrigation schemes. Although soil erosion {{is no longer a}} major concern due to permanent pasture cover, irrigation water is sourced from limited supplies of ground and surface water and thus the effects of wind on irrigation <b>losses</b> due to <b>spray</b> drift and increased ET are of significant concern. The impact of reducing windbreaks needs to be understood in terms of water resources use. Experimental and theoretical work was conducted to quantify the reduction in wind speeds by windbreaks and in <b>spray</b> evaporation <b>losses.</b> A temporal and spatial model was also developed and validated to quantify the impact of single and multiple windbreaks on irrigation water losses. Initial modelling results show that for hot windy dry conditions in Canterbury, ET can increase by up to 1. 4 mm/day when windbreaks are reduced to 2 m in height and on average wind days ET can increase by up to 0. 5 mm/day. ET can be reduced by up to 30 % in the windbreak leeward zone relative to ET in areas not protected by windbreaks. Wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity all had a considerable impact on <b>spray</b> evaporation <b>losses,</b> but the extent is determined by the droplet size. Estimated losses range from only 0. 07 % to 67 % for 5 and 0. 2 mm droplet sizes respectively. Preliminary measurements of typical irrigation spray nozzles with a range of drop sizes show losses of up to 30 % under high wind conditions. Potential reduction in ground and surface water resources use for irrigation can be significant if windbreaks are maintained by using irrigation systems that can be adapted to work within windbreaks...|$|R

Finally, to have an on line analysis of the efficiency of the refinement process in the Spiral Ore Concentrator. The hardware of the Machine Vision System was implemented and tested in the laboratory. The hardware included a video recorder, through which a video signal was obtained from the play-back of video material taken of the ore flow in the Spiral Ore Concentrator. The video signal was used as input to an RGB decoder in order to remove the colour modulation. A black and white frame grabber digitized the video signal which was then analyzed by a computer. Based on the fundamental theory of edge detection used in computer vision systems, an algorithm was designed and implemented to detect the transition point between the two types of material. This algorithm was used to find the difference of averages of grey levels between two global neighborhoods within a specified area of interest window. The algorithm gave consistent results and was robust towards surface irregularities. The algorithm, operating in a continuous repetitive mode, gave rapid fluctuations in the determined edge position. Because a motor with a slow response time would be used to control the movement of the blade separator, the determined edge position signal was smoothed by a filter. Based on periodogram analysis of the edge position signal, a smoothing filter was implemented which incorporates a median filter, followed by a fading-memory polynomial filter. These filters gave sufficient smoothing with little lag to step changes in ore concentration. The efficiency of the ore separation was monitored by the determination of losses. These losses consist of, the percentage of black material loss and percentage of white material contamination. Two types of losses could be identified, they were <b>Spraying</b> <b>losses</b> and Filter losses, these were combined to give Total losses. From the true edge position curve, which was obtained by finding the edge position every second pixel point, the Nyquist sampling frequency could be determined.

The controller will be programmed directly into the plant distributed control system (DCS) and does not require the continuous use of any third party software. The intrexes serve as the loop seal in the CFB as well as intermediate and finishing superheaters. Heat is transferred to the steam in the intrex superheaters from the circulating ash which can vary in consistency, quantity and quality. Fuel composition can have a large impact on the ash quality and in turn, on intrex performance. Variations in MW load and airflow settings will also impact intrex performance due to their impact on the quantity of ash circulating in the CFB. Insufficient intrex heat transfer will result in low main steam temperature while excessive heat transfer will result in high superheat attemperator <b>sprays</b> and/or <b>loss</b> of unit efficiency. This controller will automatically adjust to optimize intrex ash flow to compensate for changes in the other ash properties by controlling intrex air flows. The controller will allow the operator to enter a target intrex steam temperature increase which will cause all of the intrex air flows to adjust simultaneously to achieve the target temperature. The result will be stable main steam temperature and in turn stable and reliable operation of the CFB...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Designing and {{management}} of sprinkler irrigation systems depend on the situation and location of its implementation and often rely on professional and long-term tests (9). Having a good irrigation system depends on knowledge {{of the relationship between}} soil, water, plants, irrigation scheduling, the required amount of irrigation water to the water-holding capacity of soil, climate and plant growth (6). The less use of sprinkler irrigation systems and less performed research projects in the Guilan province, lack of correct design parameters due to shortage of the required parameters for local and regional planning, has led to reliance on charts and tables. Therefore, planning water resources cannot be performed well and with accurate details. According to many researchers (8), the technical evaluation should be a regular and short-term process to review the problems and possible performance of irrigation systems. Merriam and Keller (10) defined the assessment of an irrigation system analysis, based on field measurements in real terms during the normal work of the system. Therefore, to develop these systems over the next few years, it is essential to evaluate the use of irrigation systems and review the performance of existing problems and utilizing the results to improve it. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the current status of implemented irrigation systems in the tea plantations of Guilan and evaluate their performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, six classic sprinkler irrigation systems in tea fields of Guilan province were evaluated during two years. Sprinkler irrigation systems of semi-portable, solid-set and solid-set (hand-move sprinkler) were selected randomly. To evaluate this irrigation systems, Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient (CU), distribution uniformity (DU), potential application efficiency of low-quarter (PELQ) and application efficiency of low-quarter (AELQ) in the form of trial blocks were estimated by measuring pressure fluctuations which were applied to the entire system. Using irrigated area and irrigation water depth, adequacy of irrigation curve, deep percolation <b>losses</b> and <b>spray</b> <b>losses</b> were determined on the basis of existing relationships. Results and Discussion: Average values of CU, DU, PELQ and AELQ for 6 tea fields were 65, 52, 44 and 44 percent, respectively. Application efficiency in all irrigation systems, Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity were lower than recommended values in the references. Merriam and Keller (11) reported the allowable range for potential application efficiency of low-quarter between 65 to 85 percent. With respect to irrigation less than the actual water requirement of the plant in tea fields, AELQ was equal with PELQ. Untechnical design and implementation of irrigation systems, particularly poor operating pressure and economic problems were detected as the main reasons for the low PELQ. Simultaneous use of sprinklers with different specifications and models, old irrigation systems, water leakage from valves and other equipment, practically change the pressure and flow rate, which were the main reasons for the decrease in uniformity of water distribution and application efficiency of low-quarter. According to Cobban (4) uniformity coefficient of sprinkler irrigation systems were reported between 31 to 55 percent in Tanzania tea fields and in other reports were between 58 to 72 percent (7), which was due to poor design, long spacing of sprinklers and high speed wind. Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity of low-quarter in ED, WB & EP systems were lower than recommended values by Merriam and Keller (...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model {{was developed and}} {{used to assess the}} sensitivity of thermal performance characteristics of a closed wet cooling tower to inlet air conditions. In the present study, three cases of different ambient conditions are considered: In the first case, the average mid-winter and mid-summer conditions as well as the extreme case of high temperature and relative humidity, in Athens (Greece) during summer are considered according to the Greek Regulation for Buildings Energy Performance. In the second case, the varied inlet air relative humidity while the inlet air dry bulb temperature remains constant were taken into account. In the last case, the effects on cooling tower thermal behaviour when the inlet air wet bulb temperature remains constant were examined. The proposed model is capable of predicting the variation of air thermodynamic properties, sprayed water and serpentine water temperature inside the closed wet cooling tower along its height. The reliability of simulations was tested against experimental data, which were obtained from literature. Thus, the proposed model could be used for the design of industrial and domestic applications of conventional air-conditioning systems as well as for sorption cooling systems with solid and liquid desiccants where closed wet cooling towers are used for precooling the liquid solutions. The most important result of this theoretical investigation is that the highest fall of serpentine water temperature and <b>losses</b> of <b>sprayed</b> water are observed for the lowest value of inlet wet bulb temperature. Hence, the thermal effectiveness, which is associated with the temperature reduction of serpentine water as well as the operational cost, which is related to the <b>sprayed</b> water <b>loss</b> due to evaporation, of a closed wet cooling tower depend predominantly on the degree of saturation of inlet air.

40|$|About one {{fifth of}} the energy used today is {{allocated}} in the transportation sector {{and most of the}} vehicles are driven by internal combustion engines. Replacing them with electrical machine would have a positive environmental impact but there is room for improvement of the electric machines. Rotors of the electrical machines in the automotive industry today are built with permanent magnets. High efficiency and high power density are two advantages with this machine design but {{there are a number of}} drawbacks as well. Temperature sensitivity and costly materials are two examples. Operation in higher temperature can lead to demagnetization of the magnets. Segmentation, leading to reduced heat generation, is used today to prevent overheating. By varying the composition of the magnet they also become more temperature resilience but this is often expensive. The goal with the thesis was to, by cooling, achieve and maintain a safe operation temperature while simultaneously allow higher performance and/or simpler magnet design alternatively lower temperature grade. The analysis is based on theoretical calculations and experimental results from a test rig that was designed and constructed within the thesis. The cooling system was designed to spray oil on the inside of the rotor of the electrical machine. Due to the high rotational speed the oil forms a thin film that absorbs the heat generated by the magnets. In the thesis a cylinder with an external heat source was used to simulate the rotor. A thermal analysis of the test setup was conducted to assess the heat transfer capability of the <b>spraying</b> method. <b>Losses</b> and operation temperature of an actual machine were estimated for different operation points and segmentation designs of the magnets. The results showed significant drop in the temperature of the magnets as well as a possibility to reduce the number of segments. Validerat; 20141031 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} natural enemies on {{immature}} {{stages of the}} diamondback moth was quantitatively assessed in commercial cabbage crops in southeast Queensland, Australia, in 2000 and 2001. The survivorship of Plutella xylostella (L.) eggs, larvae and pupae on cabbage plants caged to exclude predators and larval and pupal parasitoids was compared with survivorship on cabbage plants which were caged to simulate the ambient conditions created by the exclusion cages, but which allowed natural enemy access. In 2000, six cohorts of P. xylostella were studied on three commercial Brassica farms which adopted an integrated approach to pest management and six cohorts were studied on three farms which adopted a calendar spray approach to pest management; a further two cohorts were followed in cabbage plots at Gatton Research Station. In 2001, two cohorts were followed on a farm adopting IPM and two cohorts were followed on a farm practising calendar <b>spraying.</b> Estimated <b>losses</b> due to predation ranged from 2 - 85 % in 2000 and from 22 - 77 % in 2001. When losses and mortality due to parasitism were combined, total estimated losses ranged from 2 - 98 % in 2000 and from 22 - 90 % in 2001. Larval and pupal parasitism rates were low in both years of the study but, in order of abundance, the hymenopteran parasitoids detected could be ranked Diadegma semiclausum > Diadromus collaris > Apanteles ippeus > Oomyzus sokolowskii. This study represents the first record of O. sokolowskii attacking P. xylostella in Australia. Pitfall trapping indicated that Araneae (Lycosidae and Oxyopidae) were the most abundant insectivorous predators but that Coleoptera (Carabidae, Staphylinidae and Coccinellidae) and Hemiptera were also relatively abundant on commercial Brassica farms in south-east Queensland...|$|R

A technique for texturing the surface of silicon wafers oriented in 100 plane to form a regular pattern of inverted pyramids as well as irregular topography patterns was developed. The efficiency of the solar cells with monofacial sensitivity from silicon wafers with the surface patterned {{in the form of}} inverted pyramids was increased from 10. 1 to 15. 8, which is by more than 5 higher compared to the efficiency of the solar cells with unstructured silicon surface. For solar cells with bifacial sensitivity, the total efficiency was increased from 12. 6 to 15. 7 for the case of irregular patterned silicon surface and up to 20. 9 {{in the case of the}} regular patterned silicon surface. The developed and applied technique for the structurization of the surface of silicon wafers for solar cell devices resulted in an efficiency increase to up to 15. 8 for monofacial and up to 20. 9 for bifacial solar cells.

40|$|Postharvest {{diseases}} {{are a major}} problem in long storage of apples and pears in The Netherlands. Despite intensive preharvest <b>spraying</b> programs significant <b>losses</b> occur (over 60 % of fruit losses are recorded). Over 125 heavily affected lots of apples (mainly ‘Elstar’) and pears (mainly ‘Conference’) from packing houses in different regions of The Netherlands were evaluated for decay symptoms and causal organisms in the 2011 / 2012 season. Results showed that the most important pathogens were Neofabraea spp. (apples and pears) and Cadophora spp. (pears). Other pathogens such as Botrytis spp., Pencillium spp., Fusarium spp., Alternaria spp., and Cladosporium spp. were isolated at low frequencies and are considered of minor importance. Also new problems with sooty blotch and lenticel rot of apple were noticed, most likely caused by other, not yet identified pathogens. Pathogenicity testing and characterization of isolates are on-going. For major pathogens, qPCR assays are developed. Samples of substrates (e. g., leaves, cankers, soil) were monthly taken from 10 apple and 10 pear orchards in 2102. Samples will be assessed using the qPCR assays for presence and dynamics of pathogen populations. This information on the pathogen life cycles is needed for the development of innovative strategies (e. g., sanitation practices) to prevent postharvest losses...|$|R
40|$|Termites and ants are key {{ecosystem}} {{engineers and}} nutrient re-cyclers. Extensive spraying of insecticidespresents a hazard to these insects. Using a control-treatment paired design comprising 3 replicate pairs ofplots per soil type, we quantified {{the impact of}} fipronil on termite consumption of cardboard and woodbaits, termite repair of deliberately damaged mounds as well as ant community composition and abundancein two different habitats (black vertisol and red kandosol soil) when applied aerially at a dose raterecommended for locust control in Australia. The studywas conducted from 2006 to 2008. The diversity oftermites and ants was higher and side-effects were more pronounced on kandosol than on vertisol soil. Overall termite consumption of cardboard baitswas significantly greater in unsprayed than in <b>sprayed</b> plotswhile <b>losses</b> were significantly greater in only one (vertisol) or two (kandosol) sprayed plots, respectively,compared to paired unsprayed plots. In the first year, termite consumption of wood baits was generallysignificantly greater on unsprayed than on sprayed kandosol while only marginally significant onunsprayed vertisol. Again, losses were significantly greater in one (vertisol) and two (kandosol) sprayedplots, respectively, compared to paired unsprayed plots. Overall termite consumption of wood baits wassimilar among plots {{in the second year}} post-spray although consumption remained significantly depressedin one pair of sprayed plots in each habitat. The capacity of the mound-building termite, Drepanotermesrubriceps (Froggatt) unique to kandosol, to repair damaged mounds was significantly reduced by fipronil. Furthermore, colonies of Iridomyrmex greensladei Shattuck, an ant species associated with mounds of D. rubriceps, were not re-located five months post-spray. Ant communities were also adversely affected. Onvertisol, species richness and relative abundance were similar among treatments, but significantly fewerspecies were caught in one individual sprayed plot. In contrast on kandosol, species richness and relativeabundance were significantly reduced by fipronil. A drop in species richnesswas observed in all and a dropin relative abundance in two sprayed plots. On vertisol, abundances of two species were significantly lowerin sprayed than in paired unsprayed plots. Likewise on kandosol, abundances of five species were significantlyreduced in sprayed plots, and one species was not caught at all. The weight of evidence of ourfindings indicate that fipronil, even at a low rate, will have substantial adverse impacts on the diversity andactivity of termites and ants, especially if applied within one to two years of earlier applications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{essential}} {{amino acid}} lysine {{plays an important role}} for the nutritional quality of infant formula. Unfortunately, it is easily damaged during spray drying which is usually used to produce infant formula powders. In this study, we showed that the extent of lysine loss can be controlled by adjusting the air inlet temperature and the air-to-liquid ratio. Depending on the spray drying conditions, 10. 4 [*]±[*] 2. 9 % lysine loss down to no lysine loss was determined after spray drying in laboratory scale and in pilot scale. A main impact on lysine loss could be attributed to the particle residence time which was shown to be longer for the short-form, pilot-scale spray dryer than for the tall-form, laboratory-scale spray dryer. Median particle residence time was 6  s in the laboratory scale dryer and 17  s in the pilot scale dryer. The air-to-liquid ratio of the spray dryer proved to be a good parameter to compare different types of spray dryers. The extent of lysine loss during storage of the spray dried powders was independent of the extent of lysine <b>loss</b> during <b>spray</b> drying. Lysine <b>loss</b> during storage can be reduced by low storage temperatures and low water contents of the powder. Coupling kinetics of lysine loss that take into account the physical state of lactose, i. e., glassy, rubbery, or crystalline, with the processing conditions and particle residence time during spray drying was shown to be a promising tool to improve the nutritional quality of spray dried infant formula...|$|R
