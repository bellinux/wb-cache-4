5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a <b>silver</b> <b>salt,</b> and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "calotype", or [...] "talbotype", was a [...] "developing out" [...] process, Talbot's {{improvement}} {{of his earlier}} photogenic drawing process {{by the use of}} a different <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> (silver iodide instead of silver chloride) and a developing agent (gallic acid and silver nitrate) to bring out an invisibly slight [...] "latent" [...] image on the exposed paper. This reduced the required exposure time in the camera to only a minute or two for subjects in bright sunlight. The translucent calotype negative made it possible to produce as many positive prints as desired by simple contact printing, whereas the daguerreotype was an opaque direct positive that could only be reproduced by copying it with a camera. On the other hand, the calotype, despite waxing of the negative to make the image clearer, still was not pin-sharp like the metallic daguerreotype, because the paper fibres degraded the printed image. The simpler salted paper process was normally used when making prints from calotype negatives.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{step was}} the {{structure}} elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective {{of whether they}} were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who both studied a <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> of the same composition but had different properties. Wöhler studied silver cyanate, a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated silver fulminate, a salt with explosive properties. The elemental analysis shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, {{but this was not}} the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by Berzelius's theory of isomers, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. [...] However, it took until 1858 before by August Kekulé formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon tetravalent ad can bind itself to carbon chains as they occur in natural products.|$|E
50|$|In {{black-and-white}} {{photographic film}} {{there is usually}} one layer of <b>silver</b> <b>salts.</b> When the exposed grains are developed, the <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> are converted to metallic silver, which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film negative. Color film has at least three sensitive layers. Dyes, which adsorb {{to the surface of}} the <b>silver</b> <b>salts,</b> make the crystals sensitive to different colors. Typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top, followed by the green and red layers. During development, the exposed <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> are converted to metallic silver, just as with black-and-white film. But in a color film, the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes. Because the by-products are created in direct proportion to the amount of exposure and development, the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development. Following development, the silver is converted back to <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> in the bleach step. It is removed from the film in the fix step. Fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes, which combine to make up the colored visible image. Later color films, like Kodacolor II, have as many as 12 emulsion layers, with upwards of 20 different chemicals in each layer.|$|R

[As I {{was anxious}} to learn what acid the {{secretion}} contained, 445 leaves were washed in distilled water, given me by Prof. Frankland; but the secretion is so viscid that it is scarcely possible to scrape or wash off the whole. The conditions were also unfavourable, as {{it was late in}} the year and the leaves were small. Prof. Frankland with great kindness undertook to test the fluid thus collected. The leaves were excited by clean particles of glass placed on them 24 hrs. previously. No doubt much more acid would have been secreted had the leaves been excited by animal matter, but this would have rendered the analysis more difficult. Prof. Frankland informs me that the fluid contained no trace of hydrochloric, sulphuric, tartaric, oxalic, or formic acids. This having been ascertained, the remainder of the fluid was evaporated nearly to dryness, and acidified with sulphuric acid; it then evolved volatile acid vapour, which was condensed and digested with carbonate of silver. [...] "The weight of the <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> thus produced was only [...] .37 gr., much too small a quantity for the accurate determination of the molecular weight of the acid.
