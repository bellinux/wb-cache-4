500|$|MacGregor raised {{several hundred}} armed men for this {{enterprise}} in the Mid-Atlantic states, South Carolina, and particularly Savannah, Georgia. He also raised $160,000 by {{the sale of}} [...] "scripts" [...] to investors, promising them fertile acres in Florida or their money back with interest. He determined to first attack Amelia Island, an anarchic community of pirates and other criminals containing about 40% of East Florida's population (recorded as 3,729 in 1815), and expecting little to no resistance from the tiny Spanish garrison there. He left Charleston in a ship with fewer than 80 men, mostly US citizens. He led the landing party personally on 29 June 1817 with the words: [...] "I shall sleep either in hell or Amelia tonight!" [...] The Spanish commander at Fort San Carlos, with 51 men and several cannon, vastly overestimated the size of MacGregor's force and surrendered without either <b>side</b> <b>firing</b> a shot.|$|E
500|$|According to {{survivor}} accounts, {{before dawn}} on August 15 the H Company mortar platoon {{became aware of}} enemy activity near Hill 303. The platoon leader telephoned G Company, 5th Cavalry, which informed him a platoon of 60 South Korean troops would come to reinforce the mortar platoon. Later {{in the morning the}} platoon saw two North Korean T-34s followed by 200 or more enemy soldiers on the road below them. A little later a group of Koreans appeared on the slope. A patrol going to meet the climbing Korean troops called out and received in reply a blast of gunfire from automatic weapons. The mortar platoon leader, Lt. Jack Hudspeth, believed they were friendly. Some of the Americans realized that the advancing troops were North Korean and were going to open up on them according to former Pvt. Fred Ryan and Pvt. Roy Manring, when they revisited the old mortar position in 1999. Hudspeth ordered them not to fire and threatened them with a court-martial if they did. The rest of the watching Americans were not convinced that the new arrivals were enemy soldiers until the red stars became visible on their field caps. By that time, they were extremely close to the American positions. The North Korean troops came right up to the foxholes without either <b>side</b> <b>firing</b> a shot. Hudspeth ordered his platoon to surrender without a fight as it was far outnumbered and outgunned. The North Koreans quickly took [...] the mortarmen captive. Estimates of the number captured range from 31 to 42.|$|E
2500|$|The cruiser's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} eight BL [...] Mk XI* guns, arranged in single mountings behind open-backed gunshields. A single quick-firing [...] gun {{was used to}} protect the ship from air attack. Brisbane carried a 12-pounder field gun for ashore deployment. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were used as saluting guns. Ten [...]303-inch machine guns were carried for close defence work (eight Lewis guns and two Maxim guns). Two submerged 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes were fitted: one on each <b>side,</b> <b>firing</b> broadside. Armour plating consisted of side belts [...] thick amidships, tapering to [...] thick at the bow and stern, along with protective decking over the engineering and magazine spaces, and an armoured conning tower.|$|E

2500|$|US and Mexican sources {{differ on}} the success of US troops taking the {{imposing}} hills immediately to the east of the two cities of Nogales. US sources indicate that the heights were taken (and held until that evening's cease-fire) by a combined assault of the 10th Cavalry and 35th Infantry. For their part, Mexican sources, such as the contemporary [...] "Corrido de Nogales" [...] (a Mexican ballad about the battle's main events), highlight the participation of the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry during the assault on these hills. In the [...] "Corrido de Nogales", it is also claimed that the Mexican townspeople of Nogales stopped the assault on that hill at the eastern end of the Nogales communities. Nevertheless, during the assault Capt. Joseph D. Hungerford was killed by a bullet to the heart while leading the 10th Cavalry charge on the hill. Meanwhile, a few US civilians used their vehicles to shuttle troops toward the border, but only one US military vehicle, driven by Private James Flavian Lavery, crossed the border, delivering supplies and retrieving the wounded. Lavery was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. American militia who became involved stayed on the American <b>side,</b> <b>firing</b> their weapons from the windows of their houses. Allyn Watkins, an eyewitness to the shooting from the rooftops of homes along a tall hill on the US side, claimed that the disordered involvement of US civilians in the border fight “didn’t help the progress of the ‘war’ any.” Late in the fighting, members of the 35th Infantry placed a machine gun on top of a stone building and fired into the Mexican positions. The capture of the heights and this machine gun fire encouraged the end of the fighting.|$|E

It gives a general form for expressing the solution of such variable-coefficient combat attrition equations in terms of Lanchester functions, which are introduced here and can be readily tabulated. Different Lanchester functions arise from different mathematical forms for the attrition-rate coefficients. We give results for two such forms: (1) effectiveness of each <b>side's</b> <b>fire</b> proportional to a power of time, and (2) effectiveness of each <b>side's</b> <b>fire</b> linear with time but with a nonconstant ratio of attrition-rate coefficients.
