500|$|The {{progressing}} {{relationship between}} Maggie Greene and Glenn was well received by critics. Nate Rawlings of Time asserted that their interactions carried the most emotional poignance. Rawlings opined: [...] "She's forced to confront, {{perhaps for the}} first time, that these creatures are slobbering monsters. Before her attack, <b>she</b> <b>yelled</b> at Dale [...] for calling them Walkers; to her they're mom, her brother, the neighbors. After her attack, her mind might be changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gelman later {{stated that}} since {{he knew he would}} be caught, {{he was going to take}} down [...] "rats" [...] who had wronged him. Gelman then went to the house of a female {{acquaintance}} named Yelena Bulchenko, where he killed her mother, Anna, at about 10:30a.m. He then allegedly left the crime scene and waited several hours for Yelena, who had been staying at a friend's house, to return home. Once she did, she found Anna dead and called 9-1-1, but Gelman was on his way back to the scene to check if she returned home. Upon arrival at about 4:00p.m., he spotted her outside on the phone and got out of the car, upon which <b>she</b> <b>yelled</b> at him. He hid the knife in his jacket sleeve and approached her, but she took off running. However, Gelman caught up with her and stabbed her eleven times, killing her, before speeding off in Kuznetsov's car. Ramming into another car, Gelman stabbed and wounded the driver, Arthur DiCrescento, three times when he confronted him, before carjacking the vehicle. Gelman later ran down 62-year-old pedestrian Stephen Tanenbaum, who subsequently died of his injuries.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine {{on the floor by}} his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. [...] "I could see the barrel of the rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head," [...] he said. Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled [...] "Get the fuck out of here" [...] and [...] "May the blood of [...] be on your [...] ". The captain dove for cover to his left as <b>she</b> <b>yelled</b> [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; [...] "she shout in English that she wanted to kill Americans" [...] and then lost consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2012, a show source told Inside Soap that Christmas 2012 would [...] "bring {{serious drama}} to the Moons" [...] with the reveal {{of the mystery}} man's {{identity}} and the aftermath: [...] "the consequences will be felt across the Square. Who could blame Alfie if he kicked Kat to the kerb? She has treated him appallingly." [...] It was revealed Kat would reveal the identity of her lover during an episode in which Kat and Alfie argue, Alfie attacks {{one of the suspects}} and Kat shouts that he has the wrong brother. An EastEnders source told the Daily Star: [...] "It's the question that has been on everyone's lips for months—who is Kat's secret lover? The big revelation was always {{going to be in the}} Queen Vic in front of everyone and it will not disappoint. Jessie [...] and Shane [...] are both brilliant and this is one episode viewers will not want to miss. Alfie goes for one of the Branning brothers as he is convinced it's him who's been sleeping with his wife. Kat storms through the pub as he's got him on the floor and reveals the truth. We all got goosebumps as <b>she</b> <b>yelled</b> the line, 'You've got the wrong brother' [...] It really is classic Enders." [...] The source added, [...] "Sadly it doesn't look like [...] be able to get over this one." [...] EastEnders confirmed that viewers would discover the identity of Kat's lover in the episode broadcast on 20 December 2012. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said it would be a [...] "dramatic climax" [...] to the storyline. On being told who Kat's lover is, Richie said he understood and found it clever, though he had previously thought it would be Michael or Ray. Richie told Radio Times that Alfie is still in denial about the affair but becomes Kat's [...] "stalker", following her to the bedsit. He then pieces the evidence together and realises Kat is having an affair with someone he knows.|$|E

"Yes, indeed was he; {{and he went}} up to the attics {{when all}} was burning above and below, and got the {{servants}} out of their beds and helped them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we heard him call 'Bertha!'

60|$|Helen {{urged her}} horse after {{them and they}} broke across {{a corner of the}} swale to the woods. Pedro was running straight, with his nose high. He let out one short bark. He headed into the woods, with Dale not far behind. Helen was on one of Dale's best horses, but that fact {{scarcely}} manifested itself, because the others began to increase their lead. They entered the woods. It was open, and fairly good going. Bo's horse ran as fast in the woods as he did in the open. That frightened Helen and <b>she</b> <b>yelled</b> to Bo to hold him in. <b>She</b> <b>yelled</b> to deaf ears. That was Bo's great risk--she did not intend to be careful. Suddenly the forest rang with Dale's encouraging yell, meant to aid the girls in following him. Helen's horse caught the spirit of the chase. He gained somewhat on Bo, hurdling logs, sometimes two at once. Helen's blood leaped with a strange excitement, utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless. Yet her natural fear, and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish risk of this ride, shared alike in her sum of sensations. She tried to remember Dale's caution about dodging branches and snags, and sliding her knees back to avoid knocks from trees. She barely missed some frightful reaching branches. She received a hard knock, then another, that unseated her, but frantically she held on and slid back, {{and at the end of}} a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging blow in the face from a far-spreading branch of pine. Bo missed, by what seemed only an inch, a solid snag that would have broken her in two. Both Pedro and Dale got out of Helen's sight. Then Helen, as she began to lose Bo, felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left behind to get lost in the forest, and she urged her horse. Dale's yell pealed back. Then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than by sight. Wind and brush tore at her. The air was heavily pungent with odor of pine. Helen heard a wild, full bay of the hound, ringing back, full of savage eagerness, and she believed Pedro had roused out the lion from some covert. It lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her horse on faster.|$|E
6000|$|Early in {{the morning}} Grettel {{had to go out}} and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. [...] "First we'll bake," [...] said the old dame; [...] "I've heated the oven already and kneaded the dough." [...] She pushed Grettel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. [...] "Creep in," [...] said the witch, [...] "and see if it's {{properly}} heated, so that we can shove in the bread." [...] For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: [...] "I don't know how I'm to do it; how do I get in?" [...] "You silly goose!" [...] said the hag, [...] "the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself," [...] and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how <b>she</b> <b>yelled,</b> it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.|$|E
