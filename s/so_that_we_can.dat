He [...] "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army {{in the form of a}} Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local [...] "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. [...] "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured.

500|$|The second, more {{fundamental}} rift, concerned {{a discussion about}} whether NATO should form close relationships with countries far beyond NATO's borders, in particular Australia, Japan and South Korea. The United States and some other NATO members pressed for a closer relationship with these countries. R. Nicholas Burns, Under Secretary for Political Affairs explained the US proposal: [...] "We seek a partnership with them <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> train more intensively (...) and grow closer to them because we are deployed with them. Australia, South Korea and Japan are in Afghanistan. They have all been in Iraq (...) [...] in the Balkans." [...] It was however not clear how far this plan would have gone in practice, but the US insisted they were not seeking to turn NATO into a global alliance: membership would not be offered to the prospective new partners. The idea of a [...] "global" [...] NATO however was strongly opposed by France, which considers NATO a regional defence alliance that should not spread its wings too far over the globe. The French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie summarized the position of France as follows: [...] "The development of a global partnership could... dilute the natural solidarity between Europeans and North Americans in a fuzzy entity [...] send a bad political message, that of a campaign launched by the West against those who don't share their ideas. What a pretext we would offer to those who promote {{the idea of a}} clash of civilisations." [...] The summit did not reach a satisfying consensus on the future role of NATO and it was considered an exercise in [...] "papering over cracks", much more than it was ever a serious effort to decide on the future borders and core purposes. As a consequence the debate continued after the summit.|$|E
