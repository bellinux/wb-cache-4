40|$|The {{nervous system}} {{achieves}} stable perceptual representations of objects despite large {{variations in the}} activity patterns of sensory receptors. Here, we explore perceptual constancy {{in the sense of}} touch. Specifically, we investigate the invariance of tactile texture perception across changes in <b>scanning</b> <b>speed.</b> Texture signals in the nerve {{have been shown to be}} highly dependent on speed: temporal spiking patterns in nerve fibers that encode fine textural features contract or dilate systematically with increases or decreases in <b>scanning</b> <b>speed,</b> respectively, resulting in concomitant changes in response rate. Nevertheless, texture perception has been shown, albeit with restricted stimulus sets and limited perceptual assays, to be independent of <b>scanning</b> <b>speed.</b> Indeed, previous studies investigated the effect of <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> on perceived roughness, only one aspect of texture, often with impoverished textures, namely gratings and embossed dot patterns. To fill this gap, we probe the perceptual constancy of a wide range of textures using two different paradigms: one that probes texture perception along well established sensory dimensions independently and one that probes texture perception as a whole. We find that texture perception is highly stable across <b>scanning</b> <b>speeds,</b> irrespective of the texture or the perceptual assay: Any speed-related effects are dwarfed by differences in percepts evoked by different textures. This remarkable speed invariance of texture perception stands in stark contrast to the strong dependence of the texture responses of nerve fibers on <b>scanning</b> <b>speed.</b> Our results imply neural mechanisms that compensate for <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> to achieve stable representations of surface texture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a layer-by-layer Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{process that}} creates {{physical}} metal parts from three dimensional Computer Aided Design (CAD) data. For DMLS to be generally accepted by {{industry as a}} manufacturing technology, high mechanical integrity of final components needs to be demonstrated. Mechanical properties of manufactured components are directly affected {{by the quality of}} each individual laser sintered track of each consecutive layer. In this study, the optimal ratio of laser power and <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> on single tracks was determined for Titanium- 6 Al- 4 V powder on an EOSINT M 270 DMLS machine for a layer thickness that varied between 15 µm and 30 µm.

The most stable tracks resulted from high laser power, slow <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> and thin powder distribution.

LMD samples of titanium alloy, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and copper, Cu were produced by varying the <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> and keeping other parameters constant. The deposited samples were characterized through the volume of deposited composites, microstructure, microhardness {{and the degree of}} porosity. The effect of the optimized high (powder flow rate) PFR, <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> varying from 0. 06 m/min to 1. 2 m/min and a constant power of 1 kW led to a degree of porosity on the deposited composites. The varying percentages of porosities in the samples have an advance merit effect in the implantation of bones in animal and human. It was found that the existence of pores reduced as the <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> increases. The Vickers mirohardness was observed to increase with an increase in the <b>scanning</b> <b>speed</b> which shows an improvement in the properties of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V/Cu composites. At low scanning velocity, the microstructure appears coarse due to the high rate of powder deposited at the same power of 1 kW.

5000|$|Another major {{challenge}} for perovskite solar cells is {{the observation that}} current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.The power-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its current-voltage (IV) behavior under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, {{it has been observed}} that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a hysteretic behavior: depending on scanning conditions - such as scan direction, <b>scan</b> <b>speed,</b> light soaking, biasing - there is a discrepancy between the scan from forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB). Various causes have been proposed such as ion movement, polarization, ferroelectric effects, filling of trap states, [...] however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if the scanning parameters exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic steady-state. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan. Henry Snaith et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.Both methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans. However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.Initial reports suggest that in the 'inverted architecture', which has a transparent cathode, little to no hysteresis is observed. This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.|$|E
