25|$|The jungle is {{also home}} to some of Mexico’s most {{numerous}} and impressive archaeological sites, all of which belong to the Mayan civilization. The most important of these sites are Palenque, Bonampak and Yaxchilan, but there are many more sites and ruins that still lie unexcavated under the vegetation. Palenque lies {{on the edge of the}} Lacandon, where the Eastern Mountains meet the Gulf Coast Plains. It is not the largest Mayan archaeological site, but it has some well-preserved sculpture and architecture the culture produced. Major structures include the Temple of Inscriptions, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Cross; however, only a small fraction of it has been excavated. Away from the ceremonial center and on the way to the site museum are smaller buildings around the Otolum stream with a <b>small</b> <b>waterfall.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{the hunters}} separate, {{with the younger}} one manning a spot high on a cliff near a waterfall. He descends from his post to wash up in a <b>small</b> <b>waterfall</b> in the hills. His gun out of reach, the hunter {{suddenly}} finds himself cornered by the grizzly, who rears and roars {{at the sight of}} the man. Faced with certain death, the hunter cowers in fear. The grizzly, seemingly affected by the hunter's distress, turns and leaves. The young hunter, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun into the air. When the hunter's companion joins him, having heard the gunshots, the younger man tells him that the bear is dead. However, spying the bear ascending a scree, the older man raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by the other man. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the young cub and then ride off into the wilderness.|$|E

During the rain season rainwater filtering through the ground below the city flows out as a <b>small</b> <b>waterfall</b> {{at the bottom of the}} cave. The cave was used for ceremonial activities, related to the presence of the spring within it and the fact that the walls are formed from green phyllite; greenstone was sacred to the Maya and was associated with water and fertility. Ritual activities in the cave have continued into modern times, with ceremonial fires being lit within.|$|E

60|$|In {{this state}} of amorous delirium, I was strolling one morning along a {{beautiful}} wild brook, which I had discovered in a glen. There was one place where a <b>small</b> <b>waterfall,</b> leaping from among rocks into a natural basin, made a scene such as a poet might have chosen as the haunt of some shy Naiad. It was here I usually retired to banquet on my novels. In visiting the place this morning I traced distinctly, on {{the margin of the}} basin, which was of fine clear sand, the prints of a female foot of the most slender and delicate proportions. This was sufficient for an imagination like mine. Robinson Crusoe himself, when he discovered the print of a savage foot on the beach of his lonely island, {{could not have been more}} suddenly assailed with thick-coming fancies.|$|E
