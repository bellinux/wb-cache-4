5|$|In 1978, Gravel {{authored}} {{and secured}} the passage into {{law of the}} General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. While that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed 1980 Alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to Alaskan citizens for pipeline-related revenue, it also {{turned out to be}} <b>significant</b> <b>in</b> the development of binary economics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in El Niño years. During El Niño years, {{conditions}} are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear. This is why Category5s cluster in single seasons. The effects of El Niño are most <b>significant</b> <b>in</b> the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline).|$|E

50|$|There are {{performance}} {{differences and}} similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A 1999 study of discus throwers {{found that for}} F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal {{at the moment of}} release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F6 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F4, F5, F3, F7, F8 and F9 throwers.
