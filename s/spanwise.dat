5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control <b>spanwise</b> flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center {{acquired}} an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights {{in support of}} short programs, chase on X-15 missions and lifting body flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a <b>spanwise</b> blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these <b>spanwise</b> vortices shed behind the flap, chordwise vortices shed from {{in front of the}} flap become important at high angles of attack.|$|E
25|$|Vortilons {{consist of}} one or more flat plates {{attached}} to the underside of the wing near its leading edge, aligned with the flight direction. When the speed is reduced and the aircraft approaches stall, the local flow at the leading edge is diverted outwards; this <b>spanwise</b> component of velocity around the vortilon creates a vortex streamed around the top surface, which energises the boundary layer. A more turbulent boundary layer, in turn, delays the local flow separation.|$|E
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with <b>spanwise</b> position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The basic design, {{common to}} both models, {{was that of}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cabin. The main gear wheels of the undercarriage were retractable, and the tailwheel was steerable. The aircraft structure incorporated a framework built up of welded steel tube which extended lengthwise from the engine firewall {{to the rear of the}} cabin, and <b>spanwise</b> from one undercarriage well to the other. Around this framework was a conventional, monocoque fuselage. The MAC-125 was powered by a single 125-hp engine while the MAC-145 production model had a 145-hp engine instead and a larger tail fin.|$|E
25|$|The rudder {{mass balance}} {{was larger than}} that of {{production}} aircraft, with an angled lower edge cutting further {{into the top of}} the fin. Although the basic wing plan was to stay the same for most production Spitfires, the prototype wing was structurally different: No weapons were fitted and the alclad skinning was laid out in <b>spanwise</b> strips; underneath the port wing the radiator bath started immediately behind the starboard undercarriage bay, with the opening conforming to the angle of the bay. Unlike production aircraft the wingtips were {{an integral part of the}} structure and, for the first series of tests a long pitot tube projected from near the port wingtip.|$|E

500|$|Both early {{accidents}} {{were originally}} attributed to pilot error, as over-rotation {{had led to}} a loss of lift from {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's wings. It was later determined that the Comet's wing profile experienced a loss of lift at a high angle of attack, and its engine inlets also suffered a lack of pressure recovery in the same conditions. As a result, de Havilland re-profiled the wings' leading edge with a pronounced [...] "droop", and wing fences were added to control <b>spanwise</b> flow. A fictionalised investigation into the Comet's takeoff accidents was the subject of the 1959 novel Cone of Silence by Arthur David Beaty, a former BOAC captain. Cone of Silence was made into a film in 1960, and Beaty also recounted the story of the Comet's takeoff accidents in a chapter of his 1984 non-fiction work, Strange Encounters: Mysteries of the Air.|$|E

2500|$|The ARV Super2 is a {{side-by-side}} configuration two-seater with {{a shoulder}} wing for improved visibility. [...] The wing is swept forward 5° to maintain correct {{centre of gravity}} balance. The wing area is a small , giving a wing loading of 11.9lb/ft² (58.1kg/m²). [...] The forward sweep may also promote a <b>spanwise</b> airflow inwards towards the root, thereby reducing {{the likelihood of a}} wingtip stall. [...] The ARV's tapered fibreglass wingtips help to reduce drag from wingtip vortices.|$|E
2500|$|The Triplane also {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for structural weakness because the wings of some aircraft collapsed in steep dives. This defect was attributed {{to the use of}} light gauge bracing wires in the 46 aircraft built by subcontractor Clayton & Shuttleworth. [...] Several pilots of No. 10 Naval Squadron used cables or additional wires to strengthen their Triplanes. In 1918, the RAF issued a technical order for the installation of a <b>spanwise</b> compression strut between the inboard cabane struts of surviving Triplanes. One aircraft, serial N5912, was fitted with additional mid-bay flying wires on the upper wing while used as a trainer.|$|E
2500|$|Reynolds {{numbers are}} used in airfoil design to (among other things) manage [...] "scale effect" [...] when computing/comparing {{characteristics}} (a tiny wing, scaled to be huge, will perform differently). Fluid dynamicists define the chord Reynolds number [...] like this: , where [...] is the flight speed, [...] is the chord length, and [...] is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in which the airfoil operates, which is [...] for the atmosphere at sea level. In some special studies a characteristic length other than chord may be used; rare is the [...] "span Reynolds number", {{which is not to}} be confused with <b>spanwise</b> stations on a wing, where chord is still used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} Bee was of novel construction, built around a wide box formed from four <b>spanwise</b> spruce members connected with ply, constant in chord but tapering in thickness. [...] Aerofoil shaped ribs were then slipped around the box and fabric covered. The wings had almost constant chord, tapering in plan only slightly and carrying long ailerons. A 40hp (30kW) four-cylinder water-cooled Carden-Ford engine lay buried in each wing immediately behind the box spar, driving a small two-bladed propeller via a gearbox, which increased the output speed by 10%, and a shaft to the trailing edge. These shafts were horizontal in flight, and so emerged above the wing surface on the way rearwards, contained in a shallow cowling. Radiators were mounted inside the wing, next to the engine, the cooling air ducted from under {{the front of the}} wing and exited via slots {{in the rear of the}} cowling. Fuel was stored in leading-edge tanks.|$|E
2500|$|Structurally the HD.15 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft, {{though the}} flying surfaces and rear fuselage were fabric covered. [...] The wings had rectangular section Duralumin box spars, assisted by tubular auxiliary spars forward and aft of them. In plan they were straight edged, unswept and of constant chord and thickness. The lower wing had a slightly greater span. [...] The wing tips were essentially square, {{except that the}} horn balances of the short span ailerons on both upper and lower wings projected beyond. There was no stagger. The HD.15 had unusual interplane struts: instead of the familiar division of the wing into bays by struts braced with crossed flying and landing wires, it had a rigid, <b>spanwise,</b> X-shaped strut on each side, linking {{the upper and lower}} spars. [...] Vertical wires maintained the interplane gap and the location of the crossing point, which was below mid-gap. The inboard end of each upper X-strut met the wing {{at the top of the}} aft member of a pair of cabane struts. [...] The lower ends of the X-strut [...] met the wing further outboard, at the bottom of a strut that ran to the upper fuselage longeron. [...] The empennage of the HD.15 was like those used on earlier Emile Dupont designs, with a braced, rectangular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and a small, curved edged fin. [...] Both carried balanced control surfaces, the elevator's balances projecting beyond the tailplane tips, and the low but broad chord, curved edge, deep rudder reaching down to the keel and moving within an elevator cut-out.|$|E
5000|$|To derive {{the model}} {{we start with}} the {{assumption}} that the circulation of the wing varies {{as a function of the}} <b>spanwise</b> locations. The function assumed is a Fourier function. Firstly, the coordinate for the <b>spanwise</b> location [...] is transformed by , where y is <b>spanwise</b> location, and s is the semi-span of the wing.|$|E
50|$|When a {{swept wing}} travels at high speed, the airflow has {{little time to}} react and simply flows over the wing almost {{straight}} from front to back. At lower speeds the air does have time to react, and is pushed <b>spanwise</b> by the angled leading edge, towards the wing tip. At the wing root, by the fuselage, this has little noticeable effect, but as one moves towards the wingtip the airflow is pushed <b>spanwise</b> {{not only by the}} leading edge, but the <b>spanwise</b> moving air beside it. At the tip the airflow is moving along the wing instead of over it, a problem known as <b>spanwise</b> flow.|$|E

50|$|Theoretically, {{the most}} {{efficient}} way to create lift is to generate it in an elliptical <b>spanwise</b> distribution across the wing.

50|$|The {{important}} distinction between serpentine plasma actuators and more tradition geometries {{is that the}} geometry of the electrodes has been modified in order to periodic across its span.

5000|$|The lift {{tends to}} {{decrease}} in the <b>spanwise</b> direction from root to tip, and the pressure distributions around the airfoil sections change accordingly in the <b>spanwise</b> direction. Pressure distributions in planes perpendicular to the flight direction tend {{to look like the}} illustration at right. [...] This spanwise-varying pressure distribution is sustained by a mutual interaction with the velocity field. Flow below the wing is accelerated outboard, flow outboard of the tips is accelerated upward, and flow above the wing is accelerated inboard, which results in the flow pattern illustrated at right.|$|E
