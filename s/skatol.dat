To date, undecenovanillylamide is the most effective substance found and is most effective in a mixture with p-dichlorobenzene. Three materials which have been tested actually appear to stimulate attack by coyotes on the treated animal. These are: <b>Skatol</b> (a fecal compound), Naphthalene and Thiomalic acid (a foul sulpher-like odor) ...|$|E
40|$|A psychophysical {{detection}} {{test was}} used to measure the response of human subjects to ‘good’ and ‘bad’ smells. Different intensities and frequencies of odour stimulation were delivered by an olfactometer and the responses to a group of malodours (valeric acid, <b>skatol,</b> butyric acid) and pleasant smells (amyl acetate, cis- 3 -hexenol, linalool) were compared. A mathematical model, a power equation, was used to fit the three-dimensional data plots (dose vs. stimulus frequency vs. response). The model was able to distinguish between malodours and pleasant odours {{on the basis of the}} values of parameters describing dose–response and adaptation/habituation. We show that the olfactory system adapts/habituates more rapidly to malodours than to pleasant smells, but is much more sensitive to changes in stimulation by malodours than pleasant odours. The degree of adaptation is inversely proportional to stimulus strength. The response profile for women was different to that of men for certain odours, in particular valeric acid, <b>skatol</b> and cis- 3 -hexenol. The difference lay in their sensitivity and the slope and range of the dose response. Thus, we have shown for the first time that the olfactory system adapts more readily to ‘bad’ smells than ‘good’ smells, and that it has a broader range of adaptation for bad smells. As a consequence, the olfactory system is specially responsive to changes in potential olfactory warning signals...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary supplementation with {{lactulose}} (3 g/d for 2 wk) on the faecal flora and faecal bacterial metabolism was studied in eight healthy volunteers. During the intake of lactulose, {{the number of}} bifidobacteria increased significantly (P< 0. 01), whereas the numbers of lecithinase-positive clostridia, including Closrridiurn perfringens, and Bacteroidaceae decreased (P < 0. 05) compared to values {{before and after the}} intake. Faecal indole, <b>skatol</b> and phenols, and faecal P-glucuronidase, nitroreductase and azoreductase activities were decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) after 7 - 14 d of treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of proanthocyanidin-rich extracts from grape seeds on human fecal ora and fecal odor. Proanthocyanidin-rich extract containing 38. 5 % proanthocyanidin was administered to nine healthy adults at a dose of 0. 5 g:day (0. 19 g:day as proanthocyanidin) for 2 weeks, and proanthocyanidin-rich extract containing 89. 3 % proanthocyanidin was administered to eight elderly inpatients at a dose of 0. 43 g:day (0. 38 g:day as proanthocyanidin) for 2 weeks. Green tea extract and:or champignon extract, both of which have been found to have a deodorant effect on fecal odor, were administered in a similar manner as controls. In healthy adults, marked decreases in fecal odor and concentrations of methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sul de in feces were observed during proanthocyanidin-rich extract intake, but the effects of green tea extract and champignon extract were weak. After 2 weeks of proanthocyanidin-rich extract intake, the number of Bi dobacterium had increased signi cantly (pB 0. 05), whereas the number of Enterobacteriaceae tended to decrease (p 0. 121). The level of putrefactive substances, including ammonia, phenol, p-cresol, 4 -ethylphe-nol, indole, and <b>skatols</b> tended to decrease after proanthocyanidin-rich extract intake, and fecal pH also tended to decrease. Nurses and hospital aides performed organoleptic evaluations that showed less fecal odor in elderly inpatients with proanthocyanidin-rich extract intake than with champignon extract intake. In an in ×itro study, the proanthocyanidin-rich extract reduced methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sul de release from the feces of healthy adults, and also reduced methyl mercaptan release from methyl mercaptan solution.

40|$|Olfactory {{involvement}} is well recognized {{in patients with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD). The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine smell function quantitatively, using different types and concentrations of odorants in PD patients. We aimed to elucidate whether a specific odor can affect the severity and duration of PD patients. A total of 89 nondemented PD patients and 20 age-matched controls participated in the study. Quantitative evaluation of smell function was performed using the T and T olfactometer test. This test contains five kinds of odorants at different concentrations. Recognition threshold (RT) scores for all five odorants and for each individual odorant were measured in five groups of PD patients with Hoehn and Yale (HY) stages I (n = 12), II (n = 24), III (n = 43), and IV (n = 10), as well as in control subjects (n = 20). One-way analysis of variance and Ryan’s method were used for statistical comparison between the five groups. Compared with controls and HY I patients, total RT scores were significantly higher in HY II, III, and IV patients. There were no statistically significant differences in RT scores between HY I patients and controls. However, total RT scores for three HY I patients (25 %) were higher than the mean + two standard deviations of controls. On single odorant testing, significant higher RT scores for methylcyclopentenolone and <b>skatol</b> were found in HY II, III, and IV patients, in comparison with controls and HY I patients. The remaining three odorants did not differ statistically between PD patients and control subjects. The present study indicated that hyposmia in PD patients increased from HY II onwards. A single odorant of methyl cyclopentenolone or <b>skatol</b> had benefits for olfactory evaluation in PD patients. Our data also clarified that olfactory deficits occurred in a subset of HY I patients.

40|$|Goat milk was {{characterized}} and analyzed by human sensory evaluation and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O). Most potent odor-active compounds were determined in (a) raw goat's milk {{from two different}} seasons and (b) heated goat's milk after different treatment intensities. A trained panel found sensorial differences between winter and summer milks (seasonal effect) and milks from different farms (farm-specific effect). A total of 54 odor-active compounds with flavor dilution (FD) factors = 8 were detected of which 42 odorants were identified. 4 -Ethyloctanoic acid, 3 -methylindole (<b>skatol)</b> and one unknown compound (RI 2715) showed highest intensities in all raw milks. With heat treatment, goat-like, stable-like, and (cooked) milk-like odor characteristics decreased while caramel-like or vanilla-like notes increased. In total, 66 odor-active compounds were detected in heated goat milks (FD = 8). To {{the best of our}} knowledge, only 16 of the 42 identified odorants were reported before in raw goat's milk.

40|$|Organic pork {{is a clear}} {{alternative}} to conventional pork because organic pig production, with outdoor access and roughage, is quite different. The low market share (1 %) for organic pork provides a promising development potential. Consumer expectation for a natural product means that a stop for castration could provide new marketing possibilities. A recent pilot study on production of entire males on commercial organic farms indicates {{that the proportion of}} organic produced entire male pigs with boar taint is so high that it is a major barrier for a marked orientated growth in organic pig production. In this project we develop a management concept for future organic pig production without castration, with a documented low level of entire male pigs {{with a high level of}} <b>skatol</b> and androstenone in back fat and therefore a minimum risk for boar taint. The risk of boar taint can be reduced by feeding the right feeds in the right combination. The best feed rations are selected based on their ability to minimize boar taint and tested for consequences for productivity, nutrient utilization and natural disease resistance. Subsequently the best feeding is combined with the best decisions concerning, pig weight when taken from pasture, group size and grouping strategy and slaughter weight and the concept is tested for the overall effect on skatole and androstenone level in male pig. The consequences for economy and working conditions are demonstrated for farmers and citizens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] Membrane inlet mass {{spectrometry}} (MIMS) {{is presented as}} a new tool for monitoring the removal efficiency of biofilters with respect to odour compounds. The MIMS technique is based on the separation of volatile chemicals and gases from an air stream by a thin silicone membrane adjacent to the ion source of a standard quadropole mass spectrometer. The vacuum conditions of the MS forces the separated compounds to diffuse through the membrane and evaporate in the ion source. The compounds are detected by MS by means of specific molecular ions or fragment ions. It is possible to monitor a number of individual compounds or compound groups contributing to the odour nuisance of livestock facilities. 4 -Methylphenol (p-cresol), <b>skatol,</b> indol, 4 -ethylphenol, phenol and dimethyltrisulfide give rise to specific signals corresponding to molecular fragments. A variety of carboxylic acids can be detected by signals corresponding to three subgroups of this compound group. The sum of reduced organic sulphur compounds (ROS) are measured by a common signal. The contribution of individual sulphur compounds (mainly methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide) to ROS can be estimated from supplementary MS fragments. MIMS is not suitable for measuring ammonia and hydrogen sulphide for which other methods must be applied. MIMS is suitable for continuous monitoring on-site and has been applied for evaluation of a number of biofilters in the Danish agricultural sector, primarily for treating ventilated air from pig barns...|$|E
