However, to calibrate such models, special uniform calibration patches need to be printed. These calibration patches use space and have to be removed from the final product. The present contribution shows how to deduce the ink spreading behavior of the color halftones from spectral reflectances acquired within printed color images. Image tiles of a color as uniform as possible are selected within the printed images. The ink spreading behavior is fitted by relying on the spectral reflectances of the selected image tiles. A relevance metric specifies the impact of each ink spreading curve on the selected image tiles. These relevance metrics are used to constrain the corresponding ink spreading curves.

40|$|Abstract- Detection {{of areas}} {{of water on}} the land surface via aerial imagery is highly {{desirable}} for assisting land management. As near-infrared (IR) energy tends to be absorbed by water, this property of low <b>spectral</b> <b>reflection</b> is usually utilized in analyzing water resources on land. However, the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflection</b> of shallow water varies significantly. It is difficult to distinguish such areas from the background by traditional land cover classifications. This paper proposes an object-based classification approach for automatically detecting water areas from aerial imagery with red, green, blue, and IR bands. To overcome the problem of inadequate class definition in conventional region-based classifications, the water areas (we focus here on farm dams) are divided into a number of classes, and we newly introducing a specific feature of spectral differences and proposed a decision tree (DT) approach to select the features required for each class. In this way, we separate small water areas from other objects with significant reduction in false alarms caused by the diversity of spectra in the feature space. Experiments show that the proposed approach has good capability to distinguish shallow water areas from other objects in wetlands.

40|$|On every arm of {{cuttlefish}} and squid {{there is}} a stripe of high-reflectance iridophores that reflects highly polarized light. Since cephalopods possess polarization vision, it has been hypothesized that these polarized stripes could serve an intraspecific communication function. We determined how polarization changes when these boneless arms move. By measuring the spectral and polarizing properties of the reflected light from samples at various angles of tilt and rotation, {{we found that the}} actual posture of the arm has little or no effect on partial polarization or the e-vector angle of the reflected light. However, when the illumination angle changed, the partial polarization of the reflected light also changed. The <b>spectral</b> <b>reflections</b> of the signals were also affected by the angle of illumination but not by the orientation of the sample. Electron microscope samples showed that these stripes are composed of several groups of multilayer platelets within the iridophores. The surface normal to each group is oriented at a different angle, which produces essentially constant reflection of polarized light over a range of viewing angles. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish and squid could send out reliable polarization signals to a receiver regardless of arm orientation...|$|R

Planning of agricultural mechanization, fertilizer and pesticide requirements, pests and diseases control, estimates of agricultural production, income and tax and financial planning, all linked to the cultivated areas and estimation of agricultural products.

40|$|Cloud {{is one of}} {{the most}} common interferers in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrum-radiometer (MODIS) remote sensing imagery. Because of cloud interference, much {{important}} and useful information covered by cloud cannot be recovered well. How to detect and remove cloud from MODIS imagery is an important issue for wide application of remote sensing data. In general, cloud can be roughly divided into two types, namely, thin cloud and thick cloud. In order to effectively detect and eliminate cloud, an automatic algorithm of cloud detection and removal is proposed in this paper. Firstly, several necessary preprocessing works need to be done for MODIS L 1 B data, including geometric precision correction, bowtie effect elimination and stripe noise removal. Furthermore, through analyzing the cloud spectral characters derived from the thirty-six bands of MODIS data, it can be found the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflections</b> of ground and cloud are different in various MODIS bands. Hence, cloud and ground can be respectively identified based on the analysis of multispectral characters derived from MODIS imagery. Cloud removal processing mainly aims at cloud region rather than whole image, which can improve processing efficiency. As for thin cloud and thick cloud regions, the corresponding cloud removal algorithms are proposed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively detect and remove cloud from MODIS imagery, which can meet the demands of post-processing of remote sensing imagery. </p...|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} towards {{the development of}} a passive wireless sensor for measurement of temperature in coal gasifiers and coal-fired boiler plants. Approaches investigated included metamaterial sensors based on guided mode resonance filters, and temperature-sensitive antennas that modulate the frequency of incident radio waves as they are re-radiated by the antenna. In the guided mode resonant filter metamaterial approach, temperature is encoded as changes in the sharpness of the filter response, which changes with temperature because the dielectric loss of the guided mode resonance filter is temperature-dependent. In the mechanically modulated antenna approach, the resonant frequency of a vibrating cantilever beam attached to the antenna changes with temperature. The vibration of the beam perturbs the electrical impedance of the antenna, so that incident radio waves are phase modulated at a frequency equal to the resonant frequency of the vibrating beam. Since the beam resonant frequency depends on temperature, a Doppler radar can be used to remotely measure the temperature of the antenna. Laboratory testing of the guided mode resonance filter failed to produce the spectral response predicted by simulations. It was concluded that the spectral response was dominated by <b>spectral</b> <b>reflections</b> of radio waves incident on the filter. Laboratory testing of the mechanically modulated antenna demonstrated that the device frequency shifted incident radio waves, and that the frequency of the re-radiated waves varied linearly with temperature.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an active (real time) recognition strategy whereby information is inferred iteratively across several viewpoints in descent imagery. We will show how we use inverse theory {{within the context}} of parametric model generation, namely height and <b>spectral</b> <b>reflection</b> functions, to generate model assertions. Using this strategy in an active context implies that, from every viewpoint, the proposed system must refine its hypotheses taking into account the image and the effect of uncertainties as well. The proposed system employs probabilistic solutions to the problem of iteratively merging information (images) from several viewpoints. This involves feeding the posterior distribution from all previous images as a prior for the next view. Novel approaches will be developed to accelerate the inversion search using novel statistic implementations and reducing the model complexity using foveated vision. Foveated vision refers to imagery where the resolution varies across the image. In this paper, we allow the model to be foveated where the highest resolution region is called the foveation region. Typically, the images will have dynamic control of the location of the foveation region. For descent imagery in the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) process, it is possible to have more than one foveation region.
