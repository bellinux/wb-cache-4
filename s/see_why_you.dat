2500|$|Stewart began {{spending}} time in Oregon in 1903. [...] He was allowed to represent clients in local Portland courts before passing the bar examination, and was assigned as the public defender {{in a few cases}} in 1903. [...] Like the Twin Cities, Portland's black community was small when Stewart permanently settled there in 1904. [...] Most African Americans were service workers or unskilled, menial laborers, though there were some black-owned businesses. Stewart's father was disappointed in his son's decision to move to Portland, noting [...] "But for the life of me, I can't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are 'using up' your life where you are", suggesting his son try moving abroad like he had. [...] Stewart disregarded the advice and remained in Oregon, and was the first African American admitted to the state bar on March 1, 1901.|$|E
2500|$|On Kristallnacht, an anti-Semitic pogrom {{that took}} place on the night of November 9, 1938 and {{resulted}} in the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and the deaths of 91 Jews, Trepp was arrested and placed in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was held as one of as many as 30,000 Jews who were arrested and held in prison camps by the Nazis. In the wake of Jews being detained and dying, Trepp saw his role as being part of [...] "a very rewarding rabbinate because the Jews needed me". [...] He recalled the inmates being called out in Sachsenhausen at 4:00 in the morning, seeing the guard towers manned with soldiers holding machine guns and being told [...] "You are the dregs of humanity. I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should live". [...] He told God that he was prepared to die, but was overcome with the feeling that [...] "God was with me. I know God was there. In the concentration camp with me. And it was the worst place for it. That's why it was the best." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Morrison {{included}} Tench {{in a new}} band lineup as {{the lead}} guitarist and a vocalist, in March 1978 to record the Wavelength album. Tench was recommended to Morrison by drummer Peter Van Hooke, after Hooke had seen him perform with Streetwalkers. In an interview with Johnny Rogan Tench stated: [...] "I quite liked the songs [...] "Natalia" [...] and [...] "Wavelength" [...] because I {{had a lot to}} do with them. They came together quickly. He's a very quick worker and once it's there he doesn't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> can't record it. He let us get on with it, really. It was a good band". He was credited with production assistance, guitar, and backing vocals on this album, which became Morrison's best selling album at that time. He also contributed lead guitar and vocals to the promotional Wavelength tour which followed. The tour started in Santa Clara, California on 30 September 1978 and ended on 1 March 1979 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. By the end of the tour he had appeared in Morrison's lineup sixty two times.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} annual High School Hoops magazine, the players {{weighed in on}} the subject of the new rules {{regarding}} draft eligibility. Many of them felt that it was unfair. Kansas State freshman Bill Walker, said (as a junior in high school), [...] "I'm against it. I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have to be 19 to play a game of basketball when you can be 18 and go to war for our country and die. It's ridiculous." [...] Jerryd Bayless said [...] "It's not fair at all. If a tennis player can go pro at 13, I don't understand why a basketball player can't go pro at 18." [...] A possible number one pick out of high school, had the rule not been put in place, was Greg Oden (though he was still picked first in 2007). When asked about the agreement he said [...] "It's unfair, but it's over with now, so there's no reason to complain." [...] In spite of the claims that the rule is unfair, Wayne Ellington of North Carolina, said that [...] "…I also think it's going to help the league a little bit. Some guys who come in, like from this year's draft, it will help." [...] Brandan Wright said that [...] "It may hurt guys who need money, but it will help people grow and develop." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The little {{manicure}} girl whom I {{met in the}} Soho restaurant," [...] {{he replied}} promptly, [...] "what on earth was her reason for wishing me to come and <b>see</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Why</b> did <b>you</b> want me to come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a risk, this, we are running," [...] he muttered. [...] "I do not <b>see,</b> Selingman, <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{could not}} have hired this fellow through Allen {{or one of the}} others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{there was}} nothing else to <b>see.</b> <b>Why</b> do <b>you</b> ask? But you mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so." ...|$|R

60|$|Diana didn't <b>see</b> <b>why,</b> if <b>you</b> had an {{imagination}} at all, you couldn't {{stretch it}} to that extent; but probably Anne knew best, and the chore boy was finally christened ROBERT RAY, to be called BOBBY should occasion require.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Philippa rejoined, {{with cold}} surprise; [...] "I <b>see</b> no reason <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should not answer such simple {{questions}} at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't {{meet you}} anywhere. I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't keep calling for me. But if you won't, I don't {{want to meet}} you." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lord John, {{in spite}} of this however, pumped up a tone. [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should speak as if I were urging some abomination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{predecessor}} {{never was}} a new broom," [...] retorted Lawson, quickly. [...] "Sennett always had a nasty slaunch to him. He never in his life cleaned the dirt from the corners, and I don't <b>see</b> exactly <b>why</b> <b>you</b> take such pains in defending him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, sir, I <b>see</b> not <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{should play}} the {{champion}} of a wench that will none of you, and incur the resentment of a favourite's favourite, as dangerous a monster as ever a knight adventurer encountered in the old story books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] he then said; [...] "I <b>see</b> {{no reason}} <b>why</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't go--particularly as your mother means {{to stay with}} Margaret Willans." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nicholas flared up. [...] "Harry Riddle {{is going}} in the coach. I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> can't take me sometimes. You like him better than me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O, I don't know," [...] he replied. [...] "Why in snakes should anybody {{want to be}} a sculptor, if {{you come}} to that? I would love to sculp myself. But what I can't <b>see</b> is <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should want to do nothing else. It seems to argue a poverty of nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All right,' said Venables, 'I don't <b>see</b> {{any reason}} <b>why</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't. We {{have to catch}} the 8.14 at the station. Don't you go missing it or anything.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{were so much}} impressed," [...] she remarked after a while. [...] "There {{is nothing}} very strange in him after all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{worry about}} that, Carrie. If {{he had gone}} out to Cadiz or Oporto, as your uncle intended, you don't suppose the people there would have troubled {{themselves}} about him. He would just have gone his own way. You went your own way, didn't you? And it is mighty little you troubled yourself about what your uncle was likely to say, when you took up with an Irishman in a marching regiment; and I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should trouble now.|$|E
