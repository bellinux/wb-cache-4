40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis involves the study of ice cloud microphysical and optical properties using both hyperspectral and narrowband infrared spectral data. First, ice cloud models are developed for the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument onboard the METOP-A satellite, which provide the bulk-scattering properties of these clouds for the 8461 IASI channels between 645 and 2760 cm- 1. We investigate the sensitivity of simulated brightness temperatures in this spectral region to the bulk-scattering properties of ice clouds containing individual ice crystal habits {{as well as for}} one habit distribution. The second part of this thesis describes an algorithm developed to analyze the sensitivity of simulated brightness temperatures at 8. 5 and 11. 0 ?m to changes in effective cloud temperature by adjusting cloud top height and geometric thickness in a <b>standard</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Applicability of using these channels in a bi-spectral approach to retrieve cirrus cloud effective particle size and optical thickness is assessed. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the retrieval of these ice cloud properties for a case of single-layered cirrus cloud over a tropical ocean surface using measurements from the Moderate Resolution Infrared Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Cloud top height and geometric thickness in the profile are adjusted to assess the influence of effective cloud temperature on the retrieval...|$|E
40|$|The shortwave {{broadband}} albedo {{at the top}} of {{a molecular}} atmosphere over ocean between 40 deg N and 40 deg S is estimated using radiance measurements from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument and the Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS) aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The albedo monotonically increases from 0. 059 at a solar zenith angle of 10 deg to 0. 107 at a solar zenith angle of 60 deg. The estimated uncertainty in the albedo is 3. 5 x 10 (exp - 3) caused by the uncertainty in CERES-derived irradiances, uncertainty in VIRS-derived aerosol optical thicknesses, variations in ozone and water vapor, and variations in surface wind speed. The estimated uncertainty is similar in magnitude to the standard deviation of 0. 003 that is derived from 72 areas divided by 20 deg latitude by 20 deg longitude grid boxes. The empirically estimated albedo is compared with the modeled albedo using a radiative transfer model combined with an ocean surface bidirectional reflectivity model. The modeled albedo with <b>standard</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is 0. 061 and 0. 111 at the solar zenith angles of 10 deg and 60 deg, respectively.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{reviewing}} several recent developments concerning certain class of geophysical models, including the primitive equations (PEs) of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics and a <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model. The PEs for large-scale oceanic and atmospheric dynamics are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to the heat convection by adopting the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations, while the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model considered here is a nonlinear interaction system between the barotropic mode and the first baroclinic mode of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with moisture. We are mainly concerned with the global well-posedness of strong solutions to these systems, with full or partial viscosity, as well as certain singular perturbation small parameter limits related to these systems, including the small aspect ratio limit from the Navier-Stokes equations to the PEs, and a small relaxation-parameter in the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model. These limits provide a rigorous justification to the hydrostatic balance in the PEs, and to the relaxation limit of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model, respectively. Some conditional uniqueness of weak solutions, and the global well-posedness of weak solutions with certain class of discontinuous initial data, to the PEs are also presented.

40|$|A two-column {{model of}} the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is developed. The two columns are kept in {{buoyancy}} equilibrium by mass exchange driven by the inter-column pressure gradient, and diabatic processes are parameterized by highly simplified schemes. This model is used to investigate whether spon-taneous large-scale circulations will develop in the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> when the sea surface temperature and solar radiative forcing are uniform. Such circulations do indeed develop in the model, with ascent in one column and descent in the other, {{when one of the}} columns is slightly perturbed from the initial state of radiative-convective equilibrium. A key element of the circulation dynamics is that increased equivalent potential temperature in a column leads to enhanced convection and rainfall in that column, which fur-ther increases the equivalent potential temperature there. The latter effect arises because convection enhances surface heat fluxes and decreases outgoing longwave radiation by virtue of the increase in stratiform cloudiness. These results form an attractive explanation for the observed patchiness of deep convection over warm tropical oceans and suggest that further modeling and observational work be directed toward understanding the budget of equiva-lent potential temperature in the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and its relationship to rainfall. 2...|$|R
40|$|Local convective-radiative {{equilibrium}} {{states of}} the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> {{are determined by the}} following external forcing: 1) Insolation, 2) Surface heat and moisture exchanges (primarily radiation and evaporation), 3) Heating and moistening induced by large-scale circulation.

We extend our previous study using the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) Model which resolves convective-radiative processes more explicitly than global climate models do. Several experiments are carried out under fixed insolation and sea surface temperature. The prescribed SST consists of a uniform warm pool (29 C) surrounded by uniform cold SST (26 C). The model produces "Walker"-type circulation with the ascending branch of the model atmosphere more humid than the descending part, but the vertically integrated temperature does not show a horizontal gradient.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the Amazon {{deforestation}} problem predict that removal of the forest {{will result in a}} higher surface temperature, a significant reduction in evaporation and precipitation, and possibly significant changes in the tropical circulation. Here, we discuss the basic mechanisms contributing to the response of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to deforestation. A simple linear model of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is used in studying the effects of deforestation on climate. It IS suggested that the impact of large-scale deforestation on the circulation of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> consists of two components: the response of the tropical circulation to the negative change in precipitation (heating), and the response of the same circulation to the positiue change in surface temperature. Owing to their different signs, the changes in predicted temperature and precipitation excite competing responses working in opposite directions. The predicted change in tropical circulation determines the change, if any, in atmospheric moisture convergence, which is equivalent to the change in run-off. The dependence of run-off predictions on the relative magnitudes of the predicted changes in precipitation and surface temperature implies that the predictions about run-off are highly sensitive, which explains, at least partly, the disagreement between the different models concerning the sign of the predicted change in Amazonian run-off. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{response}} of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to steady forcing for all four seasons is computed using a simple two-layer linear primitive-equation model allowing an arbitrary basic flow with two-dimensional shear. The character of each seasonal response is studied, and two distinct forms of behavior are found. Near the Equator, the forcing excites a slowly varying Kelvin wave of the time scale of months while, in midlatitudes, the atmosphere responds via the Rossby mode. Both regimes are separated by the critical latitudes existing on the poleward limits of the easterly channel of the basic flow. The longwave scale {{response of}} the equatorial motions noted by Krishnamurti are shown to be {{the results of the}} natural filtering of the slowly varying Kelvin wave. The temporal variation of this zonal circulation is discussed. The analysis is extended to infer the behavior and location of transient disturbances in the upper tropical tropo-sphere for time scales much less than seasonal. Also shown is that the zonal mean flow plus the standing eddies are locally barotropically unstable, providing preferred geographical locations for the development and maintenance of transient disturbances. Such locations are shown to vary seasonally. Variations of the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of time scales much greater than seasonal also are investigated. It is shown that the correlations of Walker may be thought of as long-term variations in the seasonal standing eddies, which themselves provide a mode of communication throughout the <b>tropical</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Also suggested is that the Walker circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean may be thought of as the slowly varying filtered Kelvin wave response, within the easterly channel of the basic flow, weighted toward the long-wave heating distribution of low latitides. 1...|$|R
