In 806, 68 monks were killed and the next year the abbot withdrew to Kells in Ireland, taking the relics of St. Columba with him. There were periodic returns of abbots and relics, often ending in more massacres. Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and the Hebrides eventually fell to the pagan Norsemen, curtailing the influence of the church in the Highlands and Islands. The threat posed by the Vikings may have forced a union between the kingdoms of Dál Riata and the Picts under Kenneth mac Alpin, traditionally dated to 843. In 849, according to the Annals of Ulster, the abbot of Iona once again took Columba's relics to Ireland, but the earliest version of the Chronicles of the Kings of Scots <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year they were removed by Kenneth mac Alpin, to a church he had built, probably at Dunkeld, perhaps indicating that the relics were divided.

The film, which was censored in France, showed the methods used by the French colonial army in Algeria, including the systemic use of torture. The naval chaplain (again, not Caggiano) introduced the film and added a commentary from the religious point of view, reportedly justifying the use of torture as a weapon.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the most}} widely {{accepted}} version of its origin, the Thai state based at Ayutthaya in {{the valley of the}} Chao Phraya River rose from the earlier, nearby Lavo Kingdom (at that time, still {{under the control of the}} Khmer Empire) and Suvarnabhumi. One source <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-fourteenth century, due to the threat of an epidemic, King Uthong moved his court south into the rich floodplain of the Chao Phraya River onto an island surrounded by rivers. The name of the city indicates the influence of Hinduism in the region.

25|$|Likewise the new labour historians {{believe that}} {{the rise of the}} Knights of Labor caused the Orange and Catholic Irish in Toronto to resolve their generational hatred and set about to form a common working-class culture. This theory presumes that Irish-Catholic culture was of little value, to be {{rejected}} with such ease. Nicolson (1985) argues that neither theory is valid. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ghettos of Toronto the fusion of an Irish peasant culture with traditional Catholism produced a new, urban, ethno-religious vehicle - Irish Tridentine Catholism. This culture spread from the city to the hinterland and, by means of metropolitan linkage, throughout Ontario. Privatism created a closed Irish society, and, while Irish Catholics cooperated in labour organizations for the sake of their families' future, they never shared {{in the development of a}} new working-class culture with their old Orange enemies.|$|E
25|$|The 1846 {{abolition}} in Jaipur {{was regarded}} by many British {{as a catalyst}} for the abolition cause within the Rajputana; within 4 months after Jaipur's 1846 ban, 11 of the 18 independently governed states in Rajputana had followed Jaipur's example. One paper <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 1846-1847 alone, 23 states in the whole of India (not just within Rajputana) had banned sati. It was not before 1861 sati was legally banned in all princely states of India, Mewar resisting {{for a long time before}} that time. The last legal case within princely states was from 1861 Udaipur the capital of Mewar, but as Anant S. Altekar shows, local opinion had then shifted strongly against the practice. All the widows of Maharanna Sarup Singh flatly refused to become sati when asked, and the one who was burnt with him was a slave girl. Later the same year, the general ban on sati was issued by a proclamation from Queen Victoria.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have grossly exaggerated Jewish presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Communist Party.

Leng presents three possible interpretations for this couplet: [...] "another play on the blind seer idea"; Harrison's rejection of the concept espoused in his 1968 Beatles composition [...] "The Inner Light", [...] "that knowledge is the key to enlightenment"; or, like his 1975 rebuttal to detractors such as Rolling Stone, [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", a [...] "dig at smartass rock journalists".|$|E
500|$|Michelangelo was {{the artistic}} {{heir to the}} great 15th-century sculptors and {{painters}} of Florence. He learned his trade first {{under the direction of}} a masterly fresco painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio, known for two great fresco cycles in the Sassetti Chapel and Tornabuoni Chapel, and for his contribution to the cycle of paintings {{on the walls of the}} Sistine Chapel. As a student Michelangelo studied and drew from the works of the two most renowned Florentine fresco painters of the early Renaissance, Giotto and Masaccio. [...] Masaccio's figures of Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden had a profound effect on the depiction of the nude in general, and in particular on the use of the nude figure to convey human emotion. Helen Gardner <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Michelangelo [...] "the body is simply the manifestation of the soul, or of a state of mind and character".|$|E
25|$|Even in curved space, Minkowski {{space is}} still a good {{description}} in an infinitesimal region surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities).

500|$|In {{a review}} of a {{recording}} of choral works by Reger, Gavin Dixon said that the Requiem is [...] "almost mystical in its use of widely spaced chords, unusual harmonic shifts and dreamy arpeggios <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accompaniment".

500|$|When {{comparing}} {{the two brothers}} during the time Alphonse obtained {{the ability to use}} alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemist appearing in the series. Although she claims she has not thought of the characters' birthdates, Arakawa noted that she decided Edward's birthdate during the series' serialization. During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16, winter was about to begin in Hokkaido, Arakawa's birthplace, so it was decided Edward's birthdate would be in winter. In a common slapstick gag from the series, Edward is often struck by Winry Rockbell's wrench. While commenting that Edward has an ability easily dodge her, Arakawa comments that he gets hit on purpose as a result of his personality. The director of the first anime series, Seiji Mizushima, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of the story Edward [...] "evolves and devolves"; Mizushima comments that Edward is continuously overcoming inner struggles in order to determine how to grow up. The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character, making viewers note that Edward lost something important.|$|E
