5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis {{of the liver}} in persons who have inherited two defective genes.|$|E

5|$|Due to its unusual loop, initial reports {{suggested}} {{it was two}} separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession.

5|$|Human {{language}} {{is unique in}} comparison {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by non-human animals.

5|$|Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera, a {{depression}} {{formed by the}} collapse of a volcano, in the La Rioja province of Argentina. Part of the Argentine Andes, it is considered the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity. Incapillo is one of several ignimbritic or calderic <b>systems</b> <b>that,</b> along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E

5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of thermodynamics, which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
5|$|Loitering weapons first {{emerged in}} the 1980s {{for use in the}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> fit in a backpack.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} plants are {{integrated}} with agriculture and some use innovative tracking <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems.

30|$|The {{frequency}} of shifting bottlenecks increases for systems with smaller buffer inventories, i.e., a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> {{has only two}} parts between processes shifts more frequently than a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> has ten parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} sixty {{divisions}} along the Jaibs and Jaib Tamams {{is that the}} instrument uses the Sexagesimal number <b>system.</b> <b>That</b> is it is graduated to the number base 60 {{and not to the}} base 10 or decimal <b>system</b> <b>that</b> we presently use. Time, angular measurement and geographical coordinate measurements are about the only hold overs from the Sumerian/Babylonian number <b>system</b> <b>that</b> are still in current use.|$|R
30|$|The {{frequency}} of shifting bottlenecks increases for systems with shorter system cycle times, i.e., a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> produces a part every 5  s shifts {{more frequently than}} a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> produces a part every 2  h.|$|R

50|$|The {{idea that}} the output of a {{function}} at any time depends only on past and present values of input {{is defined by the}} property commonly referred to as causality. A <b>system</b> <b>that</b> has some dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible dependence on past or current input values) is termed a non-causal or acausal system, and a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> depends solely on future input values is an anticausal <b>system.</b> Note <b>that</b> some authors have defined an anticausal <b>system</b> as one <b>that</b> depends solely on future and present input values or, more simply, as a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> does not depend on past input values.|$|R

5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence {{on the size of}} the cluster, with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion. This is not, however, a universal trend and it has been shown in some <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> the diffusion rate takes on a periodic tendency wherein some larger clusters diffuse faster than those smaller than them.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels seem to {{be largely}} free of blood parasites, even when in close {{proximity}} to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that seabird species with long incubation periods and long lives have well-developed immune <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> prevent serious blood parasitism.|$|E

40|$|Moral {{dilemmas}} engender {{conflicts between}} two traditions: consequentialism, which evaluates actions {{based on their}} outcomes, and deontology, which evaluates actions themselves. These strikingly resemble two distinct decision-making architectures: a model-based <b>system</b> <b>that</b> selects actions based on inferences about their consequences; and a model-free <b>system</b> <b>that</b> selects actions based on their reinforcement history. Here, I consider how these systems, along with a Pavlovian <b>system</b> <b>that</b> responds reflexively to rewards and punishments, can illuminate puzzles in moral psychology...|$|R
