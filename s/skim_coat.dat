5000|$|The Colonel Young Block was a three-story, nine bay, brick {{building}} that was built on a stone foundation. Its decorative elements {{were found in the}} tall narrow windows and their projecting hoods. When it was built it featured an ornate cornice that was removed in later years. [...] A <b>skim</b> <b>coat</b> application had been applied to the exterior. The building's original three-bay storefronts were altered with a permastone covering.|$|E
50|$|Plasterboard is {{commonly}} made {{with one of}} three different edge treatments: tapered edge, where the long edges of the board are tapered with a wide bevel at the front to allow for jointing materials to be finished flush with the main board face; plain edge, used where the whole surface will receive a thin coating (<b>skim</b> <b>coat)</b> of finishing plaster; and, finally, bevelled on all four sides, used in products specialist for roofing. However four side chamfered drywall is not currently offered by major UK manufacturers for general use.|$|E
50|$|Hawks {{are most}} often used by plasterers along with a {{finishing}} trowel to apply a smooth finish of plaster to a wall. Brick pointers use a hawk to hold mortar while they work. Hawks are also used to hold joint compound for <b>skim</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} materials can be cement-based or gypsum-based. Notable examples of dry mixture mortars which utilize methyl cellulose include: tile adhesives, EIFS, insulating plasters, hand-troweled and machine-sprayed plaster, stucco, self-leveling flooring, extruded cement panels, <b>skim</b> <b>coats,</b> joint & crack fillers, and tile grouts. Typical usage is about 0.2% - 0.5% of total dry powder weight for dry mixtures.|$|R
50|$|Ready-mixed joint {{compound}} is {{most commonly used}} in hanging drywall for new or remodeled homes. Application is simple and easy, usually never taking more than three or four coats. When used for new walls, {{joint compound}} effectively eliminates all blemishes {{from the surface of}} the drywall, such as fasteners, damage, or drywall tape. Joint compound is used to finish gypsum panel joints, corner bead, trim and fasteners, as well as <b>skim</b> <b>coating.</b> In addition, it is also very handy for fixing minor blemishes or damages to walls. It easily patches up holes, bumps, tears, and other minor damage.|$|R
40|$|Quality of <b>skim</b> <b>coat</b> was {{examined}} by using both {{qualitative and quantitative}} methodologies. The industrial problems of skim coats are of two major types; mixing related and application related. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank these problems according to their relative importance. Difficult to trim, poor workability and poor mixing were having the highest ranking based on the comments given by the manufacturers, retailers and users. The effect of thickener percentage in the <b>skim</b> <b>coat</b> {{was found to be}} significant for difficulties in mixing. Mixing was easy up to 0. 5 % of thickener and the flowability was found to be the best in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of thickener. Increase of thickener percentage has increased the tendency for forming agglomerates and lumps of paste during mixing. Good workability and optimum setting could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 5 % of thickener. Optimum performance for trimming could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of thickener. The above qualitative results were verified quantitatively with the physical testing; ram extrusion, set to touch drying time test, pencil hardness test and dust weight on trimming. According to both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the optimum amount of thickener in <b>skim</b> <b>coat</b> was found to be in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide an {{overview}} of the nature of lime plasters of a region of Sardinia, Italy. Several samples of scratch coat and <b>skim</b> <b>coat</b> were collected from both external and internal parts, and their study was assessed by employing a straightforward methodology. The conclusions are of practical implication for future conservation as the experimental analysis provided the following information: type of aggregate, ratios between binder and aggregate, calculation of aggregate grading envelopes for every subcategory, softness and management of water vapor, use of pozzolana, and nonhydraulicity of lime...|$|E
50|$|In {{architecture}} a quirk {{is a small}} 'V' shaped channel used {{to insulate}} and give relief to a convex rounded moulding. To create the plastered corner, backing coat (browning) is plastered up to the staff bead, then the quirk is cut into the backing coat a little larger than the finished size. When the top <b>skimming</b> <b>coat</b> is applied, again the bead is fully skimmed in and then, using a straight edge, the quirk is re-cut to the finished depth, usually on an approximate 45 degree angle into the bead. The quirk will hide the eventual small crack that will form between the staff bead and plaster.|$|R
5000|$|Working in {{collaboration}} with concrete manufacturers and mining companies, he developed [...] "green" [...] chemical binders Solunexz and Glunexz for coal dust, construction aggregates, and charcoal. With continued support from Sasol, he developed Amoriguard, a non-volatile organic compound paint and <b>skim</b> <b>coating</b> based on tailings and industrial waste. Amoriguard has received Agrément certificate. In 2014, he worked on flushing solar-powered toilets that operate as a miniature waste-treatment plant. This technology based on nanofiltration and anaerobic digestion is implemented in places where {{water supply and sanitation}} are scarce. In 2016, while developing acid bricks, Doyoyo designed and manufactured Ecocast brick making machines that save water and energy, while adaptable to off-grid communties.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{polyimide}} polishing {{film is a}} kind of soft polishing {{films with}} polyimide substrate and abrasive cement. It isn't replaced by other grinding tool because of its acid resistance, alkali resistance, water-resistance, oil resistance, heat-resistance et al. The paper focuses on ascertaining the minimal substrate thickness of polishing film, selecting molding method and molding technology. Applying the <b>skim</b> <b>coating</b> processes, and using a self-made, film making device, a lab-level, making process of polyimide polishing film is developed, and the polyimide polishing films are made in a lab. Then, study the polishing films form and analyze the molding performances with scanning electron microscope, and get an effect rule of the consistency of polyamides adhesive and abrasive to polyimide polishing films form and the appropriate consistency of polyamides adhesive finally...|$|R
5000|$|Another similar <b>skim</b> <b>coating</b> {{is always}} {{done in a}} process called veneer plastering, {{although}} it is done slightly thicker (about 2 mm or 1/8 inch). Veneering uses a slightly different specialized setting compound ("finish plaster") that contains gypsum and lime putty. This application uses blueboard, which has special treated paper to accelerate {{the setting of the}} gypsum plaster component. This setting has far less shrinkage than the air-dry compounds normally used in drywall, so it only requires one coat. Blueboard also has square edges rather than the tapered-edge drywall boards. The tapered drywall boards are used to countersink the tape in taped jointing whereas the tape in veneer plastering is buried beneath a level surface. One coat veneer plaster over dry board is an intermediate style step between full multi-coat [...] "wet" [...] plaster and the limited joint-treatment-only given [...] "dry" [...] wall.|$|R
40|$|Cellulose ethers (CEs) are {{employed}} in many polymer-modified mortars, such as cement renders, masonry mortars, tile adhesives, repair mortars, <b>skim</b> <b>coats,</b> and self-levelling mortars. The addition of CEs to mortars causes the retardation of cement hydration and modifies the microstructural characteristics and the properties of these mortars. The present work attempts to provide {{a comprehensive review of}} the current state of knowledge on the effects of CEs and critically identifies gaps in the knowledge. A fundamental scientific understanding concerning the chemistry and hydration of cement, chemical natures, and relevant properties of CEs are discussed. The behaviours and mechanisms of CE adsorption on cement are assessed. The influences of CEs on the kinetics of cement hydration, mechanisms of retardation, and microstructural evolution of the mortars also are reviewed. Finally, the impact of CEs on the properties of fresh and hardened mortars as well as the approaches used to mitigate the negative impacts of CEs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the fabrication of {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) nanodisc arrays isolated by a polymer layer and contacted with a top electrode. PZT thin films were deposited by multitarget sputtering onto a platinum/titanium bottom electrode and structured by means of nanosphere lithography. To guarantee short-circuit-free deposition of a top electrode, {{the space between the}} nanostructures was filled by a polymer. Two approaches for the filling are demonstrated: (a) imprinting and (b) <b>skim</b> <b>coating.</b> Single nanodiscs embedded in a flexible polymer matrix have two major advantages. First, taking into account the flexibility of the matrix, they can vibrate in lateral direction and, second, due to shrinking to the nanoscale, predominant directions of the polarization form, such as vortex- or bubble-like domain patterns. Piezoresponse force microscopy was performed on patterned and nonpatterned samples with and without a top electrode to check the local piezoresponse. Comparison of the different samples revealed an increase in lateral piezoactivity for patterned samples with Ni/Cr electrode while the out-of-plane piezoresponse remained constant. Gold electrodes limit the piezoresponse in both measured directions...|$|R
5000|$|A two part {{installation}} at the Boise Art Museum from November 8, 2008 to May 3, 2009, After is {{an exploration}} of the modern forces that create and construct space—architecturally, visually, and conceptually. The project was composed of two large constructions individually titled, After: Billboard, and After: Dwelling. [...] "After: Billboard" [...] features a roped off pile of rubble with a sign surface made entirely of layered paper and real estate advertisements, capped with a window-like opening that exposes the crisscrossing two-by-fours that are the superstructure. Vaguely discernible real estate slogans and window details of this exterior piece were intended to reference the house-sized construction on the interior of the museum. [...] "After: Dwelling" [...] was composed of a landscape of gravel approximately 25 ft x 50 ft with a sharply defined rectilinear impression suggesting a building foundation. Floating above this field were corners of a house made entirely from architectural foam board and <b>skim</b> <b>coated</b> cement. Taken together the individual pieces describe the perimeter of a house in the uncertain state of construction or demolition and featuring several design clichés identified with an anonymous modern architecture. [...] "The Boise Weekly" [...] noted that [...] "...The billboard promises, 'Your Own Piece of Blue Sky!' The wall text tells us the artists are exploring the complex systems involved in the production of space. In other words, advertising dominates the view." ...|$|R
