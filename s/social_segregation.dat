25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 18th century, despite rising {{prosperity}} evidenced by its growing importance as a banking centre, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe's most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns. Visitors were struck by the fact that the various social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same tenement buildings; although here a form of <b>social</b> <b>segregation</b> did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.|$|E
25|$|In some cities, such as Stockholm, Helsinki, Tel Aviv, Austin, Texas, and Copenhagen, {{there are}} no {{established}} gay villages, {{partly due to the}} differing social dynamics of these cities (less <b>social</b> <b>segregation</b> within the city), but also due to earlier and greater social acceptance of the gay community within mainstream society. However, there are areas which were historically known as meeting places for gays, such as Södermalm in Stockholm, Punavuori and Kallio in Helsinki, which remain as somewhat trendy areas for gay people to live in, though {{they do not have a}} predominantly gay population.|$|E

25|$|Urban {{growth in}} São Paulo has {{followed}} three patterns {{since the beginning}} of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th Century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery <b>social</b> <b>segregation,</b> in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.|$|E
25|$|The film is {{partially}} {{presented in a}} found footage format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of humanity, xenophobia, and <b>social</b> <b>segregation,</b> begins in an alternate 1982, when an alien ship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. When a population of sick and malnourished insect-like aliens is found aboard the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson tries to escape with his son and return home, crossing paths with a bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe. The title and premise of District 9 were inspired by events in District Six, Cape Town, during the apartheid era.|$|E

It was almost like cliques in school.” During this time she completed her first draft, but put the book aside for about two years due to her personal life and responsibilities as a teacher and parent. She resumed working on the novel after one of the Boston Public Library grant judges asked after the novel and Barnaby continued working on Wonder Show for an additional five years before the book was acquired.|$|R

25|$|The {{desire of}} some whites {{to avoid having}} their {{children}} attend integrated schools has been a factor in white flight to the suburbs., and in the foundation of numerous segregation academies and private schools which most African American students, though technically permitted to attend, are unable to afford. Recent studies in San Francisco showed that groups of homeowners tended to self-segregate to be with people of the same education level and race. By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been mostly replaced by indirect factors, including the phenomenon where whites pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas. The residential and <b>social</b> <b>segregation</b> of whites from blacks in the United States creates a socialization process that limits whites' chances for developing meaningful relationships with blacks and other minorities. The segregation experienced by whites from blacks fosters segregated lifestyles and leads them to develop positive views about themselves and negative views about blacks.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to its {{campaign}} pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts {{at the elementary}} and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a priority area, with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers’ positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the Bac C) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had {{come to be known as}} a “royal road into élitist schools and careers.” The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and <b>social</b> <b>segregation,</b> and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country’s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem. They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones.|$|E

The two-volume work {{presents}} the crusader {{states as a}} working immigrant society, and shows the importance of immigration and labor shortages. [...] Another book by Prawer, The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem: European Colonialism in the Middle Ages, which was intended for a larger audience, was more controversial. In it, he portrays the crusaders as a society of Frankish immigrants living in complete political and <b>social</b> <b>segregation</b> from the local Muslim and Syro-Christian population, and terms this phenomenon [...] "Apartheid". To Prawer, it is the settlers' refusal to assimilate and their reconstruction of a European-type society on foreign soil, {{as well as the}} persistence of indigenous institutions without any interference, that mark the Crusader settlement as colonialist. His thesis is that the economy, society, and institutions of the Latin states are best understood in the light of their colonial status. The 1980 book Crusader Institutions collected a number of his earlier publications and expanded upon them with revisions and new chapters. The book continues his treatment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem as a European colonial product but focuses attention on five topical areas, while throughout employing the tools of textual criticism and commentary on sources. [...] Especially prominent is his coverage of [...] the status and administrative role of burgesses, which had not received such attention before. In his last years, he published a book on a topic of especial interest to him, The History of the Jews in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, which examined the tightly-knit isolated Jewish communities of the Levant, the Jewish philosophical feuds they engaged in, and their dreams of restoring Israel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a measure of}} segregation based on two premises: (1) a measure of segregation should disaggregate {{to the level of}} individuals, and (2) an individual is more segregated the more segregated are the agents with whom she interacts. Developing three desirable axioms that any segregation measure should satisfy, we prove that one and only one segregation index satisfies our three axioms, and the two aims mentioned above; which we coin the Spectral Segregation Index. We apply the index to two well-studied social phenomena: residential and school segregation. We calculate the extent of residential segregation across major US cities using data from the 2000 US Census. The correlation between the Spectral index and the commonly- used dissimilarity index is. 42. Using detailed data on friendship networks, available in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we calculate the prevalence of within-school racial segregation. The results suggests that the percent of minority students within a school, commonly used as a substitute for a measure of in-school segregation, is a poor proxy for <b>social</b> interactions. <b>segregation,</b> networks, <b>social</b> interactions, school <b>segregation,</b> residential segregation...|$|R

2500|$|Established circa 1850, the Baptist {{church was}} built in the Greek Revival style with a {{symmetrical}} three-bay, gable-front facade on land that served as the market square of the town. [...] The land on which the church sits was the Southside chapel of the 17th-century Varina Parish and the main church of Bristol Parish. [...] Unlike many churches, probably because of the longtime settlement of several black slave and pre-war emancipated families living in the community over the many generations, the church served both blacks and whites, both rich and poor. [...] Established by the Americans, the churched kept to its <b>social</b> <b>segregation,</b> requiring enslaved and free blacks to sit in the balcony while whites sat in the lower area. However, over time, the growth of the poor and working class white congregants, forced them to congregate in the upper sections causing substantial resentments within the church.
