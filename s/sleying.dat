50|$|<b>Sleying</b> is {{the term}} used for pulling the warp threads through the loom, which happens in the warping process (the process of putting a warp on the loom). <b>Sleying</b> is done by {{inserting}} a reed hook through the reed, hooking the warp threads and then pulling them through the dent. The warp threads are taken in the order {{they come from the}} heddles, so as to avoid crossing threads. If the threads cross, the shed will not open correctly when the weaving is begun.|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare to}} weave, the warp must be made. By hand {{this is done}} {{with the help of}} a warping board. The length the warp is made is about a quarter to half yard more than the amount of cloth needed. Warping boards come in a variety of shapes, from the two nearest door handles to a board with pegs on it, or a device called a warping mill that looks similar to a swift. Warping the loom, mean {{threading}} each end through an eye in a heddle, and then <b>sleying</b> it through the reed. The warp is set (verb) at X ends per inch. It then has a sett (noun) of X ends per inch. The weft is measured in picks per inch.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extraordinary}} {{progress in the}} technology of weaving, the majority of weavers, particularly in the developing world, use shuttle looms. These looms suffer from various deficiencies, one of them being the severe abrasion between warp threads and shuttle, particularly when the shuttle leaves the shed. This can be avoided or reduced by allowing the <b>sley</b> to dwell near the back centre. Changing the drive of the <b>sley</b> from the currently used four-bar mechanism to a cam-driven mechanism will easily achieve this objective. However, weavers currently using shuttle looms are reluctant to accept this modification because of the significant increase in cost that it entails. A compromise would be a six-bar mechanism that can give a dwell or "near-dwell" condition, i. e. very slow motion, near the back centre. Such a mechanism, based on the Watt chain, has been explored in this article. It gives 0. 06 degrees of maximum angular displacement of the output link for 95 degrees rotation of the input link. The suitability of the mechanism in satisfying the other requirements of <b>sley</b> movement of a shuttle loom has also been discussed...|$|R

40|$|In a {{companion}} paper Demeulenaere et al. (2005), the cam-based centrifugal pendulum (CBCP) was introduced as a simple, cam-based, input torque balancing (ITB) mechanism. The differential equation that governs the CBCP cam design was derived and a methodology for solving it developed. Furthermore, in a de-sign example, the CBCP {{was applied to}} balance the input torque of a high-speed cam-follower mechanism, driving the <b>sley</b> of a weaving loom. The present pa-per rstly shows how the design parameters for this particular design example can be optimized, so as to obtain a compact and technologically feasible mechanism. The formulation of the optimization problem {{is based on a}} parameterization of the CBCP rotor and coupler shape. Because of its nonconvex nature, the optimization problem is solved using a multi-start Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) approach. A design chart, based on an exhaustive analysis, is introduced which (i) allows the designer to perform the design optimization in a quick and approx-imative way, and (ii) gives a lot of insight in the behavior of the SQP-algorithm. Secondly, the CBCP is applied to an industrial case study, that is, a weaving loom. The robustness of the CBCP is illustrated by showing that input torque balancing solely the <b>sley</b> movement enhances the overall dynamic machine behavior, despite the presence of the non-balanced shed motion. A particular contribution of this part is the determination of the weaving loom regime behavior in the frequency domain, an approach which is believed to be novel in mechanism literature...|$|R
50|$|Beams are the {{vertical}} threads from a beam roller {{that contributes to}} the pattern. Lace is made up of motif that is repeated vertically and horizontally. If a design has 48 horizontal repeats, there will be 48 threads on each beam roller. Every beam roller has its own guidebar, made of thin watch-spring steel. Each front warp ends has its own guidebar. The back warp ends share 4 stump bars between them. The guide bars are controlled by the Jacquards so can be reposition for each motion, indeed they are also known as Jacquard bars; they are held in a bar box above the <b>sley</b> but below the carriages.|$|R

50|$|The frame {{viewed from}} the front is similar to Leavers machine. Its action is {{different}} as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The Nottingham lace curtain machine only has one warp and the patterning threads are carried on a spools not on a beam. The terms to describe the actions {{are the same as}} those used for a Leavers machine: rise, fall, right, left, <b>sley,</b> carriage, comb et c. The lace is collected at the top, unlike the Pusher machine where it is at the bottom, It is collected on a take up beam; a spiky roller called the porcupine beneath it, regulated the take up tension.|$|R
50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a <b>sley</b> with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R

40|$|Input torque {{balancing}} is a {{well known}} way to reduce drive speed fluctuations in high speed machinery and combustion engines. This paper introduces a cam-based centrifugal pendulum (CBCP) and a design procedure for it which results in quasi perfect balancing of inertial torques for any drive speed. The CBCP combines the centrifugal pendulum vibration absorber, well-known in mechanical vibration literature, with a torque balancing principle well-known in mechanism literature, that is, the use of cams to generate arbitrary torques. For given design parameters (such as the link lengths and link inertial parameters), the cam design is governed by a nonlinear, second-order, explicit differential equation. This differential equation is numerically solved by reformulating it as a nonlinear least squares problem. The design parameters themselves are determined {{by means of an}} optimization problem, the goal of which is to minimize the (constant) equivalent inertia of the combined system, consisting of the original mechanism to be balanced and the CBCP. Application of the CBCP to torque balance a high-speed, purely inertial cam-follower mechanism, driving the <b>sley</b> of a weaving loom, shows that the optimization results in a compact and technologically feasible mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|Older adults {{encounter}} {{many changes}} as they age, both cognitively and physically. These changes tend to impact one 2 ̆ 7 s mobility {{in terms of}} driving ability and exposure. It {{has been well documented}} that this population is increasing in number (Lyman, Ferguson, Braver, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2002) and that they pose a higher crash risk than a younger population (Braver 2 ̆ 6 Trempel, 2004; Dellinger, Kresnow, White, 2 ̆ 6 Seghal, 2004; Tavris, Kuhn, 2 ̆ 6 Layde, 2001). These cognitive and physical changes combined with increased crash risk lead a number of drivers to reduce the amount that they dri c or cease dri ing altogether, thereby limiting their independence. Some studies ha examined the domains on w hich these changes occur and have found that various medical conditions, cognitiv e deficits, and physical limitations lead to these changes in driving habits (Ball, Ow <b>sley,</b> Stalvey, Roenker, Sloane 2 ̆ 6 Graves, 1998; Lyman, McGwin. 2 ̆ 6 Sims, 2001). The present study sought to replicate a structural equation model proposed by Vance, Roenker, Cissell, Edwards, Wadley, and Ball (in press) in which it was found that a particular battery of tests (GRIMPS and UFOV) was predictive of both increased avoidance of certain situations and decreased exposure. Specifically, they found that the latent constructs of health and cognitive function were predictive of both exposure and avoidance. However, physical function appeared to make no contribution. The current study attempted to replicate this model on a sample (N = 299) that participated as part of the driver 2 ̆ 7 s licensing process at three Motor Vehicle Administration sites in Maryland. It was found that this sample did decline over time in the areas of health, physical, and cognitive functionn. Also, they reduced the amount of driving that they did and increased their avoidance of many situations. However, the structural equation model for this sample found the latent construct of physical functioning to be the only significant predictor of driving avoidance and exposure...|$|R
