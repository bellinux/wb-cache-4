25|$|The <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> {{rating of}} film {{capacitors}} {{can be enhanced}} by various internal configurations. Because metallization is the cheapest way of producing electrodes, optimizing {{the shape of the}} electrodes is one way to minimize the internal resistance and to increase the current-carrying capacity. A slightly thicker metallization layer at the schoopage contact sides of the electrodes results in a lower overall contact resistance and increased <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> handling, without losing the self-healing properties throughout the remainder of the metallization.|$|E
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E
25|$|However, {{metal foil}} {{capacitors}} {{do not have}} self-healing properties. A breakdown in the dielectric film of a film/foil capacitor leads to an irreversible short circuit. To avoid breakdowns caused by weak spots in the dielectric, the insulating film chosen is always thicker than theoretically required by the specific breakdown voltage of the material. Films of less than 4µm generally are not used for film/foil capacitors because of their excessively high numbers of point defects. Also. the metallic foils only can be produced down to about 25µm in thickness. These tradeoffs make the film/foil capacitor the most robust but also the most expensive method for increasing <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> handling.|$|E

25|$|The oldest form of {{rechargeable}} battery is the lead–acid battery, which {{are widely used}} in automotive and boating applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the hydrogen gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy {{for the amount of}} electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern car battery, which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 amperes.|$|E
25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input <b>surge</b> <b>current</b> or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} electro-thermal {{stresses}} on the converter semiconductor components during <b>surge</b> <b>currents</b> {{events in a}} VSC HVDC-system using MMC topology. A typical HVDC-link is described and modelled in PSCAD simulation software and analytical calculations were performed alongside in order to confirm the simulated fault current peak values. Both the analytical calculations and simulations {{have shown that the}} most severe fault cases for the converter components are when faults occurs on DC-side of the converter, so called pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground faults. These fault currents are mainly conducted by the semiconductor diodes in the converter for which two different kinds of voltage drop models were derived - one extrapolated measurement based model and one physics based Lauritzen power diode model. The corresponding temperature response of the diode was simulated by a thermal model using Cauer electrical network representation. All models were created and combined in a Matlab/Simulink environment. The Lauritzen model has proven to give satisfying results in the transient electro-thermal investigation for <b>surge</b> <b>currents</b> with lower peak values. However, during higher <b>surge</b> <b>currents,</b> the model starts to deviate from the measurement based model and estimate larger losses. The parameter extraction process for the Lauritzen model is time consuming for a new component and if the model parameters does not already exist, the benefits compared to the measurement based model are negligible. Similar to the Laurtizen model, the extrapolated model with the three different types of temperature coefficient starts also to deviate for higher <b>surge</b> <b>currents.</b> Better knowledge of the temperature dependent voltage drop combined with more detailed measurements in higher current and temperature range are needed in order to achieve more accurate simulations...|$|R
