5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in <b>shredded</b> cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise <b>shredded</b> clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>shredding</b> of {{automobiles}} and major household appliances {{is a process}} where a hammermill acts as a giant tree chipper by grinding the materials fed into it to fist-size pieces.

5|$|It {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year, primarily at night. Gestation {{is about three}} weeks, and the female has a litter {{of three or four}} young. Nests in the wild, built from <b>shredded</b> bark, are in a tunnel or under a log. Marsh shrews typically live about 18 months, and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer. Since their lifespan is short, they apparently breed for only one season. Although no breeding data exist for British Columbia, the breeding season elsewhere is from late January to late August; most young are born in March. The number of litters a female rears is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|In City at War, {{due to the}} {{injuries}} he sustained from Splinter, <b>Shredder</b> has been confined to a hospital bed {{under the care of}} Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take <b>Shredder</b> down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, <b>Shredder</b> decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to <b>Shredder,</b> and as the mutagen is injected into <b>Shredder,</b> his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In The Insecta Trifecta, <b>Shredder</b> is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, <b>Shredder</b> is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as <b>Shredder</b> deploys a pair of blades {{from the back of his}} hand, right out of the skin itself. In [...] "The Super Shredder" [...] <b>Shredder</b> forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super <b>Shredder</b> form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. <b>Shredder</b> then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the <b>Shredder</b> along with Shinigami but <b>Shredder</b> easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him, (The Shell Raiser) and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. <b>Shredder</b> then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. <b>Shredder</b> then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach <b>Shredder,</b> Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. <b>Shredder</b> forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads <b>Shredder</b> to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. <b>Shredder</b> eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. <b>Shredder</b> then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as <b>Shredder</b> was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and <b>Shredder</b> fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, [...] "Darkest Plight", <b>Shredder</b> and Splinter are separated during the fall, and <b>Shredder</b> returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, <b>Shredder</b> goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, <b>Shredder</b> tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at <b>Shredder.</b> However, before <b>Shredder</b> can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures <b>Shredder</b> in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, <b>Shredder</b> is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where <b>Shredder</b> demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, <b>Shredder</b> overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In [...] "Tale of Tiger Claw", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.|$|R

5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are <b>shredded</b> into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E
