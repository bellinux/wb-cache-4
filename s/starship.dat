5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new <b>starship</b> designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation <b>starship</b> disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan.

The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E
