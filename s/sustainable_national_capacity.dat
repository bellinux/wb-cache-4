In recent years, the Region has been an epicentre for many emerging diseases, resulting in substantial negative impacts on health, social and economic development. As the Region is {{home to more than}} 50 % of the world population, true global public health security depends to a large degree upon how successful this Region is in developing and sustaining functional national and regional systems and capacities for managing emerging diseases and acute public health events and emergencies. Tremendous efforts have been made by individual countries and the international community to confront emerging disease threats in recent years, but the need for a common regional strategic framework has been recognized by countries and areas in the Asia Pacific, the World Health Organization, donors and partner agencies. To address this need, an updated Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, or APSED (2010), has been developed, aiming to strategically build <b>sustainable</b> <b>national</b> and regional <b>capacities</b> and partnerships to ensure public health security through preparedness planning, prevention, early detection and rapid response to emerging diseases and other public health emergencies. The Strategy calls for collective responsibility and actions to address the shared regional health security threat with a greater emphasis on preparedness-driven investments in health security. APSED (2010) serves as a road map to guide all countries and areas in the region towards meeting their core capacity requirements under the International Health Regulations (2005) to ensure regional and global health security...|$|R

CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s long-standing partnerships with Ministries of Health (MoH) assist with improvement of critical infrastructure and services to build <b>sustainable</b> <b>national</b> public health <b>capacity.</b> In 2003, the United States Government (USG) launched PEPFAR, an interagency initiative to provide 15 billion over five years to fund care, treatment and prevention services in 15 countries that were hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Emergency rapid scale-up of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and developing laboratory infrastructure to support the services became the intense focus in resource-limited settings. On July 30, 2008, PEPFAR was reauthorized with a budget of up to 48 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, with a continued emphasis on laboratory system strengthening and improved diagnostic laboratory capabilities. Prior to PEPFAR, CDC strengthened laboratory infrastructure in host countries by using a 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 top-down 22 ̆ 0 ac? approach which concentrated on strengthening the national reference laboratory, or main laboratory in the host nation, and establishing partnerships with regional laboratories. With the inception of PEPFAR, CDC broadened its scope and began activities to improve capacity at all levels of a tiered laboratory system: national, provincial, district, and primary care. The activities helped PEPFAR to reach its initial set of ambitious goals: treatment for 2 million HIV-infected people, prevention of 7 million new infections, and care for 10 million people infected with, or affected by, HIV/AIDS. The new 10 -year goals aim {{to increase the number of}} those treated to 3 million, the number of infections prevented to 12 million, and the number of people receiving care to 12 million.
