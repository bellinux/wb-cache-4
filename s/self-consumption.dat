This paper {{presents}} an exploratory {{analysis of the}} suitability of supercritical CO 2 Brayton power cycles as alternative energy conversion systems for a future fusion reactor based on a DCLL (dual coolant lithiumlead) blanket, as prescribed by EUROfusion. The main issue dealt is the optimization of {{the integration of the}} different thermal sources with the power cycle in order to achieve the highest electricity production. The analysis includes the assessment of the pumping consumption in the heating and cooling loops, taking into account additional considerations as control issues and integration of thermal energy storage systems. An exergy analysis has been performed {{in order to understand the}} behavior of each layout. Up to ten scenarios have been analyzed assessing different locations for thermal sources heat exchangers. Neglecting the worst four scenarios, it is observed less than 2 % of variation among the other six ones. One of the best six scenarios clearly stands out over the others due to the location of the thermal sources in a unique island, being this scenario compatible with the control criteria. In this proposal 34. 6 % of electric efficiency (before the <b>self-consumptions</b> of the reactor but including pumping consumptions and generator efficiency) is achieved. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

This paper presents an exploratory analysis of the suitability of supercritical CO 2 Brayton power cycles (S-CO 2) for low-temperature divertor fusion reactors cooled by helium (as defined by EFDA). Integration of three thermal sources (i. e., blanket, divertor and vacuum vessel) has been studied through proposing and analyzing a number of alternative layouts, achieving an improvement on power production higher than 5 % over the baseline case, which entails to a gross efficiency (before <b>self-consumptions)</b> higher than 42 %. In spite of this achievement, the assessment of power consumption for the circulating heat transfer fluids results in a penalty of 20 % in the electricity production. Once the most suitable layout has been selected an optimization process has been conducted to adjust the key parameters to balance performance and size, achieving an electrical efficiency (electricity without taking into account auxiliary consumptions due to operation of the fusion reactor) higher than 33 % and a reduction in overall size of heat exchangers of 1 / 3. Some relevant conclusions can be drawn from the present work: the potential of S-CO 2 cycles as suitable converters of thermal energy to power in fusion reactors; the significance of a suitable integration of thermal sources to maximize power output; the high penalty of pumping power; and the convenience of identifying the key components of the layout as a way to optimize the whole cycle performance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

2500|$|The {{energy balance}} {{can be done}} in two balance types: 1) Balance of delivered/imported and {{exported}} energy (monitoring phase as <b>self-consumption</b> of energy generated on-site can be included); 2) Balance between (weighted) energy demand and (weighted) energy generation (for design phase as normally end users temporal consumption patterns -e.g. for lighting, appliances, etc.- are lacking). Alternatively a balance based on monthly net values in which only residuals per month are summed up to an annual balance is imaginable. This can be seen either as a load/generation balance or as a special case of import/export balance where a “virtual monthly self-consumption” is assumed (see figure 2 [...] and compare).|$|E

Coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels for generating electricity. The world's electricity consumption was 18,608TWh [...] in 2012. This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and <b>self-consumption</b> from power plants (gross generation).

[...] The deployment corridor was doubled to between 2500 and 3500MWp, along with tighter growth-dependant degression rates of 1–12%, {{in addition to the}} ordinary degression of 9%. [...] The <b>self-consumption</b> incentive was significantly raised to around 8¢/kWh and eligibility extended to systems up to 500kWp. [...] The feed-in rate itself was dependent on the system size and the proportion of demand that was consumed on-site. [...] Free-standing systems were excluded from using agricultural land.|$|E

Other words and themes the speaker uses are explained by Helen Vendler: [...] "The concepts – because Shakespeare's mind works by contrastive taxonomy – tend to be summoned in pairs: increase and decrease, ripening and dying; beauty and immortality versus memory and inheritance; expansion and contraction; inner spirit (eyes) and outward show (bud); <b>self-consumption</b> and dispersal, famine and abundance". Shakespeare uses these words to make [...] "an aesthetic investment in profusion". The meaning found in these lines and words shows how the young man's refusal to procreate is a refusal of his flesh, a wasting of it.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's sonnets do {{not exactly}} {{adhere to the}} norms of the sonnet form {{established}} by the Italian poet, Petrarch. According to Robert Matz, [...] "Shakespeare transforms the sonnet convention". Shakespeare brings in topics and themes that were unusual at the time. Shakespeare's audience would have interpreted such an aggressive tone as entirely improper encouragement of procreation. In fact, the other sonnets of the time revered chastity. However, Shakespeare [...] "does not engage in stock exaltation of the chastity of the beloved, but instead accuses the young man of gluttonous <b>self-consumption</b> in his refusal to produce a 'tender heir' who would continue his beauty beyond the inexorable decay of aging". Sonnets are often about romantic love between the speaker and the beloved but Shakespeare does not do this. Instead, Shakespeare urges the young man, the beloved, to have sex and procreate with a woman in marriage. Marriage in Shakespeare's time was mainly functional. If in fact Shakespeare’s sonnet was about a beloved that was a man, then this was an entirely new concept.|$|E

Cotton is spun and woven mostly to create clothing and linens—including dresses, shirts, blouses, jackets, tablecloths, table runners, napkins, and bedspreads.

[...] The system size categories were changed, now up to 10, 40, 1000, and kWp. [...] A new category of 10–40kWp was introduced, while free-standing systems were limited to 10MWp. [...] The regular standard degression was set to 1% per month, equal to 11.4% per year, and replacing the previous six-monthly adjustment. [...] The flexible cap for the deployment corridor remained unchanged at 2500 to 3500MWp per year. [...] If new additions exceed this corridor, the degression rises by 1.0% up to 2.8%. [...] A hard cap on the total photovoltaic capacity was introduced, set at 52GWp. [...] The <b>self-consumption</b> privilege was removed for new installations, as grid parity was already met: the feed-in tariff for roof systems at 19.5¢/kWh was now lower than the average electricity price for households at 23¢/kWh.
