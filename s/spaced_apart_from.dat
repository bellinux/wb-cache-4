Due to the iron core and close proximity of the windings, they have a high mutual inductance (M), the coupling coefficient is close to unity 0.95 - 1.0, which means almost all the magnetic field of the primary winding passes through the secondary. The Tesla transformer in contrast is [...] "loosely coupled", the primary winding is larger in diameter and <b>spaced</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the secondary, so the mutual inductance is lower and the coupling coefficient is only 0.05 to 0.2.

The loose coupling slows the exchange of energy between the primary and secondary coils, which allows the oscillating energy to stay in the secondary circuit longer before it returns to the primary and begins dissipating in the spark.|$|E

It is known from the castle records that two stone buildings were built in the bailey from 1369 to 1377, although their form and function are unknown.

The largest number of preserved stone trackways, over 150, are found on Malta.|$|E

The genus is {{distinguished}} from other genera of Lake Malawi Haplochromini by details of its melanic color pattern and by its dentition. The color pattern includes (1) a midlateral horizontal stripe starting at least an eye length behind the operculum, this stripe broken into separate spots at least on its front half, more nearly continuous on its rear half, extending {{to the end of}} the caudal peduncle; (2) a second (supralateral) stripe above the midlateral one that is only on the front part of the flanks, and which is also at least partly broken into spots; (3) above this at the base of the dorsal fin are 4 or 5 dorsal midline spots. The dentition of the jaws is also distinctive in fish at least 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length (not counting the caudal fin); the outer teeth are roughly conical with a single cusp and are <b>spaced</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> each other by about the width of the tooth.|$|E

In contrast, she draws eyes relatively large and are widely <b>spaced</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> each other. The limbs of her characters are depicted as long and narrow, along with possessing a long torso. Generally, despite this unique style, her female characters are often thought to be very moe. These recurring characteristics of her art are referred to by her Japanese fans as [...] "Itaru-e" [...] (meaning [...] "Itaru drawings"). She is skilled in preserving the psychological description of her characters via their facial expressions. Her style of drawing erotic content is also seen as being distinct. As seen with her art from 2006 onwards, such as in Little Busters!, much of her distinct style that she has become known for has generally either been omitted or improved upon.|$|E
