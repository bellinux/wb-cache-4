40|$|Very Large Floating Structures (VLFS) {{are highly}} {{specialized}} floating structures with variety of {{applications in the}} civil engineering of ocean. Their economic design is based on their hydro-elastic behavior due to wave environmental forces. VLFS are extra large in size and mostly extra long in span in the design feature for their applications. For that reason they are mostly modularized into several smaller structures and joined together in the site. The critical problem is the longitudinal bending moment of the long floating vessel in severe wave environment. With {{the result of that}} the present available VLFS designs become not economical for applications in hostile-ocean. This paper presents ocean space utilization using an innovative VLFS with truss pontoon concept. The concept uses a strong deck with strong longitudinal beams {{to take care of the}} needed bending moment of the vessel for the survival, <b>standby</b> and operational <b>conditions</b> of the ocean environment. At the submerged bottom just above the keel-tank top, a simple open-frame truss-structure is used instead of a heavy shell type pontoon. The truss-pontoon provides the necessary flow transparency for the reduction of the wave exciting forces and consequently reduces heave amplitude of motions and the vertical acceleration. Each individual columns of the truss pontoon semi-submersible is tuned to have heave-period over 22 sec, independently, such that minimum hydrodynamic-motions are obtained for the overall structure. The VLFS is designed with minimum heave for the extreme storms unlike the conventional column stabilized semi-submersible unit with conventional pontoon.

Eight inch transfer piping connects them to the usage point. Operations began with activation of the burnstack for the LH 2 storage area.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work {{can be seen as}} making the bridge between the fields of Solid-State Integrated Circuits (IC) and Power Electronics. Multiple AC-DC and DC-DC power {{converters}} are investigated from the IC standpoint, this means a constant effort to realize converters that are fully integrated on a single chip, or have at least a very high level of integration. Moreover, it is of paramount importance to improve power conversion efficiency throughout the transport chain of energy from source (e. g., a battery, the mains) to load (i. e., the application which is the consumer). Creating new converter systems that are very efficient and integrated into chip-scale solutions enable the benefit of longer battery autonomy in portable devices, on top of enabling ever lighter and slimmer devices. In non-mobile applications, less power is required from the mains for the same functionality and consequently this helps to reduce emissions related to electricity generation, such as carbon dioxide, etc. To summarize this work, a few different research targets are introduced: 1) monolithic switched-capacitor DC-DC conversion for granular power delivery on-chip, 2) reduction of standby power in mains-connected devices through the addition of an efficient and compact auxiliary supply to provide power during standby mode, and 3) high-ratio DC-DC voltage conversion in a monolithic context. Modern integrated circuits contain more and more functionality within a single chip. These are also called Systems on Chip and examples of such systems are the Application Processing Unit chips at the heart of today’s smartphones or personal computers. Because these single-chip systems house a large amount of subsystems, it is only logical that they require multiple different supply voltages to power these functions. In the past, most required voltages were generated off-chip on the printed circuit board, {{in the vicinity of the}} chip. This approach, however, is becoming less and less viable due the growing number of desired supply voltages and the associated number of interconnection pins to get the power from the off-chip power converters to the on-chip loads. Moreover, there are other negative aspects related to this approach. Therefore, a better approach is to provide the chip with one, or a few, different supply voltages, and use on-chip power converters to further provide the desired supply voltages. This requires less package pins, and enables better regulation of the desired supply voltage, since the feedback loop can now be performed locally on the chip. The goal of this work is to enable the above. To that end, an investigation of suitable fully-integrated DC-DC converters is conducted. Specifically, the realization of a switched-capacitor DC-DC converter in a standard CMOS technology with a high power density was targeted. It is important to implement the converter in a standard CMOS process to enable co-integration with its loading circuits on the same chip. Secondly, a high power conversion density yields a lower chip area requirement to implement the converter. This work investigated circuit techniques to deliver top-notch specifications, given this context. Standby power is caused by mains-connected devices in standby mode. They have a power supply that is optimized for the active mode, where power levels may be very large with respect to the low required power level of standby, a factor 100 x or more. It cannot be expected that these converters are efficient both at their nominal power (active mode) and also at light-load (<b>standby</b> mode) <b>condition.</b> Therefore, the power consumption of mains-connected devices is much higher than what it could be. Since standby power on a global scale is associated to about 10 % of residential electricity consumption and 1 % of CO 2 emissions, standby power reduction could help to counter global warming. Therefore, this work aims to build the AC-DC converters that enable such reductions in standby power and prevent the associated emissions. The research toward high-ratio voltage conversion in an integrated context is motivated by the research conclusion, of the previous work on AC-DC converters, that switched-capacitor DC-DC converters are particularly well suited for this task. Monolithic high-ratio DC-DC conversion can, for example, be used to deliver high voltages from a standard Li-ion battery in a very small and light form factor, which is particularly important for robotic insects, where high voltages are required in the drivers that power the wings. Switched-capacitor DC-DC converters do not rely on the duty cycle to set their voltage conversion ratio, as its popular inductive buck converter counterpart does, and can therefore maintain a 50 % duty cycle, regardless of the actual voltage conversion ratio. Instead, the conversion ratio is a consequence of the switched-capacitor topology. As such, it is a better candidate for high-ratio voltage conversion than the buck converter, which is this case more affected by efficiency limiting drawbacks, due to its reliance on very low duty cycles in order to obtain high voltage conversion ratios. The research in this work explores, given the system-level choice for the SC DC-DC converter, which topology is expected to yield the best performance, considering the typical context of CMOS integration.

40|$|This Resource Load Schedule (RLS) {{addresses}} two missions. The Advanced Reactors Transition (ART) mission, {{funded by}} DOE-EM, is to transition assigned, surplus facilities {{to a safe}} and compliant, low-cost, stable, deactivated condition (requiring minimal surveillance and maintenance) pending eventual reuse or D&D. Facilities to be transitioned include the 309 Building Plutonium Recycle Test Reactor (PRTR) and Nuclear Energy Legacy facilities. This mission is funded through the Environmental Management (EM) Project Baseline Summary (PBS) RL-TP 11, ''Advanced Reactors Transition. '' The second mission, the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) Project, is funded through budget requests submitted to the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (DOE-NE). The FFTF Project mission is maintaining the FFTF, the Fuels and Materials Examination Facility (FMEF), and affiliated 400 Area buildings in a safe and compliant <b>standby</b> <b>condition.</b> This mission is to preserve {{the condition of the}} plant hardware, software, and personnel in a manner not to preclude a plant restart. This revision of the Resource Loaded Schedule (RLS) is based upon the technical scope in the latest revision of the following project and management plans: Fast Flux Test Facility Standby Plan (Reference 1); Hanford Site Sodium Management Plan (Reference 2); and 309 Building Transition Plan (Reference 4). The technical scope, cost, and schedule baseline is also in agreement with the concurrent revision to the ART Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 Multi-Year Work Plan (MYWP), which is available in an electronic version (only) on the Hanford Local Area Network, within the ''Hanford Data Integrator (HANDI) '' application...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Respiratory {{activity}} {{can be a}} clinical predictor for serious adverse events, yet accurate observation of respiration is infrequently performed because of the obtrusiveness and inconvenience of the existing methods. Wearable health monitoring is a convenient and promising way of collecting physiological data including respiratory activity information. However, {{one of the major}} obstacles to widespread adoption of such systems is their dependence on limited lifetime batteries as their power source. Consequently, methods for scavenging renewable energy especially human energy have been investigated. The movements of the chest wall and abdominal area during normal breathing can be a source of renewable energy that is not only readily available but also carries critical medical information. In this dissertation, as the first reported practical and human-tested study, novel models and methods are investigated to practically estimate the available energy during breathing. Then a wearable lightweight respiratory effort harvesting sensor is implemented, optimized, and tested. The results from our method show tremendously lower amounts than what was theoretically estimated in previous literature. Our self-powered respiration sensor is also the first reported non-invasive, human tested sensor which is able to produce mW-range power and can sense thoracic vs. abdominal movements. The output is sufficient to continuously power an ultra-low power System-on-Chip (SoC) in <b>standby</b> <b>condition.</b> Energy accumulation for less than 1 minute while seated and less than 3 seconds during brisk walking provides enough power for a power-optimized on-body SoC. The electromagnetic harvesting system produces up to 1. 4 V, 6. 44 mW and 30. 4 mJ which can power up the SoC for transmission every 6 minutes during fast walking. A statistical paired t-test analysis of the calculated energy expenditure confirmed that there is no significant change (P> 0. 05) in the metabolic rate of subjects wearing the electromagnetic harvester and biosensor.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} {{in response to}} a request from the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) subcommittee on ''Long-Term Isotope Research and Production Plans. '' The NERAC subcommittee has asked for a reply to a number of questions regarding (1) ''How well does the Department of Energy (DOE) infrastructure sme the need for commercial and medical isotopes?'' and (2) ''What should be the long-term role of the federal government in providing commercial and medical isotopes?' Our report addresses the questions raised by the NERAC subcommittee, and especially the 10 issues that were raised under the first of the above questions (see Appendix). These issues are related to the isotope products offered by the DOE Isotope Production Sites, the capabilities and condition of the facilities used to produce these products, the management of the isotope production programs at DOE laboratories, and the customer service record of the DOE Isotope Production sites. An important component of our report is a description of the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) reactor at the Hbford Site and the future plans for its utilization as a source of radioisotopes needed by nuclear medicine physicians, by researchers, and by customers in the commercial sector. In response to the second question raised by the NERAC subcommittee, it is our firm belief that the supply of isotopes provided by DOE for medical, industrial, and research applications must be strengthened in the near future. Many of the radioisotopes currently used for medical diagnosis and therapy of cancer and other diseases are imported from Canada, Europe, and Asia. This situation places the control of isotope availability, quality, and pricing in the hands of non-U. S. suppliers. It is our opinion that the needs of the U. S. customers for isotopes and isotope products are not being adequately served, and that the DOE infrastructure and facilities devoted to the supply of these products must be improved This perception forms one of the fundamental bases for our proposal that the FFTF, which is currently in a <b>standby</b> <b>condition,</b> be reactivated to supply nuclear services and products such as radioisotopes needed by the U. S. medical, industrial, and research communities...|$|E
40|$|This plan {{implements}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) 4330. 4 B, Maintenance Management Program (1994), at the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF). The FFTF is {{a research}} and test reactor located near Richland, Washington, and is operated under contract for the DOE by the B&W Hanford Company (BWHC). The intent of this Maintenance Implementation Plan (MIP) is to describe {{the manner in which}} the activities of the maintenance function are executed and controlled at the FFTF and how this compares to the requirements of DOE 4330. 4 B. The MIP ii a living document that is updated through a Facility Maintenance Self- Assessment Program. During the continuing self-assessment program, any discrepancies found are resolved to meet DOE 4330. 4 B requirements and existing practices. The philosophy of maintenance management at the FFTF is also describe within this MIP. This MIP has been developed based on information obtained from various sources including the following: * A continuing self-assessment against the requirements of the Conduct of Maintenance Order * In-depth reviews conducted by the members of the task team that assembled this MIP * Inputs from routine audits and appraisals conducted at the facility The information from these sources is used to identify those areas in which improvements could be made in {{the manner in which the}} facility conducts maintenance activities. The action items identified in Rev. 1 of the MIP have been completed. The MIP is arranged in six sections. Section I is this Executive Summary. Section 2 describes the facility and its 0683 history. Section 3 describes the philosophy of the graded approach and how it is applied at FFTF. Section 3 also discusses the strategy and the basis for the prioritizing resources. Section 4 contains the detailed discussion of `the elements of DOE 4330. 4 B and their state of implementation. Section 5 is for waivers and requested deviations from the requirements of the order. Section 6 contains a copy of the Maintenance Self-Assessment Schedule for the FFTF. In January 1997, the Secretary of Energy declared that DOE-HQ planned to place the FFTF in a hot <b>standby</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) Decommissioning Project was {{initiated}} in 2009 as a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Removal Action {{with funding from}} the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This paper summarizes the history prior to 2009, the major D&D activities, and final end state of the facility at completion of decommissioning in June 2011. The HWCTR facility was built in 1961, operated from 1962 to 1964, and {{is located in the}} northwest quadrant of the Savannah River Site (SRS) approximately three miles from the site boundary. The HWCTR was a pressurized heavy water test reactor used to develop candidate fuel designs for heavy water power reactors. In December of 1964, operations were terminated and the facility was placed in a <b>standby</b> <b>condition</b> {{as a result of the}} decision by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission to redirect research and development work on heavy water power reactors to reactors cooled with organic materials. For about one year, site personnel maintained the facility in a standby status, and then retired the reactor in place. In the early 1990 s, DOE began planning to decommission HWCTR. Yet, in the face of new budget constraints, DOE deferred dismantlement and placed HWCTR in an extended surveillance and maintenance mode. The doors of the reactor facility were welded shut to protect workers and discourage intruders. In 2009 the $ 1. 6 billion allocation from the ARRA to SRS for site footprint reduction at SRS reopened the doors to HWCTR - this time for final decommissioning. Alternative studies concluded that the most environmentally safe, cost effective option for final decommissioning was to remove the reactor vessel, both steam generators, and all equipment above grade including the dome. The transfer coffin, originally above grade, was to be placed in the cavity vacated by the reactor vessel and the remaining below grade spaces would be grouted. Once all above equipment including the dome was removed, a concrete cover was to be placed over the remaining footprint and the groundwater monitored for an indefinite period to ensure compliance with environmental regulations...|$|E
40|$|A full scale, {{wellhead}} Biphase turbine was manufactured {{and installed}} with {{the balance of}} plant at Well 103 of the Cerro Prieto geothermal resource in Baja, California. The Biphase turbine was first synchronized with the electrical grid of Comision Federal de Electricidad on August 20, 1997. The Biphase power plant was operated from that time until May 23, 2000, a period of 2 years and 9 months. A total of 77, 549 kWh were delivered to the grid. The power plant was subsequently placed in a <b>standby</b> <b>condition</b> pending replacement of the rotor with a newly designed, higher power rotor and replacement of the bearings and seals. The maximum measured power output of the Biphase turbine, 808 kWe at 640 psig wellhead pressure, agreed closely with the predicted output, 840 kWe. When combined with the backpressure steam turbine the total output power from that flow would be increased by 40 % above the power derived only from the flow by the present flash steam plant. The design relations used to predict performance and design the turbine were verified by these tests. The performance and durability of the Biphase turbine support {{the conclusion of the}} Economics and Application Report previously published, (Appendix A). The newly designed rotor (the Dual Pressure Rotor) was analyzed for the above power condition. The Dual Pressure Rotor would increase the power output to 2064 kWe by incorporating two pressure letdown stages in the Biphase rotor, eliminating the requirement for a backpressure steam turbine. The power plant availability was low due to deposition of solids from the well on the Biphase rotor and balance of plant problems. A great deal of plant down time resulted from the requirement to develop methods to handle the solids and from testing the apparatus in the Biphase turbine. Finally an online, washing method using the high pressure two-phase flow was developed which completely eliminated the solids problem. The availability of the Biphase turbine itself was 100 % after implementations of this method in March 2000. However, failures of instrumentation and control system components led to additional plant down time and damage to the bearings and seals. The enthalpy and pressure of well 103 declined substantially from the inception of the project. When the project was started the wellhead pressure and enthalpy were 760 psig and 882 Btu/lb respectively. At the time the plant was placed in standby the corresponding values were only 525 psig and 658 Btu/lb. This reduced the available plant power to only 400 kWe making the project economically unfeasible. However, replacement of the existing rotor with the Dual Pressure Rotor and replacement of the bearings and seals will enable the existing Biphase turbine to produce 1190 kWe at the present well conditions without the backpressure steam turbine. Operation with the present staff can then be sustained by selling power under the existing Agreement with CFE. Implementation of this option is recommended with operation of the facility to continue as a demonstration plant. Biphase turbine theory, design and performance are reported herein. The construction of the Biphase turbine and power plant and operational experience are detailed. Improvements in the Biphase turbine are indicated and analyzed. The impact of Biphase techonology on geothermal power production is discussed and recommendations made...|$|E
