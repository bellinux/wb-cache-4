40|$|The {{conduct of}} {{military}} forces {{is not limited}} to their territory. They are typically sent on missions that potentially affect civilians beyond the borders of the sending State. Under the European Convention, the linking factor bringing its protection into play is that of jurisdiction under Article 1 ECHR. What is the reach of the European Convention in the context of participation by Contracting Parties in military operations abroad? The interpretation of the concept of jurisdiction has evolved from its territorial beginnings. After a detailed analysis of the case-law on the interpretation of jurisdiction, including the latest landmark cases of Al-Jedda and Al-Skeini, I conclude that the current case-law lacks coherence. The search for a more coherent approach to determining questions of jurisdiction, in situations involving military conduct abroad has steered this thesis into considering the unsatisfactory interplay between humanitarian law and human rights law {{and the way in which}} the two systems apply to civilians caught in military operations. An analysis of the case-law under the European Convention in situations where Contracting Parties send troops as part of multi-national forces has indicated the benefits of considering dual or multiple attribution rather than a <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> I propose a more coherent approach to jurisdiction replacing the present uncertainty in the context of applicability of the European Convention to military operations abroad. I argue, in all situations, for a test requiring a direct and immediate link between the conduct of Contracting Parties and the violation of Convention rights as offering better protection of human rights for individuals trapped in conflicts. In this way the supervisory effect of the European Convention is enhanced. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|This article assesses {{predictors}} of payouts and non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases {{decided by the}} Spanish Supreme Court from 2006 until 2010. Medical malpractice cases can be judged in administrative or civil courts, and this distinction heavily relies {{on the type of}} hospital where the medical accident took place (in general terms, administrative courts judge cases involving public hospitals and civil courts judge cases involving private hospitals). I find that cases decided by the Administrative Section of the Supreme Court are not more likely to receive damages than cases decided by the Civil Section. The probability of receiving compensation is significantly higher among cases involving permanent major/grave injuries. With respect to non-economic compensation amounts, there are no significant differences between Administrative and Civil cases. This result is confirmed by matching estimation and simulation exercises. There is evidence of vertical inequality according to the level of harm: cases involving permanent grave injuries are those receiving the highest non-economic damages, followed by permanent major, death, permanent minor and temporary /emotional cases. Differences in compensation awards between Administrative and Civil courts has been one argument widely used against the current <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> in many civil law tradition countries. The results found in this paper do not support this claim...|$|R
50|$|Cursola, as it {{was called}} in Latin, became an episcopal see in the early 14th century, when the bishop of Ston (Stagnum in Latin) asked to be {{authorized}} to transfer his seat there because of Serb pressure on Ston. This was granted and he was made bishop also of a new diocese of Cursola united with his previous one. In 1541, the Ragusans asked for the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical <b>jurisdiction</b> over Ston, which they had conquered, from Cursola, which in the previous century had become a Venetian possession. In 1828, when both the Korčula and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) belonged to the Austrian Empire, the territory of the diocese of Cursola was made part of that of Dubrovnik. No longer a residential bishopric, Cursola is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.|$|R

Four main issues have been discussed. Firstly, whether the legislator is entitled, and if he can, to what extent, to invest into the executive power {{with the task of}} determining the grounds (constituting) criminal responsibility, and more precisely, the interpretation of the nullum crimen sine lege principle in the context of article 31 clause 3 and article 42 clause 1 of the Constitution. Secondly, whether in Poland's constitutional system (order) exist instruments which a legislator could use to check the scope of criminalisation. Here, the dispute concerning the right of criminal courts to disregard, at their own discretion, the norm arising from an Act or ordinance, if such a norm is found to be in conflict with the Constitution. Thirdly, an attempt has been made to determine the level of judicial competence that may be vested in the criminal court to establish the attributes of a prohibited act. And fourthly, the level to which the legislator is authorised to propose absolutely determined punishment has been analysed, followed with a question whether such punishments are in line with the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> power-based <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> courts appointed to administer justice...|$|R

40|$|The term {{jurisdiction}} may {{be defined}} as the authority to affect legal interests [...] to prescribe rules <b>of</b> law (legislative <b>jurisdiction),</b> to adjudicate legal questions (judicial jurisdiction) and to enforce judgments the judiciary made (enforcement jurisdiction). The definition, nature and scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> vary depending on the context in which it is to be applied. United States domestic law, for example, defines and applies notions <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> pursuant to the United States constitutional provisions relating to the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers. Within the United States, jurisdiction is defined and applied in a variegated fashion depending on whether a legal problem is within the federal or the state sphere. Among the states, the definition and scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> also vary. The international setting gives rise to another set of definitions and applications of the notion <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> International law has failed to develop jurisdictional rules that are as comprehensive or precise as the domestic jurisdictional laws of individual nations. Indeed, international law has tended to focus on penal rather than civil jurisdiction. Moreover, the set of rules relating to criminal legislative, judicial and enforcement jurisdiction in the international setting is not as well developed as the parallel domestic laws of the various nations. Generally, this article will discuss the problem <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over extraterritorial crime by analyzing the interaction between United States domestic and international law relating to jurisdiction. In 1935, Harvard Research on International Law (Harvard Research) identified five theories of criminal jurisdiction: territorial; protective; nationality; universal; and passive personality. These theories, representing the possible bases for a state to claim jurisdiction over actions committed abroad and proscribed by its criminal law, provide the organizational format for this article...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{ascertain}} the rules of private international law determining the procedural law of international commercial arbitral proceedings. In an Introduction, the author outlines the fundamental notions, introduces the topic and the major doctrines and issues, and sets out his methodology {{and structure of the}} work. The thesis examine first, as a preliminary issue, the considerations influencing the assumption <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over arbitral proceedings. Chapter 1 discusses the various theories on the lex arbitri (the law supplying the general legal framework of an arbitration) as relevant to the procedural law, and concludes that they are deductive and therefore unable to satisfactorily to determine the applicable procedural law. Chapter 2 analyses major national laws as case-studies of the technique and scope of application of international arbitration law, and suggests a model of legislative and court jurisdiction based on the legal concept of 'seat of the arbitration' and on considerations based on the most appropriate court to control an arbitration. Chapter 3 discusses the obligations {{of the state of the}} seat under the European Convention on Human Rights and confirms the findings in Chapter 2. In a second part, the thesis elaborates on the title and extent of permissible municipal law interference. Chapter 4 tests the validity of the propositions derived from Chapters 2 and 3 against arbitral practice and concludes that seldom will arbitrators derogate from the law of the seat. Chapter 5 examines the particular case of arbitrations with states and similar entities. The third part discusses the relevance of compliance with the law of the seat at the stage of enforcement of an award. Chapter 6 deals with the technical issue of whether annulment at the place of making precludes enforcement in other fora. That chapter gives the opportunity to discuss models <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> international <b>jurisdiction</b> and co-operation between different jurisdictions from a practical perspective. It thus serves as a convenient introduction to Chapter 7, which discusses the more abstract question of the nexus required between an arbitral award and the municipal law of the state of rendition in order for the award to enter, in limine, the scope of application of the international instruments in the field. The thesis ends with Conclusions in the form of model provisions for municipal law and arbitration rules. </p...|$|R

40|$|When private {{international}} law lawyers discuss jurisdiction, focus is typically placed primarily on personal jurisdiction, and secondarily on subject matter jurisdiction. This article seeks to demonstrate {{that there is a}} third matter – what we can call scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or perhaps scope <b>of</b> remedial <b>jurisdiction</b> – that needs to be considered. Scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> relates to the appropriate geographical scope of orders rendered by a court that has personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction.

5000|$|To prevent one branch from {{becoming}} supreme, protect the [...] "opulent minority" [...] from the majority, and to induce the branches to cooperate, government systems that employ a <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers need {{a way to}} balance each of the branches.

Checks and balances allow for a system-based regulation that allows one branch to limit another, such as {{the power of the}} United States Congress to alter the composition and <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the federal courts.
