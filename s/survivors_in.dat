5|$|In {{contrast}} to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone. A total of 586homes were damaged there. Just outside {{the city in the}} Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18people. Overall, the storm claimed 37lives in the country and left US$6.7million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless.

5|$|London's {{buildings}} are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, {{partly because of}} their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those {{just west of the}} centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor <b>survivors</b> <b>in</b> the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey 1515.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} on Mackinac Island are built of wood, a few are of stone, and most have clapboard siding. The architectural styles on the island span 300 years, from the earliest Native American structures to the styles of the 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century. Mackinac Island has the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States, and one of few <b>survivors</b> <b>in</b> North America.|$|E
