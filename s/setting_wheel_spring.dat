C., Chen, B. L., published in the International Journal of Solids and Structures, 2003, Vol. 40, No. 2, pp. 465 – 491. First, the formulation of H(t,tk) on p. 470 is questionable. Second, for a moving suspension mass model, the interaction force between moving mass and bridge is incorrectly given. Third, for a moving mass model for the train and without the installation of PTMD (passive tuned mass damper), the equation of motion of the bridge is incorrect. Lastly, for the train load model, which consists of one-half of a train car, one bogie, two <b>wheel</b> <b>sets,</b> <b>spring</b> and dashpot between bogie and half of a train car, and spring and dashpot between bogie and each <b>wheel</b> <b>set,</b> the authors did not put forward the formulation of interaction force between <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> and bridge, but the discusser does...|$|R
25|$|Running gear {{includes}} the brake gear, <b>wheel</b> <b>sets,</b> axleboxes, <b>springing</b> and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface. Adhesive weight is {{the portion of the}} locomotive's weight bearing on the driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able {{to make the most of}} its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the adhesive weight. Locomotives with equalising beams connecting the ends of plate springs have often been deemed a complication, however locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip.|$|R

The rear half-elliptical springs also were given a torsion bar stabilizer and hydraulic shock absorbers. They were rubber-mounted to minimise vibration. The exhaust system was also insulated.|$|R

For optimum performance the Marco J-5 can be {{built with}} a glider-type retractable monowheel, using stabilizing wheels mounted in downturned trapezoidal wingtip extensions.

The selenium cell exposure meter is now coupled to a [...] "setting wheel" [...] located on {{the very bottom of}} the lens mount. This <b>setting</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> adjusts the camera's exposure value (EV) by changing (in a most complex fashion) the aperture and/or shutter rings {{at the same time that}} it changes the depth-of-field pointers on the camera's lens.

The current invention is an omnidirectional, remote-controlled mobility apparatus, {{similar to}} a wheelchair, which allows the transport of an individual or object(s). The device includes a cubic-shaped base with wheel wells on each vertical side of said base. Within each wheel well is a <b>wheel</b> <b>set,</b> such that {{the front and rear}} <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> face each other and the left and right <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> face each other.

50|$|The Farman III was, {{like the}} Voisin, an equal-span pusher biplane {{with a single}} forward {{elevator}} and biplane tail surfaces carried on booms. Farman's design eliminated the covered nacelle for the pilot which also carried the elevator in the Voisin: instead the elevator was mounted on two pairs of converging booms. Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The undercarriage also differed considerably, replacing the pair of wheels {{with a pair of}} skids each carrying a pair of <b>wheels</b> <b>sprung</b> using bungee cord and restrained by radius rods.|$|R
50|$|The Fouga {{aircraft}} company {{submitted a}} prototype tractor and trailer on 2 February 1939. It was tested until 8 May. This vehicle also closely resembled the Renault UE, {{but had a}} higher roof, making hoods unnecessary and enlarging the cargo space. Its suspension had two bogies per side with each two road <b>wheels,</b> <b>sprung</b> by leaf springs. The type, its submission too late because a choice had already been made for a rivalling type, was rejected because its mechanical parts were not easily accessible and the vibration level was too high.|$|R

The series code on the ID tag denotes which model and from that it can be determined what weight rating each vehicle has. 4×4 trucks can also be identified by the Vehicle Identification Number and on the ID plate as a serial number. For example, F10 is an F-100 2-wheel drive, but F11 is an F-100 4×4, and so on. Serial numbers beginning with an [...] "X" [...] are SuperCab models.|$|R

He was critical of the combination rail and wheel arrangement, and he recommended that [...] "proper" [...] railway track should be used, laid adjacent to the existing tramplate to allow for continued operation during the conversion. He wanted the railway fenced, and level crossing gates and signalling to be provided. All the wagons in use were unsuitable for a passenger carrying railway, and they had to be replaced with those of an approved type, with wrought iron <b>wheels,</b> <b>springs</b> and buffers.|$|R
