25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their <b>shoes</b> <b>off.</b> Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{opens the}} song listing {{the things she}} would do for her man during her verses: brush his hair, take his <b>shoes</b> <b>off,</b> give him a manicure, rub his feet, help him put his do-rag on, undo his cufflinks. She also sings the lines [...] "Let me feed you, let me run your bath water, {{whatever}} you desire" [...] after the thins she had previously listed. Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep my hair fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if her man comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'" [...] Williams sings her solo verses during the song's bridge.|$|E
500|$|After hearing Quagmire {{brag about}} his sexual exploits, Peter {{feels that he}} has missed out on enjoying the single lifestyle. Death is summoned to The Drunken Clam on a false alarm (thinking that Horace had died), and decides to grant Peter's wish by sending him, along with Brian, back to 1984 for one night. He notices his friend Cleveland, in his '80s look, who high-fives him around the pool. He then sees 18-year-old Lois Pewterschmidt walking around the country club pool, taking her high-heeled <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> and jumping off the diving board into the pool with [...] "Mr. Night" [...] playing in the background, a {{reference}} to Caddyshack. [...] Appearing to others as his 18-year-old self, Peter cancels his scheduled movie date to see Zapped! with Lois, instead accepting an invitation from Cleveland to go and party at a bar. Peter enjoys the evening, and ends up making out with actress Molly Ringwald before Death appears to return him to the present.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though I disagree {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E

5000|$|One <b>Shoe</b> <b>Off</b> opened Off-Broadway in April 1993 in a Second Stage Theatre {{production}} at the Public Theater.

2500|$|The word {{comes through}} French (galoche) and Latin from Greek and {{originally}} meant a shoemaker's last; literally [...] "wood" [...] + [...] "foot". [...] By the 14th century {{it had been}} transferred to English style clogs, that is those with a wooden sole and fabric (e.g. leather) upper. [...] By 1572 the term also applied to [...] "a Gallage or Patten"; that is, an overshoe with a shaped wooden base to raise the wearer's good <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> the ground.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jackson, {{he got his}} {{nickname}} during a mill game played in Greenville, South Carolina. Jackson had blisters on his foot from {{a new pair of}} cleats, which hurt so much that he took his <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> before he was at bat. As play continued, a heckling fan noticed Jackson running to third base in his socks, and shouted [...] "You shoeless son of a gun, you!" [...] and the resulting nickname [...] "Shoeless Joe" [...] stuck with him throughout the remainder of his life.|$|E

50|$|She {{is often}} shown {{with a small}} fiddler at her feet, and with one <b>shoe</b> <b>off.</b> This derives from a legend, also {{attached}} to the Volto Santo of Lucca, of a silver shoe with which the statue had been clothed dropping spontaneously {{at the feet of}} a poor pilgrim. In the Wilgefortis version the poor devotee became a fiddler, perhaps in the 13th century.|$|R
2500|$|After befriending Simone {{through a}} series of meetings, Gravano, with the {{assistance}} of Milito and D'Angelo, abducted Simone from Yardley Golf Club in Yardley, Pennsylvania (part of suburban Trenton, New Jersey) and drove him to a wooded area on Staten Island. Gravano then granted Simone's requests to die with his <b>shoes</b> <b>off,</b> in fulfillment of a promise he had made to his wife, and {{at the hands of a}} made man. After Gravano removed Simone's shoes, Milito shot Simone in the back of the head, killing him. Gravano later expressed admiration for Simone as a so-called [...] "man's man", remarking favorably on the calmness with which he accepted his fate. Gravano earned praise from Castellano for the killing.|$|E
2500|$|Some key {{customs and}} {{etiquette}} in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, {{it is considered}} good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually {{in the form of}} potlucks. Most locals take their <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the pandanggo). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as [...] "locals of Hawaii" [...] or [...] "people of Hawaii".|$|E
2500|$|Joanna Rapf, {{writing about}} the filming of The Verdict, states that Lumet gave a lot of {{personal}} attention to his actors, whether listening to them or touching them. She describes how Lumet and star Paul Newman sat on a bench secluded from the main set, where Newman had taken his <b>shoes</b> <b>off,</b> in order to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot[...] [...] [...] The actors walk through their scenes before the camera rolls. This preparation was done because Lumet likes to shoot a scene in one take, two at the most. Newman liked to call him [...] "Speedy Gonzales," [...] adding that Lumet did not shoot more than he had to. [...] "He doesn't give himself any protection. I know I would," [...] Newman said.|$|E
5000|$|Ben Brantley in {{reviewing}} Birth and After Birth for The New York Times, observed [...] "The suggestion is {{of a natural}} world that thwarts and ultimately devours the ambitions and pretensions of the civilized. This is a theme that Ms. Howe would develop in later works, sometimes artfully (Coastal Disturbances), sometimes clumsily (One <b>Shoe</b> <b>Off),</b> but always in a style that was distinctively her own." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 11 February 1858, Bernadette, then aged 14, was out {{gathering}} firewood {{with her}} sister Marie and a friend near the grotto of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she experienced her first vision. While the other girls crossed the little stream {{in front of the}} grotto and walked on, Bernadette stayed behind, {{looking for a place to}} cross where she wouldn't get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, [...] "came a dazzling light, and a white figure". [...] This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as aquero (pronounced [...] ), Gascon Occitan for [...] "that". In later testimony, she called it [...] "a small young lady" [...] (uo petito damizelo). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.|$|E
2500|$|By 1863, with {{clothing}} supplies {{harder to}} come by, {{men from the}} regiment were dressing in [...] "home-woven gray blue, brown or black woolen jeans pants or overcoats... homemade lamb's wool or beaver or coonskin fur hats... gray or black hats... the majority of us wore wool socks sent us from home, while others wore the entire regulation gray uniform including gray caps." [...] Matthews reports that [...] "there were a class of men among us who would rob the dead... men who did not entertain the thought of taking the <b>shoes</b> <b>off</b> the dead themselves, but who were in need of shoes {{and did not know}} where they could get any, would pay from $10 to $25 for a pair of second-hand shoes to the man who said, usually, that he had bought them and that they did not fit." [...] Some became so desperate by 1863 that they resorted to scrounging old shoes from abandoned campsites that had been exposed to the elements for six months or more. These were initially soaked in water and then worn; some men had to wear two completely different sized shoes, one for each foot.|$|E

50|$|Veterinary {{treatment}} includes {{taking the}} <b>shoe</b> <b>off,</b> cutting the hoof clean and opening the nail hole to allow drainage. If {{the horse is}} in pain anesthesia of the nerve is given. The hole is irrigated and the hole can be packed with iodine-soaked cotton. Superficial infections may only need one treatment. The horse can be given an antiseptic foot bandage for 3-4 days and then be shod if the lameness is gone. The prognosis is usually good provided that minimal damage occurs to vatial structures of the foot. Tetanus prophylaxis is used for unvaccinated horses.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is unknown}} {{of the extent}} of which Ray played with the Panhandles. While he did appear in photos {{advertising}} the Panhandles, he did not play in many games with the club.
