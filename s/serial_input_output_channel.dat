40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 2001 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaMany high-performance, {{reconfigurable}} data functions can now {{be integrated}} into a single PCI circuit board, making possible low-cost and complex systems using PCs or UNIX workstations. FPGA and PCI technologies are an excellent match to telemetry applications where commercial off-the-shelf solutions are desired, but customization is common and performance critical. A Multifunction Telemetry I/O (MFT) module was designed to exploit these technologies for both flight test and space telemetry ground systems. The reconfigurability of the module has facilitated evolutionary hardware enhancements as well as custom applications. These enhancements have been used both as building blocks for system integrators and for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) graphic setup, processing, archiving, and display software. The MFT module includes a standard set of telemetry functions: up to two bit synchronizers, an IRIG time decoder, and two independent telemetry <b>serial</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>channels.</b> The MFT module is also available on a 6 U VME board. This paper describes some of the proven capabilities and applications of this module...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} shown that the {{capacity}} of a multiple-input multiple-output system increases linearly with the number of antennas, provided that the environment is rich scattering. However, this increase in the capacity is substantially degraded if the multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> <b>channels</b> are correlated. In this paper, the capacity of correlated multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> fading <b>channel</b> is investigated for laplacian and uniform angular energy distributions that implicitly represent two different scatterer distributions. The effect of the spatial correlation of a uniform circular antenna array is considered. Optimal power allocation is implemented to maximize the capacity. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, the results show that multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> <b>channel</b> capacity {{is a function of the}} angle spread and antenna spacing. These two parameters play a major role in dictating the spatial correlation which in turn affects on the capacity. Large angle spread leads to lower correlation between the antenna elements and consequently higher capacity. The degradation in the capacity can be reduced by increasing the spacing between the antenna elements...|$|R

40|$|Because of its {{linearity}} needs, {{the direct}} {{implementation of the}} cost effective blind matched filtering technique to multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> communication <b>channels</b> was not possible. In this paper we show how to perform the cost effective blind matched filtering technique for these types of communication channels assuming a two-way transmission scenario. For this reason, the blind matched filter and the adaptive filtering blocks, which are required by the so called technique, are adapted for multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> case. Besides its structural simplicity, such adaptation does also enable the use of no higher than second order statistics of the received signal for the matched filter identification purposes. Moreover, {{with the use of}} the novel receiver, the equalization of the multiple <b>input</b> multiple <b>output</b> <b>channel</b> is performed alongside the matched filter identification stage...|$|R
40|$|We explore optimal ways of {{communicating}} (with a power constraint) over multiple antenna communication systems by managing spatial power distribution.

MC at the transmit array affects the amount of power drawn from the supply, and this power can be calculated by integrating the power radiated by the array in all directions. In this thesis, we focus on two problems, both of them assuming knowledge of perfect channel state information: (a) Finding the Signal to Noise Ratio maximizing scheme for Multiple <b>Input</b> Single <b>Output</b> <b>channels,</b> and (b) Determining the capacity achieving scheme for Multiple <b>Input</b> Multiple <b>Output</b> <b>channels.</b> Our solutions, Coupling Optimized BeamForming and Coupling Optimized WaterFilling outperform beamforming and waterfilling respectively, {{and the extent to}} which they do better depends on the strength of MC...|$|R
