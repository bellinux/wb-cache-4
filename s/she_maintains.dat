25|$|In 2004, Dr Xun Zhou, a {{research}} fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, published doubts regarding the authenticity of the Kaifeng community. Zhou asserts that the apparent presence of the Jews was largely a Western cultural construct, which grew following the publication by James Finn of The Jews in China (1840) and The Orphan Colony of Jews in China (1874) whose initial research was based upon the accounts of the 17th century Jesuit missionaries. <b>She</b> <b>maintains</b> that the community had no Torah scrolls until 1851, when they suddenly appeared to be sold to eager Western collectors. She also states that drawings of the synagogue were doctored in the West because the original did not look like one, and that the Kaifeng community claimed to have kept some Jewish practices since before they are known to have begun. Xun Zhou's conclusion is that the Kaifeng community was not Jewish in any meaningful sense.|$|E
