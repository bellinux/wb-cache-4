5000|$|Inevitably, {{the queen}} begins to falter, and the bees decide {{to replace her}} by {{creating}} a new queen {{from one of her}} worker eggs. They may do this because she has been damaged (lost a leg or an antenna), because she has run out of sperm and cannot lay fertilized eggs (has become a [...] "drone laying queen"), or because her pheromones have dwindled to where they cannot control all the bees in the hive. At this juncture, the bees produce one or more queen cells by modifying existing worker cells that contain a normal female egg. They then pursue one of two ways to replace the queen: supersedure, replacing or superseding the queen without swarming, or <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> production, dividing the hive into two colonies through swarming.|$|E

40|$|Proteus mirabilis is a {{urinary tract}} {{pathogen}} that differentiates from a short swimmer cell to an elongated, highly flagellated <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>Swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation parallels an increased expression of several virulence factors, suggesting that both processes {{are controlled by}} the same signal. The molecular nature of this signal is not known but is hypothesized to involve the inhibition of flagellar rotation. In this study, data are presented supporting the idea that conditions inhibiting flagellar rotation induce <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and implicating a rotating flagellar filament as critical to the sensing mechanism. Mutations in three genes, fliL, fliF, and fliG, encoding components of the flagellar basal body, result in the inappropriate development of <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> in noninducing liquid media or hyperelongated <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> on agar media. The fliL mutation was studied in detail. FliL− mutants are nonmotile and fail to synthesize flagellin, while complementation of fliL restores wild-type cell elongation but not motility. Overexpression of fliL+ in wild-type <b>cells</b> prevents <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and motility, a result also observed when P. mirabilis fliL+ was expressed in Escherichia coli. These results suggest that FliL {{plays a role in}} <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and implicate FliL as critical to transduction of the signal inducing <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and virulence gene expression. In concert with this idea, defects in fliL up-regulate the expression of two virulence genes, zapA and hpmB. These results support the hypothesis that P. mirabilis ascertains its location in the environment or host by assessing the status of its flagellar motors, which in turn control <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> gene expression...|$|R

Although the phospholipid composition of <b>swarmer</b> and stalked <b>cells</b> was indistinguishable in continuously labeled cultures {{if the two}} cell types were pulse-labeled {{for a short time}} period, marked differences in the pattern of phospholipid synthesis were detected. Pulse-labeled <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a higher proportion of phosphatidic acid and a lower proportion of phosphatidylglycerol. In addition, minor phospholipids were detected in the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> that were not detected in stalked cells. Stalked cells that developed directly from <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> showed that same phospholipid profile as the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells.</b> The switch to the second phospholipid profile was observed to occur at the predivisional cell stage.

40|$|Hyphomonas spp. {{reproduce}} by budding {{from the}} tip of the prosthecum, distal to {{the main body of the}} reproductive cell; thus, the chromosome must travel through the prosthecum to enter the progeny, the <b>swarm</b> <b>cell.</b> When viewed by electron microscopy, negatively stained whole cells, ultrathin-sectioned cells, and freezeetched and frozen hydrated cells all had marked swellings of the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) in the prosthecum which are termed pseudovesicles (PV). PV were separated by constrictions in the contiguous CM. In replicating cells, PV housed ribosomes and DNA, which was identified by its fibrillar appearance and by lactoferrin-gold labeling. The micrographs also revealed that the CM bifurcates at the origin of the prosthecum so that one branch partitions the main body of the reproductive cell from the prosthecum and <b>swarm</b> <b>cell.</b> The results of this fine-structure analysis suggest models explaining DNA segregation and the marked asymmetric polarity of the budding reproductive cell. In most bacteria, the chromosome, ribosomes, and macromolecules travel a relatively short distance before they are partitioned in the adjacent dividing daughter cell.

40|$|Abstract. A reaction-diffusion model {{motivated}} by Proteus mirabilis swarm colony development is presented and analyzed in this work. The principal variables are {{the concentrations of}} swarm cells and swimmer cells, which are multicellular and single-cell forms, respectively, of the Proteus mirabilis bacteria. The kinetic terms model the growth and division process of the swimmer cells, {{as well as the}} formation and septation of swarm cells. In addition, a nonlinear diffusion is employed for the <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> migration that incorporates several essential aspects of the concentration-dependent dynamics observed in experiments. The model exhibits time-periodic colony evolution in which each period consists of two distinct phases: a swarming phase and a consolidation phase. Both are very similar to those seen in experiments. During the swarming phase, the colony expands as swarm cells migrate outward to form a new terrace beyond the colony’s initial boundary. Gradually, this expansion slows down and stops, and then the consolidation phase begins, during which time the colony boundary stays in place, but the swarm and swimmer concentrations inside the colony boundary change significantly. Finally, when the <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> concentration has reached a threshold, the consolidation phase ends abruptly and the next swarming phase begins, repeating the cycle...|$|E

40|$|Caulobacter crescentus differentiates from a motile, {{foraging}} <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> into a sessile, replication-competent stalked cell {{during its}} cell cycle. This developmental transition is inhibited by nutrient deprivation {{to favor the}} motile swarmer state. We identify two cell cycle regulatory signals, ppGpp and polyphosphate (polyP), that inhibit the swarmer-to-stalked transition in both complex and glucose-exhausted media, thereby increasing the proportion of <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> in mixed culture. Upon depletion of available carbon, <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> lacking the ability to synthesize ppGpp or polyP improperly initiate chromosome replication, proteolyze the replication inhibitor CtrA, localize the cell fate determinant DivJ, and develop polar stalks. Furthermore, we show that <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> produce more ppGpp than stalked cells upon starvation. These results provide evidence that ppGpp and polyP are cell-type-specific developmental regulators...|$|R
40|$|We {{reported}} previously that artificial overexpression of the flhDC operon in liquid-grown Serratia liquefaciens {{resulted in}} the formation of filamentous, multinucleated, and hyperflagellated cells that were indistinguishable from surface-induced swarm cells (L. Eberl, G. Christiansen, S. Molin, and M. Givskov, J. Bacteriol. 178 : 554 – 559, 1996). In the present report we show by means of reporter gene measurements, Northern analysis, and in situ reverse transcription-PCR that the amount of flhDC mRNA in surface-grown swarm cells does not exceed the maximum level found in nondifferentiated, vegetative cells. This suggests that surface-induced S. liquefaciens <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, although dependent on flhDC gene expression, does not occur through elevated flhDC mRNA levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{and associated}} physiological {{aspects of the}} chemoorganotrophic and photoorganotrophic appendaged (prosthecate) bacteria were considered. Initially work centred on the enrichment, isolation and enumeration of the chemoorganotrophic species Ancalomicrobium,Caulobacter and IIyphomicrobium from freshwater sources which varied in eutrophication levels. Induction and repression of the multiappendaged form of an Ancalomicrobium isolate, induced by environmental stimuli, was indicated. Additionally the morphological diversity of IIyphomicrobium found to be expressed in response to carbon source variation (methanol to methylamine) brings into doubt the validity of generic classification {{on the grounds of}} morphology. Of the appendaged photoorganotrophic (Athiorhodaceae) species isolated, the growth, and reproduction of a Rhodomicrobium species was studied in detail. This microorganism was shown to be similar physiologically to Rh. vannielii (Duchow and Douglas, 1949) but differed in that it produced exospores in profusion during the stationary phase. The formation, germination and physiological characteristics of these resting cells were examined. Information from the growth and reproduction studies, correlated with ultrastructural work, was used to formulate a model for growth and replication applicable to the vegetative cell 'and exospore. The obligatory, sequential, differential events required for growth and replication of the Rhodomicrobium. <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> lead to exploitation of this system {{as a model for the}} study of differentiation.

40|$|The {{chemotaxis}} system {{plays an}} essential role in <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and motility. We show in this study that two (Tsr and Tar) of the four chemoreceptors in Escherichia coli can support swarming individually, but sensing their most powerful chemoattractants is not necessary. Conditions that abolish chemotaxis toward serine (presence of serine concentrations that saturate Tsr, or mutations in Tsr that destroy serine binding) have no effect on swarming. Similar results were obtained for the aspartate and maltose chemoreceptor Tar. We also show that although a mutation in the signaling domain of Tsr that inhibits CheA kinase abolishes swarming, nonchemotactic flagellar switch mutants can swarm. Our results suggest that during swarming, the chemoreceptors signal through the chemotaxis pathway and induce swarmer cell differentiation in response to signals other than their known chemoeffectors...|$|E
40|$|Proteus mirabilis is a dimorphic, motile {{bacterium}} {{often associated}} with urinary tract infections. Colonization of urinary tract surfaces is aided by <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, which is initiated by inhibition of flagellar rotation when the bacteria first contact a surface. Mutations in fliL, encoding a flagellar structural protein with an enigmatic function, result in the inappropriate production of differentiated <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells,</b> called pseudoswarmer cells, under noninducing conditions, indicating involvement of FliL in the surface sensing pathway. In the present study, we compared the fliL transcriptome with that of wild-type <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> and showed that nearly all genes associated with motility (flagellar class II and III genes) and chemotaxis are repressed. In contrast, spontaneous motile revertants of fliL cells that regained motility yet produced differentiated <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> under noninducing conditions transcribed flagellar class II promoters at consistent levels. Expression of umoA (a known regulator of <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells),</b> flgF, and flgI increased significantly in both <b>swarmer</b> and pseudoswarmer <b>cells,</b> as did genes in a degenerate prophage region situated immediately adjacent to the Rcs phosphorelay system. Unlike <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells,</b> pseudoswarmers displayed increased activity, rather than transcription, of the flagellar master regulatory protein, FlhD 4 C 2, and analyses of the fliL parent strain and its motile revertants showed that they result from mutations altering the C-terminal 14 amino acids of FliL. Collectively, the data suggest a functional role for the C terminus of FliL in surface sensing and implicate UmoA {{as part of the}} signal relay leading to the master flagellar regulator FlhD 4 C 2, which ultimately controls <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} wosA, a Proteus mirabilis gene identified by {{its ability to}} increase swarming motility when overexpressed. At various times during the swarming cycle, the increased expression of wosA resulted in a 4 - to 16 -fold upregulation of the transcription of flhDC, encoding the master regulator of the flagellar cascade. In turn, the expression of flaA, encoding flagellin, was substantially increased in wosA-overexpressing strains. The overexpression of wosA also resulted in constitutive <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation in liquid medium, a normally nonpermissive condition. However, in wosA-overexpressing strains, the onset of swarming was not altered. A null wosA allele resulted in a slight decrease in swarming motility. The expression of wosA was growth phase dependent during growth in liquid and on agar plates during <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Increasing the viscosity of liquid medium {{by the addition of}} polyvinylpyrrolidone induced <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and resulted in a fourfold increase in wosA transcription. A fliL mutation that results in constitutive <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> elongation also increased wosA transcription. In this study, we discuss the possible role of the wosA gene product in signal transduction from solid surfaces to induce <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, possibly via alterations in the motor switch complex.

Bacterial swarming is a specialized form of surface translo-cation that enables flagellate bacteria to coordinately move atop solid surfaces (11). The ability to swarm depends on a complex differentiation process that leads short and oligo-flagellate swimmer cells to produce long, multinucleate, and hyperflagellate swarm cells actively migrating over surfaces in organized groups of tightly bound cells (reviewed in reference 10). The widespread nature of swarming-proficient species sug-gests that this type of flagellum-aided motility is a successful strategy developed by flagellate bacteria to rapidly colonize environmental surfaces (10).

V. parahaemolyticus differentiates between two distinct cell types: short rod-shaped swimmer cells and highly elongated <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells.</b> We {{show that the}} intracellular organization of chemotactic signaling arrays changes according to the differentiation state. In swimmer cells chemotaxis arrays are strictly polarly localized, but in <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> arrays form both at the cell poles and at irregular intervals along the entire cell length. Furthermore, the formation of lateral arrays increases with <b>cell</b> length of <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells.</b> Occurrence of lateral signaling arrays {{is not simply a}} consequence of the elongated state of <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells,</b> but is instead differentiation state-specific. Moreover, our data suggest that <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> employ two distinct mechanisms for localization of polar and lateral signaling arrays, respectively.

In this study, the genome-wide transcriptional response of B. cereus ATCC 14579 during swarming was analyzed. Swarming was shown to trigger the differential expression (> 2 -fold change) of 118 genes. Downregulated genes included those required for basic cellular metabolism. In accordance with the hyperflagellate phenotype of the <b>swarm</b> <b>cell,</b> genes encoding flagellin were overexpressed.

Mutants in rcsB, the response regulator in the Rcs phosphorelay, hyperswarm on solid agar and differentiate into <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> in liquid, demonstrating that this system also influences {{the expression of}} genes central to differentiation. To gain a further understanding of RcsB-regulated genes involved in <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) {{was used to examine}} the RcsB regulon.

On agar, a P. mirabilis colony grows outward in a bull’s-eye pattern formed by consecutive waves of rapid swarming followed by consolidation into shorter cells. To examine differential gene expression in these growth phases, a microarray was constructed based on the completed genome sequence and annota-tion.

A total of 587 genes were differentially expressed in broth-cultured <b>cells</b> versus <b>swarming</b> <b>cells,</b> and 527 genes were differentially expressed in broth-cultured cells versus consolidation-phase cells (consolidate). Flagellar genes were highly upregulated in both <b>swarming</b> <b>cells</b> and consolidation-phase cells.

This oligotrophic bacterium divides asymmetrically {{to produce}} a motile <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> that represses DNA replication and a sessile stalked cell that replicates its DNA. The initiation of DNA replication coincides with the proteolysis of the CtrA replication inhibitor and the accumulation of DnaA, the replication initiator, upon differentiation of the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> into a stalked cell. We analyzed the adaptive response of C. crescentus <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> to carbon starvation and {{found that there was}} a block in both the swarmer-to-stalked cell polar differentiation program and the initiation of DNA replication. SpoT is a bifunctional synthase/hydrolase that controls the steady-state level of the stress-signaling nucleotide (p) ppGpp, and carbon starvation caused a SpoT-dependent increase in (p) ppGpp concentration. Carbon starvation activates DnaA proteolysis (B. Gorbatyuk and G. T. Marczynski, Mol. Microbiol. 55 : 1233 - 1245, 2005). We observed that SpoT is required for this phenomenon in <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells,</b> {{and in the absence of}} SpoT, carbon-starved <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> inappropriately initiated DNA replication. Since SpoT controls (p) ppGpp abundance, we propose that this nucleotide relays carbon starvation signals to the cellular factors responsible for activating DnaA proteolysis, thereby inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication. SpoT, however, was not required for the carbon starvation block of the swarmer-to-stalked cell polar differentiation program. Thus, <b>swarmer</b> <b>cells</b> utilize at least two independent signaling pathways to relay carbon starvation signals: a SpoT-dependent pathway mediating the inhibition of DNA replication initiation, and a SpoT-independent pathway(s) that blocks morphological differentiation...|$|R

In this investigation, environmental and physiologic factors affecting growth and <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> formation in C. septicum were studied over a range of dilution rates (D = 0. 02 to 0. 65 h− 1) in glucose-limited, glucose-excess, and mucin-limited chemostats. Cellular differentiation was observed at low specific growth rates, irrespective of the carbon and energy source, showing that swarming occurred in response to nutrient depletion. Differential expression of virulence determinants was detected in swarm cells. Hemolysin was secreted by short motile rods but not swarm cells, whereas in cultures grown with glucose, only swarm cells formed DNase, hyaluronidase, and neuraminidase. However, neuraminidase and, to a lesser degree, hyaluronidase were induced in short motile rods in mucin-limited cultures. Both swarm cells and short rods were cytotoxic to Vero cells. Mucin was chemotaxic to C. septicum, and large amounts of mucin-degrading enzymes (β-galactosidase, N-acetyl β-glucosaminidase, glycosulfatase, and neuraminidase) were produced. Synthesis of these enzymes was catabolite regulated. In chemostat experiments, glycosulfatase secretion occurred only in swarm cells at low dilution rates in mucin-limited cultures. Determinations of oligosaccharide utilization demonstrated that N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine were the main carbon sources for C. septicum in mucin.

40|$|The {{bacterium}} Proteus mirabilis exhibits {{an unusual}} form of motility on solid surfaces known as swarming.

Following a brief resting period, swarm cells are again formed and the cycle is repeated;Microscopic studies of swarming showed that extracellular slime is always associated with migrating swarm cells. In this study, improved methods of observing slime associated with swarming cells are presented. The use of toluidine blue O to stain slime on impression mounts and a fixation method consisting of hot sulfuric acid and sodium borate provide new ways to visualize slime. Extracellular slime of P. mirabilis IM 47 was isolated by centrifugation. A biological assay was developed based on the ability of isolated slime to promote swarming of a nonswarming mutant of P. mirabilis. For the assay, polycarbonate filters were dipped in the test material (slime) and placed on an agar plate to dry. The nonswarming mutant was inoculated onto the filter and swarming was examined after incubation at 35 C for 24 h. Biological activity was also found in slime which was purified with protease and ion exchange chromatography. Chemical assays showed that purification produced increased quantities of anthrone-positive carbohydrates and uronic acids;The role of slime in swarming is presently unclear. Slime may promote swarming by providing a reduced surface tension and lubricity necessary for <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> migration. Many functional similarities appear to exist between the slime of swarming P. mirabilis and the slime of gliding bacteria...|$|E

We present data {{showing that the}} ability to invade host urothelial cells is closely coupled to swarming, a form of cyclical multicellular behavior in which vegetative bacteria differentiate into hyperflagellated, filamentous swarm cells capable of coordinated and rapid population migration. Entry into the human urothelial cell line EJ/ 28 by P. mirabilis U 6450 isolated at different stages throughout the swarming cycle was measured by the antibiotic protection assay method and confirmed by electron microscopy. Differentiated filaments entered urothelial cells within 30 min and were 15 -fold more invasive (ca. 0. 18 % entry in 2 h) than an equivalent dry weight of vegetative cells isolated before differentiation, which attained only ca. 0. 012 % entry in the 2 -h assay. The invasive ability of P. mirabilis was modulated in parallel with flagellin levels throughout two cycles of swarming. Septation and division of intracellular swarm cells produced between 50 and 300 vegetative bacteria per human cell, compared with 4 to 12 intracellular bacteria after incubation with vegetative cells. Transposon (Tn 5) mutants of P. mirabilis with specific defects in motility and multicellular behavior were compared with the wild-type for the ability to invade. Mutants which lacked flagella (nonmotile nonswarming) were entirely noninvasive, and those which were motile but defective in <b>swarm</b> <b>cell</b> formation (motile nonswarming) were 25 -fold less invasive than wild-type vegetative cells. Mutants with defects in the coordination of multicellular migration and the temporal control of consolidation (cyclical reversion of swarm cells to vegetative cells) were reduced ca. 3 - to 12 -fold in the ability to enter urothelial cells. In contrast, a nonhemolytic transposon mutant which swarmed normally retained over 80 % of wild-type invasive ability. Swarm cells and early consolidation cells were at least 10 -fold more cytolytic than vegetative cells {{as a result of their}} high-level production of hemolysin...|$|E

40|$|In a {{developmental}} strategy designed to efficiently exploit and colonize sparse oligotrophic environments, Caulobacter crescentus cells divide asymmetrically, yielding a motile <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> and a sessile stalked cell. After a relatively fixed time period under typical culture conditions, the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> differentiates into a replicative stalked cell. Since differentiation into the stalked cell type is irreversible, {{it is likely}} that environmental factors such as the availability of essential nutrients would influence the timing of the decision to abandon motility and adopt a sessile lifestyle. We measured two different parameters in nutrient-limited chemostat cultures, biomass concentration and the ratio of nonstalked to stalked cells, over a range of flow rates and found that nitrogen limitation significantly extended the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> life span. The transcriptional profiling experiments de-scribed here generate the first comprehensive picture of the global regulatory strategies used by an oligotroph when confronted with an environment where key macronutrients are sparse. The pattern of regulated gene expression in nitrogen- and carbon-limited cells shares some features in common with most copiotrophic organisms, but critical differences suggest that Caulobacter, and perhaps other oligotrophs, have evolved regulatory strategies to deal distinctly with their natural environments. We hypothesize that nitrogen limita-tion extends the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> lifetime by delaying the onset of a sequence of differentiation events, which when initiated by the correct combination of external environmental cues, sets the <b>swarmer</b> <b>cell</b> on a path t...|$|R
