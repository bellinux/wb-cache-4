40|$|This {{article will}} be {{concerned}} with the question whether the books of Job and Ecclesiastes {{can be viewed as}} (postmodern) wisdom in revolt or not. Three questions underlie this title: firstly, are the books of Job and Ecclesiastes wisdom books? Secondly, if so, is their wisdom revolutionary in nature? And thirdly, are there any similarities between the thoughts of Job and Ecclesiastes {{on the one hand and}} that of postmodern thinkers on the other hand? It will be argued that there are various similarities to be cited between the ideas of the ancient wisdom writers of Job and Ecclesiastes and more recent postmodern thinkers. This does not, however, necessarily justify a postmodern tag for the books of Job and Ecclesiastes, but points to a <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> development between the ancient societies of Job and Ecclesiastes and the present-day societies. Such similarities are viewed as a clear indication of the meaningful role which Old Testament wisdom, or wisdom in revolt for that matter, can play in current intellectual and theological debates.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between}} Godwin and Wordsworth will have to do primarily with the expressed opinions of each of the two men. For that reason, in the development of this thesis, principal effort was expended on a careful and, in the main, independent examination of the literary productions of each writer. The writings themselves, rather than a voluminous bibliography, furnish the most satisfying source and the most efficient tool for the study here undertaken. The discussion would be incomplete, however, if it were not to take cognizance of the causal factors that contributed, directly or indirectly, to the relationship which resulted in parallelism of thought and expression in the two men. It is here that several of Wordsworth 2 ̆ 7 s biographers have rendered valuable service. The fruits of their investigations could not be ignored in this essay, which is indebted especially to the splendid factual and interpretative material offered by Ernest de Selincourt, Huch I 2 ̆ 7 Anson Fausset, Herbert Read, and Emile Legouis. For a convenient survey of the <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> and expression of Godwin and Wordsworth, a summary of parallels has been submitted in the appendix on page 123...|$|E
40|$|The general {{theme of}} change in {{philosophy}} over time is due to traditional customs and beliefs failing to regulate society. This theme drove both John Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s Progressive Movement {{and the creation of}} the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (1989) by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The remarkable <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> between Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s writings and the Standards is the basis for this paper. The point of view is from the Standards looking back to find Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s similar ideas. Although Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s views of mathematics per se are not extensively explicated, his overarching views on learning content resonate strongly with those of the NCTM document. There is common focus on the individual, learning as doing, developing power of each student, the use of worthwhile tasks, views on curriculum, and the need for more experienced teachers and peers to stretch and pull the student into arenas of exploration. If John Dewey were alive today, what would he have to say about the standards movement? There are a number of types of standards under consideration, with a variety of characteristics. In particular, what would he think of the NCTM C 2 ̆ 6 E Standards? What is the background of the NCTM Standards? Where would Dewey agree with the NCTM Standards? Where would Dewey disagree with the NCTM Standards? There are four main sections comprising the body of this paper: the issue, the epistemology, the impetus for change, and the vision. The idea of standards, {{what does it mean to}} know, why change, and what are the related goals...|$|E

40|$|Little {{detailed}} {{study has been}} made of the <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> between Byron and Rousseau. At first glance, the men and their works ostensibly appear too different to warrant investigation. Analysis of the third Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and La Nouvelle Héloïse, however, suggests that Byron and Rousseau had very similar views of nature, society and the individual. Furthermore, Byron was intensely aware of Rousseau while composing the third Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. [...] Throughout his life, Byron vehemently denied any resemblance between himself and Rousseau. La Nouvelle Héloïse and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto III, however, reveal that their authors viewed nature as beneficent, society as corrupt and imagination as a liberating force for the individual. During the summer of 1816 when Byron completed Canto III, he was drawn into an imaginative communion with Rousseau. Visiting Rousseau's Swiss homeland, Byron deepened his appreciation of the eighteenth-century Genevan. Like Rousseau, Byron was profoundly affected by the natural beauty of the Alpine landscape. Reading La Nouvelle Héloïse and using it as a guide book for his boat tour with Shelley of Lake Geneva, Byron was imaginatively stimulated into a Rousseauistic reverie. Seeing first-hand the places vividly depicted in La Nouvelle Héloïse, Byron was frequently led into reflection on Rousseau's fictional characters and often related their experiences to his own. [...] In this thesis, I examine Childe Harold, Canto III, with emphasis on the biographical facts of Byron's Swiss experience in 1816. I discuss the similarities between Canto III and Rousseau's novel and conclude that Byron's intense awareness of Rousseau's ideas helped significantly in shaping the poetry of Canto III. Byron's viewpoint while in Switzerland and the ideas expressed in Canto III prove that his Swiss experience amounted to an imaginative journey into the world of Rousseau's novel...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{outcomes}} of the Romantic period, {{an interest in the}} relationship of the arts remains a widely recognized yet rarely examined field of study. Music and literature seemed to develop a particular kinship, yet to identify the exact relationship is as difficult as defining Romanticism itself. In this study, I attempt to do both. In exploring the concept of Romanticism, its paradoxical development from Classicism is examined through the comparison of six great composers and poets of the period. By tracing the <b>similarities</b> and differences <b>in</b> style of Beethoven/Wordsworth, Schumann/Keats, and Brahms/Tennyson, hopefully a clearer understanding of the evolution of Romanticism is achieved. These artists, although creating through different mediums, address the apparent rejection of Neoclassicism, the apex of Romanticism, and the realization of its limitations. The result is the revelation of the paradox of Romanticism. For each artist, the realization of the Romantic spirit presents contrasts. Ultimately, the rejection of Neoclassic thought becomes as important to Romanticism as its dependence on Neoclassic form. These six artists achieved success not only because of their talents but also because of their acknowledgement of this fact. In this study, I trace their development through {{the rise and fall of}} Romanticism as more than instances of shared techniques or borrowed texts; the <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought,</b> poetic vision, and style shared by these artists are explored as well. The paradox of Romanticism is revealed through the interrelationship of poetry and music...|$|R
40|$|This textual and {{linguistic}} commentary, {{which is the}} first of any kind in English on the Historiae of Quintus Curtius, discusses the uncertainties presented by the text as transmitted, evaluates the solutions offered by previous scholars and suggests some new emendations. Curtius' grammar, syntax {{and linguistic}} usage are examined in comparison with the standards accepted before the time of Livy and the developments thereafter. His expression and style are compared with those of other authors, with special reference to Livy and Curtius' near-contemporary, Seneca the Younger. Literary analogies with other authors in all periods are given and <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> and style are also noticed. Curtius' treatment of his subject-matter is considered {{in the light of the}} parallel accounts of Arrian, Diodorus Siculus, and in some places Plutarch and Justin, and questions of historical fact are discussed where they arise from the text of Curtius himself. Two appendices are included, of which the first deal with the dispute over the date of composition of the work, and Curtius' identity. It presents the case for identifying the Princeps referred to at X 9. 1 - 6 with Claudius and suggests that Curtius composed the Historiae during the early years of that emperor's reign. The second appendix deals with our author's vocabulary and his use of participles and infinitives, and demonstrates some aspects of his contribution to, and place within, the evolution of the Latin language since the time of Livy. The apparatus criticus is derivative; the commentary, except insofar as every such work must take account of previous scholarship, is entirely original. <p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analysis}} of the leibnizian applications of conceptof analogy as well as the analogical reasoning is approached. Thus, the analysis tries to show that the leibnizian concept of analogy is based on the idea of structural similarity. As a consequence of such consideration,two basic ways in which Leibniz applies analogical reasoning are examined. The first way has a conjectural character and is rather heuristic, whereas the second constitutes, at least in intention, a kind of demonstrative analogicalreasoning, since it tries to prove its conclusions for a determined theoreticaldomain by applying a transfer principle, which is itself founded on the identity of structural properties. This procedure is exemplified by outlining the leibnizian view on contingent truths. In this way, the paper concludesby pointing out the theoretical relevance of the concept of <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> theleibnizian <b>thought...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how faculty {{curriculum}} committees from different disciplines moved through a major curriculum change process from content-focused curriculum to outcomes-based curriculum. Data was gathered through direct observations, committee member interviews, a questionnaire, and the Gregorc Style Delineator from four curriculum committees representing different disciplines. This qualitative study generated the following findings: I. The stages of outcomes-based curriculum development can be predicted and are common across all disciplines. The five stages include Immersion, Creation, Negotiation, Revision, and Submission. 2. A knowledgeable outcomes-based curriculum facilitator can successfully immerse a committee in designing curriculum without first "training" them in outcomes-based theory. 3. On an outcomes-based curriculum planning committee, knowledge of member differences and <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> process, academic preparation and workplace experience enhances the work. 4. Interest in interdisciplinary connection emerges naturally as a result of faculty dialogue about student learning outcomes. 5. Outcomes-based curriculum planning increases collaboration and reduces competition between programs and campuses in a multiple campus institution. 6. The dialogue inherent in outcomes-based curriculum planning renews faculty member's energy and commitment, as the dialogue builds relationships through shared ideas. Recommendations from this study include: 1. Make curriculum committees aware of the common stages involved in the outcomes-based curriculum design work. Emphasize the continuous improvement nature of the process. 2. Rather than attempting to "train" faculty in outcome-based curriculum reconstruction methods, build institutional capacity by preparing faculty leaders who can function as curriculum development facilitators. Provide extensive preparation for faculty facilitators so that they can facilitate the work. 3. Make planning groups aware of member differences by using such tools as a questionnaire and Gregorc Style Delineator. Provide a structure for dialogue to occur within the committees on an ongoing basis...|$|R
40|$|Bernard Lonergan's {{understanding}} of the developing subject is conceived concretely {{in terms of the}} broadening horizon of the subject towards a real apprehension of the human good, from particular good to the notion of value. I will argue that Lonergan's {{understanding of}} the developing subject is a complex phenomenon rooted in the self-transcending existential subject's freedom and apprehension of value, which precedes decision-making and which orients the course of one's personal development. An analysis of Bernard Lonergan's {{understanding of the}} development of the subject reveals that he drew heavily from the psychologist Abraham Maslow. My main purpose is to retrieve Lonergan's insights on personal development by comparing to what extent his thinking is similar to and different from that of Maslow's. I will argue that although there are <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> their <b>thought,</b> the perspectives they offer regarding human nature are reached from within very different horizons, and therefore their understanding of personal development, although complimentary, is foundationally different. In the final chapter I offer suggestions for merging the two thinkers' <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> order to provide a more complete understanding of personal development which takes seriously considerations from both psychology and theology...|$|R
40|$|I. Male {{heterosexual}} prostitution, women paying men {{for sexual}} services, is seldom mentioned {{in discussions of}} prostitution. While virtually ignored by social scientists, it has received attention in several recent magazine and newspaper articles. This paper reports the results of analyses of this literature. A typology of prostitute roles based on type of payment and organizational affiliation is presented and discussed. Control theory is used to explain the rise in female sexual deviance. II. This paper investigates the relevance of gender for labelling {{and its effect on}} adolescent delinquent self-conceptions in a sample of high school students. The sensitivity of females to the attitudes of others in their self-concept formation served {{as the basis for the}} formulation of several hypotheses regarding delinquent identity development and its consequences for male and female self-esteem. Boys were more likely than girls to have delinquent identities and to feel they were labelled as delinquent. The association between delinquent identities and labels varied by gender. Among those labelled as delinquent, girls are more likely than boys to have a delinquent identity. Both delinquent identities and labels have negative effects on self-esteem. Strain theory was used to explain the conditional effect of father's education. III. Large numbers of married women have entered the workforce during the past twenty years. This paper investigates effects of social position on choice of significant others in a sample of married couples. It is argued that working increases a person's social network of significant others, that not working results in a smaller network of significant others and greater dependence on them and the institutions with which they are associated. Female self-esteem is more dependent on marital quality. Spouse appreciation and marital quality are related to self-esteem, though the association varies by the self-esteem measure used. Marital quality and spouse appreciation are important for male and female self-esteem. These findings are consistent with previous research which shows that for both men and women similar social positions produce <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> and behavior...|$|R
40|$|The main {{contours}} {{of the history of}} philosophical and scientific conceptions of law and individuality are portrayed. This includes an account of perspectives and views found in ancient Greece, the Graeco-Roman world, the medieval speculation and, via the Renaissance, in early modern developments that were continued in the Enlightenment era, in Romanticism and historicism, and were eventually manifested in the linguistic turn. What is important for a proper understanding of modern law conceptions is an acknowledgement of the all-pervading influence of modern nominalism. This orientation was characterised by employing two related distinctions, namely the distinction between conceptual knowledge and concept-transcending knowledge, and that between rationalism and irrationalism. From a systematic point of view, various aspectual terms provide a frame of reference for the idea of a law of nature as a compound basic concept of science. Special attention is given to the nature of normative principles and physical laws.

40|$|This article compares various {{elements}} of Ibn Khaldūn’s and Douglass C. North’s {{thoughts on the}} role of institutions in influencing or forcing economic change. There are a number of interesting <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> ideas, <b>thoughts,</b> approaches, and methodologies, which prove that New Institutional Economics may actually mirror much of (and can benefit from) Ibn Khaldūn’s fourteenth century ideas than was previously thought. Both Ibn Khaldūn’s continuum of badāwah to ḥaḍārah and North’s theory on changes from informal to formal institutions lead to the same fundamental conclusions: (i) change is incremental as it is a result in small cumulative changes in the cost-benefit outcomes of the market agents over time, and therefore (ii) economic performance inevitably depends on the existence and effectiveness of formal institutions that alter those outcomes. It is also noted that ‘aṣabiyyah or group feeling, another cornerstone of Ibn Khaldūn’s thought, corresponds perfectly to North’s treatise that social cohesion and institutional efficiency are more important than the amount of resource endowment in bringing about economic development and change. In addition, Ibn Khaldūn’s views on the government’s commercial activities are reviewed in the study in light of North’s transaction costs and property rights framework.   </p...|$|R
40|$|By {{utilizing}} the library research method, this paper aims at analysing {{the influences of}} Shah Waliullah on the thoughts of Sayyid Abul A‘la Mawdudi. Shah Waliullah (1703 - 1762) {{was one of those}} great Islamic thinkers who by the virtue of their knowledge and activities helped reconstruct the sociopolitical and religious <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> Islam. Waliullah bridged between medieval and modern Islam in India. He was a socio-political reformer, a great Islamic scholar, a Sufi, a reformist and an Islamic missionary worker, all at the same time. Mawdudi (1903 - 1979) was greatly influenced by the thought and teachings of Waliullah. He was an expounder of Islam during the 20 th century. Both of them have presented Islam as a complete code of life with solutions to all problems faced by mankind. In line with Waliullah’s thought, Mawdudi chalked out a strategy to establish an Islamic State and initiated a powerful movement to translate Islamic ideology into a realizable term for the reconstruction of socio-political life in accordance with Islamic ideology. However, Mawdudi did not accept every thought of Waliullah uncritically. He disagreed with Waliullah on several issues including Islamic mysticism. Yet, <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> their <b>thoughts</b> are overwhelming. Both initiated a process of socio-political change in their respective times, inspired by Islamic ideal.

40|$|Chinese state {{capitalism}} {{has been}} treated as essentially synonymous with state-owned enterprises (SOEs). But drawing a stark distinction between SOEs and privately owned enterprises (POEs) misperceives the reality of China’s institutional environment {{and its impact on}} the formation and operation of large enterprises of all types. We challenge the “ownership bias” of prevailing analyses of Chinese firms by exploring the blurred boundary between SOEs and POEs in China. We argue that the Chinese state has less control over SOEs and more control over POEs than its ownership interest in the firms suggests. Our analysis indicates that Chinese state capitalism can be better explained by capture of the state than by ownership of enterprise. We explain the mechanisms of capture in China and argue that due to China’s institutional environment, large, successful firms—regardless of ownership— exhibit substantial <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> areas commonly <b>thought</b> to distinguish SOEs from POEs: market dominance, receipt of state subsidies, proximity to state power, and execution of the state’s policy objectives.

40|$|Public {{places in}} modern urban areas play an undeniable role in {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} life within cities. Like any other urban space, public places need to be carefully planned and designed to perform their task as a venue for social interactions in cities. Consequently, for a space to present itself in a unique manner, it needs special setting and feature. Therefore, Questions are raised as for the criteria of successful public space’s environment. This study examines the features, which creates the environment of a space and influence human behavior within it, through categorizing the features into physical feature such as edge, size, landscape, and non-physical such as sound, smell and illumination. The categories are structured to form a three level hierarchical model, which comprised of features, criteria, and sub-criteria. The model is an outcome of literature review and current guidelines analysis. Furthermore, to identify the values of these criteria and their sub-criteria, a ranking questionnaire was developed and distributed over two groups of respondent – professionals and young people. The respondents are assumed to share the same aim of having functional public space within their urban environment. The result of the responses showed that professionals and young people have evaluated the criteria in different manner; although there was <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> their <b>thoughts.</b> Nevertheless, the study found that, some of the important criteria according to the respondents were not addressed in the current guideline. Hence, this study recommends some additional guidelines regarding the non-physical criteria of spaces, such as sound, smell and illumination in public place, for the current documents to include...|$|R
40|$|This study explores <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> the <b>thought</b> {{world of}} the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Thomas. Particular {{attention}} {{is devoted to the}} role that the 'poor' and 'poverty' play in both documents. For the Epistle of James it is 'the poor in the world that God has chosen to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom' (Ja 2 : 5). In a similar vein, in the Gospel of Thomas the kingdom is promised to those who have embraced the poverty of a radical life-style: 'Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven' (GTh 54). This outlook betrays a basic ethos adopted toward the world. In both the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Thomas the relationship to the world ultimately determines one's relationship to the kingdom or to God. For the Epistle of James the very definition of religion demands that one keep 'oneself unstained from the world' (Ja 1 : 27) and that 'friendship with the world' is enmity with God (Ja 4 : 4). For the Gospel of Thomas the rejection of the world involves a radical ethos that embraces an intinerant life ('Be passersby' (GTh 42 J), which includes a rejection of wealth (GTh 63). 'If you do not abstain from the world, you will not find the kingdom' (GTh 27). It is argued that the Gospel of Thomas and the Epistle of James reflect traditional sayings that endorse a similar ethos of radical discipleship.

40|$|Every {{multicellular}} animal must {{undergo the}} process of gastrulation during embryonic development to form the primary cell layers – the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. During mesoderm formation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, cells along the embryo’s ventral side change shape and move into the embryo. Understanding these mechanisms is important because they are also involved in other mechanisms such as cancer cell metastasis. However, the exact dynamics and patterns of these cell movements often vary between organisms {{due to differences in}} the expression or roles of critical genes. My thesis therefore aimed to gain insight into how these important cellular mechanisms change over the course of evolution. To do this, I intended to compare the well-characterized expression and role of t 48 and mist in D. melanogaster gastrulation to their unknown expression in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, a more divergent insect. I first created probes that were used to reveal gene expression in A. gambiae embryos with a colored stain. Due to time limitations, only the mist probe could be applied to the A. gambiae embryos. Preliminary results suggest that the probes worked well and that mist is expressed during A. gambiae embryonic development. This is the first known evidence of mist expression in A. gambiae embryos, indicating potential <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> what is <b>thought</b> to be divergent mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Two protein {{components}} were isolated {{in a highly}} purified state from a toxic fraction from the navy (haricot) bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). One, a lectin, strongly agglutinated horse erythrocytes and leucocytes, agglutination being readily observable with both types of cell at a lectin concentration of 4 μg/ml. The other component (component 1), although possessing some <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> composition, was <b>thought</b> to be non-agglutinating or, at most, only very weakly so. Component 1 had a mol. wt. of about 143000 and a subunit mol. wt. of about 37000, suggesting a tetrameric structure probably with identical subunits. Alanine was the only N-terminal amino acid identified and the molecule was notable in being devoid of tryptophan and cysteine, low in methionine and high in leucine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. The lectin was somewhat smaller (mol. wt. about 114000) and apparently also composed of four identical subunits of mol. wt. about 30000. Dansylation showed that arginine occupied the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain. Aspartic acid, serine, threonine and leucine were the predominant amino acids of the lectin, and the sulphur-containing amino acids were entirely absent. Both constituents were glycoproteins and the compositions of the carbohydrate portions (4. 9 % for component 1 and 8. 1 % for the lectin) were generally similar, consisting of mannose and glucosamine with smaller amounts of glucose and traces of xylose and arabinose...|$|R
40|$|Isolated {{reports have}} long {{suggested}} a <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> content and <b>thought</b> processes across mind wandering (MW) during waking, and dream mentation during sleep. This overlap has encouraged speculation that both ‘daydreaming’ and dreaming may engage similar brain mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we systematically examined published first-person experiential reports of MW and dreaming and found many similarities: in both states, content is largely audiovisual and emotional, follows loose narratives tinged with fantasy, is {{strongly related to}} current concerns, draws on long-term memory, and simulates social interactions. Both states are also characterized by a relative lack of meta-awareness. To relate first-person reports to neural evidence, we compared meta-analytic data from numerous functional neuroimaging (PET, fMRI) studies of the default mode network (DMN, with high chances of MW) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (with high chances of dreaming). Our findings show large overlaps in activation patterns of cortical regions: similar to MW/DMN activity, dreaming and REM sleep activate regions implicated <b>in</b> self-referential <b>thought</b> and memory, including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial temporal lobe structures, and posterior cingulate. Conversely, in REM sleep numerous PFC executive regions are deactivated, even beyond levels seen during waking MW. We argue that dreaming {{can be understood as}} an ‘intensified’ version of waking MW: though the two share many similarities, dreams tend to be longer, more visual and immersive, and to more strongly recruit numerous key hubs of the DMN. Further, whereas MW recruits fewer PFC regions than goal-directed thought, dreaming appears to be characterized by an even deeper quiescence of PFC regions involved in cognitive control and metacognition, with a corresponding lack of insight and meta-awareness. We suggest, then, that dreaming amplifies the same features that distinguish MW from goal-directed waking thought...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> music preferences in the formation and discontinuation of friendships over a one-year period. Questionnaire data were gathered from 283 Dutch same-sex mutual best friends (Mean age = 12. 97) in two waves with a one-year interval. Results show consistent evidence for high <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> specific music dimensions among friends at both waves. Moderate <b>similarity</b> was found <b>in</b> the overall patterning of preferences for music genres at both waves, even after controlling for <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> social background. Girls {{were found to be}} more similar in their preference for Rock than boys. Specific music <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> more non-mainstream music dimensions and overall music similarity at Wave 1 were related to selecting a new friend at Wave 2. However, <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> music preferences was not related to the discontinuation of an existing friendship at Wave 2. Thus, results suggest that <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> music preferences is related to friendship formation, and not to friendship discontinuation...|$|R
