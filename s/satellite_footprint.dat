50|$|Potential {{drawbacks}} {{of satellite}} broadband systems include {{the lack of}} security of the download data (which can be received by anyone within the <b>satellites</b> <b>footprint)</b> and the delay inherent in the connection - as both upload and download data must follow the route from the ground to the satellite (located some 35785 km above the Earth) and back, there is a minimum total delay or latency (depending on {{the location of the}} receive site) of about 0.5 seconds.|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} difference regarding <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints</b> is {{the repetition}} frequency of each footprint.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} perturbations {{caused by}} {{the interaction between the}} moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede and the Jovian magnetosphere propagate along magnetic field lines in the form of Alfvén waves and finally create auroral footprints in Jupiter’s polar ionosphere. Thanks to the high spatial and temporal resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope, the analysis of the footprints in the Far UV domain provides extremely valuable information on these interactions. In the case of the Io footprint, the analysis of the multiplicity of the auroral spots and of their relative motion resulted into a new understanding of the far field interaction, which involves trans-hemispheric electron beams. Consistent with the in-situ energetic electrons observations, this scenario has been later reinforced by theoretical models simulating the Alfvén wave’s propagation and the ways these waves accelerate electrons. Moreover, while the altitude and the vertical profile of the auroral emissions provide crucial information on the energy of the precipitating electrons, the measure of the shape of the different sub-structures of the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints</b> provides important clues {{about the size of the}} interaction region. The evolution of the footprint brightness is also an essential parameter for understanding the energies involved in the interaction. Finally, the study of the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints</b> can also be used for broader purposes than just the investigation of the satellite-magnetosphere interaction, such as building more accurate Jovian magnetic field models...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen dioxide {{vertical}} column density (NO 2 VCD) measurements via satellite are {{compared with a}} fine-scale regional chemistry transport model, using a new approach that considers varying <b>satellite</b> <b>footprint</b> sizes. Space-borne NO 2 VCD measurement {{has been used as}} a proxy for surface nitrogen oxide (NO x) emission, especially for anthropogenic urban emission, so accurate comparison of satellite and modeled NO 2 VCD is important in determining the future direction of NO x emission policy. The NASA Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO 2 VCD measurements, retrieved by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), are compared with a 12 km Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We found that the OMI footprint-pixel sizes are too coarse to resolve urban NO 2 plumes, resulting in a possible underestimation in the urban core and overestimation outside. In order to quantify this effect of resolution geometry, we have made two estimates. First, we constructed pseudo-OMI data using fine-scale outputs of the model simulation. Assuming the fine-scale model output is a true measurement, we then collected real OMI footprint coverages and performed conservative spatial regridding to generate a set of fake OMI pixels out of fine-scale model outputs. When compared to the original data, the pseudo-OMI data clearly showed smoothed signals over urban locations, resulting in roughly 20 – 30 % underestimation over major cities. Second, we further conducted conservative downscaling of OMI NO 2 VCDs using spatial information from the fine-scale model to adjust the spatial distribution, and also applied averaging kernel (AK) information to adjust the vertical structure. Four-way comparisons were conducted between OMI with and without downscaling and CMAQ with and without AK information. Results show that OMI and CMAQ NO 2 VCDs show the best agreement when both downscaling and AK methods are applied, with the correlation coefficient R = 0. 89. This study suggests that <b>satellite</b> <b>footprint</b> sizes might have a considerable effect on the measurement of fine-scale urban NO 2 plumes. The impact of <b>satellite</b> <b>footprint</b> resolution should be considered when using satellite observations in emission policy making, and the new downscaling approach can provide a reference uncertainty for the use of satellite NO 2 measurements over most cities...|$|E

40|$|The {{signature}} of electromagnetic {{interaction between the}} moons Io, Europa and Ganymede and the Jovian magnetosphere can be observed on Jupiter’s polar ionosphere {{in the form of}} auroral footprints. The observation campaigns carried out {{during the past few years}} by the Hubble Space Telescope in the Far UV domain provided not only a high spatial and temporal resolution but also an unprecedented System III longitude coverage. Consequently, these recent observations of the morphology and the dynamics of the footprints proved to be very powerful tools to probe these interactions. For example, the locations of the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints</b> have been used as a valuable constraint for building Jovian magnetic field models. Moreover, analysis of the multiplicity of the Io footprint spots as well as their relative motion lead to new conclusions on the electron acceleration processes. The altitude of the Io footprint has also been used to infer the typical energy of the impinging electrons. Finally, the study of the three-dimensional shape and of the brightness of the different sub-structures of the footprints provides important clues on the processes at play between Io and the Jovian ionosphere. On the theoretical side, considerable efforts have also been recently carried out in order to model the propagation of the Alfvén waves generated at Io and the subsequent acceleration of auroral electrons. Coupled with HST images, radio decametric measurements and in situ data from the Galileo spacecraft, these advances provide a brand new understanding of the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aurorae are the {{atmospheric}} signatures of energetic processes taking place {{far in the}} magnetosphere. One {{of the most important}} results brought by high resolution imaging of the UV aurorae at Jupiter is the realization that there isn’t such a thing as «the aurora» at Jupiter; as these light emissions appear to arise from a variety of processes. Some are related to the interaction of the magnetospheric plasma with the moons (the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints).</b> Others are linked with the radial motion of flux tubes through centrifugal instabilities (the injection auroral signatures). Some diffuse emissions are connected with wave-particle interaction (the equatorward diffuse emissions). Another feature is associated with the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling (the main emission/oval). Some auroral spots are related to internally driven reconnection (the polar dawn spots). Finally, the polar-most emissions remain to be understood and this list is still incomplete. In order to illustrate the discrepancies between these various features, I will show a set of recent results derived from the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope observations. For example, I will compare the vertical profile of <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints</b> and the main emissions, and show that the energy population of the precipitating particles varies from feature to feature. Moreover, even within a single feature, spatial variations do exist. As an example, I will characterize the dawn-dusk brightness discrepancy of the main emissions and discuss its implication regarding the magnetospheric currents. And finally, the dynamics of the features also helps differentiating one type of aurora from another. This will be shown through the description of the morphological evolution of the transient flares in the polar region...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of permanent soil moisture measurement networks are nowadays providing the means for validating new remotely sensed soil moisture estimates such as those provided by the ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. Two types of in situ measurement networks can be found: small-scale (100 – 10000 km 2), which provide multiple ground measurements within a single <b>satellite</b> <b>footprint,</b> and large-scale (> 10000 km 2), which contain a single point observation per <b>satellite</b> <b>footprint.</b> This work {{presents the results of}} a comprehensive spatial and temporal validation of a long-term (January, 2010 to June, 2014) dataset of SMOS-derived soil moisture estimates using two in situ networks within the Duero basin (Spain). The first one is the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS), which has been extensively applied for validation of soil moisture remote sensing observations, including SMOS. REMEDHUS can be considered within the small-scale network group (1300 km 2). The other network started from an existing meteorological network from the Castilla y León region, where soil moisture probes were incorporated in 2012. This network can be considered within the large-scale group (65000 km 2). Results from comparison to in situ show that the new reprocessed L 2 product (v 5. 51) improves the accuracy of former soil moisture retrievals, making them suitable for developing new L 3 products. Validation based on comparisons between dense/sparse networks showed that temporal patterns on soil moisture are well reproduced, whereas spatial patterns are difficult to depict given the different spatial representativeness of ground and satellite observations...|$|E

If the number of the users of high-precision GNSS positioning increases as a result of decreasing prices, such a crowdsourced dataset will have wide potentials including geophysical applications (Foster et al. 2012; Ichikawa et al. 2013; Roggenbuck et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|The bulk {{morphology}} of Jupiter's and Saturn's UV aurorae is conveniently {{divided into}} three components: 1) the main emission (main oval), 2) the <b>satellites</b> auroral <b>footprints</b> (equatorward of the main emission) : Io, Europa and Ganymede for Jupiter and Enceladus for Saturn, 3) the polar emissions (poleward of the main emission). This schematic view is already providing useful information on the giant planets aurorae. However, a quick inspection of HST and Cassini UV images directly shows that this simplified classification does not really match the complex morphology of the auroral emissions. As an example, {{in the case of}} Jupiter's UV aurorae, it appears that the main emission is not forming an oval, not even a closed shape; it is far from uniform and its position and size vary with time and depend on the viewing geometry. A secondary emission appears equatorward of the main emission and many small scale features regularly appear, some of them periodically. <b>Satellites</b> auroral <b>footprints</b> themselves appear to be much more intricate than predicted by present models. These footprints are actually multiple, their location and number vary periodically with time and with the satellites orbital longitude. The polar emissions are also much more complicated than predicted. Each of the above effects is related to a specific physical phenomenon in the atmosphere, the magnetosphere, or even in the planet's interior. For instance, the spatial distribution of the <b>satellites</b> auroral <b>footprints</b> made it possible to demonstrate the existence of a magnetic field anomaly near the surface of Jupiter's northern hemisphere. Observations which might appear insignificant, like the multiplicity of the <b>satellites</b> <b>footprints</b> or their periodicity are actually extremely valuable because they reveal the complexity of the interaction, in this case between a moon and the magnetospheric plasma of the planet around which it is orbiting. The same applies to small scale auroral structures which depict crucial magnetospheric processes like hot plasma injection, flux-tube interchange or magnetic reconnection mechanisms. The growing HST and Cassini databases are shedding new light on the origin of Jupiter's and Saturn's aurorae. Mechanisms that we thought could be taken for granted may even be challenged...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{features}} of the Giant planets’ aurorae are very special spots which move in a very distinct manner compared with the remaining of the aurora. Indeed, these spots are magnetically connected with planetary satellites and rotate around the poles at the same pace as their parent moon. These features, called the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints,</b> are the signature of the electromagnetic interaction between the moons and the rapidly rotating magnetosphere plasma. On Jupiter, Io, Europa and Ganymede (and possibly Callisto) have their respective footprints while only the Enceladus footprint has been detected on Saturn so far. Several models {{of the interaction between}} Io and the jovian magnetosphere, from the unipolar inductor to the ideal Alfvén wings model, have been proposed well before the first observations of the footprints in 1993. However, the continuously improving technologies and observing methods gave rise to more accurate observations that challenged several aspects of these models and lead to further refinements. For example, when analyzed in detail, high resolution images of the aurorae show that the footprints of Io and Ganymede are not made of one, but several spots, and that the footprint of Io, Europa and Ganymede can be followed by an extended tail. The respective motion of these spots {{as a function of the}} orientation of the planetary magnetic field suggests that the Alfvén waves launched from these satellites accelerate the electrons in both directions along the field lines, hence doubling the number of visible spots, Moreover, studies of the <b>satellite</b> <b>footprints</b> are not only useful to unveil some key aspects of the moon-magnetosphere interactions, but they also contribute to the understanding of the whole magnetospheric system. For instance, their locations have been used as landmarks to constrain magnetic field models or to more accurately relate some auroral structures with their root region in the magnetosphere...|$|R
