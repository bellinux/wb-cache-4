The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reproductive}} behavior of <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> {{has not been}} well studied, despite their classification as a critically endangered species and the dire need for captivity breeding to return the population to its ideal size. [...] Nevertheless, much can be inferred based on information known about the {{reproductive behavior}} of other elasmobranchs. Observations show that <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> may participate in precopulatory behavior in captivity. Much of this activity involves the biting of pectoral fins known as “courtship biting.” [...] There is sexual dimorphism {{in the teeth of}} <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> with males presenting a higher mean value for both left and right rostral tooth counts. The electrosensory system is believed {{to be used in the}} courtship behavior of sawfish and other elasmobranchs. [...] Reproductively active males use the sensory organs in their saw to locate females and vice versa. [...] Once a mate has been selected, several copulations occur during which the male inserts his claspers, which are paired intromittent organs, into the female’s vagina. The claspers contain subdermal siphon sacs that provide the propulsive power for sperm transfer. It is also possible that the siphon sacs assist with sawfish sperm competition by washing away rival sperm from the female’s vagina before copulations.|$|E

50|$|Sawfishes are marine, {{euryhaline}} (moving between freshwater and saltwater), or marginal (brackish water) species, and {{are widely}} distributed across tropical and warm temperate nearshore ocean {{waters in the}} Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. They inhabit inshore coastal areas such as coastal lagoons, estuarine environments, and the lower, brackish river deltas. Young <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (P. pectinata) can have high site fidelity at specific locations within an estuarine nursery area, and this may help when changes occur in freshwater inflow. Some species are known to penetrate far into rivers and major lakes such as Lake Nicaragua.|$|E
50|$|The {{body and}} head of a sawfish are flat, and they {{spend most of their}} time lying on the sea floor. Like rays, a sawfish's mouth and {{nostrils}} are on its flat underside. The mouth is lined with small, dome-shaped teeth for eating small fish and crustaceans, which the fish sometimes swallows whole. Sawfish breathe with two spiracles just behind the eyes that draw water to the gills. The skin is covered with tiny dermal denticles that give the fish a rough texture. Sawfish are usually light grey or brown; the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> Pristis pectinata, appears olive green.|$|E

40|$|Sawfishes are {{generally}} a tropical marine and estuarine elasmobranch (shark and ray relative). All modern sawfishes {{appear to be}} more shark-like than ray-like, with only the trunk and especially the head ventrally flattened. The presence of a rostrum having laterally protruding teeth separates sawfishes from skates and rays (Figure 1). The rostrum has a saw-like appearance and hence the name of sawfish. The largetooth sawfish and the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pectinata) are similar in appearance. The two species can usually be differentiated by noting the number of teeth {{on one side of the}} rostrum. Largetooth sawfish can have between 14 and 21 rostral teeth on one edge of the saw whereas <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> usually have 23 to 34 (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998, Compagno and Last 1999). These two species can also be distinguished by observing that in largetooth sawfish the first dorsal fin originates anterior to the pelvic fins, while in <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> the first dorsal fin originates along the same axis as the pelvic fins. The pectoral fins of largetooth sawfish are proportionally larger than those of <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish.</b> Furthermore, only largetooth sawfish has a distinct lower lobe on its caudal fin (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998, Compagno and Last 1999). Maximum size of largetooth sawfish have been reported between 20 and 21. 3 feet (6. 1 - 6. 5 m) total length with weights between 1100 and 1300 pounds (500 to 600 kg) (Thorson 1976). Studies of largetooth sawfish in Lake Nicaragua (Thorson 1976) report litter sizes of 1 to 13 individuals, with a mean of 7. 3 individuals.

40|$|This status review {{summarizes}} the biological information gathered for an Endangered Species Act (ESA) {{assessment of the}} status of the largetooth sawfish (Pristis perotteti). Species are added to a Species of Concern list as a notification to the public that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has concerns about a species or population which may lead to listing under the ESA. The purpose of this list is to facilitate and encourage outside voluntary conservation efforts that act to prevent species from an ESA listing. It is the policy of NMFS to highlight these species before they are listed so that Federal and state agencies, Native American tribes, and the private sector are aware of unlisted species that could benefit from proactive conservation efforts. The following text explains the chronological history {{of the status of}} the species starting with its listing as candidate species. The largetooth sawfish was listed as a candidate species by the NMFS on June 11, 1991 (56 FR 26797), along with the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pectinata). Both species were removed from the candidates list on July, 14 1997 (62 FR 37560), but were subsequently added to the revised list published on June 23, 1999 (64 FR 33466).

40|$|Sawfish (family Pristidae) {{are among}} the most {{critically}} endangered marine fish in the world, yet very little is known about how genetic bottlenecks, genetic drift, and inbreeding depression may be affecting these elasmobranchs. In the US Atlantic, the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pectinata) has declined to 1 - 5 % of its abundance in the 1900 s, and its core distribution has contracted to southwest Florida. We used 8 polymorphic microsatellite markers to show that this remnant population still exhibits high genetic diversity in terms of average allelic richness (18. 23), average alleles per locus (18. 75, standard deviation [SD] 6. 6) and observed heterozygosity (0. 43 - 0. 98). Inbreeding is rare (mean individual internal relatedness = - 0. 02, SD 0. 14; FIS = - 0. 011, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 0. 039 to 0. 011), even though the estimated effective population size (Ne) is modest (250 - 350, 95 % CI = 142 - 955).

Of the six to seven currently recognized extant species of sawfish, the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> P. pectinata, and the largetooth sawfish, P. perotteti, are the only two species of sawfish native to North American waters. Their historical ranges extended throughout North America, with areas of greatest abundance in parts of the United States and most of the Caribbean coast of Central America. However, both species have undergone dramatic transitions in population abundance and range over the course of the last century. Incidental capture as bycatch, overexploitation by directed fisheries, increased demand in local and international trade, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic influences have led to severe declines in population abundance and loss of critical nursery habitat, leading both species to be extirpated from the majority of their native habitat and facing the threat of extinction. While essential steps have been taken to protect P. pectinata in U.

The <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pectinata) {{is one of several}} critically endangered sawfishes worldwide known to use estuaries and rivers during their early life history. In a Florida estuary designated as critical habitat by the USA government, juveniles were monitored to characterise seasonality, recruitment, and habitat use. Stretched total length ranged from 671 to 2172 mm (n = 137, mean = 1248 mm). Sawfish were captured year round. Captures of neonates with embryonic rostral sheaths allowed refinement of the size at birth (671 – 812 mm) and confirmed a protracted timing of parturition (November–July), which peaked between April and May. Although sampling occurred throughout the estuary, five locations had the greatest catch rates. Most juvenile sawfish had an affinity for water 30 °C, dissolved oxygen > 6 mg L– 1, and salinity between 18 and 30. Greater catch rates for sawfish > 1 year old were associated with shoreline habitats with overhanging vegetation such as mangroves.

40|$|Dermopristis paradoxus gen. et sp. nov., a microbothriid monogenean {{parasite}} {{from the}} skin and mouth lining of the largetooth sawfish, Pristis microdon (Elasmobranchii, Pristidae) in Australia, is described. The parasite has 2 juxtaposed testes and differs from other microbothriids in possessing a unique and unusual terminal male reproductive tract comprising a proximal and a distal tube, the latter with a conspicuous opening on the ventral surface and lacking a recognisable male copulatory organ. The <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish,</b> P. pectinata, also has a skin-parasitic microbothriid, Dermophthirioides pristidis Cheung et Nigrelli, 1983, but this parasite species has a prominent copulatory papilla. Dermopristis paradoxus also has parallel ridges with broad tops running in a roughly transverse direction across the ventral surface of the body. The ventral ridges are prominent from {{the level of the}} pharynx to the posterior region of the body. The function of the ridges is unknown. Reproductive biology, attachment and feeding in D. paradoxus are discussed. In the absence of unmounted parasite specimens for sectioning, a mounted specimen of D. paradoxus was released from the slide and successfully processed to provide serial, stained, resin sections. This useful technique is recommended to provide anatomical information in situations where only specimens on slides are available for study. Graham C. Kearn, Ian D. Whittington and Richard Evans-Gowin...|$|E
40|$|In 2003, the U. S. {{distinct}} population {{segment of}} <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pectinata {{was listed as}} endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). At that time, little was known about its habitat use patterns and, although required {{as part of the}} ESA, critical habitat could not be officially designated. Subsequently, studies were conducted that identified some of the specific habitats and environmental conditions important for the species. Facilitating recruitment into the adult population by protecting the species’ nurseries was identified in the recovery plan as the key conservation objective, which would be supported by the designation of critical habitat. The location of nurseries was determined by applying published criteria developed for identifying elasmobranch nursery areas to a decade of encounter data. These largely nontraditional data were composed primarily of encounters voluntarily reported by the public to members of the recovery team. The nursery habitats essential to the conservation of the species were identified as those adjacent to red mangroves Rhizophora mangle and euryhaline habitats with water depths ≤ 0. 9 m. Ultimately, two broad areas in southwest Florida that contain these habitats were designated as critical habitat for juvenile smalltooth sawfish: the Charlotte Harbor Estuary unit (896 km 2) and the Ten Thousand Islands/Everglades unit (2, 505 km 2) ...|$|E
