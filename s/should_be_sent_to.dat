5|$|On {{completing}} his novitiate in 1518, Vermigli took the name Peter Martyr after the thirteenth-century Dominican Saint Peter of Verona. The Lateran Congregation had recently decided that promising young ordinands <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the monastery of Saint John of Verdara in Padua to study Aristotle, so Vermigli was sent there. The University of Padua, with which Saint John of Verdera was loosely affiliated, {{was a very}} prestigious institution at the time. At Padua, Vermigli received a thorough training in Thomistic scholasticism and an appreciation for Augustine and Christian humanism. Vermigli was determined to read Aristotle in his original language {{despite the lack of}} Greek teachers, so he taught himself. He also made the acquaintance of prominent reform-minded theologians Pietro Bembo, Reginald Pole, and Marcantonio Flaminio.|$|E
5|$|When {{the head}} of the British forces in the Peninsula, Sir John Moore, was killed in the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, the British Army having been driven from the Peninsula in disarray, Wellesley sent the Secretary of War a memo insisting that a British force of no less than 30,000 British troops <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> defend and rebuild Portugal's {{military}} strength. His proposal was approved and he re-embarked to Lisbon on 14 April 1809, having been appointed to head of all British forces in Portugal on the 6 April– a motion supported by the government and King George III, as Wellesley did not hold seniority.|$|E

However, when the force of between 20 and 30 policemen entered Borovo Selo under the white flag, they were ambushed by paramilitaries and members of a local militia. Approximately 150 police arrived from Osijek and Vinkovci on buses and were deployed as reinforcements. The force dispatched from Vinkovci entered Borovo Selo and was ambushed, while the reinforcements sent from Osijek via Dalj were stopped at a roadblock north of Borovo Selo and failed to enter the village. A firefight ensued and lasted until 2:30p.m., when seven JNA armoured personnel carriers (APCs) moved into the village from Dalj. Another convoy of APCs deployed by the JNA through Borovo Naselje, just south of Borovo Selo, was stopped by a crowd of Croat women who refused to let them through.|$|E

25|$|Bourassa led French Canadian {{opposition}} to the participation in World War I, especially Robert Borden's plans to implement conscription in 1917.

25|$|Igor Gouzenko, a cipher {{clerk in}} Soviet embassy in Ottawa, {{defected}} in 1945 {{with a mass}} of documents, one of {{which led to the}} arrest of Alan Nunn May for spying. Philby recommended that Hollis rather than Archer <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Canada to interview Gouzenko although he knew Archer would be better able to do the job. Agreeing this, MI5 sent Hollis and yet it was Philby at SIS who was apprised of progress and who altered, delayed and omitted messages before passing them on to MI5. By these means, Philby stopped Archer from having any involvement in the case.|$|E
25|$|The MP {{introducing}} {{the bill will}} generally make a recommendation that the bill be considered by an appropriate Select Committee (see below). Sometimes, it will be recommended that a special Committee be formed, usually when the bill is particularly important or controversial. The House then votes {{as to whether the}} bill <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Committee for deliberation. It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the Select Committee stage even by parties which do not support it — since Select Committees can recommend amendments to bills, parties will often not make a final decision on whether to back a bill until the Second Reading.|$|E

The 1872 international match took place between England and Scotland on 30 November, with Alcock ruled out of the England side which drew 0–0 at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick through injury sustained two weeks earlier, playing for Old Harrovians against Old Etonians. Instead he represented his country as umpire, with the England captaincy awarded to Cuthbert Ottaway.|$|E

25|$|In 1757, the Seven Years' War having broken out, Cumberland {{was placed}} {{at the head of}} the Hanoverian Army of Observation, {{intended}} to defend Hanover (of which George II was Elector) from a French attack. At the Battle of Hastenbeck, near Hamelin, on 26 July 1757, Cumberland's army was defeated by the superior forces of d'Estrées. Despite seemingly having the advantage towards the end of the battle, Cumberland's forces began to retreat. Within a short time discipline had collapsed, and Cumberland's army headed northwards in total disorder. Cumberland hoped that the Royal Navy might bring him reinforcements and supplies which would allow him to regroup and counterattack, but the British mounted an expedition to Rochefort instead, despite suggestions that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> aid Cumberland.|$|E
25|$|The first {{suggestion}} that a military force <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Yukon came from Nathaniel Wallace, who put forward {{the idea in}} Parliament in February 1898. The government worked up the proposal into a formal plan, which was confirmed through an Order-in-Council on March 21. In May, Frederick Borden, the Minister of Militia and Defence, announced that a 200-strong force would be deployed to Fort Selkirk, the nominal capital of the territory, to reinforce the mounted police. One of the arguments put forward in favour of this option {{was that it was}} much cheaper than sending additional police, who enjoyed higher pay than soldiers. In addition to its primary role in maintaining Canadian sovereignty, Borden stated that the force would, if necessary, assist in maintaining law and order.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 24 March 1603 Queen Elizabeth died without naming a successor. A few days {{beforehand}} De Vere at his house at Hackney had entertained the Earl of Lincoln, a nobleman known for erratic and violent behaviour similar to his host's. Lincoln reported that after dinner De Vere spoke of the Queen's impending death, claiming that the peers of England should decide the succession, and suggested that since Lincoln had 'a nephew of the blood royal…Lord Hastings', he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> France to find allies to support this claim. Lincoln relayed this conversation to Sir John Peyton, Lieutenant of the Tower, who, knowing how physically and financially infirm De Vere was, refused to take Lincoln's report as {{a serious threat to}} King James' accession.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{received}} {{the news of}} Philiphaugh on 28 September 1645, and gave orders that the west should be abandoned, the prince of Wales <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> France, and Goring should bring up what forces he could to the Oxford region. On 4 October Charles himself reached Newark (whither he had marched from Denbigh after revictualling Chester and suffering the defeat of Rowton Heath). The intention to go to Montrose was of course given up, at any rate for the present, and he was merely waiting for Goring and the Royalist militia of the west, each {{in its own way}} a broken reed to lean upon. A hollow reconciliation was patched up between Charles and Rupert, and the court remained at Newark for over a month. Before it set out to return to Oxford another Royalist force had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In extrapulmonary TB, {{surgery is}} often {{needed to make}} a {{diagnosis}} (rather than to effect a cure): surgical excision of lymph nodes, drainage of abscesses, tissue biopsy, etc. are all examples of this. Samples taken for TB culture <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the laboratory in a sterile pot with no additive (not even water or saline) and must arrive in the laboratory as soon as possible. Where facilities for liquid culture are available, specimens from sterile sites may be inoculated directly following the procedure: this may improve the yield. In spinal TB, surgery is indicated for spinal instability (when there is extensive bony destriction) or when the spinal cord is threatened. Therapeutic drainage of tuberculous abscesses or collections is not routinely indicated and will resolve with adequate treatment. In TB meningitis, hydrocephalus is a potential complication and may necessitate the insertion of a ventricular shunt or drain.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 1916 {{a meeting}} {{took place at}} Rosyth between Jellicoe, Beatty and First Sea Lord Jackson to discuss {{the future of the}} battlecruiser fleet.

It was decided that the 5th Battle Squadron (BS) would be temporarily attached to the battlecruisers to make up their numbers. Although the battlecruisers used different standing orders to the Grand fleet, Beatty did not meet with Evan-Thomas, nor send him copies of their standing orders. This was to become an issue later, when the ships took part as one unit in the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
