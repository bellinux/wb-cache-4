In such context, replication is a key issue in order to achieve acceptable performance and availability levels. However, the inherent characteristics of ad-hoc networks bring up new challenges for which most conventional replication systems don’t provide an appropriate response. Namely, the lack of a preexisting infrastructure, the high topological dynamism of these networks, the relatively low bandwidth of wireless links, as well as the limited storage and energy resources of mobile devices are issues that strongly affect the efficiency of any distributed system intended to provide ubiquitous information sharing. Such aspects demand solutions that are able to offer high availability, in spite of the expected frequent network partitions and device <b>suspension</b> <b>periods.</b> Pessimistic approaches for replication are usually too restrictive solutions to achieve such requirement.

Aviat Space Environ Med 2012; 83 : 1176 - 80. Background: Rat tail suspension is an accepted method to create experimental osteopenia. However, <b>suspension</b> <b>periods</b> longer than 3 wk may cause tail skin sloughing or rat slippage. The hypothesis {{was that a}} traction system with skeletal anchorage through one tail vertebra would prolong the suspension time without significant complications. Methods: There were 80 young adult female Wistar rats that were submitted {{to one of the}} following interventions: skeletal tail suspension (N = 20), skin tail suspension (N = 20), no intervention (N = 20), and a baseline control (N = 20). All animals were followed up either for 3 (N = 10) or 6 (N = 10) wk. Animals were assessed for clinical signs of stress and tolerance to suspension. The femur evaluation was in terms of mineral density content, mechanical resistance, and histomorphometry. Results/Discussion: All animals reached the 3 -wk end point. However, for the 6 -wk period, seven animals suspended by the skin traction method were discarded (70 %) because of signs of stress and skin sloughing. In contrast, there was one loss in the skeletal suspension group (10 %). All suspended animals developed similar osteopenia at 3 wk characterized by decreased bone mineral content, weakened bone resistance, and loss of femoral mass. At 6 wk, all suspended animals had similar osteopenic parameters, but they were not statistically {{different from those of the}} rats in the 3 -wk groups. Therefore, suspension longer than 3 wk did not increase the bone deterioration in the femur. State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP...|$|R
