5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, and then sent condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> <b>the</b> Baptist in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, but the fact that the church was dedicated to <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> <b>the</b> Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityAlthough {{literary}} {{scholars have}} investigated minutely the multiple sources or T. S. Eliot, they have examined only cursorily <b>the</b> influence of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> of <b>the</b> Cross. The first reference ot Eliot to <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> of <b>the</b> Cross {{is the second}} epigraph or "Fragment of a Prologue" written tor The Criterion in 1926 and published with "Fragment or an Agon" under the title, Sweeney Agonistes, in 1932. In the twenty-eight years since this epigraph of Eliot, {{there have been no}} consistent studies of <b>st.</b> <b>John</b> ot <b>the</b> Cross, nor have critics ventured beyond the "dark night of the soul. " Moreover, they classify as the dark night of the soul all the mystical elements in the poetry and drama of Eliot, {{despite the fact that the}} dark night is only one phase of the mystical doctrine of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> ot <b>the</b> Cross. 	The aim or this study, then, is the examination of the informing influence of <b>st.</b> <b>John</b> of <b>the</b> Cross in the ideational and symbolic patterns of Eliot. It traces the progress of the life of the soul, as described by <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> of <b>the</b> Cross, through the ascetical, mystical, and unitive ways, and shows this development in the poetry and drama ot T. S. Eliot. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
