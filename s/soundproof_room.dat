25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. Every bit of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point where it does not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} from Greece, Holst resumed his {{teaching}} and composing. In addition to his existing work he accepted a lectureship in composition at the University of Reading and joined Vaughan Williams in teaching composition at their alma mater the RCM. Inspired by Adrian Boult's conducting classes at the RCM, Holst tried to further pioneer music education for women by proposing to the High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School that he should invite Boult to give classes at the school: [...] "It would be glorious if the SPGS turned out the only women conductors in the world!" [...] In his <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> at SPGS he composed the Ode to Death, a setting of a poem by Whitman, which according to Vaughan Williams {{is considered by many}} to be Holst's most beautiful choral work.|$|E
500|$|Farmer first {{married in}} the mid-1950s, to a woman from South America; the couple had one son, Arthur Jr, who died in 1994, and they {{divorced}} after about a year. Farmer's second wife was a distant cousin; this also ended in divorce. He married again, to a Viennese banker named Mechtilde Lawgger, and their son, Georg, {{was born in the}} early 1970s. They lived together in a house that they had built in Vienna, and Farmer reported contentment with his lifestyle; notably, in contrast with his homeland, he did not experience racism in Europe. Farmer described himself in 1985 as [...] "an introvert, and kind of reclusive"; a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> in his Austrian house allowed him to practice alone for the four or five hours a day that he desired. His personality was often described by others as mirroring his playing: Leonard Feather, for instance, observed in 1990 that Farmer was [...] "mellow, relaxed and [...] gentle".|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} before the night of 16/17 December (OS), Rasputin had been invited to the Moika Palace at an unseemly hour, intimating Felix Yusupov's {{attractive}} wife, Princess Irina, would be present. She was really away in Crimea, staying with her parents-in-law. Yusupov, who had visited Rasputin regularly {{in the past few months}} for treatment, [...] went with Stanislaus de Lazovert to Rasputin's apartment in Dmitry's car. A <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> in the basement in the east wing had been specially prepared for the killing. Waiting on another floor were the fellow conspirators: Dmitri, politician Vladimir Purishkevich and army officer Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} each week, each housemate is {{required}} to sit down and be interviewed about the past week's events. Unlike the normal day-to-day taping, these interviews, which are referred to as [...] "confessionals," [...] involve the subject looking directly into the camera while providing opinions and reflective accounts of the week's activities, which are used in the final, edited episodes. The producers instruct the cast to talk about whatever they wish, and to speak in complete sentences, to reinforce the perception {{on the part of the}} home viewer that the cast is speaking to them. Winick described this practice as [...] "like therapy without the help." [...] The confessionals were originally conducted by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, but were eventually delegated to production staff members like George Verschoor and Thomas Klein. Beginning with the second season (Los Angeles), a small <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> was incorporated into each house for this purpose, which itself has also become known as the Confessional. (The soundproofing practice appears to have been discontinued in later seasons.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{soundproof}} room: A cristal <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> {{is installed}} at the central studio. The first three weeks, the two contestants that were leading the televote for eviction were taken on a van from the eviction room to the <b>soundproof</b> <b>room.</b> There, they were briefly interviewed by the host and could see the reasons given by their housemates to nominate them, {{so that they could}} defend themselves while the televoting lines were open. The non-evicted housemate was taken back to the house. From Week 16, the nominees chosen by the audience to become a finalist are taken to the <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> to be interviewed, thinking that they have been evicted. After the interview they are taken back to a secret room in the house.|$|E

25|$|Isolation — Richard Wiseman {{and others}} argue {{that not all of}} the studies used <b>soundproof</b> <b>rooms,</b> so it is {{possible}} that when videos were playing, the experimenter could have heard it, and later given involuntary cues to the receiver during the selection process.

5000|$|Barry Gibb recalls {{about the}} {{recording}} of this track: [...] "'And the Sun Will Shine' was a one-day event, I remember very well the engineer in that studio had a trap door in the ceiling where the <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> was! They must have decided that the engineer needed to be safe. You could make as much music as possible, but you couldn't get up into that <b>soundproof</b> <b>room.</b> And The Sun Will Shine' definitely {{had the potential to}} be something and, in fact, that's what we ended up with, the song on the spot. We never rerecorded it". [...] Barry Gibb ...|$|E

50|$|The first reverb effects {{created for}} {{recordings}} used a real physical space {{as a natural}} echo chamber. A loudspeaker would play the sound, and then a microphone would pick it up again, including the effects of reverb. Although {{this is still a}} common technique, it requires a dedicated <b>soundproofed</b> <b>room,</b> and varying the reverb time is difficult.|$|R

"Watashi's private {{torture chamber}} was a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> {{containing}} a narrow wooden bench, which bore an ominous number of russet stains, and many ugly implements of iron.

50|$|Part of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} on the band's tour bus. They had announced in previous years that they had wanted to do this. They cleared out parts of the back recreational area of the bus, and installed a small <b>soundproof</b> <b>room,</b> and an area for a mixing board and computer. This is briefly visible in the video released by the band of Danny getting 'disturbed'.|$|E
50|$|With the {{contestant}} offstage in a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room,</b> {{the celebrity}} teammate {{was asked to}} come up with five associations to a clue word provided by the host, then designate one of those five as a bonus word, the one his or her teammate was most likely to say. The contestant would then return and have 20 seconds {{to come up with}} all five associations for $50 each.|$|E
5000|$|Arkwright Hall {{is a large}} Victorian mansion with a 17th-century atmosphere. The {{building}} {{served as}} a community centre for many years, containing a <b>soundproofed</b> <b>room</b> and field studies centre.

50|$|The {{first full}} day of program testing {{occurred}} August 6, 1966. The first weekly schedule of programming began officially on September 15, 1966 at 4:00 p.m. on FM channel 212 of the frequency 90.3 transmitting with 250 watts of power through a 4-bay antenna. The new station had three <b>soundproof</b> <b>rooms</b> which contained broadcasting equipment, and a large live studio for live production and program planning.|$|R
2500|$|The plan {{fell out}} of favor in the early 20th century, when Sunday schools changed their {{approach}} to one in which pupils were taught separately for the entire session, eliminating the school-wide exercises. [...] The awkwardly shaped and imperfectly <b>soundproofed</b> <b>rooms</b> were poorly adapted for this new approach, {{and many of them}} underwent extensive remodelling. [...] By the beginning of the 21st century, few intact Akron Plan interiors remained in existence.|$|R

Unable to watch, Todd screams that the Answer is attacking from the east. The Mayor thanks Todd, and leaves to organise his army. Todd realizes where his duty lies and formulates a plan to stop the Mayor with the help of Ivan and other personnel.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} round, {{one member of}} each team was offstage in a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room.</b> The three {{remaining}} players were asked questions about themselves or their partners. The first player to buzz in after a question was read would answer first, then the other two would answer. If players buzzed in before the question was completed, they had to answer without hearing the entire question or any multiple choice options, if there were any. Three questions were asked in this manner.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treatise}} {{takes the}} form of a dialogue between the Ciceronian [...] "Nosoponus" [...] and his opponent [...] "Bulephorus" [...] (representing Erasmus). Bulephorus's views are supported by [...] "Hypologus". Erasmus's persona approaches his argument in an intentionally entertaining and satirical style, imagining the Ciceronian purists having to write their ultra-sterilised prose in <b>soundproof</b> <b>rooms</b> to avoid any violation by real life, especially the distressingly vulgar speech of children and women.|$|R
50|$|The Music {{rooms at}} both campuses have a main room {{that is used}} for class tuition, and several small <b>soundproof</b> <b>rooms</b> in which each there is a piano {{available}} for private individual practice.

5000|$|Three teams competed, each (usually, but not always) {{consisting}} of a brother and sister. The front game was played in two rounds. In Round 1, the brothers were [...] "teleported" [...] to the [...] "Isolation Zone" [...] (or [...] "Iso-Zone") using special effects and a video edit (i.e., taken offstage to a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room).</b> One of three pun-styled categories was chosen at random by hitting a plunger, and Faso read a question loosely based on the chosen category. Three questions were played, with each sister choosing one category, and all three sisters responded to every question.|$|E
50|$|At the Beckworth's house, Carter {{is trying}} to get up the nerve to ring the {{doorbell}} when Jerry arrives and begs him to leave. Beckworth comes to the door and grows indignant as he realizes what is going on. Carter flies into a rage and attacks Beckworth. After Jerry separates them, Beckworth produces a gun and starts shooting at the intruders. Jerry manages to kill Beckworth with a fire poker but not before getting shot in the neck. As he dies, he tells Carter to flee, and he manages to flip up a rug, exposing a handle to a trap door. Carter watches the news coverage back at home, and learns that Beckworth had kept the girl alive in a <b>soundproof</b> <b>room</b> in his basement.|$|E
50|$|Aless was 29 {{years old}} and he was living in Milan. He was a footballer. He entered the House the 1 Day and a few days later started a {{relationship}} with Naomi. She traveled to Brazil's Exchange in week 7. There she had sex with Rafael, the winner of BBB. Returning to Spain, she declared that she will confessed everything to Alessandro, but she did not. This generated much controversy abroad. On Day 110 Alessandro became a finalist, although he thought that he was eliminated. He went to the central studio of Telecinco and saw videos of his passage through the House within the <b>soundproof</b> <b>room.</b> That same day, Alessandro chose Marta to accompany him until the end. He was fourth with 13.6%. He won La Re-Vuelta.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{releases}} {{were generally}} recorded and mixed in makeshift studios based in homes, garages and warehouses, although {{the last two}} albums were mixed in a dedicated facility. Although live performances used a full band, much of the recordings were done by Lytle alone using analog recorders and Pro Tools. He recorded basic drum tracks in a <b>soundproofed</b> <b>room</b> and overdubbed cymbals and tom toms. He recorded his vocals close to the strings of a piano for {{what he described as}} a [...] "ghostly effect".|$|R
5000|$|The Priory {{changed hands}} yet again and was re-opened as a girls school. The school housed 70 {{boarders}} {{and it is}} interesting to note that there were 20 pianos in separate <b>soundproof</b> <b>rooms.</b> For several years the school prospered as a female preserve. Male staff were required to leave by 9:30pm when the gates were locked. Any man inadvertently entering the grounds was politely but rapidly removed. Local actor and journalist Pete Knobbler referred to his great-uncle's attempt to remain in the school after hours in an article published in the Harrow Observer in 1983.|$|R
