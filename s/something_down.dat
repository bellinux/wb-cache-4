500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{completion}} of The Return of the King, Weta Workshop and Weta Digital, supervised by Taylor, Rivers, and Joe Lettieri, started pre-production on King Kong. Jackson brought back most of the crew he had on The Lord of the Rings series, including cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, production designer Grant Major, art directors Simon Bright and Dan Hennah, conceptual designer Alan Lee, and editor Jamie Selkirk. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens began to write a new script in late October 2003. Jackson acknowledged that he was highly unsatisfied with the original 1996 script. [...] "That was actually just Fran and Peter very hurriedly getting <b>something</b> <b>down</b> on paper", Boyens explained. [...] "It was more one of many possible ways the story could go." [...] The writers were adamant to base the new script on the 1933 film, rather than the 1996 script. They also included scenes that were either uncompleted or entirely omitted from James Ashmore Creelman's original script in the cutting room floor. In the scene where Kong shakes the surviving sailors pursuing Ann and himself from a log into the ravine, it was originally the intention of directors Merian Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack to feature giant spiders emerging from the rock to devour their bodies. This was cut from the original release print, and remains known to Kong fans only via a rare still that appeared in Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson included this scene and elaborated upon it. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens also cited Delos W. Lovelace's 1932 novelization of King Kong as inspiration, which included the character Lumpy (Andy Serkis). To make the relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong plausible, the writers studied hours of gorilla footage. Jackson also optioned Early Havoc, a memoir written by vaudeville performer June Havoc to help Walsh and Boyens flesh out Ann Darrow's characterization. Carl Denham was intentionally modeled after and inspired by Orson Welles. Their new draft was finished in February 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{attended}} Long Beach Polytechnic High School, {{which was}} a high-profile school in sports. He was a two-sport star in both basketball and baseball. In his final two years, his Jackrabbits baseball teams were a combined 3-25-2 in the league, while the basketball teams went 53-6 and twice reached the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section 4A championship game. Gwynn had considered quitting baseball as a senior to concentrate on basketball, but his mother talked him out of it. [...] "She said it might be <b>something</b> <b>down</b> the road and that I might be sorry later if I didn’t play", recalled Gwynn.|$|E
2500|$|Tomorrow's Harvest {{features}} seventeen tracks {{written and}} composed by Marcus Eoin and Mike Sandison. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Sandison discussed the songwriting process of the tracks, stating: [...] "we often jam <b>something</b> <b>down</b> quickly and you tend to find those things are the ones with a great instant melody." [...] Sandison said that [...] "crafting the tunes into a specific style and time period we want to reference" [...] was a challenging aspect of the process, further noting that [...] "there's a deliberate VHS video-nasty element throughout the record", which was achieved by timing changes in the composition and music to simulate film soundtracks from [...] "around30 years ago." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{judge the}} success of the Libby Prison escape solely by the number of men who crossed Federal lines would be a mistake. [...] Richmond was deeply {{affected}} by the break, and Libby Prison itself was thrown into chaos, much to the satisfaction and raised morale of the remaining prisoners. [...] Lieutenant Colonel Cavada recorded some of the more humorous effects of the escape inside the prison. [...] On one occasion, the entire camp was roused {{in the middle of the}} night for a roll call because a sentry thought he saw <b>something</b> <b>down</b> in a sewer. [...] It turned out to be his own shadow. [...] Even the Confederate warden, Major Thomas P. Turner, was visibly shaken. [...] Cavada commented, [...] "Really, when our distracted little Commandant now comes into our rooms, he keeps his knees well together, it is necessary to be very cautious, some of us might slip out between his legs!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{under house}} arrest, T.I. began writing lyrics {{down on paper}} for his {{following}} album. The first official single from the album, titled [...] "No Matter What," [...] was released in April 2008. The music video was released on June 2008 on MTV's FN Premieres. The official lead single was [...] "Whatever You Like," [...] released in July 2008, and became his most successful single of his career so far, breaking {{the record for the}} highest jump to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, jumping from number 71 to number one and also becoming T.I.'s first solo number one on the chart. The third single was [...] "Swing Ya Rag" [...] which featured vocals and production from Swizz Beatz. T.I. released his sixth album, Paper Trail, in September 2008. The title of the album refers to the lyrics he had written down on paper. Like many other rappers, T.I. abandoned this style of rapping after his debut album I'm Serious by just memorizing lyrics. His representative explained that T.I. wanted to [...] "take more time to really put <b>something</b> <b>down</b> [...] ". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 568,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
