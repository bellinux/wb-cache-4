The oral route of exposure has been poorly explored, despite the presence of a fraction of nano-sized particles in certain food additives/supplements and the incorporation of such particles into packaging in contact with foods. After their ingestion, these nanoparticles pass through the digestive tract, where they may undergo physicochemical transformations, with consequences for the luminal environment, before crossing the epithelial barrier to reach the <b>systemic</b> <b>compartment.</b> In this review, we consider two examples, nano-silver and nano-titanium dioxide. Despite the specific features of these particles and the differences between them, both display a close relationship between physicochemical reactivity and bioavailability/biopersistence in the gastrointestinal tract. Few studies have focused on the interactions of nanoparticles of silver or titanium dioxide with the microbiota and mucus. However, the microbiota and mucus play key roles in intestinal homeostasis and host health, and are undoubtedly involved in controlling the distribution of nanoparticles in the <b>systemic</b> <b>compartment...</b>|$|E

Mixed infections with tagged Salmonella {{can be used}} in combination with probabilistic models to describe the dynamics of the infection process. Here we used mixed oral infections with tagged Salmonella strains to identify bottlenecks in the infection process in naı̈ve and vaccinated mice. We established a next generation sequencing based method to characterize the composition of tagged Salmonella strains which offers a fast and reliable method to characterise the composition of genome-tagged Salmonella strains. We show that initial colonization of Salmonella was distinguished by a non-Darwinian selection of few bacteria setting up the infection independently in gut associated lymphoid tissue and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments.</b> Colonization of Peyer’s patches fuels the sustained spread of bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes via dendritic cells. In contrast, infection of liver and spleen originated from an independent pool of bacteria.

40|$|Melioidosis, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a septicemic illness, often associated with pneumonia and bacterial dissemination to distant sites. Recently we reported the inflammatory mRNA profile in blood leukocytes during human melioidosis. Knowledge of the inflammatory gene expression profile in the pulmonary compartment after infection with B. pseudomallei, however, is highly limited. We therefore aimed to characterize the inflammatory mRNA profile in the pulmonary and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartment</b> during murine melioidosis. By using a newly developed mouse specific Multiplex-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification (MLPA) assay we determined the expression profile of 33 genes encoding inflammatory proteins in lung tissue, leukocytes in bronchoalveolar-lavage-fluid (BALF) and blood leukocytes in mice before and at several time points after intranasal infection with B. pseudomallei. Relative to naive mice, mice intranasally infected with B. pseudomallei showed increased transcription of a whole array of genes involved in inflammation, Toll-like receptor-signaling, coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, tissue repair and homeostasis in the lung, BALF and blood compartment. Notably, many inflammatory genes were shown to be differentially expressed {{during the course of}} infection.

Intramuscular vaccination of an adenovirus vector (Adv) {{has been shown}} to induce Ag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in both <b>systemic</b> and gut-mucosal <b>compartments.</b> We previously found that type I interferon (IFN) signaling is required for induction of gut-mucosal, but not systemic, CTLs following vaccination; however, the molecular mechanism involving type I IFN signaling remains unknown. Here, we found that T helper 17 (Th 17) -polarizing cytokine expression was down-regulated in the inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) of Ifnar 2 −/− mice, resulting in the reduction of Ag-specific Th 17 [*]cells in the iLNs and gut mucosa of the mice. We also found that prior transfer of Th 17 [*]cells reversed the {{decrease in the number of}} Ag-specific gut-mucosal CTLs in Ifnar 2 −/− mice following Adv vaccination. Additionally, prior transfer of Th 17 [*]cells into wild-type mice enhanced the induction of Ag-specific CTLs in the gut mucosa, but not in <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments,</b> suggesting a gut mucosa-specific mechanism where Th 17 [*]cells regulate the magnitude of vaccine-elicited Ag-specific CTL responses.

We here addressed whether mice harboring a human intestinal microbiota developed intestinal, extra-intestinal and systemic sequelae upon ileitis induction. Secondary abiotic mice were generated by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and associated with a complex human intestinal microbiota following peroral fecal microbiota transplantation. Within three weeks the human microbiota had stably established in the murine intestinal tract as assessed by quantitative cultural and culture-independent (i. e. molecular 16 S rRNA based) methods. At day 7 post infection (p. i.) with 50 cysts of T. gondii strain ME 49 by gavage human microbiota associated (hma) mice displayed severe clinical, macroscopic and microscopic sequelae indicating acute ileitis. In diseased hma mice increased numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells within the ileal mucosa and lamina propria and elevated intestinal secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators including IFN-γ, IL- 12 and nitric oxide could be observed at day 7 p. i. Ileitis development was accompanied by substantial shifts in intestinal microbiota composition of hma mice characterized by elevated total bacterial loads and increased numbers of intestinal Gram-negative commensals such as enterobacteria and Bacteroides / Prevotella species overgrowing the small and large intestinal lumen. Furthermore, viable bacteria translocated from the inflamed ileum to extra-intestinal including <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments.</b> Notably, pro-inflammatory immune responses were not restricted to the intestinal tract as indicated by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in extra-intestinal (i. e. liver and kidney) and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments</b> including spleen and serum. With respect to the intestinal microbiota composition "humanized" mice display acute ileitis following peroral high dose T. gondii infection.

Anopheline mosquitoes are vectors of human malaria but are believed to transmit one known arbovirus, o’nyong-nyong virus, whereas Aedes mosquitoes transmit many. Anopheles interactions with viruses have been little studied, and the initial antiviral response in the midgut has not been examined. Here, we determine the antiviral immune pathways of the Anopheles gambiae midgut, the initial site of viral infection after an infective blood meal. We compare them with {{the responses of the}} post-midgut <b>systemic</b> <b>compartment,</b> which is the site of the subsequent disseminated viral infection. Normal viral infection of the midgut requires bacterial flora and is inhibited by the activities of immune deficiency (Imd), JAK/STAT, and Leu-rich repeat immune factors. We show that the exogenous siRNA pathway, thought of as the canonical mosquito antiviral pathway, plays no detectable role in antiviral defense in the midgut but only protects later in the <b>systemic</b> <b>compartment.</b> These results alter the prevailing antiviral paradigm by describing distinct protective mechanisms in different body compartments and infection stages. Importantly, the presence of the midgut bacterial flora is required for full viral infectivity to Anopheles, in contrast to malaria infection, where the presence of the midgut bacterial flora is required for protection against infection. Thus, the enteric flora controls a reciprocal protection tradeoff in the vector for resistance to different human pathogens...|$|E

It is, however, unclear, whether intestinal MDR P. aeruginosa carriage {{is associated with}} inflammatory responses in intestinal or even <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments.</b> In the present study, we generated {{with respect to their}} microbiota “humanized” mice by human fecal microbiota transplantation of secondary abiotic mice. Following peroral challenge with a clinical P. aeruginosa isolate on two consecutive days, mice harboring a human or murine microbiota were only partially protected from stable intestinal P. aeruginosa colonization given that up to 78 % of mice were P. aeruginosa-positive at day 28 post-infection (p. i.). Irrespective of the host-specificity of the microbiota, P. aeruginosa colonized mice were clinically uncompromised. However, P. aeruginosa colonization resulted in increased intestinal epithelial apoptosis that was accompanied by pronounced proliferative/regenerative cell responses. Furthermore, at day 7 p. i. increased innate immune cell populations such as macrophages and monocytes could be observed in the colon of mice harboring either a human or murine microbiota, whereas this held true at day 28 p. i. for adaptive immune cells such as B lymphocytes in both the small and large intestines of mice with murine microbiota. At day 7 p. i., pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was enhanced in the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 was down-regulated in the former at day 28 p. i. Strikingly, cytokine responses upon intestinal P. aeruginosa colonization were not restricted to the intestinal tract, but could also be observed systemically, given that TNF and IFN-γ concentrations were elevated in spleens as early as 7 days p. i., whereas splenic IL- 10 levels were dampened at day 28 p. i. of mice with human microbiota.

40|$|Abstract Background At present, {{available}} pneumococcal vaccines {{have failed}} to eradicate infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Search for effective vaccine continues and some serotype independent pneumococcal proteins are considered as candidates {{for the design of}} new vaccines, especially a mucosal vaccine, since pneumococci enter the body through mucosal surfaces. Selection of the appropriate adjuvant is important for mucosal vaccines, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with immunostimulant properties are promissory candidates. In this work, we assessed the adjuvant effect of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), when nasally administered with a pneumococcal antigen (pneumococcal protective protein A: PppA) for the prevention of pneumococcal infection. Adjuvanticity of both live (LcV) and heat-killed (LcM) was evaluated and humoral and cellular antigen-specific immune response was assessed in mucosal and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments.</b> The potential mechanisms induced by nasal immunization were discussed. Results Nasal immunization of young mice with PppA+LcV and PppA+LcM induced anti-PppA IgA and IgG antibodies in mucosal and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments</b> and levels of these specific antibodies remained high even at day 45 after the 3 rd Immunization (3 rd I). These results were correlated with IL- 4 induction by the mixture of antigen plus LcV and LcM. Also, PppA+Lc (V and M) induced stimulation of Th 1 and Th 17 cells involved in the defence against pneumococci. The protection against pneumococcal respiratory challenge at day 30 after the 3 rd I showed that PppA+LcV and PppA+LcM immunizations significantly reduced pathogen counts in nasal lavages while prventing their passage into lung and blood. Survival of mice immunized with the co-application of PppA plus LcV and LcM was significantly higher than in mice immunized with PppA alone and control mice when intraperitoneal challenge was performed. No significant differences between the treatments involving LcV and LcM were found. Conclusions Live and heat-killed L. casei enhanced the antigen-specific immune response when administered nasally with a pneumococcal antigen. Considering the potential risk associated with live bacteria, the design of a nasal vaccine based on pneumococcal antigens and heat-killed L. casei emerges as a safe and effective strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal infections and opens new possibilities of application of dead LAB as adjuvants in vaccine formulations against other pathogens. </p...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{developing}} adaptive immune responses, young infants {{are especially}} vulnerable to serious infections including sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs) are key effectors that function as broad-spectrum anti-infectives. This review seeks to summarise the clinically relevant functional qualities of APPs and the increasing clinical trial evidence for their use to combat serious infections in infancy. Levels of APPs are relatively low in early life, especially in infants born preterm or with low birth weight (LBW). There are several rationales for the potential clinical utility of APPs in the prevention and treatment of infections in infants: (a) APPs may be most helpful in those with reduced levels; (b) during sepsis microbial products signal via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) causing potentially harmful inflammation which APPs may counteract; and (c) {{in the era of}} antibiotic resistance, development of new anti-infective strategies is essential.

We then summarise the evidence from a range of models linking BBB changes with systemic inflammation, and the underlying mechanisms. The clinical relevance of these BBB changes during systemic inflammation are discussed in the context of clinically-apparent syndromes such as sickness behaviour, delirium, and septic encephalopathy, as well as neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. We review emerging evidence for two novel concepts: (1) a heightened sensitivity of the diseased, versus healthy, BBB to systemic inflammation, and (2) the contribution of BBB changes induced by systemic inflammation to progression of the primary disease process...|$|E
40|$|Flagellin, the {{structural}} {{component of the}} flagellar filament in various motile bacteria, {{can contribute to the}} activation of NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokine expression during the innate immune response in host cells. Thus, flagellin proteins represent a particularly attractive target for the development of vaccine candidates. In this study, we investigated the immune response by increasing the flagella number in the iacP mutant strain and the adjuvant activity of the flagellin component FljB of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We found that the iacP mutant strain expresses two flagellin proteins (FliC and FljB), which result in increased NF-κB-dependent gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages. Using an oral immunization mouse model, we observed that the administration of a live attenuated S. typhimurium BRD 509 strain expressing the FliC and FljB flagellins induced significantly enhanced flagellin-specific IgG responses in the <b>systemic</b> <b>compartment.</b> The mice immunized with the recombinant attenuated S. typhimurium strain that has two types of flagella were protected from lethal challenge with the Salmonella SL 1344 strain. These results indicate that overexpression of flagella in the iacP mutant strain enhance the induction of an antigen-specific immune responses in macrophage cell, and both the FliC and FljB flagella...|$|E
40|$|Few of the {{vaccines}} {{in current}} use can induce antigen- (Ag-) specific immunity in both mucosal and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments.</b> Hence, {{the development of}} vaccines that realize both mucosal and systemic protection against various pathogens is a high priority in global health. Recently, {{it has been reported}} that intramuscular (i. m.) vaccination of an adenovirus vector (Adv) can induce Ag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in both systemic and gut mucosal compartments. We previously revealed that type I IFN signaling is required for the induction of gut mucosal CTLs, not systemic CTLs. However, the molecular mechanism via type I IFN signaling is largely unknown. Here, we report that type I IFN signaling following i. m. Adv vaccination is required for the expression of type I IFN in the inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs), which are the draining lymph nodes of the administration site. We also showed that the type I IFN signaling is indispensable for the early activation of CTLs in iLNs. These data suggested that type I IFN signaling has an important role in the translation of systemic innate immune response into mucosal adaptive immunity by amplifying the innate immune signaling and activating CTLs in the iLN...|$|R
40|$|The barrier {{separating}} mucosal and <b>systemic</b> <b>compartments</b> comprises epithelial cells, annealed by tight junctions, limiting permeability. GUCY 2 C recently {{emerged as}} an intestinal tumor suppressor coordinating AKT 1 -dependent crypt-villus homeostasis. Here, the contribution of GUCY 2 C to barrier integrity opposing colitis and systemic tumorigenesis is defined. Mice deficient in GUCY 2 C (Gucy 2 c 2 / 2) exhibited barrier hyperpermeability associated with reduced junctional proteins. Conversely, activation of GUCY 2 C in mice reduced barrier permeability associated with increased junctional proteins. Further, silencing GUCY 2 C exacerbated, while activation reduced, chemical barrier disruption and colitis. Moreover, eliminating GUCY 2 C amplified, while activation reduced, systemic oxidative DNA damage. This genotoxicity was associated with increased spontaneous and carcinogen-induced systemic tumorigenesis in Gucy 2 c 2 / 2 mice. GUCY 2 C regulated barrier integrity by repressing AKT 1, associated with increased junction proteins occludin and claudin 4 in mice and Caco 2 cells in vitro. Thus, GUCY 2 C defends the intestinal barrier, opposing colitis and systemic genotoxicity and tumorigenesis. The therapeutic potential of this observation is underscored by the emerging clinical development of oral GUCY 2 C ligands...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} {{the methodology of}} isolated hypoxic hepatic perfusion (IHHP) using balloon catheter techniques and to gain insight into the distribution of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), melphalan, and mitomycin C (MMC) through the regional and <b>systemic</b> blood <b>compartments</b> when applying these techniques. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There is no standard treatment for unresectable liver tumors. Clinical results of isolated limb perfusion with high-dose TNF and melphalan {{for the treatment of}} melanoma and sarcoma have been promising, and {{attempts have been made to}} extrapolate this success to the isolated liver perfusion setting. The magnitude and toxicity of the surgical procedure, however, have limited clinical applicability. METHODS: Pigs underwent IHHP with TNF, melphalan, and MMC using balloon catheters or served as controls, receiving equivalent dosages of these agents intravenously. After a 20 -minute perfusion, a washout procedure was performed for 10 minutes, after which isolation was terminated. Throughout the procedure and afterward, blood samples were obtained from the hepatic and <b>systemic</b> blood <b>compartments</b> and concentrations of perfused agents were determined. RESULTS: During perfusion, locoregional plasma drug concentrations were 20 - to 40 -fold higher than systemic concentrations. Compared with systemic concentrations after intravenous administration, regional concentrations during IHHP were up to 10 -fold higher. Regional MMC and melphalan levels steadily declined during perfusion, indicating rapid uptake by the liver tissue; minimal systemic concentrations indicated virtually no leakage to the <b>systemic</b> blood <b>compartment.</b> During isolation, concentrations of TNF in the perfusate declined only slightly, indicating limited uptake by the liver tissue; no leakage of TNF to the systemic circulation was observed. After termination of isolation, systemic TNF levels showed only a minor transient elevation, indicating that the washout procedure at the end of the perfusions was fully effective. CONCLUSIONS: Complete isolation of the hepatic vascular bed can be accomplished when performing IHHP using this balloon catheter technique. Thus, as in extremities, an ideal leakage-free perfusion of the liver can now be performed, and repeated, without major surgery. The effective washout allows the addition of TNF in this setting...|$|R
