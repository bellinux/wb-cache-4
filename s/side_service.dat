25|$|On November 26, 1931, a {{connection}} south of Chambers Street to the Montague Street Tunnel opened, adding two stations (Fulton Streets and Broad) and rerouted train {{service on the}} bridge's south <b>side.</b> <b>Service</b> on that side became relatively low afterward as the only trains that normally crossed it were The Bankers’ Special, which ran from either the Sea Beach and/or Fourth Avenue Line, crossed the Manhattan Bridge or Montague Street Tunnel into Manhattan, {{and then returned to}} Brooklyn via the opposite crossing.|$|E
500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a trolley for table <b>side</b> <b>service.</b> Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E

2500|$|The north {{tracks were}} reopened {{and the south}} tracks were closed {{simultaneously}} in December 1988, merging again the [...] and [...] services, rerouting the [...] train to Sixth Avenue, and suspending, and returning express service on the Broadway, and Sixth Avenue Lines, respectively. After an 18-month delay of procurements, the New York City Transit Authority and politicians pressured the DOT to resume N train service on the bridge's south side on September 30, 1990, despite warnings from engineers that the structure was unsafe and major repairs still had to be made. On December 27, state inspectors forced south <b>side</b> <b>service</b> to be rerouted via the tunnel again after discovery of corroded support beams and missing steel plates. Following the controversial firing of the city's deputy commissioner for bridges, David Steinberger and his administrative assistant David Bronstein by Transportation Commissioner Lucius Riccio after this closing, the New York City Council's Transportation committee held an inquiry into the decision to restore subway service on the Manhattan Bridge south side (as well as the safety of all New York City bridges) with reluctance from Riccio and Mayor David Dinkins. They found that the Transportation Department and Transit Authority's lack of cooperative inspection were a major contributor for the deteriorating conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Cross’ encounter, in {{accordance}} with the Nigrescence Model, was the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968. After this, Cross was ensnared in the Black Consciousness Movement, which largely influenced his formulation of the Nigrescence Theory, a theory that explained the variance of identities and how this related to the fluctuation that accompanies social movements. During the Vietnam War, Cross became the Director of West <b>Side</b> <b>Service</b> Center (WSSC) in Evanston, IL. With the Black Power Movement in full swing, Cross was put in charge of creating proactive programs to engage the youth of Evanston. During this time, he regularly attended OBAC (Organization of Black American Culture) meetings. Cross relates that at these meetings, he learned the importance of culture consciousness, not just race consciousness, an idea that would become influential in his model of race and cultural identity conceptions. He also claims to have learned much about the conversion process through his interactions of Jimmy Reid, who organized a second-tier Black Panther organization, and happened to share office space with the WSSC staff. He saw that black identity conversion transcended social class, and learned that the “identity must be complemented by material change or else one is forced to fall back on a survival mode.” [...] Cross describes that his role as Director of West <b>Side</b> <b>Service</b> Center corresponded to his Immersion-Emersion experience.|$|E
