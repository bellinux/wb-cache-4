40|$|Water {{heating energy}} use is {{important}} in low-rise residential buildings. <b>Standby</b> <b>loss</b> is typically {{more than a quarter}} of a gas storage type water heater system's total energy use. However, when the system fuel is natural gas, there are no generation losses as are associated with electricity. Fuel type is very important in determining water heating energy use. While natural gas, LPG or oil can be burned directly to heat water, electricity is typically generated in a power plant. Approximately two thirds of the source energy used to generate electricity is lost in the generation and distribution processes. Any electric water heating system must automatically account for the inefficiency of the fuel type. Standard electric water heaters are not considered energy efficient for this reason.

40|$|With the popularization of {{household}} electrical appliances and the rapid development of office automation and networking, {{a huge number of}} consumer electronic devices, computers, copiers, and fax machines have been put into use in China over the last two decades. These products almost all use a certain amount of standby power [...] the power that is consumed when a device is connected but not performing its primary function. The rapid growth of standby energy consumption due to these products [...] and the consequent environmental problems [...] has attracted more and more attentions from researchers and from many government and international agencies. Numerous countries have developed policies and measures to restrict and reduce standby energy consumption (US EPA, 2004, IEA, 2001, and GEEA, 2004). However, standby energy consumption is still a new concept for Chinese consumers and the phenomenon of ''unconscious waste of energy'' is still very common in the people's daily life and work. With the goal of reducing China's standby energy consumption, China Certification Center for Energy Conservation Products (CECP) and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) have, under the sponsorship of the Energy Foundation (EF), entered into a collaboration to develop technical requirements for CECP's labeling program for consumer electronics and office equipment. These technical requirements will be used to qualify products for CECP's energy efficiency endorsement label in China. In the phase I of this collaborative project, CECP and LBNL conducted technical and economic research on televisions and printers in China. Based on the results of this research, CECP developed specifications for, and carried out corresponding energy conservation certifications for these two products. CECP's standby power certification program has made impressive gains in China. Leading manufacturers, such as Haier, Hesons, TCL, Chuangwei, Lenovo, EPSON, Fujitsu, and Brother have participated in CECP's certification activities. Media events organized by CECP have greatly improved the country's awareness of <b>standby</b> power <b>loss.</b> Reducing <b>standby</b> power <b>loss</b> has been formally incorporated into China's energy efficiency policy portfolio and in China's collaboration with the international community on the subject of energy efficiency (IEA, 2001).

40|$|Magnetic {{components}} are {{important parts of}} the phase shifted full bridge (PSFB) converter. During the dead-time of switches located in the same leg, the converter can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) by using the energies stored in magnetic components to discharge or charge the output capacitances of switches. Dead-time is usually calculated under a given set of pre-defined load condition which results in that the available energies are insufficient and ZVS capability is lost at light loads. In this paper, the PSFB converter is controlled by variable dead-time method and thus full advantage can be taken of the energies stored in magnetic components. Considering that dead-time has a great effect on ZVS, the relationship between available energies and magnetic component values is formulated by analyzing the equivalent circuits during dead-time intervals. Magnetic component values are chosen based on such relationship. The proposed choice procedure can make the available energies greater than the required energies for ZVS operation {{over a wide range}} of load conditions.

Both are sinusoidal-type inverters, producing grid-quality power, suitable for all applications. Maximum efficiencies of 89 and 90 % were measured, indicating large improvement in performance during the last 15 years. Both efficiencies closely agree with the manufacturer's specification of 90 and 92 %. The output voltage at nominal output power was 213 and 221 VAC, i. e. somewhat too low for the 12 VDC inverter. The <b>standby</b> <b>losses</b> were found to be 1. 8 and 3. 3 W, respectively. The latter is 32 % higher than specified by the manufacturer. Improvements are suggested regarding the reduction of losses and the cooling of the transistors.

With water heating contributing such {{a substantial portion}} of natural gas consumption, it is important to pay attention to water heater efficiencies.

The flue damper was expected to reduce off-cycle <b>standby</b> <b>losses,</b> which would lead to improvements in the efficiency of the water heater. The test results showed that the Energy Factor of the baseline water heater was 0. 576. The recovery efficiency was 0. 768. The standby heat loss coefficient was 10. 619 (BTU/hr-oF). After the damper was installed, the test results show an Energy Factor for the baseline water heater of 0. 605. The recovery efficiency was 0. 786. The standby heat loss coefficient was 9. 135 (BTU/hr-oF). The recovery efficiency increased 2. 3 percent and the standby heat loss coefficient decreased 14 percent. When the burner was on, the baseline water heater caused 28. 0 CFM of air to flow from the room. During standby, the flow was 12. 4 CFM.
