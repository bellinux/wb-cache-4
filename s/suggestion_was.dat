5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has {{been the source of}} debate and research since its discovery. The initial <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.|$|E
5|$|This <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> {{acted upon}} and in 1889 the first {{non-native}} fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, {{a practice that}} continued until 1955 and helped create the angling experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for.|$|E
5|$|Carla Thomas {{claimed that}} the pair had planned to record another duet album in December the same year, but Phil Walden denied this. Redding had {{proposed}} to record an album featuring cut and rearranged songs in different tempos; for example, ballads would be uptempo and vice versa. Another <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> to record an album entirely consisting of country standards.|$|E

40|$|When {{asking for}} donations, {{charitable}} organizations often suggest a potential amount to contribute. However, the evidence concerning {{the effects of}} such <b>suggestions</b> <b>is</b> scarce and inconsistent. Unlike the majority of earlier studies concerned with small-money solicitations, we {{examine the effect of}} larger nonbinding suggestions in the context of middle-range donations which are relevant in practice. In a randomized field experiment conducted in conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera, opera visitors received solicitation letters asking to support a social youth project organized by the opera house. The three different treatments were: no suggestion and suggestions of € 100 and € 200, respectively. Both <b>suggestions</b> <b>were</b> larger than average and median donations in this context. We find that suggested contribution levels substantially influence the distribution of donations actually received. The mean amounts given increase significantly if a <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> made. The increase is stronger in the € 200 treatment. On the other hand, the participation rate decreases if a <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> made. Overall, the returns from the campaign increase non-significantly when a <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> made. The solicitation was repeated a year later, without any <b>suggestion.</b> There <b>is</b> weak evidence that suggestions have a long-term effect on individual contribution-level decisions. I...|$|R
5|$|Dutch {{physician}} Pieter Pel {{first proposed}} a tissue {{stage of the}} malaria parasite in 1886, presaging its discovery by over 50 years. This <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> reiterated in 1893 when Golgi suggested that the parasites might have an undiscovered tissue phase (this time in endothelial cells). Pel in 1896 supported Golgi's latent phase theory.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Dudley {{hypothesized}} that the excitation of neon, {{at the time a}} recently discovered noble gas, was responsible for the appearance of the aurora borealis. While this was incorrect, his <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> widely reported by the media at the time.|$|E
5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E

5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} comets were all fragments {{of an earlier}} Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E
40|$|Two entirely {{different}} <b>suggestions</b> have <b>been</b> advanced {{in the literature}} as to where the cosmic rays originate. The first <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that cosmic rays are of local origin (upper earth atmosphere, our own planetary system, etc.). The other <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that cosmic rays are produced or have been produced throughout the universe, or even more specifically, throughout interstellar or intergalactic spaces. This latter view has especially been advanced by R. A. Millikan...|$|R

5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
5|$|By October 11, {{investigators}} had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 {{pieces of evidence}} related to the case. They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania, which had occurred {{five days after the}} shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that that particular <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> outside the current budget.|$|E
5|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns usually {{were not}} dated, {{although}} some, concerning {{withdrawal of money}} from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period hatt-ı hümayuns and irades had dates. Abdulhamid I was especially inclined to date his hatt-ı hümayuns. His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ı hümayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III {{so that he could}} follow up whether his orders were carried out. However, this <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> not adopted. Abdulhamid II used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.|$|E

Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E
5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The appointment {{was seen as}} a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> ignored.|$|E
50|$|Hypermnesia was not {{considered}} a phenomenon until the mid-1970s when Erdelyi and his associates completed further testing. Two <b>suggestions</b> have <b>been</b> offered to explain the increases in net recall over testing. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that pictures and high imagery words enhance hypermnesia, speculating that this nature of stimuli is more recognizable and hence less susceptible to forgetting. The second <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> Roediger's level of recall hypothesis claiming that any variable that produces greater levels of depth processing lead to greater hypermnesia.|$|R

40|$|The rise of {{the field}} of “experimental mathematics” poses an {{apparent}} challenge to traditional philosophical accounts of mathematics as an a priori, non-empirical endeavor. This paper surveys different attempts to characterize experimental mathematics. One <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that experimental mathematics makes essential use of electronic computers. A second <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that experimental mathematics involves support being gathered for an hypothesis which is inductive rather than deductive. Each of these options turns out to be inadequate, and instead a third <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> considered according to which experimental mathematics involves calculating instances of some general hypothesis. The paper concludes with the examination of some philosophical implications of this characterization...|$|R
5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. This <b>suggestion</b> <b>was</b> made by community leaders and approved by Gens.|$|E
5|$|No {{time was}} to be wasted on {{elaborate}} drawings; charts and plans should have notes and simple views of the land {{as seen from the}} sea showing measured heights of hills.
