40|$|Background: Family centred care {{is widely}} {{promoted}} {{as a model}} for <b>children</b> 19 <b>s</b> health care in many countries throughout the world and in all spheres of <b>children</b> 19 <b>s</b> <b>nursing</b> education, management, policy and practice. However, research has failed to show that clinical practice uses the partnership model, central to family centred care. Thesis of this paper: In this paper we suggest that, in part, the failure of family centred care, as a project, is {{due to the lack of}} attention paid to the cultural, social and political context in which <b>children</b> 19 <b>s</b> health care is delivered. Discussion: We propose that the concepts of cultural safety and ethical symmetry can be used to locate family and child centred care within the complexity of <b>children</b> 19 <b>s</b> lives, as lived with illness. Implications for practice: of cultural safety and ethical symmetry can be applied in paediatrics and may be more effective than family-centred care...|$|R

The goals {{of this study}} were to examine gender differences in pain outcomes and pain-related psychological constructs postoperatively and to identify pain-related psychological correlates of acute post-surgical pain (APSP) and predictors of functional disability 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Methods: Eighty-three children aged 8 &ndash; 18 (mean 13. 8 &plusmn; 2. 4) years who underwent major orthopedic or general surgery completed pain and pain-related psychological measures 48 &ndash; 72 hours and 2 weeks after surgery. Results: Girls reported higher levels of acute postoperative anxiety and pain unpleasantness compared with boys. In addition, pain anxiety was significantly associated with APSP intensity and functional disability 2 weeks after discharge, whereas pain catastrophizing was associated with APSP unpleasantness. Conclusion: These results highlight the important role played by pain-related psychological factors in the experience of pediatric APSP by children and adolescents.

40|$|This brief {{analyzes}} employed parents’ {{access to}} {{five or more}} paid sick days annually {{to care for a}} <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> in 2008. Using data from the 2008 National Study of the Changing Workforce collected by the Families and Work Institute (the most recent data available in the series), authors Kristin Smith and Andrew Schaefer analyze differences in access between employed mothers and fathers by demographic and work-related characteristics. They report that, in 2008, more than one-half— 52 percent—of employed parents lacked access to at least five paid sick days to care for a <b>sick</b> <b>child,</b> and lower-earning parents had the least access. Although employed mothers and fathers have similar access to paid sick days to care for their <b>sick</b> <b>children,</b> mothers more often miss work to care for a <b>sick</b> <b>child.</b> Employed parents with paid sick days to care for a <b>sick</b> <b>child</b> are 1. 9 {{times more likely to be}} very satisfied with their job than those without this access...|$|R
