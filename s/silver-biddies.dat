50|$|A 1955 {{study by}} Mary John {{identified}} fifteen species of grey mullets. She reports that most species of grey millets {{migrate to the}} lake during the months when Kayal {{is connected to the}} sea. The Kayal is rich in prawns. An environment impact assessment by National Thermal Power Corporation in association with the Fisheries department lists about 70 species of fishes in the Kayal. There are about 40 commercially important fish species which includes flathead mullet, greenback mullet, longarm mullet, largescale mullet, gold-spot mullet, bluespot mullet, tade grey mullet, bluetail mullet, Commerson's glassy perchlet, bald glassy perchlet, greasy grouper, tiger perch, spotted catfish, milkfish, longfin snake-eel, largetooth flounder, Solea indica, roughscale tonguesole, speckled tonguesole, barracuda, pearlspot, orange chromide, sulphur goatfish, spotted scat, whipfin <b>silver-biddy,</b> slender <b>silver-biddy,</b> small Bengal <b>silver-biddy,</b> common ponyfish, splendid ponyfish, shortnose ponyfish, Indo-Pacific tarpon, tenpounder, fringescale sardinella, Indian anchovy, Commerson's anchovy, Malabar thryssa and walking catfish. Besides the commercially important species there are about 30 other species of fish including northern whiting, bigeye trevally, black-tailed trevally, congaturi halfbeak, long-billed halfbeak, Quoy's garfish, chacunda gizzard shad, milkspotted puffer, diodon, Indian halibut, chorinemus, dusky sleeper, tank goby, mangrove red snapper, dory snapper, sleepy goby, sharptail goby, spotfin snouted goby Indian short-finned eel, Macrognathus guentheri, long whiskers catfish, yellow catfish, striped dwarf catfish, scarlet-banded barb, greenstripe barb, climbing perch, Indian carplet and spotted snakehead.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese <b>silver-biddy</b> (Gerres equulus) is {{a species}} of mojarra native to the coastal waters of the western Pacific Ocean from {{southern}} Korea to southern Japan, though it does not occur around the Ryukyu Islands. This species can reach 22.4 cm in standard length. It is commercially important for the local fish industry in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>silver-biddy</b> (Gerres oyena) is {{a species}} of mojarra native to marine and {{brackish}} waters of coastal waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. It inhabits estuaries, coastal waters and lagoons. This species can reach a length of 30 cm, though most do not exceed 20 cm. This species is important to local commercial fisheries.|$|R
50|$|Philometra gerrei is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} nematode of fishes, infecting the gonads of marine perciform fishes off the eastern Indian coast. It was first found in the whipfin <b>silver-biddy,</b> Gerres filamentosus. It is distinguished from its cogenerates by the gubernaculum structure in males, {{as well as the}} shape and structure of the females' cephalic and caudal ends, and their oesophagus.|$|R
50|$|The Slender <b>silver-biddy</b> (Gerres oblongus) is {{a species}} of mojarra native to marine and {{brackish}} waters of coastal waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, far towards Vanuatu. It inhabits estuaries, coastal waters and lagoons. They inhabit at depths from 0 to 10 m. This species can reach a length of 30 cm, with the average of 15 cm. This species is important to local commercial fisheries in many tropical countries.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 669, Gerres filamentosus (Cuvier, 1829) were {{collected}} from Hurghada area in the Egyptian Red Sea coast (January â December 2010). The author investigated the age and growth by two different methods through scale-annuli reading (Direct method) and Length-frequency distribution (Indirect method) which showed new record of lengths for the species. The equations of the length-weight relationship was WÂ =Â  0. 0143 â L 2. 9564 (Males), WÂ =Â  0. 0146 â L 2. 9543 (Females) and WÂ =Â  0. 0144 â L 2. 9597 (combined sexes). The von Bertalanffy growth equation was calculated by three different mathematical methods. It was concluded {{that it would be}} economical to protect this species from capture until at least their 5 th year, after the fish has reached about 32. 71 Â cm in total length and about 439. 15 Â grams in weight.
