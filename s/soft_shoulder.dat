50|$|The {{shoulder}} {{is usually}} slightly narrower than a full traffic lane. In some cases, particularly on older rural roadways, shoulders that initially existed were hardened with gravel {{rather than being}} paved with asphalt or concrete. In Britain, motorway shoulders are now paved, but are still known as 'hard shoulders.' Older, gravel shoulders have sometimes been termed <b>soft</b> <b>shoulders</b> by comparison. Because the paved surface ends at that point, they are less safe {{if they need to}} be used for emergency maneuvers. Notably, the section of Ontario Highway 401 between Windsor and London had <b>soft</b> <b>shoulders</b> with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers, if drivers accidentally drifted off the paved section of the road and then overreacted after hitting the gravel. Modern practice is to build a continuous paved shoulder whenever possible.|$|R

The <b>soft</b> <b>shoulders</b> consisted of gravel with a sharp slope which was blamed for facilitating vehicle rollovers.|$|R
60|$|Her {{hands were}} drawing him, drawing {{him down to}} her. He was afraid, even a little horrified. For he had, really, no {{intention}} of loving her. Yet her hands were drawing him towards her. He put out his hand quickly to steady himself, and grasped her bare shoulder. A flame seemed to burn the hand that grasped her <b>soft</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He {{had no intention of}} loving her: his whole will was against his yielding. It was horrible. And yet wonderful was the touch of her shoulders, beautiful the shining of her face. Was she perhaps mad? He had a horror of yielding to her. Yet something in him ached also.|$|E

The miner had taken his place beside his wife, thus bringing the young people {{side by side on the}} forward seat, and this arrangement had much to do with filling Morton's mind with a new and delicious content, for Viola's face was almost constantly lifted to his, and at every lurch of the vehicle her <b>soft</b> <b>shoulder</b> touched his arm, while the faint perfume of her garments rose like some enchanter's incense, dulling his sense of duties abandoned, quickening his delight in her beauty, and restoring his joy in his own youth.

60|$|I {{know that}} the account {{of this kind of}} solitary {{imprisonment}} is insufferably tedious, unless there is some cheerful or humorous incident to enliven it--a tender gaoler, for instance, or a waggish commandant of the fortress, or a mouse to come out and play about Latude's beard and whiskers, or a subterranean passage under the castle, dug by Trenck with his nails and a toothpick: the historian has no such enlivening incident to relate in the narrative of Amelia's captivity. Fancy her, if you please, during this period, very sad, but always ready to smile when spoken to; in a very mean, poor, not to say vulgar position of life; singing songs, making puddings, playing cards, mending stockings, for her old father's benefit. So, never mind, whether she be a heroine or no; or you and I, however old, scolding, and bankrupt--may we have in our last days a kind <b>soft</b> <b>shoulder</b> on which to lean and a gentle hand to soothe our gouty old pillows.|$|E

It is shown that for the first two systems which belong to the class of bounded potentials the Rosenfeld scaling formula is valid only in the infinite temperature limit where there are no anomalies. For the <b>soft</b> repulsive <b>shoulder</b> the scaling formula is valid already at sufficiently low temperatures, however, out of the anomaly range. Comment: 11 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The highway was an {{important}} and only avenue of advance during Operation Market Garden, and after the fighting along its length between Allied and Wehrmacht forces it was named [...] "Hell's Highway" [...] so named because of the effective artillery fire directed at it by the German forces in the area. During the fighting some 16 km of the highway south of Eindhoven was jammed with wrecks of vehicles being attacked by up to 200 Luftwaffe bombers requiring bulldozers and blade-equipped tanks to roam the length, pushing them off the surface to keep traffic moving. The wrecks on the <b>soft</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the highway prevented its use by other vehicles, in effect converting the highway into a narrow corridor, and slowing the movement on it to a crawl for the Allied drivers.|$|R

The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s.

Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the adoption of}} the shoulder pad in female, western fashion. Shoulder pads are essentially a form of wadding inserted into a garment that alters the natural shape of the shoulder line. They can give the illusion of a much broader shoulder, a square shoulder or a rounded, <b>softer</b> <b>shoulder.</b> In bespoke or made-to measure fashion such as tailoring and haute couture, the use of shoulder padding can also align the shoulders if one slopes more than the other. The fashion industry has utilzed shoulder pads to enhance the silhouette of many types of clothes and this research aims to trace the history of shoulder padding in contemporary fashion, from the early 1930 s. It also discusses how technology has developed the use of shoulder padding in female fashion. Their inclusion in fashionable clothing depends on the fashion taste of the day however the research also investigates how shoulder pads have sometimes been appropriated by women in order to galvanize an impression of power and emancipation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for analyzing the necessity and effectiveness of forgiving roadside design that aims to mitigate the consequences of run-off-road accidents (RORA). A framework is presented, which comprises the development of road, vehicle and driver models in order to simulate specific RORA scenarios. These scenarios are based on data taken from the Austrian road accident database that contains more than 650, 000 personal injury accidents since 1994. Three-dimensional road models (including the roadside) created from laser measurements allow integrating accurate replications of existing accident high-risk sites in simulation. For each âvirtualâ high-risk site, the roadside is then modified with appropriate safety treatments, before run-off-road accidents are simulated. Indicators for the effectiveness of roadside treatments are the head injury criterion (HIC) and the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) Simulation {{results show that the}} risk of fatal injuries strongly declines with forgiving roadside design. For a specific accident high-risk site, safety treatments with hard and <b>soft</b> <b>shoulders</b> are investigated in the simulation. The results show that the implementation of hard shoulders mitigates the risk of severe injuries...|$|R

Miniature medals are worn on the left breast below miniatures of qualification badges earned. The summer {{standard pattern}} mess dress is similar except that a white jacket with rank insignia worn on black shoulder boards, and cummerbund, is worn. Army reserve regiments are authorized to wear mess dress that is distinctive to the regiment and which can consist of jackets of different cuts (for example high collar) and colours, rather than the standard pattern mess dress.

5000|$|General of the Army (abbreviated as GA) is a five-star general {{officer and}} the second highest {{possible}} rank in the United States Army. A General of the Army ranks immediately above a general and is equivalent to a fleet admiral and a General of the Air Force.
