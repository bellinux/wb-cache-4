Billy Gunn, however, used the chair to his {{advantage}} by performing an offense maneuver on Crash Holly that caused his head to <b>slam</b> <b>into</b> the chair which was lying in the ring. Therefore, the Hollys won the match by disqualification.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and <b>slam</b> <b>into</b> enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode <b>slam</b> <b>into</b> the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur {{even in an}} idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.|$|E

25|$|The fifth {{match of}} Triplemanía XX {{was also a}} Hair vs. Hair match, contested for the hairs of Joaquín and Dorian Roldán. Joaquin led his team of Electroshock and L.A. Park into the arena, {{followed}} by Dorian {{and his team of}} Jeff Jarrett and Kurt Angle. The rudo team was also accompanied by Karen Jarrett, Jeff's wife and the former wife of Angle. Towards the end of the match, as referee Piero was busy keeping Karen out of the ring, Dorian entered and attacked Electroshock, which led to also his father entering the ring and telling him to get out. Dorian looked like he was about to leave the ringside area, only to return with La Sociedad member and half of the AAA World Tag Team Champions, Abyss, by his side. After a hot tag, L.A. Park was in control of his opponents, which led to Abyss entering the ring, only for Park to dropkick him out and hit him with a suicide dive. At this point, Dorian again entered the ring, but was followed by Joaquín, who dropped his son with a clothesline. As Jarrett went for diving crossbody, Park moved, which resulted in him taking out referee Piero instead. Park rolled Jarrett in an inside cradle, but Piero was unable to make the count. Abyss then once again entered the ring and hit Park with a chokeslam. He went to perform the same move on Electroshock, but got hit with a cutter instead. Electroshock then countered Angle's finishing maneuver, the Angle <b>Slam,</b> <b>into</b> an arm drag, before hitting him also with the cutter. Electroshock pinned Angle, as Park jumped on top of him, and scored the three count for the win, forcing Dorian Roldán to have his head shaved bald. However, before the shaving took place, Joaquín asked his son to disband La Sociedad and return to AAA, which led to Dorian apologizing for his actions and agreeing to disband the rudo stable. Jarrett tried to protest, but was shut down by Electroshock. Joaquín then announced {{that he did not want}} his son to be shaved, drawing the ire of L.A. Park. Suddenly, Dorian attacked his father, while Jarrett and Angle did the same to Electroshock and Park. Dorian then shaved his father's head, before leading La Sociedad out of the ring. Park, infuriated by what had happened, went to AAA president Marisela Peña Roldán, the wife of Joaquín and the mother of Dorian, and told her that she should have never let Joaquín get his hands on Antonio Peña's company.|$|E

500|$|Conker's {{abilities}} are far simpler {{than those of}} previous Rare platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. Conker also has a few other physical abilities. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, climb ladders or ropes, and {{is strong enough to}} push heavy objects. To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of [...] "anti-gravity" [...] Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. Additionally, the game employs [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the [...] "B" [...] button atop them. For instance, {{in the beginning of the}} game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to <b>slam</b> <b>into</b> the ground, and some are also used to pull out his shotgun, to activate his throwing knives, slingshot and so on. They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next.|$|E

2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to <b>slam</b> <b>into</b> me for not reading enough, for being generally immature.

2500|$|The early 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene developed slam dancing (also called moshing), a {{style of}} dance in which participants push or <b>slam</b> <b>into</b> each other, and stage diving. Moshing works {{as a vehicle for}} expressing anger by [...] "represent a way of playing at violence or roughness that allowed participants to mark their difference from the banal niceties of middle-class culture." [...] Moshing is in another way a [...] "parody of violence," [...] that nevertheless leaves participants bruised and sometimes bleeding. The term mosh came into use in the early 1980s American hardcore scene in Washington, D.C. A performance by Fear on the 1981 Halloween episode of Saturday Night Live was cut short when slam dancers, including John Belushi and members of a few hardcore punk bands, invaded the stage, damaged studio equipment and used profanity. Those band members included John Joseph and Harley Flanagan of Cro-Mags and John Brannon of Negative Approach and Ian Mackaye of Minor Threat.
