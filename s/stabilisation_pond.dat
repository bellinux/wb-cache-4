The anaerobic-facultative pond system, located in a remote rural area, treats wastewater from the hosing down and hydraulic flushing of the milking parlour and holding yard at the farm dairy shed. A number of multi-parameter water quality field monitoring probes were permanently deployed at various locations within the two ponds to enable continuous measurement of temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen. In addition, profiling of the supernatant of both ponds was undertaken at different times of the year to examine vertical variation of the same parameters. Continuous monitoring revealed spatial homogeneity in EC and pH levels in the upper metre of both ponds. Physio-chemical parameters also appear to change uniformly across the ponds in response to external stimuli such as rainfall. Neither pond, however, exhibits homogeneity down the profile of the supernatant. Seasonal stratification is prevalent in the facultative pond suggesting poor vertical mixing, while the anaerobic pond is notably affected by sludge accumulation. A long-term pattern of rising conductivity in both ponds indicated accumulation of dissolved salt species in the system due to recirculation of reclaimed effluent for hydraulic flushing of the dairy shed. In the facultative pond, diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential and turbidity during warmer months of the year closely followed temperature swings.

At that time, twenty wastewater pond systems were recorded as existing, five of them were used to treat textile, paper mill, tannery and other industrial wastewater. However, many waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>ponds</b> systems are ineffective because of poor operation and maintenance, design and configuration mistakes and the mixing of municipal and industrial wastes.

The findings reported in this paper were aimed at establishing the baseline water quality before the biomanipulation of the wetland to demonstrate the impact of Kirinya West wetland in treating secondary municipal effluent from the existing waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>ponds.</b> The bio-manipulation of the wetland will entail spreading the effluent from the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>ponds</b> over the northern edges of the wetland so as to increase the treatment area of the wetland and hence its treatment efficiency.

40|$|Start-up is {{one major}} {{problem that has}} been {{identified}} {{in the operation of}} UASB and other high rate anaerobic systems. This is related to the availability of seed material and the time required to develop the required high bacterial biomass. At present it is difficult to obtain a large amount of seed material to start-up a full scale UASB reactor because full scale operational reactors are located in {{only a limited number of}} places. Therefore the use of other seed materials is essential. In this thesis start-up of UASB reactors using abattoir wastewater <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond</b> sludge was examined. Enhancing the rate of start-up with non-granular sludge is consequently a problem, because the dispersed nature of non-granular sludge limits its amount within a reactor making it easier to washout. This can result in a long period of start-up because the organic loading is highly dependent on the amount of sludge in the reactor. The use of centrifuged sludge may overcome this problem. It was hypothesised that the solids particles would be agglomerated and this would improve sludge retention, resulting in a greater number of the right type of microorganisms retained in the reactor. A study was carried out to examine the feasibility of using centrifuged sludge in the start-up of UASB reactors to test the above hypothesis and to follow the development of the sludge during start-up. Three sets of experiments were carried out. The first set of experiments was employed to determine if the methanogenic activity of abattoir wastewater <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond</b> sludge deteriorated due to centrifugation. Initially the sludge from different ponds in the treatment facilities was tested for methanogenic activity. The results show that the best source of sludge was the third pond in a series of 3.

40|$|Salinisation {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major cause of the progressive deterioration in the public water system in South Africa. To deal with this problem Waste <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Ponding</b> systems have been used by the Leather Processing Industry as zero-dischaJ;ge wastewater evaporation disposal processes in water-limited inland regions of the country. While effective in the evaporation disposal function these systems are plagued by the generation of serious odour nuisance creating intractable environmental problems relating to adjacent residential communities. High loading to ponds of organic compounds, sulphides and ammonia results in strongly reducing anaerobic conditions prevailing in early parts of pond cascades. These are characterised by bright red colours due to the predominance of purple photosynthetic bacteria. Sporadic micro algal blooms of Spirulina sp. and Dunaliella sp. had been previously noted to occur on the latter ponds in these cascades, and were associated with their conversion to facultative function, with aerobic surface layers, and a marked reduction in odour release. This research programme undertook an investigation of the microbial ecology of a tannery waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>ponding</b> system to describe factors which give rise to these blooms, and to determine whether microalgal growth may be manipulated to achieve a reliable oxygengenerating capping of the anaerobic ponds. The predominance of near pure cultures of Spin/lina platensis was demonstrated for the blooms and factors restricting its growth in the system were described. These include the interaction of ammonia and sulphide toxic effects and laboratory studies were undertaken to show how effluent loading may be regulated to enable effective growth of the cyanobacterium. At appropriate dilutions of tannery effluent an enhancement of growth was noted, compared to growth in defined mineral medium. An investigation of this phenomenon provided preliminary evidence for organic uptake by the pond micro algae and a possible contribution to heterotrophic nutrition. The manipulation of Spirulina sp. growth in a High Rate Algal Pond raceway was undertaken in outdoor pilot plant studies and the effect of microalgal capping of the anaerobic ponds in the cascade was demonstrated by activating a recycle loop from a blooming facultative pond. Heavy metal contaminants were effectively eliminated by an optimisation of the primary anaerobic pond function and precipitation as metal sulphides. Biomass was harvested and dried, during which a range of methods were evaluated. Toxicological studies were undertaken on the dried biomass using Artemia and chick assays, and feed studies showed its useful application in rations for the abalone Haliotlls midae and rainbow trout Onchorhynchlls mykiss. Based on positive independent assessment of research outcomes, a decision was made by the tanning company operating the Waste <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Ponding</b> system, to proceed to the construction of a full-scale 2 500 m 2 High Rate Algal Pond raceway. This would be used for controlled Spirlilina biomass production to effect a practical capping of the anaerobic ponds in the system, and to evaluate its commercial potential in the feed market. The Advanced Integrated Wastewater Ponding System described by Oswald (1991) provided the conceptual basis for the Algal Biotechnology process development undertaken. The studies of the microbial ecology and the biotechnological potential of this system have shown that a Spirulina-based High Rate Algal Ponding process can be engineered {{in such a way that}} saline tannery effluents may be treated to effect a significant reduction in overall pollution load, that biomass may be recovered as a value added product of the treatment process and that the operational performance of Waste <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Ponding</b> systems, and hence their immediate environment, may be improved by the use of the High Rate Algal Pond as a retrofitted upgrading unit operation. ...|$|R

40|$|Waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond</b> (WSP) {{technology}} offers some important advantages and interesting possibilities when {{viewed in the}} light of sustainable energy and carbon management. Pond systems stand out as having significant advantages due to simple construction; low (or zero) operating energy requirements; and the potential for bio-energy generation. Conventional WSP requires little or no electrical energy for aerobic treatment as a result of algal photosynthesis. Sunlight enables WSP to disinfect wastewaters very effectively without the need for any chemicals or electricity consumption and their associated CO 2 emissions. The energy and carbon emission savings gained over electromechanical treatment systems are immense. Furthermore, because algal photosynthesis consumes CO 2, WSP can be utilised as CO 2 scrubbers. The environmental and financial benefits of pond technology broaden further when considering the low-cost, energy production opportunities of anaerobic ponds and the potential of algae as a biofuel. As we assess future best practice in wastewater treatment technology, perhaps one of the greatest needs is an improved consideration of the carbon footprint and the implications of future increases in the cost of electricity and the value of biogas. ...|$|E

They require little technical attention during operation {{and are less}} demanding in terms of construction cost and energy consumption than other engineered wastewater treatment systems.

After reviewing a large number of pond systems operated in Australia, Wood et al.

It is therefore required that the hydrodynamic retention time distribution be precisely understood so that the hydrodynamic behaviour and the overall treatment efficiency of WSPs can be accurately evaluated.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} on the algal community structure in waste stabilisation ponds is limited {{and it is}} unclear how physicalâ€“chemical changes affect the algal community structure and the treatment performance of waste stabilisation ponds. In the present paper we studied the spatial distribution of the algal community in a waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond</b> in Cuenca (Ecuador) and found that the distribution was associated with the BOD concentration of the system. At the upstream end of the facultative pond where the BOD value is relatively high (74 mg Lâˆ’ 1), the community is dominated by motile algal species such as Euglena and Cryptophytes. More downstream, the algal community is more evenly distributed (G = 0. 26 > 0. 18) and also non-motile species such as Chlorophytes and Chrysophytes are present. Throughout the ponds, the reduction of motile algal species was associated with the decrease in BOD concentration. The dominance of Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta and Euglenophyta was highly associated with BOD concentration. Furthermore, it was concluded that the algal abundance (45541 cells mLâˆ’ 1), diversity (D = 0. 85), evenness (G = 0. 26) and richness (20. 97) of the community in the maturation pond were higher than those of the facultative pond.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamical modelling and the parameter identification of a waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond.</b> First, a dynamical model of the pond is proposed, based on mass balances in the first basin. It involves a reaction network involving eight (bio) chemical reactions, and in particular the (chemical or biochemical) oxidation of H(2) S. The height of the pond is divided into two layers: the upper layer (approximate depth: 0. 8 m), and the lower layer (about 0. 2 m). Three microorganism populations are considered: microalgae and aerobic bacteria (in the upper layer), and sulphate-reducing anaerobic bacteria (in the lower layer). The Droop model is introduced to emphasise the potential activity of microalgae when daylight has disappeared (sunset). The transport of organic matter between the two layers is also considered in the model. The derivation is based on collected data and intensive follow-up of a specific pond at the village of Rethondes in Northern France. The parameters of the model are then identified {{on the basis of these}} data by considering data in spring, summer and autumn. The calibration of the model parameters is a challenging problem because of the large number of parameters, the limited number of available experimental data and the model complexity.

40|$|Treated {{wastewater}} (TWW) reuse in South Africa {{is historically}} limited to irrigation of recreation facilities (sports fields, urban parklands). In rare instances, uses of these waters are allowed for food-related {{activities such as}} fodder production. Environmental health practitioners discourage reuse of TWW for aquaculture and production of edible crops for fear of adverse health effects. However, South Africa is a semi-arid county with erratic rainfall patterns. Demands from communities in and around urban areas to use treated wastewater for food production in small-scale farming practices are rapidly increasing. The Department of Health applies the South African Guidelines for the Permissible Re-Use of Treated Sewage Effluents (1978) to help regulate reuse of treated wastewater. The Guideline approach appears to favour the treatment method- and configuration that produces the effluent- as a benchmark for decision-making rather than the actual quality of such effluent. Reuse applications that involve more elaborate treatment facilities (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment processes within the configuration) would generally be favourably considered for purposes of food production and recreation-related applications. Applications for the reuse of effluent from waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond</b> systems (WSP) are generally discouraged- regardless of the effluent quality. To illustrate this discrepancy a study was undertaken {{over a period of}} twelve months to assess the levels of faecal coliform bacteria in the effluent of tw...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{of using the}} planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna as a commercial source of chitin was studied {{on the basis of}} the estimation of the amount of chitin produced annually by this species and the specifications of this kind of chitin. D. magna was found to have a significant chitin content, ranging from 3 % to 7 % of the body dry weight. During three consecutive years, chitin biomass (B) and daily somatic chitin production (daily P-SOM) were monitored in a 59, 000 -m(2) aerated waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>pond</b> located in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg (Western Europe). These variables were found to vary a lot seasonally. Maximum values were observed in summer (B > 40 kg chitin; daily P-SOM > 20 kg chitin day(- 1)). Annual somatic chitin production reached on average 1200 kg chitin year(- 1). The amount of chitin generated by the moulting of the daphnids (i. e. chitin contained in the exuviae) can also constitute a significant source of chitin, reaching about 1220 kg chitin year(- 1). Chitin was isolated from D. magna, following three different processing routes. The specifications of the isolated and purified chitin were similar to those of commercial chitin extracted from crabs and shrimps. The average molecular weight varied from 600, 000 to 2, 600, 000 depending on the processing route, The isolated chitin had a low N content indicating a high degree of acetylation.

40|$|Effective {{modelling}} of. {{shallow water}} ecosystems, including waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>ponds,</b> is strongly {{dependent on the}} availability of good estimates of the light attenuation coefficient k (m(- 1)). Experimental data is presented on its determination using purpose-built laboratory apparatus with a near-parallel halogen light source and an array of photodiodes allowing measurements of irradiance at different depths. The equipment was used to compare k values from different pure cultures, and mixed cultures of algae taken from a pilot-scale WSP. Laboratory values were compared with in situ measurements in the pond. At concentrations above 50 mg 1 (- 1) the relationship between k and suspended solids is non-linear; k also varied with depth. This could be modelled by a single equation, suggesting similarity of response in different cultures. At shallow depths and low suspended solids concentrations k values are variable and hard to measure reliably. The results highlight the need to standardise on a method for the measurement and reporting of k values if these are to be widely applicable in the development of pond models...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} investigated some {{factors influencing}} {{the rate of}} stabilisation of wastewater in the spring period in continental climate waste <b>stabilisation</b> <b>ponds,</b> {{and in particular the}} potential for bringing forward the discharge date by optimising storage capacity and dilution. Experiments using pilot and model-scale ponds were set up in Almaty, Kazakhstan. These simulated operating regimes for a facultative and storage/maturation pond system subject to ice cover from late November until late March. Two pilot-scale facultative ponds were operated at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 20 and 30 days, with surface loading rates of 100 and 67 kg BOD ha- 1 day- 1. Effluent from the 20 -day HRT facultative pond was then fed to two pilot-scale storage/maturation ponds which had been partially emptied and allowed to refill over the winter period with no removal of effluent. The paper discusses the results of the experiments with respect to selection of an operating regime to make treated wastewater available early in the spring. Preliminary results indicate that there may be potential for alternative operating protocols designed to maximise their performance and economic potential...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, {{wastewater}} disposal {{in the wine}} and distilling industry is undergoing a profound transformation {{as a result of}} fundamental changes in regulations and license requirements. To deal with this problem conventional Waste <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Ponding</b> systems have been used by the industry together with irrigation and evaporation disposal practises. Although effective in the evaporation and containment disposal functions, these pond systems are generally not properly designed and/or managed, resulting in overloading and, at times, the generation of seriously offensive odour problems. Preliminary studies on the feasibility of utilising the Advanced Integrated Wastewater Ponding System as a core treatment technology in winery wastewater treatment were conducted. Results indicated that specific problems had to be addressed before successful ponding treatment could be achieved. This research programme undertook an investigation of the performance of a demonstration ponding system treating household sewage, which formed the basis of the research due to limited experience reported on ponds treating wine industry wastewaters. Malfunctions identified were in correlation with the preliminary winery waste ponding survey, which included unstable fermentation pit functions and inadequate nutrient removal. Retrofitting the fermentation pit with a nylon net across the rising water column resulted in improved retention of active anaerobic sludge, especially during periods of system start-up and/or organic overloading. An investigation into nutrient removal utilising algal biomass provided a valuable contribution towards development of an independent nutrient removal system. Harvested algal biomass was passively manipulated to release polysaccharides under anoxic conditions, with subsequent use as a carbon source by denitrifying organisms. Following denitrification, the still viable algal cells were introduced into a High Rate Algal Pond raceway for photosynthetically produced alkalinity. This high pH environment resulted in induced calcium phosphate mineral formation and subsequent precipitation, as well as effective ammonia stripping from the water. Based on the novel positive research outcomes a decision was made to proceed to the construction of a pilot-scale integrated ponding system treating wastewater from a wine lees factory. The system linked the Anaerobic Baffle Reactor, for pre-treatment, with the improved Advanced Integrated Wastewater Ponding System. The potential of this system has shown that a Waste <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Ponding</b> system can be engineered to treat wine industry wastewaters and thereby effectively reduce the organic and nutrient loads, by using low-cost retrofitted upgrading unit operations. Valuable algal biomass may also be recovered as a by-product of the treatment process...|$|R
