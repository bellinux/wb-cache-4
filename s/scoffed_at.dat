25|$|On September24, an undaunted Yeltsin {{announced}} {{presidential elections}} for June 1994. The same day, the Congress of People's Deputies voted to hold simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections by March 1994. Yeltsin <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> the parliament-backed proposal for simultaneous elections, and responded {{the next day}} by cutting off electricity, phone service, and hot water in the parliament building.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, Aeneas Coffey {{patented}} the Coffey still, {{allowing for}} cheaper {{and more efficient}} distillation of whisky. In 1850, Andrew Usher began producing a blended whisky that mixed traditional pot still whisky with that from the new Coffey still. The new distillation method was <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> by some Irish distillers, who clung to their traditional pot stills. Many Irish contended that the new product was, in fact, not whisky at all.|$|E
25|$|Hubble's {{findings}} fundamentally {{changed the}} scientific {{view of the}} universe. Supporters state that Hubble's discovery of nebulae outside of our galaxy helped {{pave the way for}} future astronomers. Although some of his more renowned colleagues simply <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> his results, Hubble ended up publishing his findings on nebulae. This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.|$|E

25|$|Allenby {{arrived on}} 27 June 1917. Robertson (31 July) {{wanted him to}} keep active so as to prevent the Turks concentrating forces in Mesopotamia, {{although}} he <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> intelligence reports that the Germans might send as many as 160,000 men to that theatre. Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but {{the extent of his}} advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in “secret and personal” notes (1 and 10 August).|$|E
25|$|Just a year later, however, John II of Castile {{died and}} was succeeded by Henry IV. Barrientos did not fare well {{opposite}} the new king, whom he considered ineffectual {{and lacking in}} character. Henry IV {{was known as the}} impotent for his unconsummated marriage to Blanche II of Navarre. Barrientos <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> Henry for his failure to act in the face of rumors impugning his character, such as the infidelity of the queen with one of his confidants, and talk of his homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti adored twins {{when they}} were born within the royal family because they were seen {{as a sign of}} {{impending}} fortune. Ordinarily, boy twins joined the army and twin girls potential wives of the King. If the twins are a boy and girl, no particular career awaits them. Women who bear triplets are greatly honored because three is regarded as a lucky number. Special rituals ensue for the third, sixth, and ninth child. The fifth child (unlucky five) can expect misfortune. Families with many children are well respected and barren women <b>scoffed</b> <b>at.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of the dog {{was published in the}} Connecticut Quarterly, (April–June, 1898), by New York geologist W.H.C. Pynchon. According to Pynchon, in February 1891 he and geologist Herbert Marshall of the USGS were conducting geologic research in the Hanging Hills when they saw the dog. Pynchon had seen the dog once before. Marshall, who had seen the dog twice, <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> the legend. Shortly after the two of them saw the dog, Marshall slipped on the ice atop one of the cliffs and plunged to his death. His body was recovered by authorities. Reports of the Black Dog continue to circulate today.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, More Fun Comics #101 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Superboy, establishing that Superman began his superhero career as a child. This issue showed Krypton in much greater detail than before, as a scientifically advanced world. Kryptonians {{did not appear to}} possess superhuman powers on Krypton but were aware that a Kryptonian on Earth would have them. In this story, Superman's biological parents were named Jor-El and Lara. Jor-El attempted to convince the Supreme Council that their world was doomed and that they must take action. The Council <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> Jor-El's warnings, so he returned home to save his family, if nobody else. But Jor-El was only able to save his son.|$|E
25|$|Alan reveals to Dysart {{that during}} his youth, he had {{established}} his attraction to horses {{by way of}} his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, Western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding. Alan's sexual training began with his mother who {{told him he could}} find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time, Alan also begins to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> the father and rode off.|$|E

25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft, however, {{hoped that}} the Xbox would succeed where the Dreamcast had failed. The company {{determined}} that intense online gaming required the throughput of a broadband connection and the storage space of a hard disk drive, and thus these features would be vital to the new platform. This would allow not only for significant downloadable content, such as new levels, maps, weapons, challenges and characters, to be downloaded quickly and stored, but also would {{make it possible to}} standardize bandwidth intensive features such as voice communication. Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates both had a vision of making premium download content and add-ons that would attract many new customers. Based on this reasoning, the console included a standard Ethernet port (10/100) in order to provide connectivity to common broadband networks, but did not include a modem or any dial-up support, and its online service was designed to support broadband users only. Critics <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> it, citing poor broadband adoption {{at the turn of the}} century.|$|E
25|$|During 1965 it {{was decided}} to make Northern Songs a public company to reduce their income tax burden. 1,250,000 shares were traded on the London Stock Exchange, which were worth 17 pence each ($0.28), but were offered at 66 pence ($1.09) each. Although the trade was <b>scoffed</b> <b>at</b> by various {{financial}} institutions, it was expected that the application lists would not remain open for more than 60 seconds, which is exactly what happened, as the lists were oversubscribed. After the offer was closed, Lennon and McCartney owned 15% each, worth £195,200 ($320,000), NEMS a 7.5% interest, and James and Silver (who served as Northern Songs' chairmen), controlling 37.5%, with Harrison and Starr sharing 1.6%. The remaining shares were owned by various financial institutions. At the same time, Lennon and McCartney renewed their previous three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973. Harrison also signed with the company in 1965, for a period of three years. To protect his interests, James took out a life insurance policy of £500,000 on Lennon and McCartney. By the summer of 1966, 88 songs by Lennon and McCartney had been recorded and released, amounting to 2,900 versions by different artists.|$|E
