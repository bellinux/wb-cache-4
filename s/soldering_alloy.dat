30|$|As an example, in Fig. 5  (b) {{one can see}} how solderjet bumping {{technology}} was used to assemble a 1  mm FS cube resulting in a stress that is non-measurable by a polarimeter device (< 0.1  MPa), due to {{the small amount of}} <b>soldering</b> <b>alloy</b> and reflow energy used. In addition, in the case of Fig. 5 (c) and (d), one can appreciate how the stress follows an analogous distribution pattern with similar values of measured and simulated stress, respectively. The stress measurement for components below 1  mm size was difficult to analyze due to the minimum size (millimeters range) and resolution (0.1  MPa) of the polarimeter device. However, given that the results of the real-soldered cases with cube sizes of 2  mm and 1  mm are in agreement with the simulated measurements, we assume that results would be consistent in the case for smaller cube sizes.|$|E

Concerning with the toxicity of lead in Sn- 37 Pb <b>solder</b> <b>alloy,</b> developing lead free <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> with low melting temperature {{is one of the most}} important issues in electronic industry. Previously, researchers found out that the most promising candidate of lead free <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> is Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC). However, the melting temperature of this <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> is 217 °C, 34 °C higher than Sn- 37 Pb. This can lead to high energy consumption in electronic industry.

40|$|Trabajo presentado al EXRS 2016 - European Conference on X-ray Spectrometry, celebrada en Gothenburg (Suecia) del 19 al 24 de junio de 2016. This work {{arises in}} {{response}} to the need to understand the production techniques of pre-roman gold jewels, starting from the systematic characterization of the different methods of metal joining used in antiquity to produce these objects. To meet this requirement, different procedures used in antiquity were reproduced by means of experimental archaeology. These models correspond to three metal-joining methods reported by ancient recipes: solid-state diffusion with copper salt, brazing and autogenous welding. These techniques were studied by different analytical methods in order to characterize them at both compositional and microstructural level (SEM-EDS, metallography, μ-XRF and μ-PIXE). The results obtained show that the solid-state diffusion bonding with copper salt presents a crystal hexagonal structure without phase changes in the joining point, where only a variation in the grain size is observed. At the compositional level, this soldering method is characterized by a local increase in copper concentration and a small decrease in gold content. In contrast, brazing shows a dendritic-porous structure due to the superposition of the <b>soldering</b> <b>alloy</b> and the crystal structure of the original foils. Besides, the compositional analysis revealed an increment of silver and copper concentrations and a simultaneous reduction of gold concentration. Finally, in the autogenous welding, no changes at the microstructural and compositional levels were observed. The results obtained have also demonstrated the usefulness of a portable μ-XRF system for the in-situ characterization of ancient jewels.

[EN]: This manuscript collects {{the results}} obtained in the investigation carried out during the PhD studies about the non-destructive characterization of archaeological gold jewelry, developed mainly within the investigation project: Riqueza, valor y precio: el metal como referente en las sociedades mediterraneas (s. V a. C. - I d. C.), supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation. Gold and gold artifacts are excellent objects for unraveling the secret of ancient times and its society from their ambivalent character as condensed wealth and that basis of power, but also as transcendental symbols of eternal life and beauty, also considering {{that the work of}} gold {{was one of the first}} metallurgical techniques performed by man. This work arises in response to the need to understand and study the production techniques of pre-romans jewelries, starting from the systematic characterization of the different soldering methods used in the antiquity to produce these objects. To reach this aim, a portable device of X-rays fluorescence was designed and developed. This system allows to analyze in situ micrometric details of the archaeological jewelry by means of a micro-beam, for example, the soldering area of antiquity jewelries. The results obtained have demonstrated that using a focalization optics device, provides a high flux density of X-rays in the sample and a lateral resolution of 30 µm. The sensibility and the detection limits of this device allow to analyze the majority, minority and trace elements. In a second stage, before moving to the archaeological jewelry studies, models of the production processes used in the antiquity, by means of the experimental archaeology were performed. These models reproduce the three soldering/welding methods, reported by an ancient recipe: solid state diffusion bonding with copper salt, brazing and autogenous welding. The three techniques have been studiedby different methods (SEM-EDS, metallography, micro-XRF and micro-PIXE). The results obtained show that the solid state diffusion bonding with copper salt presents a crystal hexagonal structure without phase changes in the joining point, where only a variation in the dimensions of the crystal grains is observed. At the compositional level, this kind of alloy is characterized by an increase in the copper composition and a small decrease of gold content. The brazing shows a dendritic-porous structure, due to the superposition of the <b>soldering</b> <b>alloy</b> on the crystal structure of the sheet alloy. In the compositional analysis of the brazing an increment of the silver and copper concentration and simultaneous decrease of gold concentration is observed. Finally, in the autogenous welding no changes in micro-structural and compositional level are observed. The results obtained were utilized, in the third stage of this work, to study and characterize the ancient jewelry using the micro-XRF system. Several objects representative of two coetaneous cultures from the Mediterranean Basin, Tartesic and Etruscan, were analyzed. Tartesic were a civilization located in the South-West of the Iberian Peninsula, from the Bronze Age to the 4 th century B. C. The studied objects are a group of pieces belonging to the El Carambolo treasure, which is the most representative example of Tartesic jewelry. The results obtained have showed a good homogeneity in the alloys composition and the use of autogenous welding and brazing as joining method. Besides, some similarities and differences in the production processes have been observed, which supports the hypothesis that these objects were produced in the same workshop, where there was a collaboration between different goldsmiths using different techniques. As example of Etruscan jewelry, a group of objects belonging to the Florence Archaeological Museum (Italy), dated from 7 th to 3 dh B.

40|$|As {{soldering}} {{controls the}} effective usage and processing of electronic components in applications and devices. Solders {{are used as}} interconnect materials in microelectronic packaging. Traditionally Pb-Sn eutectic alloys have been used due to its low melting point and good wettability. However, due to the toxic nature of lead (Pb) and it harmful effect on environment and health the usage of Pb in solder should be avoided. This is why {{there is a need}} to develop environmentally benign Pb-free solders (LFS). In this research work four different lead free <b>solder</b> <b>alloys,</b> Sn-Cu, Sn-Ag, Sn-Bi, Sn-Zn, and Sn-Pb are developed and characterized. Eutectic Sn- 0. 7 wt. % Cu, Sn- 3. 5 wt. % Ag, Sn- 57 wt. % Bi, Sn- 8. 8 wt. % Zn and Sn- 37 wt % Pb <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> have been developed by melting and casting route. A comparative study of all the five alloys was done based on their microstructure and various properties like electrical resistivity, hardness, fractography and wettability on Cu substrate. Their microstructure of the alloys was analyzed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The various phases in the alloys were analyzed using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attached to the SEM. The nature of fracture in the alloys was analyzed using SEM. The melting point of the alloys was determined using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Hardness of the alloys was determined using a Vicker‟s microhard ness tester. The wettability of the <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> on Cu substrate was analyzed using SEM. Electrical resistivity of all the alloys were determined using a four point electrical probe. The objective of this study is to find out the <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> among the four eutectic <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> chosen here which could replace the traditional Sn-Pb <b>solder</b> <b>alloy...</b>|$|R
