40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} prekindergarten predictors of listening comprehension in <b>second</b> <b>grade.</b> Methods: Within a large, 5 -year longitudinal study, children progressing from prekindergarten to <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> were administered a comprehensive set of prekindergarten measures of foundational language skills (vocabulary and grammar), higher-level language skills (inferencing, comprehension monitoring, and text structure knowledge), listening comprehension, working memory, and nonverbal processing, as well as <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> measures of listening comprehension. Results: A prekindergarten measure of listening comprehension—the Test of Narrative Language—and a prekindergarten measure of foundational language skills and working memory—the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals- 4 Recalling Sentences—were significant predictors of <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> listening comprehension. Conclusions: Our findings show that a quick, reliable measure of sentence imitation and/or listening comprehension, administered in prekindergarten, provides insight into a child's <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> listening comprehension. Knowing who is at risk for comprehension failure will allow educators to make informed, evidence-based decisions on the need for further in-depth assessment and language-intensive instruction to stave off future reading disabilities...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{analysis}} {{is made to}} the two-dimensional axisymmetric flow and heat transfer of a modified <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> fluid over an isothermal non-linear radially stretching sheet. The momentum and energy equations are modelled and the boundary layer equations are derived. The governing equations for velocity and temperature are turned down into a system of ordinary differential equations by invoking appropriate transformations which are then solved numerically via fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta Fehlberg method. Moreover, {{the influence of the}} pertinent parameters namely the generalized <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> parameter, stretching parameter, the power-law index and the generalized Prandtl number is graphically portrayed. It is inferred that the generalized <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> parameter uplifted the momentum boundary layer while lessened the thermal boundary layer. Furthermore, the impact of stretching parameter is more pronounced for the <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> fluid (m =  0) in contrast with the power-law fluid (k =  0). For some special cases, comparisons are made with previously reported results and an excellent agreement is established.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the quality of English summative test taken by the {{students}} of MAN Boarding School Meulaboh I in terms of validity, reliability, difficulty index, discrimination index, {{and the effectiveness of}} distractors. Content analysis was employed in this study. Two techniques were carried out to collect the data, namely checklist and document analysis. The data from checklist were analyzed by using a statistical procedure in percentage form and the data from document analysis were analyzed by using Anates Software version 4. The results showed that English summative test in the context of content analysis of the first grade has sufficient validity, the <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> has poor validity, and the third grade has a very poor validity. However, in terms of construct validity the first grade and the third grade have poor construct validity, while the <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> has sufficient construct validity. Meanwhile, in terms of validity coefficient, the first grade and the third grade is 60 % and the <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> is 44 %. Secondly, English summative test of MAN Boarding School has a consistent degree of reliability. The reliability index of the first <b>grade</b> and the <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> test is 0. 70 and the third grade is 0. 88. Thirdly, 60 % of the test in the first grade test, 48 % of which in the <b>second</b> <b>grade,</b> and 8 % of which in the third grade test are accepted. It means that the third grade has a very poor difficulty index. Fourthly, a good discrimination index of the test in the first grade is 76 %, <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> is 56 %, and the third grade is 72 %. In other words, more than half of discrimination index is good.
