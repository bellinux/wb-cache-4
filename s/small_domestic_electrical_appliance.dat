Game-theoretic DSM is an appealing decentralized approach for collaboratively scheduling the usage of <b>domestic</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> within a set of households while meeting the users' preferences about the usage time. The drawback of distributed DSM protocols is that they require each user to communicate his/her own energy consumption patterns, which may leak sensitive information regarding private habits.

We evaluate the noise power and the number of users required to achieve a given privacy level, quantified by means of the increase of the information entropy of the aggregated energy consumption pattern. The performance of our proposed DSM system is compared to the one of a benchmark system that does not support privacy preservation in terms of total bill, peak demand, and convergence time. Results show that privacy can be improved at the cost of increasing the peak demand and the number of game iterations, whereas the total bill is only marginally incremented...|$|R

Based on this, an algorithm with accompanying flowchart was developed; and implemented using a script file written in MATLAB environment. Results obtained for the residential (R 2) class indicated that the percentage changes from the unconstrained bill to the constrained bill are 4. 3 % reduction for one line users, 8. 6 % increase for two lines users, 21. 6 % increase for the three lines users in the single phase category and 29. 4 % increase for the three phase, three lines users in the proposed system.

The use of <b>domestic</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> has increased and mobile telephones are used extensively all over the world. Several epidemiological {{studies have indicated that}} exposure to EMFs may be associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia and other cancers, and this has caused great interest in the field. Some positive data have indicated a correlation between exposure to environmental low frequency EMFs and DNA damage or chromosomal aberrations, which may induce certain kinds of disease. However, it has also been strongly suggested that no such relationship exists between EMF exposure and carcinogenesis, or that, if there is a relationship, it is only a weak one. In addition to the conflicting and contradictory views on extremely low frequency EMFs, there is also controversy surrounding the effects of high frequency electromagnetic fields (HFEMFs). HFEMFs are particularly used in mobile communication, and hence there is considerable interest in the possible effects of HFEMFs on human health. In order to investigate the properties of HFEMFs, we have examined the effects of 2. 45 GHz electromagnetic fields on micronucleus (MN) formation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) -K 1 cells. MN formation is induced by chromosomal breakage or inhibition of spindles during cell division and leads to cell damage.

Humans use colours to {{give meaning to}} objects and to express their feelings, either visually either verbally. While colours and their associations may differ in different societies, their objectives in use are similar (like religious associations, status symbols, and to add aesthetic values, etc.). Whatever are the pleasures, styles or fashions of the time, the importance of colour’s role in desirability of an object remains constant. Especially, in the post-Industrial Revolution era with the progression the field of communication, the cultural differences between societies decreased. Thus at the 20 th Century with the international design movements colour became a common language {{in the field of}} design.

40|$|Includes bibliography. Electrical {{energy is}} the life line to every nation’s or {{continent}} development and economic progress. Referable to the recent growth in the demand for electricity and shortage in production, it is indispensable to develop strategies for effective energy management and system delivery. Load monitoring such as intrusive load monitoring, non-intrusive load monitoring, and identification of <b>domestic</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>appliances</b> is proposed especially at the residential level {{since it is the}} major energy consumer. The intrusive load monitoring provides accurate results and would allow each individual appliance's energy consumption to be transmitted to a central hub. Nevertheless, there are many practical disadvantages to this method that have motivated the introduction of non-intrusive load monitoring system. The fiscal cost of manufacturing and installing enough monitoring devices to match the number of domestic appliances {{is considered to be a}} disadvantage. In addition, the installation of one meter per household appliances would lead to congestion in the house and thus cause inconvenience to the occupants of the house, therefore, non-intrusive load monitoring technique was developed to alleviate the aforementioned challenges of intrusive load monitoring. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is the process of disaggregating a household’s total energy consumption into its contributing appliances. The total household load is monitored via a single monitoring device such as smart meter (SM). NILM provides cost effective and convenient means of load monitoring and identification. Several nonintrusive load monitoring and identification techniques are reviewed. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive system that can identify appliances with small energy consumption, appliances with overlapping energy consumption and a group of appliance ranges at once. This has been the major setback to most of the adopted techniques. In this dissertation, we propose techniques that overcome these setbacks by combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with a developed algorithm to identify appliances ranges that contribute to the energy consumption within a given period of time usually an hour interval...|$|R

Although demand is increasing, little information exists on the domestic components that contribute {{to an increase in}} domestic energy consumption. Thus, a greater understanding on what is contributing to the increase in domestic energy usage is a pre-requisite to understand how it can be reduced in the future or, if not reduced, contained at its current level. This article discusses a separation filter designed for disaggregating <b>domestic</b> <b>electrical</b> demand data into different appliance categories. The filter is applied to a real time <b>domestic</b> <b>electrical</b> dataset spanning 1 Â year, and trends in standby, cold, heating element spikes and residual demand are identified. Several reasons to account for each of the trends are discussed. Additionally, the filter is applied to synthetic data both to confirm the accuracy of the separation filter and to finely adjust the filter for future application. The results indicate an increase in occupancy-related demand consumption during the winter months and an increase in cold consumption during the summer months. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that in contrast to changes observed in occupancy-related demand and cold consumption, there is little variation in standby and heating element spike consumption throughout the year. Finally, the potential advantage of incorporating a tailored separation filter into domestic smart meters is discussed. <b>Domestic</b> <b>Electrical</b> demand Power <b>Appliances</b> Energy Demand profiles...|$|R

The present research compares two real scenarios: Situation 1, where 100 % of the dwelling's energy is supplied with electricity only and Situation 2, where dwellings can be operated with natural gas plus electricity. The results for the environmental impacts using natural gas plus electricity show that of the Spanish environmental impacts air conditioning had the highest impact with approximately 27 - 42 % due to the electricity used to power it.
