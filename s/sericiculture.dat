40|$|Action of fenoxicarb on "Non-spinning syndrome" of {{silkworms}} in North-Eastern Italy. In 1988 {{appeared in}} North-eastern part of Italy the "non-spinning syndrome" of silkworms. It has been experimentally prooved that the incapacity of the silkworm larvae to spin their cocoon and the mortality ofthe A. mellifera brood, were {{connected with the}} drift of an agricultural pesticide (Fenoxicarb) having juvenilizing action. The use of this product, commercialisedas INSEGAR®, has been forbidden in Italy since 1991. Fenoxicarb also showed a negative action on other useful insects. The utilisation of fenoxicarb can represent a serious danger for <b>sericiculture,</b> apiculture and general biodiversity in many developing countries...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} analyze the major trade flows in the E. U. textile and {{clothing}} industry in close connection with the future development of <b>sericiculture</b> using the data provided by EU Market Access Data Base for the period 2007 - 2011. The world market of textile and clothing {{is divided into two}} parts: raw material providers mainly situated in Asia, but also in South America and large processors situated in the E. U. such as Italy, France, United Kingdom and Spain, whose contribution to the EU production is 75 %. The main E. U. supplier of raw material for textile and clothing industry is China, followed by India, Bangladesh, Turkey and Brazil. About 33 % of the E. U. production of textile and garments is successfully exported as long as demand/offer ratio is unbalanced at world level. Import and export price have substantially increased. At present, the EU is the 2 nd silk products exporter in the world. The new E. U. policy strategy regarding <b>sericiculture</b> is focused on the stimulation of silk worm rearing for producing cocoons mainly in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Spain, France and Romania where climate conditions are favorable, it is a long tradition in the field and rural population needs jobs. At the same time, the E. U. is focused on technology improvement and silk product design in order to create more value added and increase export and sales...|$|E
40|$|Claudine Salmon, Centre {{national}} de la Recherche scientifique, Paris La <b>sériciculture</b> à Sumatra Nord. De l'histoire à la légende de Job The {{history of}} sericulture in Indonesia is poorly documented. Some hints {{are to be}} found in Chinese and European records, but to the best of our knowledge local sources are almost silent. The first allusion to silkworm raising appears in the Zhufan zhi "A Description of Barbarous People" (1225) for Java. If this activity was not very successful in Java, it developed rather well in North Sumatra where it was well rooted and, with ups and downs, lasted over five centuries. It has just came to an end in the late 1980 s. This paper is divided into three parts. The first attempts to reconstruct the history of this activity as it may be perceived in various travelogues. The second relates the fascinating legend of the origin of the silkworm, which was collected in Aceh at the beginning of the 20 th century by a Dutch official. This legend, which links the worms that inhabited the sores of Ayyûb (the Job of the Bible) to the first silkworms, takes us far from China to the Middle- East and further westwards into Southern Europe. Finally, the paper reflects on the significance of this industry in the political and commercial context of North Sumatra in which Arabs, Persians and other Muslim merchants who came from India all took a part.

40|$|Abstract. Silk is {{a symbol}} of Chinese {{traditional}} garment culture, it represents the characteristics and spirits of Chinese civilization; Cheongsam is an integrated epitomization of modern Chinese civilization and western culture, and is an acknowledged quintessence of traditional Chinese garment. No matter cheongsam chooses the silk or silk chooses the cheongsam, it is the excellent match of unique material and classical style that accomplishes the elegant appearance and cultural connotations. However, in reality, cheongsam culture has been deducted but failed to come to any agreements, and presents awkward cheongsam phenomenon. This paper ascribed and explained cheongsam phenomenon, discussed the real situation and culture passing-down in terms of modern garment culture. The Value of Silk to Chinese Traditional Garment The nationality of silk. Silk is one of the Chinese civilizations that have an international influence. Up to now, its cultural connotations and beauty have won worldwide appreciation. Such are two sentences of an ancient Chinese poem, “Outside the window unfolds the cotton field; between wine glasses are the talks about mulberry and flax. ” <b>Sericiculture</b> and silk weaving are two representative agricultural activities that add to the magnificence of Chinese culture...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sericiculture</b> is {{characterized}} by the possibility of income generation in areas smaller than 10. 0 ha and by the rationalization of family labor. Even considering this favorable scenario for the development of this activity, there is still a gap in the management of its economic factors in most of the rural properties within this chain, contributing negatively to their expansion. This study aimed at assessing the production cost and economic viability for producing silkworm cocoons, by using a case study conducted in a property located in Quatá, São Paulo State, Brazil. The main results for a production of 1, 904 kg- 1 of silkworm cocoons, with labor costs reaching 51. 5 % of the Effective Operating Cost and 35. 5 % of the Total Operating Cost, were a profitability index higher than 50 % and an Internal Rate of Return of 9. 68 %, for the second production year, providing a good profitability rate for this agricultural segment, when we consider that the improved profitability of the producer is proportional to the best production indicators, particularly due to the fast return that this activity provides...|$|E
40|$|Nosema bombycis is a spore-forming obligate {{intracellular}} parasite which belongs to the fungi-related Microsporidia phylum. It is the causative agent of the silkworm Bombyx mori pebrine disease which inflicts severe worldwide economical losses in sericulture. Little is known about N. bombycis in vivo dissemination mechanism and its interactions with its natural host B. mori at the cellular or molecular level, despite the ongoing genome sequencing projects of both organisms. In this study, we investigate N. bombycis (Zhenjiang isolate ISC-ZJ) dissemination in per os infected B. mori larvae (Nistari). At different times post-infestation, larvae were harvested and B. mori larva tissues, hemocytes and hemolymph were analysed by histochemistry and immunocytochemistry microscopy (optic and transmission electron microscopy). This allowed us to document not only N. bombycis ISC-ZJ in vivo life cycle at the ultrastructural level, but also the hitherto unreported N. bombycis dissemination route in silkworm larvae. N. bombycis infestation first settles in the anterior epithelial midgut. The infection spreads to the muscles and tracheae closely surrounding the anterior midgut. Distant tissues and organs are then infected concomitantly with the apparition of the parasite in the hemolymph or internalized in hemocytes, before the systemic infestation with all tissues parasitized. Our results strongly suggest that hemolymph and hemocytes are vectors for the parasite dissemination in its host. Moreover the silkworm innate immune response, although existing -we identified N. bombycis melanization and its phagocytosis by B. mori hemocytes - seem to be strongly overtaken by the microsporidian development with underlying mechanisms still unknown. To further study the N. bombycis/B. mori interactions at the molecular level, we focused on major microsporidian structural proteins from the spore wall and the polar tube which {{are known to be}} involved in host invasion. We developed a proteomic-based approach to identify few N. bombycis proteins belonging to these cell structures. Protein extraction protocols were optimized and four N. bombycis spore protein extracts were compared by mono- and bi-dimensionnal electrophoresis to establish complementary proteomic profiles. Three proteins (71, 48 and 30 kDa) were shown to be located at the parasite spore wall using a polyclonal antibody raised against formaldehyde-fixed spores. Moreover seventeen polyclonal antibodies were raised against major N. bombycis proteins from all extracts, and three spots, spot PEL 1 (54 kDa, pI 5. 4), spot PEL 2 (36 kDa, pI 10) and spot PEL 3 (150 kDa, pI 7. 1), were shown to correspond to polar tube proteins (PTPs) by IFA and transmission electron microscopy immunocytochemistry on cryosections. These PTPs were respectively named NbPTP 1, NbPTP 2 and NbPTP 3 according to their global physio-chemical properties. Specific patterns for each PTP were obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS mass spectrometry. Peptide sequence tags were deduced by de novo sequencing using Peaks Online and DeNovoX, then evaluated by Mascot and Sequest searches. Identification parameters were higher than false-positive hits, strengthening our strategy that could be enlarged to a non-genomic context. Nosema bombycis est un parasite obligatoire intracellulaire et eukaryoitique microsporidia apparenté aux champignons. Cette microsporidie est l'agent responsable de la pébrine, maladie du ver à soie Bombyx mori qui inflige de sévères pertes économiques à la <b>sériciculture</b> mondiale. Nous avons étudié l'interactions N. bombycis-B. mori in vivo : l'infestation par N. bombycis démarre au niveau de l'épithélium intestinal antérieur, puis s'étend aux muscles et trachées adjacents. Les tissus plus distants sont ensuite infectés. Cependant, les réponses immune mélanisation et phagocytose, l'hémolymphe et les hémocytes sont les vecteurs de la dissémination de N. bombycis dans son hôte. Nous avons développé une approche protéomique pour identifier des protéines de tube polaire (PTP). Trois PTPs ont été caracterisés par immunocytochimie MET et MS/MS. Des motifs de séquence peptidique ont pu en être déduits par les programmes Peaks Online et DeNovoX, puis évalués par algorithmes Mascot et Seques...|$|E
