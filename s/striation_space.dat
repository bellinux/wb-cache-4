40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> {{may be related to the}} crack growth rate, da/dN, through Paris equation, as well as the maximum and minimum loads under service loading conditions. These loads define the load ratio, R, and are {{considered}} impossible to be evaluated from the inter-spacing striations analysis. In this way, this study discusses the methodology proposed by Furukawa to evaluate the maximum and minimum loads based on the experimental fact that the relative height of a striation, H, and the <b>striation</b> <b>spacing,</b> s, are strongly influenced by the load ratio, R. Fatigue tests in C(T) specimens were conducted on SAE 7475 -T 7351 Al alloy plates at room temperature and the results showed a straightforward correlation between the parameters H, s, and R. Measurements of striation height, H, were performed using scanning electron microscopy and field emission gun (FEG) after sectioning the specimen at a large inclined angle to amplify the height of the striations. The results showed that for increasing R the values of H/s tend to increase. <b>Striation</b> height, <b>striation</b> <b>spacing,</b> and load ratio correlations were obtained, which allows one to estimate service loadings from fatigue fracture surface survey...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> resulting from fatigue crack growth in dentin of human teeth. Compact tension (CT) specimens obtained from coronal dentin of patients of two age groups (young 50 years) were subjected to cyclic Mode I loads. Fracture surfaces of the CT specimens were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and contact profilometer. A power spectrum analysis of the surface profiles showed that the <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> ranged from 50 to 170 μm. In old dentin (125 ± 23 μm) the spacing was significantly larger than that in young dentin (93 ± 27 μm), suggesting that the mechanisms contributing to crack tip blunting were potentially suppressed by changes in structure of this tissue with age. Fatigue crack growth striations were also identified and examined on cracks that underwent extension in vivo. The <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> for in vivo cracks was within the range resulting from the in vitro evaluation.

40|$|A new optical-electronic {{method has}} been {{developed}} to detect <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> of single muscle fibers. The technique avoids Bragg-angle and interference-fringe effects associated with laser light diffraction by using polychromatic (white) light. The light is diffracted once by an acousto-optical device and then diffracted again by the muscle fiber. The double diffraction reverses the chromatic dispersion normally obtained with polychromatic light. In frog skinned muscle fibers, active and passive sarcomere shortening were smooth when observed by white light diffraction, whereas steps and pauses occurred in the <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> signals obtained with laser illumination. During active contractions skinned fibers shortened at high rates (3 - 5 microns/s per half sarcomere, 0 - 5 degrees C) at loads below 5 % of isometric tension. Compression of the myofibrillar lateral filament spacing using osmotic agents reduced the shortening velocity at low loads.

40|$|Abstract 304 L {{austenitic}} stainless steel is notably used to manufacture pipes in primary cooling circuits of nuclear power plants operating at a temperature close to 300 °C in a specific aqueous environment. Customarily, pipes are roughly polished, however, after some interventions, a few zones might be ground. Start-ups, shutdowns and operating transients of the reactor produce Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) loadings with different strain rates. These solicitations and the modified surface finish create specific conditions whose effects {{must be taken into}} account. In order to understand if there is a joint influence of the PWR environment and surface roughness on the successive stages of fatigue damage leading to failure, fatigue tests were conducted at 300 °C under a total strain amplitude of ±  0. 6 %. Two environments were used, laboratory air and simulated PWR primary aqueous environment. Two surface finishes were investigated, namely fine mechanical polishing and grinding (Rt of about 40 μm). The analysis of the damage process is based on data concerning crack density, crack length and <b>striation</b> <b>spacing.</b> The integration of the relation between the <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> and the strain intensity factor ΔKɛ, provides an estimation of crack propagation.

40|$|A new {{technique}} is described for high-speed measurement of <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> of single skinned muscle fibres. A galvanometer mirror directs helium-neon laser light {{on to the}} muscle fibre at a variable angle. Light diffracted by the cross-striations is collected by a position-sensitive photodetector. The incident angle necessary to centre the diffracted light beam on to the photodetector is related to sarcomere length. The instrument was tested by comparison with measurements obtained with a compound microscope. Discrepancies of several nanometers per half sarcomere were observed between these two methods. When the incident angle of the laser beam was varied sinusoidally about its mean position {{the magnitude of the}} discrepancy was reduced. During steady passive shortening of the muscle fibres the output of the diffraction instrument often displayed pauses and brief periods of rapid shortening. These irregularities were eliminated by averaging the sarcomere length output over a range of illumination angles by oscillating the incident angle of the laser beam. The results suggest that at the spatial resolution of several nanometers per half sarcomere, volume diffraction effects can cause the apparent sarcomere length measured from the angle of coherent light diffraction to differ from the mean <b>striation</b> <b>spacing.</b> With incident-angle oscillation the time and spatial resolution of the equipment were satisfactory for the sarcomere length signal to be fed back to a length controller for a 'sarcomere length clamp'.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{technique}} for dynamic estimates of sarcomere length in muscle is laser light diffraction. We have identified conditions under which artifactual oscillations can arise in apparent sarcomere length measured by this technique and report methods to reduce the effect. Altringham et al. (1984) first reported that the diffraction angle can exhibit one cycle of oscillation for each sarcomere length displacement of the illuminated portion of the fiber. We find that the amplitude of similar oscillations {{is strongly dependent on}} the intensity of light scattered from objects near the fiber and on the spacing between fiber and scatterer. The oscillations can be eliminated by minimizing scattered light and positioning the fiber a few millimeters from sources of scattering. A theoretical description shows that oscillations of this kind are expected from interference of scattered and diffracted light. Interference fringes were observed along the meridian of the pattern, and these moved during translation of either a fiber or a grating. The movement of fringes across the diffraction order shifts the centroid back and forth and, when associated with steady shortening, can give rise to "steps" and "pauses" in apparent <b>striation</b> <b>spacing...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an extension of}} the method of Myers et al. (1982) to measure with high precision the uniformity of contractile motions that occur between sarcomeres in the isolated cardiac muscle cell (guinea pig and rat). The image of the striations, observed with modulation contrast microscopy, was detected by a linear array of photodiodes. Sarcomere length was measured greater than 500 /s from the frequency of the array's video signal at two selectable regions of the cell. A precision test grating demonstrated that method resolves known differences in the spacing between two contiguous striations to +/- 0. 01 micron and that the effects of image translation and microscopic resolution are minor. The distribution of <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> appears to be discrete in isolated segments of the cell, and patches of fairly uniform length can be identified that are laterally contiguous. When electrically triggered, contraction is synchronous and the sarcomeres shorten and relengthen smoothly. The contrast between the striations is transiently enhanced during relengthening, an indication that the contracting cell can not be treated as a simple grating. Pauses that occur during late in relengthening (and transient contractile alternans) are characterized by very synchronized activity. These forms of irregular contractile behavior are not explained by desynchronization of a mechanism of release of intracellular calcium.

Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an auxiliary anode discharge, which brought the positive column in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing anode fall in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the positive column were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous positive column in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes. This leads to the con­clusion that striations are due to an inherent instability of the positive column, and not to the effects developed by the anode or cathode.

We have investigated the possibility that these sarcomere domains can explain the fine structure in optical diffraction patterns of skeletal muscle fibers. We studied near-field and far-field diffraction patterns with respect to fiber translation and to masking of the laser beam. The position of diffracted light in the near-field pattern depends on sarcomere length and position of the diffracting regions within the laser beam. When a muscle fiber was translated longitudinally through a fixed laser beam, the fine structural lines in the near-field diffraction pattern moved {{in the same direction}} and by the same amount as the fiber movement. Translation of the muscle fiber did not result in fine structure movement in the far-field pattern. As the laser beam was incrementally masked from one side, some fine structural lines in both the near-field and far-field diffraction patterns changed in intensity while others remained the same. Eventually, all the fine structural lines broadened and decreased in intensity. Often a fine structural line increased in intensity or a dark area in the diffraction pattern became brighter as the laser beam was restricted. From these results we conclude that the fine structure in the laser diffraction pattern is due to localized and relatively uniform regions of sarcomeres (domains) and to cross interference among light rays scattered by different domains...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for a retro-estimation {{of the stress}} amplitude, the cyclic ratio {{and the number of}} cycles to failure from the fracture morphology of failed structural components. The method is based on a previously proposed procedure using a new relation enabling to describe the whole range of the long crack growth. The method is suitable for quantitative assessment of fatigue loading parameters and the number of cycles spent during the stable propagation. The following materials and fracture parameters are to be known: the v-K curve for the component material, mean projective <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> at least for one crack length and the location of the stable-unstable crack growth transition on the fracture surface. The shape functions of stress intensity factors related to decisive fatigue crack growth stages are to be anticipated as well. The application possibilities of the method are demonstrated in a case study concerning the fatigue failure of a compressor blade made from Ti- 4 Al- 3 Mo- 1. 5 Zr high-strength alloy. Under the assumption of a nearly constant amplitude of applied loading, the analysis yielded the stress range ∆σ ≈ 550 MPa, cyclic ratio R ≈ 0. 3 and the number of cycles Nc ≈ 106 to propagate the initial 0. 5 mm crack to its critical distance of 17 mm. These results appeared to be very useful for an explanation of the damage process occurred during the service life of the blade. The method can be also applied in case where a stationary random loading is to be expected. A special software package was also developed for university courses in applied fracture mechanics. ...|$|R

Measurements of fatigue <b>striation</b> <b>spacing</b> on the fracture surfaces allowed determination f cycles to the initiation of defects 0. 254 mm (0. 01 inch) deep. Alternating stresses and strains were calculated using both elastic and elastic-plastic finite element analyses (FEA). The analysis results were used with a best-fit fatigue curve to predict cycles-to-crack initiation for comparison to the experimental data. Using elastic analysis corrected for stresses beyond yield {{in accordance with the}} ASME B&VP Code and the best-fit fatigue curve adjusted for low oxygen water environments resulted in under-estimates of the observed cycles to crack initiation from the tests. Improved predictions of cycles to crack initiation are possible by using an elastic-plastic FEA method with a kinematic hardening model along with the best-fit fatigue curve...|$|R
40|$|A FIB {{lift-out}} {{sample was}} made from a wear-resistant carbon coating deposited by high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) with Mo and W. TEM analysis found columnar grains extending the whole ~ 1800 nm thick film. Within the grains, the carbon {{was found to be}} organised into clusters showing some onion-like structure, with amorphous material between them; energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) found these clusters to be Mo- and W-rich in a later, thinner sample of the same material. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) showed no difference in C-K edge, implying the bonding type to be the same in cluster and matrix. These clusters were arranged into stripes parallel to the film plane, of spacing 7 - 8 nm; there was a modulation in spacing between clusters within these stripes that produced a second, coarser set of <b>striations</b> of <b>spacing</b> ~ 37 nm...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue crack {{propagation}} {{has been investigated}} in single edge notched mild steel specimens under constant and programmed loading conditions. Results have been analysed by the fracture mechanics approach and the Palmgren-Miner summation. Fracture surfaces were examined with a Cambridge Stereoscan scanning electron microscope. In tests where both load rises and load drops were included, the cumulative cycle ratio was always slightly greater than unity, irrespective of block size, load level, rate of load change or sequence. When the programme consisted only of load rises, the cumulative cycle ratio decreased below unity. These results have been {{explained in terms of}} residual stresses developed at the crack tip during load changes. The fracture mechanics analysis was found to provide a satisfactory method of data correlation, provided the effects of material and experimental variables were fully appreciated. However, no single value of slope of the log∆K-log da/dN relationship will apply to all materials and conditions. In the absence of residual stresses due to manufacturing processes, computer integration of the constant amplitude fracture mechanics data will provide a satisfactory method of life prediction. Fractographic observations showed that striation spacings were often larger than the macroscopic crack growth rate. This effect was discussed in terms of discontinuous crack front movement. <b>Striation</b> <b>spacing</b> measurements were not therefore useful as a technique of correlating macroscopic crack growth rate with the microscopic observations. However, two distinct modes of fracture were observed to occur. The first (designated stage Ila) was structure sensitive, whilst the second (designated stage IIb) was structure insensitive. The transition from stage Ila to stage llb occurred when the radius of the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip reached a value of about four times the mean grain diameter. Under programmed loading conditions, stage IIa was found to occur after a high to low load change even though the prevailing stress intensity was at the level sufficient to produce stage IIb in a single stress level test. It is suggested that this effect is caused by substantial residual compressive stresses acting in opposition to the applied stress intensity and estimates of the minimal levels of these residual stresses have been made. The mechanisms of residual stress formation and decay have been explained in terms of sizes of plastic zones at the crack tip...|$|R
