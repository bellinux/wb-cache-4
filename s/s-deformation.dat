40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{stability}} of (charged) static black holes in higherdimensional spacetimes with and without cosmological constant by using gauge-invariant master equations of the Schrödinger equation type for black hole perturbations derived by the authors recently. In particular, we show that {{the stability of}} higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes can be proved {{with the help of}} a technique called <b>S-deformation</b> of the master equations. We also point out that higher-dimensional static black holes might be unstable only against scalar-type perturbations in the neutral case and in the charged case with spherically symmetric or flat horizons. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{existence}} {{and stability of}} static black holes in Lovelock theories with a particular focus on pure Lovelock black holes. We derive the equation of stability from action without using <b>S-deformation</b> approach. It turns out that though pure-Lovelock black hole in even dimension is always unstable, however introduction of Λ stablizes it by prescribing a lower threshold mass while there also exists an upper bound on mass which is given by existence of horizon. We also study stability of dimensionally continued black holes {{as well as of}} pure Lovelock analogue of BTZ black hole in all odd dimensions.

40|$|We show that, {{independently}} of the scalar field potential and of specific asymptotic properties of the spacetime (asymptotically flat, de Sitter or anti-de Sitter), any static, spherically symmetric or planar, black hole or soliton solution of the Einstein theory minimally coupled to a real scalar field with a general potential is mode stable under linear odd-parity perturbations. To this end, we generalize the Regge-Wheeler equation for a generic self-interacting scalar field, and show that {{the potential of the}} relevant Schrödinger operator can be mapped, by the so-called <b>S-deformation,</b> to a semi-positively defined potential. With these results at hand we study the existence of slowly rotating configurations. The frame dragging effect is compared with the Kerr black hole. Comment: 11 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{evolution}} of gravitational perturbations of D-dimensional Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, and Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes. It {{is known that}} the effective potential for the scalar type of gravitational perturbations has negative gap near the event horizon. This gap, for some values of the parameters Q (charge), Lambda (cosmological constant) and D (number of space-time dimensions), cannot be removed by <b>S-deformations.</b> Thereby, {{there is no proof}} of (in) stability for those cases. In the present paper, by an extensive search of quasinormal modes, both in time and frequency domains, we shall show that spherically symmetric static black holes with arbitrary charge and positive (de Sitter) lambda-term are stable for D= 5, 6, > [...] . 11. In addition, we give a complete numerical data for all three types (scalar, vector and tensor) of gravitational perturbations for multi-dimensional black holes with charge and Lambda-term. The influence of charge, Lambda-term and number of extra dimensions on black hole quasinormal spectrum is discussed. Comment: 12 pages, RevTe...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new homology theory of uniform spaces, provisionally called μ-homology theory. Our homology theory is based on hyperfinite chains of microsimplices. This idea is due to McCord. We prove that μ-homology theory satisfies the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms. The characterization of chain-connectedness in terms of μ-homology is provided. We also introduce the notion of S-homotopy, which is weaker than uniform homotopy. We prove that μ-homology theory satisfies the S-homotopy axiom, and that every uniform space can be <b>S-deformation</b> retracted to a dense subset. It follows that for every uniform space X and any dense subset A of X, X and A have the same μ-homology. We briefly discuss the difference and similarity between μ-homology and McCord homology.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} under linear perturbations {{of a class}} of static solutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in D=n+ 2 dimensions with spatial slices of the form Σ_^n × R^+, Σ_^n an n-manifold of constant curvature. Linear perturbations for this class of space-times can be generally classified into tensor, vector and scalar types. In a previous paper, tensor perturbations were analyzed. In this paper we study vector and scalar perturbations. We show that vector perturbations can be analyzed in general using an <b>S-deformation</b> approach and do not introduce instabilities. On the other hand, we show by analyzing an explicit example that, contrary to what happens in Einstein gravity, scalar perturbations may lead to instabilities in black holes with spherical horizons when the Gauss-Bonnet string corrections are taken into account.

40|$|In a D-dimensional maximally {{symmetric}} spacetime we {{simplify the}} massless Dirac equation to two decoupled wavelike equations with effective potentials. Furthermore in D-dimensional Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild de Sitter black holes {{we note that}} for the massless Dirac field moving in the region exterior to the event horizon {{at least one of}} the effective potentials is not positive definite. Therefore the classical stability of these black holes against this field is not guaranteed. Here with the help of the <b>S-deformation</b> method, we state their classical stability against the massless Dirac field, extend these results to maximally symmetric black holes, and comment on the applicability of our results to establish the stability with respect to other classical fields.

40|$|We study a {{sufficient}} condition {{to prove the}} stability {{of a black hole}} when the master equation for linear perturbation takes the form of the Schrödinger equation. If the potential contains a small negative region, usually, the <b>S-deformation</b> method was used to show the non-existence of unstable mode. However, in some cases, it is hard to find an appropriate deformation function analytically because the only way known so far to find it is a try-and-error approach. In this paper, we show that it is easy to find a regular deformation function by numerically solving the differential equation such that the deformed potential vanishes everywhere, when the spacetime is stable. Even if the spacetime is almost marginally stable, our method still works. We also discuss a simple toy model which can be solved analytically, and show the condition for the non-existence of a bound state is the same as that for the existence of a regular solution for the differential equation in our method. From these results, we conjecture that our criteria is also a necessary condition.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein equations with a scalar field as the source. We describe a general methodology of studying small radial perturbations of scalar-vacuum configurations with arbitrary potentials V(ϕ), and in particular space-times with throats (including wormholes), which are possible if the scalar is phantom. At such a throat, the effective potential for perturbations V_eff has a positive pole (a potential wall) that prevents a complete perturbation analysis. We show that, generically, (i) V_eff has precisely the form required for regularization by the known <b>S-deformation</b> method, and (ii) a solution with the regularized potential leads to regular scalar field and metric perturbations of the initial configuration. The well-known conformal mappings make these results also applicable to scalar-tensor and f(R) theories of gravity. As a particular example, we prove the instability of all static solutions with both normal and phantom scalars and V(ϕ) = 0 under spherical perturbations. We thus confirm the previous results on the unstable nature of anti-Fisher wormholes and Fisher's singular solution and prove the instability of other branches of these solutions including the anti-Fisher "cold black holes".
