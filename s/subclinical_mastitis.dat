40|$|Abstract Background The dairy {{industry}} has undergone substantial structural changes as intensive farming has developed during recent decades. Mastitis {{continues to be}} the most common production disease of dairy cows. Nationwide surveys of mastitis prevalence are useful in monitoring udder health of dairy herds and to study the impact of structural changes on the {{dairy industry}}. This survey on bovine <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> was the first based on cow composite milk somatic cell count (SCC) data from the Finnish national health monitoring and milk recording database. A cow with composite milk SCC ≥ 200, 000  cells/ml in {{at least one of the}} four test milkings during the year was considered to have <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> and a cow with composite milk SCC ≥ 200, 000  cells/ml in three or in all four test milkings during the year to have chronic <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis.</b> The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> and chronic <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> in Finland in 1991, 2001 and 2010 and to investigate cow and herd factors associated with elevated SCC. Results Prevalence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> in Finland decreased over recent decades from 22. 3 % (1991) and 20. 1 % (2001) to 19. 0 % (2010). Prevalence of chronic <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> was 20. 4 % in 1991, 15. 5 % in 2001 and 16. 1 % in 2010. The most significant cow and herd factors associated with <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> or high milk SCC were increasing parity, Holstein breed, free-stalls with an automatic milking system and organic production. Milk SCC were highest from July to September. Main factors associated with chronic mastitis were increasing parity and Holstein breed. Conclusions Prevalence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> in Finland decreased over recent decades, the greatest change taking place during the first decade of the study. Prevalence of chronic <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> significantly decreased from 1991. The most significant factors associated with both types of mastitis were increasing parity and Holstein breed, and for <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> also free-stalls with automatic milking.

40|$|<b>Subclinical</b> Staphylococcus aureus <b>mastitis</b> {{is rarely}} treated during {{lactation}} {{because it is}} widely believed to be uneconomical, although there are no economic studies that support this view. Partial budgeting was used to develop a deterministic simulation model to estimate the net cost or benefit of antibiotic treatment of <b>subclinical</b> S. aureus <b>mastitis</b> during lactation. Direct and indirect effects of treatment were taken into account, including prevention of clinical flare-ups and contagious transmission. Input variables were based on literature and on 2003 - 2004 prices in the Netherlands. When contagious transmission of S. aureus was likely (reproductive ratio R = 5. 3), 3 - and 8 -d treatments resulted in an average net profit of 95. 62 euros and 142. 42 euros, respectively, compared with no treatment. When the probability of S. aureus transmission was low (R = 0. 32), the average economic benefit of 3 - or 8 -d treatment was - 21. 12 euros and - 57. 70 euros, respectively. On low-transmission farms, 3 -d treatment was profitable when the appropriate cows were selected for treatment using known risk factors for cure. Sensitivity analysis showed that the 6 most influential input variables in the model were chance of bacteriological cure, R, probability of culling, retention pay-off, and cost of antibiotics and bacterial culture.

40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} common and costly disease among dairy cows. Many cases are {{elicited}} by S. aureus infections that can cause both <b>subclinical</b> and clinical <b>mastitis.</b> The udder defence against infections is important but is often not sufficient to cope with the infection. Treatment with antibiotics is often not efficient. Thus, chronic <b>subclinical</b> S. aureus <b>mastitis</b> is rather common. Ginseng has been shown to stimulate the activity of blood and milk cells in dairy cows in vitro. Recent results indicate that subcutaneous injection with ginseng in vivo can improve the defence mechanisms and help to clear infections. Moreover, ginseng has been reported to be an efficient adjuvans in connection with immunization in guinea-pigs and pigs. The objectives with the project is to evaluate if ginseng can function as an adjuvans in connection with immunization. To evaluate if ginseng or vaccination against S. aureus can improve the results due to treatment of <b>subclinical</b> S. aureus <b>mastitis</b> with antibiotics. This project is a, from SLF, newly funded part of a PhD programme for Songhua Hu. The first part of the study, evaluating suitable dose of ginseng to use as an adjuvans at immunization with ovalbumin in dairy cows, is performed at present by Songhua Hu in China. Further studies are planned both in USA and Sweden during 2001 and 2002. The possibility to find ways to stimulate the cow’s defence against udder infections and to make mastitis treatments more efficient will be of great benefit to the dairy industry by reducing the incidence and costs for mastitis.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the impact of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> in dairy cattle in the Netherlands and to explore the epidemiologic and economic effects of antimicrobial treatment of recently acquired <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> during lactation. First, the occurrence of (sub) clinical mastitis was estimated in a one-year observational study. It was concluded that herds in the Netherlands varied substantially in their mastitis occurrence, indicating room for improvement of udder health. The relation between <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> (indicated by a somatic cell count (SCC) ? 200, 000 cells/ml) and clinical mastitis was investigated next. Primiparae with a high composite SCC had a fourfold higher risk to develop clinical mastitis than primiparae with a low SCC. This was twofold higher for multiparae. Approximately 25 % of clinical mastitis cases can be prevented when high SCC cows are prevented or removed from the dairy population. The therapeutic effects of antimicrobial treatment of recently acquired <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> during lactation were studied in a randomized field trial in 40 Dutch dairy herds. Cows with recently acquired streptococci or staphylococci <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> were randomly assigned antimicrobial treatment. Treated quarters had a higher bacteriological cure and decrease in SCC than control quarters. Evaluating the effect of duration of infection revealed that early treatment of Staph. aureus <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> {{tended to be more}} effective than later treatment. Staph. aureus isolates obtained from the field trial were genotyped to determine whether strains that are commonly found in multiple host species differed in bacteriological cure from strains primarily associated with bovine mastitis. Bacteriological cure of strains associated with multiple host species was around 2. 5 times higher compared with strains primarily associated with bovine mastitis. Host adaptation of Staph. aureus was found to be associated with known predictors of cure. Staph. aureus strains associated with multiple host species were more often penicillin-resistant. Additionally, penicillin-resistant, mastitis associated Staph. aureus strains had a higher SCC than other strains. The direct and indirect epidemiologic and economic effects of lactational treatment of recently acquired <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> caused by contagious pathogens were studied using a dynamic and stochastic bio-economic model. Lactational treatment of contagious pathogens resulted in less clinical flare-ups, less transmission within the herd and lower annual costs of intramammary infections. Lactational treatment of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> must be accompanied by other management measures to decrease transmission of contagious pathogens within the dairy herd to be economically beneficial. Antimicrobial treatment of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> caused by environmental pathogens {{did not seem to be}} economically beneficial. A decision tree was developed to select herds and cows to most likely benefit from lactational treatment of recently acquired <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> with antimicrobials...|$|E
40|$|<b>Subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> {{that causes}} {{significant}} economic losses in husbandry {{has been the}} most important case in the world and in our country. Since <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> is not noticeable, it is involved in milk and dairy products. In this study, physical properties- pH, electrical conductivity, and freezing point-, chemical properties - fat, protein, lactose, fat free dry matter and mineral matter content-, and biological properties - total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB) and total coliform bacteria counts and Escherichia coli incidence of 134 raw milk samples of Çanakkale-Yenice were investigated. In addition, <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> incidence was defined by determining the number of somatic cells in the samples and their California mastitis test (CMT) values. The relationship between <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> incidence and other milk properties was investigated. The mean pH, EI and DN values of the raw milks sampled were 6. 75 ± 0. 01, 5. 83 × 10 - 3 S/cm and - 0. 5296 ± 0. 002, respectively, while protein, lactose, mineral matter and fat contents were 3. 37 %± 0. 03 %, 4. 99 ± 0. 03 %, 0. 64 ± 0. 01 % and 3. 10 ± 0. 06 %, respectively. 99. 2 % of the samples were found to contain TAMB higher than 5 logcfu/mL and 13. 4 % were found to include E. coli. The relationship between <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> and these values have been also investigated. The incidence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> in Çanakkale-Yenice was determined as 59 %. Only the difference between CMT values of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> milk (CMT value ≥ 2) and healthy milk (CMT value < 2) was found to be statistically significant (p< 0. 001). There was no strong correlation between CMT, SHS, and EI values and other milk properties (r<± 0. 500) ...|$|E
40|$|Having {{considered}} that mastitis {{are the most}} costly disease in dairy farms, {{the present study was}} conducted in order to emphasize the effect of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> on milk composition and hygiene. On this purpose, large amounts of statistical data were analyzed, including all three main bovine breeds in Romania. Firstly, mastitis causing factors have been studied (breed, age, season, milking system. Afterwards, comparative study was achieved on fat, protein, lactose, salts). A significant increase in salts concomitantly with decreasing lactose percent has been revealed. Pathogen involved in <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> has been also analyzed. According to our research, defectuous mechanical milking is the most frequent cause of <b>subclinical</b> <b>mastitis</b> occurrence...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 57 gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, {{considered}} etiological agents of clinical and <b>subclinical</b> bovine <b>mastitis,</b> were tested for glucose and mannitol fermentation, coagulase and thermonuclease production, sensitivity to lysostaphin, gelatin hydrolysis, lysozyme, phosphatase and egg yolk factor production, hemolytic properties, antibiotic sensitivity, susceptibility to human and bovine phages, and enterotoxin production. All 57 strains {{were identified as}} staphylococci. A good correlation was found between 3 + and 4 + coagulase reactions, thermonuclease production, and high sensitivity to lysostaphin. Neither mannitol fermentation nor production of other enzymes {{appeared to be a}} specific property of bovine Staphylococcus aureus strains. beta- and delta-hemolysins were more frequently found than alpha-hemolysin. Nearly 40 % of the strains were penicillin resistant. Strains were lysed by phage 42 E from the human phage set more frequently than by phage 42 D, whereas with the bovine set, strains were more sensitive to specific bovine phages. Three strains produced enterotoxin C, and one strain produced enterotoxin D...|$|R
40|$|Eighty-nine {{isolates}} of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) {{of eight}} species from <b>subclinical</b> bovine <b>mastitis</b> were screened for the phenotypic and genotypic methicilline-resistance. In addition, all methicillin-resistant (MR) isolates indicating the mecA gene were examined by PCR for the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types were also determined by multiplex PCR. A total of 21 (23. 6 %) CoNS isolates {{were found to}} be resistant to oxacillin in broth microdilution assay. All isolates phenotypically resistant to oxacillin did not have the mecA gene, which was only found in 14. 6 % (13) of the isolates. Most MR-CoNS isolates were highly resistant to erythromycin (92. 3 %), fusidic acid (84. 6 %), penicillin (76. 9 %), and rifampycin (61. 5 %), and susceptible to mupirocin (100 %), tetracycline (100 %), vancomycin (100 %), clindamycin (92. 3 %), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (69. 2 %). In conclusion, a high rate of antimicrobial resistance among MR-CoNS isolated from food producing animals emphasises the need for periodic surveillance of their resistance...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus (S.) uberis is a causative {{agent for}} {{clinical}} and <b>subclinical</b> bovine <b>mastitis</b> which {{significance for the}} udder health has increased over the last decades. Molecular diagnosis methods revealed that S. uberis may be subdivided into many different varieties with different epidemiological properties. In addition, some varieties were reclassified as Streptococcus parauberis and Globicatella sanguinis. The present paper reviews S. uberis {{and its role in}} modern dairy farming. This pathogen is ubiquitous for which it is considered as environment- associated. Straw bedding and pasture, but also the bovine skin and digestive mucosae are typical localizations inhabited by S. uberis. Due to its capacity to persist within the mammary tissue, some infections may eventually turn cow-associated. In other cases, the infection is short, but in any case, there is a high risk of re-infection. Although many varieties remain susceptible to most antimicrobial agents, the problem for the dairy farm lies in the high rate of re-infection. This paper also reviews risk factors, therapies and measures to control S. uberis at farm level...|$|R
