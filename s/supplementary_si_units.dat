5000|$|The radian is the {{standard}} unit of angular measure, used {{in many areas of}} mathematics. The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it s; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (expansion at [...] ). The unit was formerly an <b>SI</b> <b>supplementary</b> <b>unit,</b> but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an <b>SI</b> derived <b>unit.</b>|$|R

The {{gas constant}} is expressed in the same physical units as molar entropy and molar heat capacity.|$|R
5000|$|The candela {{per square}} metre (cd/m2) is the derived <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of luminance. The unit {{is based on}} the candela, the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of {{luminous}} intensity, and the square metre, the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of area.|$|R
50|$|The <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of {{velocity}} is m/s, and the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> {{of electric}} field is V/m. Therefore the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of mobility is (m/s)/(V/m) = m2/(V·s). However, mobility {{is much more}} commonly expressed in cm2/(V·s) = 10−4 m2/(V·s).|$|R
30|$|A {{third stage}} in {{construction}} {{is associated with}} laterite with a high Sr content of more than 400  ppm and high magnetic susceptibilities of more than 2 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> (Figures 6 and 8). The following buildings {{have been identified as}} most likely to have been built during the third construction stage: the sanctuaries of Prasat Bak (2.08 [*]±[*] 1.32 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> Prasat Banteay Pir Chan (2.84 [*]±[*] 1.36 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> Prasat Khtum (2.21 [*]±[*] 1.18 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> and Prasat Chrap (2.49 [*]±[*] 1.49 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> the inner enclosures of Prasat Neang Khmau (2.55 [*]±[*] 1.38 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> Prasat D (2.01 [*]±[*] 1.05 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> and Prasat Pram (2.02 [*]±[*] 0.92 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> the outer enclosures of Prasat Chen (2.02 [*]±[*] 0.86 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> and Prasat Krachap (2.19 [*]±[*] 1.10 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> the west gopura of Prasat G (3.29 [*]±[*] 1.95 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> and the east gopura of Prasat Trapean Rosei (2.32 [*]±[*] 1.30 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units).</b> Given that laterite blocks with low levels of Sr were frequently observed in the sanctuaries of Prasat Bak, Prasat Banteay Pir Chan, Prasat Khtum and Prasat Chrap, as well as the west gopura of Prasat G, {{it is possible that the}} same laterite material used in the second stage of construction was also used to build these sanctuaries and gopura.|$|R
30|$|Using this criterion, we {{established}} other buildings constructed {{during the second}} stage. These include the enclosure of Prasat Damrei (1.97 [*]±[*] 0.88 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> the inner enclosure of Prasat Krachap (2.01 [*]±[*] 1.47 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> the east gopura of Prasat Kraham (2.57 [*]±[*] 1.48 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> the sanctuaries of Prasat Chen (2.75 [*]±[*] 1.87 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units),</b> and the sanctuary of Prasat Neang Khmau (5.21 [*]±[*] 2.64 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units).</b> The enclosure of Prasat Damrei may have been constructed at some point {{between the first and}} second stages.|$|R

50|$|For example, in <b>SI</b> <b>units,</b> {{the speed}} of light has been given a defined value in 1983. Thus, it was {{meaningful}} to experimentally measure {{the speed of}} light in <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> prior to 1983, but it is not so now. The proposed redefinition of <b>SI</b> base <b>units,</b> scheduled for 2018, seeks to express all <b>SI</b> base <b>units</b> in terms of fundamental physical constants.|$|R
50|$|As {{the speed}} of light has an exact defined value in <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> and the Gaussian {{gravitational}} constant k is fixed in the astronomical system of units, measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product G in <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b> Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in <b>SI</b> <b>units,</b> which is increasingly becoming the norm.|$|R
5000|$|There are 7 <b>SI</b> base <b>units.</b> These are a {{coherent}} set of units defined to measure 7 basic physical properties: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela.

30|$|The use of {{laterite}} blocks {{with low}} Sr content and magnetic susceptibility values less than 2 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> in Prasat Banteay Pir Chan and Prasat Chrap corresponded to a fourth stage of construction. Based on their magnetic susceptibility values, the inner (1.94 [*]±[*] 0.95 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> and outer enclosures (1.67 [*]±[*] 0.82 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> of Prasat Banteay Pir Chan, {{as well as}} the inner enclosure of Prasat Chrap (1.39 [*]±[*] 1.23 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units)</b> were built during this stage of construction.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the base}} units are the {{reference}} points for all measurements taken in <b>SI</b> <b>units,</b> if the reference value changed all prior measurements would be incorrect. If {{a piece of}} the international prototype kilogram snapped off, it would still be defined as a kilogram; all previous measured values of a kilogram would be heavier. [...] The importance of reproducible <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> has led the BIPM to begin defining base <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> in terms of physical constants. By defining base <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> with respect to physical constants, they are realisable with a higher level of precision and reproducibility.|$|R
50|$|Since our {{parameter}} {{group is}} dimensionless in <b>SI</b> <b>units,</b> we don't {{need to include}} the <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> in the units for our composite conversion factor {{as you can see}} in the second table.|$|R
50|$|In photometry, the lumen second (lm s or lm⋅s) is the <b>SI</b> derived <b>unit</b> of {{luminous}} energy. It {{is based}} on the lumen, the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of luminous flux, and the second, the <b>SI</b> base <b>unit</b> of time.|$|R
30|$|The {{sandstone}} {{blocks of}} {{the central part of}} the Western Annex Hall (N 2) (the first stage) have the lowest magnetic susceptibility in the Preah Vihear monument, averaging 0.011  ×  10 − 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b> The magnetic susceptibility of the sandstone blocks of buildings in the second stage is high, averaging between 0.041 and 0.047  ×  10 − 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b> It is low in the third stage, with averages in the range of 0.023 – 0.045  ×  10 − 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b> The Mandapa (C), Gopura I (G), Hall (J), Gopura II (L), and Gopura III (P) edifices belonging to the fourth stage have the highest values, with averages in the range of 0.049 – 0.068  ×  10 − 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b> The fifth stage buildings have low magnetic susceptibilities, with averages in the range of 0.019 – 0.042  ×  10 − 3 <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|Conductivity σ is the {{reciprocal}} (inverse) of electrical resistivity {{and has the}} <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> of siemens per metre (S m&minus;1), and E has the <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> of newtons per coulomb (N C&minus;1) or, equivalently, volts per metre (V m&minus;1).|$|R
50|$|The above {{equations}} {{are written}} in <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> and we are assuming that all material properties are also defined within the <b>SI</b> <b>units.</b> A result {{of this is that}} above versions of the equations do not need any unit conversion constants.
