5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's Modern Life had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, the English {{began to}} {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, similar feelings were expressed about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th-century English legislation. The English also felt <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; the position of the Jews is described below, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their own sense of status and importance. Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E

Lidle called into the station, and a 13-minute heated discussion ensued where Francesa and Russo challenged Lidle's credibility over these unofficial statements made to the media.|$|E
25|$|When the Great Plague of London {{closed the}} theatres in 1665, Dryden retreated to Wiltshire where he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie (1668), {{arguably the best}} of his unsystematic prefaces and essays. Dryden {{constantly}} defended his own literary practice, and Of Dramatick Poesie, the longest of his critical works, {{takes the form of a}} dialogue in which four characters—each based on a prominent contemporary, with Dryden himself as 'Neander'—debate the merits of classical, French and English drama. The greater part of his critical works introduce problems which he is eager to discuss, and show the work of a writer of independent mind who feels <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> his own ideas, ideas which demonstrate the breadth of his reading. He felt <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the relation of the poet to tradition and the creative process, and his best heroic play Aureng-zebe (1675) has a prologue which denounces the use of rhyme in serious drama. His play All for Love (1678) was written in blank verse, and was to immediately follow Aureng-Zebe. On 18 December 1679 he was attacked in Rose Alley near his home in Covent Garden by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt very <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We disclaim alike our Right and Desire to impose Our Convictions on any of Our Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from social intervention in India.|$|E

25|$|Wilson (diary 6, 9 November) met Bonar Law {{and told}} him that he did not agree that the {{percentage}} of defections in the officer corps would be as high as 40%, the figure suggested by the King’s adviser Lord Stamfordham. He passed on his wife Cecil’s advice that the UVF should take the patriotic high ground by pledging to fight for King and Country in the event of war. Cecil, whose family had lost its livelihood in the nineteenth century, may well have felt more <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> Ireland than Wilson himself. Bonar Law immediately attempted to reach Carson on the telephone to relay this suggestion. Wilson also advised Bonar Law – at this time the government were attempting to offer Counties Londonderry, Antrim, Armagh and Down an opt-out from Home Rule, the plan being that a refusal would make Carson look intransigent – to ensure that negotiations failed in way which made the Irish Nationalists look intransigent.|$|E

25|$|The Chappell ballad concerts {{were being}} managed by William Boosey in 1902, when {{the hall was}} owned by a private company. The {{controlling}} share was held by T. P. Chappell, chairman of Chappell's: he turned down a good offer to buy the hall because Boosey felt <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> its old connection with the Saturday and Monday 'Pops' and the Chappell ballad concerts. But Chappell died in June 1902, and the other shareholders accepted a new offer without consulting Boosey, who was badly put out. Then Queen's Hall came into the market, {{and a friend of}} Boosey's acting in that interest pointed out that Queen's Hall would be worth much more if St James's Hall ceased to operate. Boosey realised that Messrs Chappell could benefit most by becoming lessors of Queen's Hall, and it was immediately arranged with the result that Chappell's controlled Queen's Hall from 1902 down to 1944. The 11-year-old violinist Franz von Vecsey made his English debut at St James's Hall in April or early May 1904. It continued in use until February 1905 when it was demolished. The Piccadilly Hotel was afterwards built on the site.|$|E
25|$|On July 17 at Money in the Bank, Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match {{which earned}} him a World Heavyweight Championship match at any point within the {{following}} year. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at WrestleMania XXVIII. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of SmackDown, after Henry challenged Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. Big Show, {{as a friend of}} Bryan, then urged a groggy Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. After losing a rematch, Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On November 25 at SmackDown, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry. However, SmackDown authority figure Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by not waiting for WrestleMania, but explained he felt <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> exacting revenge on Henry and realised he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of his briefcase, Bryan won a four-way match on the same episode of SmackDown to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of SmackDown, Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain his title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{models for}} random interval graphs {{that are based}} on stochastic service systems, with vertices corresponding to customers and edges corresponding to pairs of customers that are in the system simultaneously. The number N of vertices in a connected component thus corresponds to the number of customers arriving during a busy period, while the size K of the largest clique (which for interval graphs is equal to the chromatic number) corresponds to the maximum number of customers in the system during a busy period. We obtain the following results for both the M=D= 1 and the M=M= 1 models, with arrival rate per mean service time. The expected number of vertices is e, and the distribution of the N=e tends to an exponential distribution with mean 1 as tends to infinity.
