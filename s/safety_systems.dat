5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|Rolls-Royce PLC is the world's second-largest aero-engine manufacturer. Its engines power {{more than}} 30 types of {{commercial}} aircraft, {{and it has}} more 30,000 engines currently in service across both the civil and defence sectors. With a workforce of over 12,000 people, Derby has the largest concentration of Rolls-Royce employees in the UK.

5|$|The {{building}} {{was owned by}} the PNB and later its parent company CoreStates until it was sold to the JPMorgan Strategic Property Fund in 1996 for almost US$28.5 million. In 1998 the building's second-largest tenant, law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, left for One Logan Square. The resulting vacancy prompted the owners to renovate the building, renamed One South Broad, {{at a cost of}} US$10 million. Renovations included modernizing the elevators, security and <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> and converting the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The renovations took eighteen months and One South Broad was officially rededicated on May 3, 2000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{importance}} of vehicle active <b>safety</b> <b>system,</b> this article designs the manageable man-machine interactive software that can help engineers to design the vehicle active <b>safety</b> <b>system.</b> Engineers can interact with the software and involve in most processes of active <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> design through the visual software. And the software can improve design efficiency, shorten the design cycle, and reduce design costs. Through the successful development of the software, the paper shows the important role VC++ plays in vehicle active <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> design {{and this will be}} instructive...|$|R
40|$|The high kinetic and {{potential}} {{energy of a}} launch vehicle mandates there be a mechanism to minimize possible damage to provide adequate safety for the launch facilities, range, and, most importantly, the general public. The Range <b>Safety</b> <b>System,</b> sometimes called the Flight Termination <b>System</b> or Flight <b>Safety</b> <b>System,</b> provides the required level of safety. The Range <b>Safety</b> <b>System</b> section of the Avionics chapter will attempt to describe how adequate safety is provided, the system's design, operation, and it's interface {{with the rest of}} the launch vehicle...|$|R
5|$|A {{specialized}} test train, Dasye set744 in a commemorative livery, {{arrived to}} conduct the fourth phase of testing, which began on 28 September 2015. During this phase, more than 200 test runs would be performed on the line. The test runs would test ride smoothness, performance of the catenary, radio communications, and the signalling system. During some runs, the test train would operate at 10% above the planned operational speeds for the line when it enters service. Some automated <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> were disabled to allow the test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions. Orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between January and March 2016 {{prior to the start}} of commercial service on the line, which was scheduled for 3 April 2016 at the time of the accident. In January 2016, SNCF announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until to 3 July 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure {{announced}} a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at Hackney Road will be retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road {{will lead to}} a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel will pass under the Botanic Road intersection, then curve to the west under Rundle Park, Rundle Road and surface in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction was anticipated to start in late 2015 with the project completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. SAGE Automation will provide expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> Construction started in March 2016 with removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. It is still expected to be completed by the end of 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) had an {{ownership}} {{stake in}} the complex ever since Centre Square was constructed and in 1992 became the sole owner. Wolgin sold his {{stake in the}} complex in the early 1980s, and a partnership led by Metropolitan Life of Virginia {{took control of the}} complex around 2000. In 2002 MetLife put the property up for sale, and in October of that year HRPT Properties Trust bought Centre Square for US$183.5 million plus closing costs. With the acquisition of Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust (now called Equity Commonwealth) began an improvement and renovation plan for the complex. Improvements included modernization of its elevator, air conditioning, and <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> Architectural firm Daroff Design Inc.'s plans included cleaning the structures and a redesign of parts of the atrium and the plaza in front of the building.|$|E

5|$|The station, {{originally}} {{part of the}} city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and {{the failed}} attempt to build the West Side Stadium, was first {{scheduled to open in}} summer 2012. When London was chosen for the Olympics, the opening date was pushed to December 2013. In 2011, the opening was postponed to June 2014, pending the completion of the escalators and elevators in the station. After a series of delays involving escalator, elevator, and fire and <b>safety</b> <b>systems,</b> the station finally opened on September 13, 2015. The 34th Street station is the first completely new station in the New York City Subway system since 1989, as well as the first such station funded by the government of New York City since 1950.|$|E

25|$|This {{point of}} view argues that {{management}} (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production {{at the end of}} 1984, allowing several <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> to save moneyâ€” including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans. Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations. Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.|$|E
