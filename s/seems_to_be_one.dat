25|$|As {{there are}} hardly any {{characteristics}} of Celtic law that cannot {{be found in}} at least some other, non-Celtic laws as well, the most sensible definition of Celtic law <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> that focuses on the language in which the law is (usually) dispensed. As such, 'Celtic law' would be any law (usually) dispensed in a Celtic language.|$|E

The book states that {{the truth of the}} matter is that Guo Yunshen actually fought one of his older xingyi brothers and lost. Sun Lutang was a student of both Guo Yunshen and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the most accurate.|$|E
25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> {{of the more interesting}} facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} in {{determining}} whether the Cimbri were speaking a Celtic or a Germanic language is {{that at this time}} the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he had a political motive for doing so (it was an argument in favour of the Rhine border). Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe, but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.|$|E
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are {{described in terms of}} a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E
25|$|The text of this liturgical {{drama is}} {{in a form}} of an {{apocryphal}} dialogue between the narrator, Adam, and Eve, with a choir/chorus that is indicated in the text by alternating black and red inks. This extra New Testament story tells of when Christ went into Hell between His Crucifixion and Resurrection for the salvation of all the righteous who had died {{since the beginning of}} the world. However, the existing text may be incomplete with its ending now lost. According to Dumville this liturgical drama <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the earliest known examples of this text, influenced by the text of the Descensus ad Infernos found in the Latin version of the extra New Testament Gospel of Nicodemus, as well as a now lost Latin pseudo-Augustinian homily that has survived in an Old English version found in the Blickling Homilies (Princeton, Princeton University Library, W.H. Schelde Collection, Blickling Homilies), and the Roman Psalter. There is a conceptual or compositional relationship between this section and the preceding Breviate Psalter verses, as this Harrowing of Hell is a pastiche of verses from the Psalms. An Irish influence is suggested by the metrical structure of the hymns as well as the inclusion of the Breviate Psalter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{central figure}} of the tortuous {{composition}} on the front is a young Roman military commander on horseback, presumed to represent the deceased. His face is serene, and his arm is extended confidently in a [...] "gesture which is difficult to interpret but <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of farewell". An X-mark on his forehead has been interpreted as the cross received by initiates into the Mithraic mysteries {{as a sign of}} the god Mithras' favor. The Mithraic religion was popular among Roman soldiers. The valor (virtus) shown by the horseman may represent real-life bravery on the battlefield, but the religious connotation of the X may suggest victory over death, a theme of mounted warriors in funerary art. The horseman probably represents the deceased.|$|E
