40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-run equilibrium and short-run dynamic relationship between <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and between <b>services</b> and nonservices <b>sectors</b> in India. The model is estimated using the optimal single-equation and the maximum-likelihood system estimators. All the estimators consistently suggest the cointegrating relationship between <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> and GDP {{as well as}} between <b>services</b> and nonservices <b>sectors.</b> The estimates of long-run elasticity parameters are statistically significant and dimensionally consistent across the estimators. The conventional Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and the new CUSUM and Moving Sum (MOSUM) tests suggest the stability of the equilibrium residuals and reinforce the cointegrating relationship between the model series. The error correction model provides some support for unidirectional Granger-causality from <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> to GDP. The impulse response and variance decomposition analyses instead suggest the bidirectional causality between <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> and GDP and between <b>services</b> and nonservices <b>sectors.</b> The stable growth of <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> is essentially crucial to absorb the adverse effects of exogenous weather shocks in agriculture and industry and provide resilience to the economy. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the nature of {{competition}} in the information technology (IT) <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> between India and China. Using primary and secondary data sources, we compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of the IT <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> in the two countries along the main dimensions of Porter’s competitive advantage model. The principal findings indicate that the IT <b>services</b> <b>sectors</b> in the two countries are distinctively different, have developed along different paths and are highly complementary to each other. China has a well established hardware sector and its IT <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> focuses mostly on servicing its domestic market. India’s IT <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> is predominantly export orientated with focus on the US and Western European markets. Contrary to popular beliefs, given the complementary characteristics of the IT <b>services</b> <b>sectors</b> in India and China, it is unlikely for the two countries to compete against each other in the near future and greater strategic co-operation between IT service providers in the two countries is a more likely outcome. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{magnitude}} of services growth and its inter-linkages with other sectors of the economy, {{it is important to}} understand the impact of <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> on other macro-economic variables. The present paper attempts to identify some of the critical issues in India’s services-led growth and tests certain hypotheses that are currently in debate. These relate to: (a) whether the robust growth of the <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> has added a dimension of stability to India's GDP growth; (b) whether there has been a growing complementarity between <b>services</b> and industrial <b>sectors</b> of the economy; (c) whether like other commodity-producing <b>sectors,</b> the <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> also experienced 'jobless' growth; (d) whether the imposition of services tax has boosted the Indian Government’s efforts at mobilising more resources; and (e) whether high growth of <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> in India had an inflationary impact on the economy. Our analysis found the first four hypotheses to hold true. In respect of the last hypothesis, in contrast to the expectations that high <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> growth has an inflationary impact on the economy, we found that the rising share of <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> in GDP has not contributed to inflation in the Indian economy...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} aid fungibility of Japan's {{official development assistance}} (ODA) to Indonesia for the period 1973 to 1994. Aid fungibility, often known as switching of aid money into non-development purposes, {{is one of the}} most controversial issues that impinges upon the macroeconomic effectiveness of foreign aid. In this study Japan's foreign aid to Indonesia is analysed, since Indonesia is one of the largest recipients of Japan's aid, and also since Japan is the largest aid donor to Indonesia. Using the maximum likelihood cointegration econometric procedure and the error correction mechanism (ECM), the study analyses aid fungibility for non-development current expenditure, development expenditure and domestic revenue for Indonesia. The results indicate that none of Japan's total sectoral aid, other donors' total sectoral aid, and non-sectoral aid from all donors, leaks into non-development current expenditure or reduces domestic revenue. Hence, no evidence of aid fungibility at the aggregate level is found. The study further analyses aid fungibility at the sectoral level for four major sections, i. e. social <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> economic <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> production sector, and other sectors. The empirical results provide no evidence that Japan's aid to the social <b>services</b> and production <b>sectors</b> is fungible. However, Japan's aid to the economic <b>services</b> <b>sectors</b> and other sectors is fungible. Furthermore, other donors' sectoral aid to all four sectors is fungible. Also, there is diversion of resources into the other sectors from other three combined sectors, i. e. social <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> economic <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> and production sector. This suggests that Japan's aid to the economic <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> and other donors' sectoral aid to the social <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> economic <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> production sector, may diverge into the other sectors. This study concludes by speculating the importance of aid sources and sectors to which aid is allocated as some of the factors that explain aid fungibility in Indonesia...|$|R
