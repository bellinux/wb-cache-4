5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies.

5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E

The technique is based on previous research by the author on non-linear <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of spectra, that is, timbre spatialisation in the frequency domain. One of the primary applications here is the further elaboration of timbre spatialisation in the frequency domain to account for distance cues incorporating loudness attenuation, reverb, and filtration. Further to this, the same approach may also give rise to more non-linear distributions of processing and effects across multi-point <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> such as audio distortions and harmonic exciters, delays, and other such parallel processes used within a spatial context...|$|R

The effect of multiple collisions in the transition zone from collisional coupling to true free flow were also included.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} variations of <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of cracks observed on the unnotched specimen surface during the fatigue process, plane bending fatigue tests {{were performed on}} carbon steel JIS, SS 41 in laboratory air and a sodium chloride aqueous solution. Two methods, developed by Morishita and Ono {{in the field of}} mathematical ecology, were used in analyzing the <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of Cracks. The following results were obtained. The <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of cracks are influenced by both stress amplitude and stress cycling. In the high stress amplitude region, the distributions are nearly random, while in the low stress amplitude region, the distributions have clumps indicating nonrandom distribution. This result was common to both fatigue in air and corrosion fatigue. With increasing stress cycling, the <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of cracks approach random distributions in the high stress amplitude region, while in the low stress amplitude region, the distributions show a strong tendency to have two kinds of clumps whose sizes are 1 / 4 mm^ 2 and 8 mm^ 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We measure quantitatively {{symmetry}} and entropy regarding {{symmetry of}} <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of acoustic emissions generated by microfracturings during creep before ultimate whole fracture {{of a rock}} specimen. In the measurement, symmetry properties of the two-dimensional discrete Walsh functions are utilized, and the two-dimensional discrete Walsh transform {{is applied to the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions.</b> We find that the <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of acoustic emissions are rich in double symmetry. Moreover, it is found that the richness in double symmetry increases and the entropy decreases with the evolution of microfracturing process. This decrease of the entropy comes from the increase of the richness in double symmetry. Thus we conclude that the microfracturing process evolves under constraint of the increase of the richness in double symmetry. 1...|$|R

These indicators are weighted mean patch size and lacunarity computed from thresholded normalized difference vegetation index obtained from multispectral IKONOS- 2 imagery. <b>Spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of the metrics are derived for an extensive suburban area on the southwest edge of London, U.

Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution,</b> or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.|$|E

Our method, which incorporates frequency- and distance-dependent characteristics of the observed apparent radiation pattern, successfully reproduced the observed <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> of P- and S-wave amplitudes during small-to-moderate local crustal earthquakes.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{other types}} of {{radiation}} used in diffraction studies of materials, such as X-rays and neutrons, electrons are charged particles and interact with matter through the Coulomb forces. This means that the incident electrons feel the influence of both the positively charged atomic nuclei and the surrounding electrons. In comparison, X-rays interact with the <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> of the valence electrons, while neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the strong nuclear forces. In addition, the magnetic moment of neutrons is non-zero, and they are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. Because of these different forms of interaction, {{the three types of}} radiation are suitable for different studies.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{typically}} affect the mesolimbic system, or more specifically, the reward pathway {{of the nervous}} system. Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse. Nicotine, competing with acetylcholine (ACh), acts through the nonsynaptic, preterminal, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) to initiate a membrane potential change and propagate an intracellular Ca2+ signal, thus encouraging the release of neurotransmitters. The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic potentiation, promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E
