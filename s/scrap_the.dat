5|$|After {{returning}} to the UK in early 1946, Indefatigable was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians {{for the rest of}} the year before she was reduced to reserve. She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The Board of Admiralty decided that she was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. Indefatigable was sold for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{remained}} on the East Asia station until early 1900, when she travelled via the Mediterranean and Portsmouth to Kiel.

On 21 May 1906, the ship was stricken from the naval register and used briefly as a target ship in 1907.

5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for <b>scrap.</b> <b>The</b> boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E

5|$|In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, {{chief of}} the Western Naval Command, said the Ministry of Defence would <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> ship as she had become very {{difficult}} to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The Bombay High Court dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.|$|E
5|$|King George Vs active naval {{career was}} {{terminated}} by the Royal Navy in June 1950, {{when she and}} her sister-ships went into reserve and were mothballed. King George V was the first large warship to be preserved in this fashion. This involved sealing the armament, machinery and boilers against damp and installing dehumidifiers throughout. In December 1955, she was downgraded to extended reserve and in 1957 the decision was taken to <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> four ships. The following year King George V was moved from her berth in Gareloch to the ship breaking firm of Arnott Young and Co. in Dalmuir to undergo dismantling.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg {{served as}} a {{training}} ship for naval cadets throughout the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she laid defensive minefields in the North Sea and then participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940. While attacking Bergen, she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal artillery, and sunk by British bombers the following day in the harbor. The wreck was eventually raised in 1942 and broken up for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E

5|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad {{was forced}} to suspend {{operations}} in October 2004 after a 75percent {{decline in the number}} of passengers, possibly brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for <b>scrap.</b> <b>The</b> right-of-way would then be used to establish a rail trail.|$|E
5|$|The fleet went {{on another}} Atlantic cruise in April 1929, and Elsass made calls in Villagarcia and A Pobra do Caramiñal, Spain. That fall, the ship visited Karlskrona, Spain. Elsass was {{withdrawn}} from active service on 25 February 1930. She was stricken from the naval register on 31 March 1931 {{and served as}} a hulk in Wilhelmshaven until 31 October 1935, when the Reichsmarine sold her to Technischer Betrieb des Norddeutscher Lloyd. Elsass was broken up for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} a very limited service life. At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|The {{wreck of}} the SS Vina, a cargo steamer built in 1894, {{can be seen at}} low tide.

After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as <b>scrap.</b> <b>The</b> remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E

They were next in combat during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, {{where they were}} blockaded in the harbour. Dingyuen {{was struck by a}} torpedo, and was beached where it continued to operate as a defensive fort. When the fleet was surrendered to the Japanese, she was destroyed while Zhenyuan became the first battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy as Chin'en. She was eventually removed from the Navy list in 1911, and was sold for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1916, Active {{was assigned to the}} Grand Fleet and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland later in the year. Shortly afterwards, she was briefly assigned as the flotilla leader of the 4th DF and escorted {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August. By the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the Dover Patrol and was present during two battles with German destroyers, but was not engaged in either. Active was based in Ireland by {{the beginning}} of 1918, but was soon transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and based in Gibraltar for the rest of the war. The ship was reduced to reserve in 1919 and was sold for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich der Grosse {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. The ship was removed from active service in 1896, after which she was used in secondary roles until 1919, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold to a scrapyard. Friedrich der Grosse was broken up for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Roma {{took part}} in a naval {{demonstration}} off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro. The following year, she was involved in a collision with the ironclad , though neither ship was damaged. That year, Venezia was converted into a torpedo training ship, while Roma remained in service until 1890, when she became a guard ship at La Spezia. In 1895, both ships were stricken from the naval register. Venezia was broken up for <b>scrap</b> <b>the</b> following year, but Roma was converted into a depot ship in La Spezia. On 28 July 1896, she was set on fire by a lightning strike and badly burned. The damage proved to be beyond economical repair, and so she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
