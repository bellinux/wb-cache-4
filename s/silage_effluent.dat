40|$|This {{laboratory}} study examines {{the impact of}} different application rates of <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> on the biomass and activity of microorganisms in a typical grassland soil (Denbigh series). Application rates ranged from an equivalent of 0 ? 5 l m 2 <b>silage</b> <b>effluent,</b> and amended soils were incubated at 25 ?C for 32 days and periodically sampled (days 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32) for microbial biomass C, CO 2 evolution and activities of various soil enzymes. After 2 and 4 days of incubation, {{there was a significant}} trend of increasing microbial biomass C (P < 0 ? 001 and P < 0 ? 01, respectively), microbial respiration (CO 2 evolution) (P < 0 ? 001), and dehydrogenase activity (P < 0 ? 01) with increasing rates of <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> application. Thereafter, microbial biomass C, microbial respiration and dehydrogenase activity declined and were not significantly different from the unamended control soil. Specific respiration (respired C: biomass C) increased with increasing <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> application, suggesting that microorganisms in amended soils may be physiologically stressed or that there is an increase in the proportion of effluent-derived bacteria relative to fungi in the amended soil. In a second experiment, there was a significant (r 2 = 0 ? 98; P < 0 ? 001) positive linear relationship between increasing rates of <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> application up to 30 l m 2 and microbial respiration. Dehydrogenase activity increased up to an equivalent application of 15 l m 2 and then declined, perhaps because high concentrations of certain chemical compounds with <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> have an adverse abiotic impact on the enzyme assay itself.

40|$|The role of {{moisture}} absorptive capacity of pre-silage material {{and its relationship}} with <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> in high moisture by-product feedstuffs (HMBF) is assessed. The term water retention capacity which is sometimes used in explaining the rate of effluent control in ensilage may be inadequate, since it accounts exclusively for the capacity of an absorbent incorporated into a pre-silage material prior to ensiling, without consideration to how much the pre-silage material can release. A new terminology, ‘potential water retention capacity’ (PWRC), which attempts to address this shortcoming, is proposed. Data were pooled {{from a series of}} experiments conducted separately over a period of five years using laboratory silos with four categories of agro by-products (n = 27) with differing moisture contents (highest 96. 9 %, lowest 78. 1 % in fresh matter, respectively), and their silages (n = 81). These were from a vegetable source (Daikon, Raphanus sativus), a root tuber source (potato pulp), a fruit source (apple pomace) and a cereal source (brewer’s grain), respectively. The pre-silage materials were adjusted with dry in-silo absorbents consisting wheat straw, wheat or rice bran, beet pulp and bean stalks. The pooled mean for the moisture contents of all pre-silage materials was 78. 3 % (± 10. 3). <b>Silage</b> <b>effluent</b> decreased (p< 0. 01), with increase in PWRC of pre-silage material. The theoretical moisture content and PWRC of pre-silage material necessary to stem effluent flow completely in HMBF silage was 69. 1 % and 82. 9 g/ 100 g in fresh matter, respectively. The high correlation (r = 0. 76) between PWRC of ensiled material and <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> indicated that the latter {{is an important factor in}} silage-effluent relationship...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{concrete}} for silage {{storage structures}} is {{specified by the}} Irish Farm Development Service (DAFF, 1992) {{in terms of a}} characteristic 28 day crushing strength of 40 N/mm 2 and a minimum cement content of 350 kg/m 3. In addition, the maximum aggregate size used must not exceed 20 mm and the slump of the unplasticised concrete must not exceed 75 mm. There is no stipulation on the maximum water to cement ratio to be used. This specification represents a high strength concrete for agricultural use and has been upgraded to this level in an attempt to improve the material’s resistance to corrosion by <b>silage</b> <b>effluent.</b> A cement content of 350 kg/m 3 is regarded as a relatively high cement content and may promote thermal cracking in the structures (Blackledge, 1990). This would result in a concrete which would be more susceptible to attack by corrosive effluent. A system of carrying out accelerated durability tests on concrete specimens under controlled conditions has been developed by Teagasc and University College Dublin (O’Donnell, C., 1993). Trials carried out by O’Donnell, indicated that cement content had little influence on the durability of concretes exposed to <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> for the ranges of mixes examined, but the use of excess water resulted in marked increases in deterioration. The present study aims to further examine the effect of (i) cement content and (ii) the use of PFA as a cement replacer. End of Project Report...|$|E

Dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), temperature (°C) and pH in the untreated BW, in the stored brewery waste and in the brewery waste silage upon silo opening, after 60 days of ensilage were analyzed. A completely randomized design was used. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, and the means were compared by the Tukey test at the 5 % probability level. The preservation of brewery waste packaged under aerobic conditions was not appropriate due to the development of filamentous fungi and yeasts; however, storage under anaerobic conditions proved to be an effective conservation process...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent times}} there is {{increasing}} interest in the hydraulic properties of free-draining unsaturated soils and {{on the fate of}} slurries, sludges, effluents and fertilisers applied to these soils. This is especially so where relatively thin soils overlie bedrocks such as limestones with fissures and solution channels (karstic aquifers). Irish soils are commonly gravelly and stony and present special problems in determining their hydraulic properties. In this project, various field and laboratory methods were employed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated gravelly and stony soils overlying karstic limestone with a watertable 25 m below ground surface at the Teagasc Centre at Athenry. In parallel with these measurements, cattle and pig slurries and <b>silage</b> <b>effluents</b> were applied at normal and very heavy rates in summer and in winter to a series of experimental plots. A chloride tracer was also used. Rainfall and soil moisture contents and hydraulic potentials of the soil of the various plots were measured. Samples of soil water were collected in suction tubes and analysed for nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a chemical preservative supplementation on the quality of lupine silage as compared with untreated controls. Fresh green Lupine (Lupines lupine), variete Juno, dry matter content 187. 15 g / kg at full waxy stage of maturity were chopped to the legth of cut ca 30 – 50 mm. The crop was artificially wilted for a periody 24 h and ensiled as described above. Lupine were ensiled for 98 days in laboratory silos, capacity about 4 l alone or with supplementation of chemical preservative 3 and 6 l/tone forage respectively). The relatively mean WSC content and the low buffering capacity of lupine crop provided for a good preservation with the chemical preservative. The best quality of fermentation process and nutritive value was found in silages with the supplement of acid mixtures dosed at 6 l / t since they showed not only a better content of net energy (NEL) and CP but also a significantly higher ethanol content, a more favourable RDP content and a hig­her starch content than the control. The supplement of preservatives resulted in the increased DM content in stored silage, in the increased escape of <b>silage</b> <b>effluents</b> and in the inhibited (P < 0. 01) formation of acetic acids (19. 8 ± 2. 17 g / kg DM) in comparison with control silage. In chemical trea­ted silages (3 l/t) was also increased level (P < 0. 01) of lactic acid (116. 9 ± 2. 61 g / kg DM) and total acids in kg of dry matter (143. 4 ± 3. 64 g / kg), but decreased level of pH value (4. 03 ± 0. 01), acidity water extract (KVV– 1221. 1 ± 11. 51 mg KOH/ 100 g silage), titration acidity (FT– 0. 107 ± 0. 002), and of NH 3 content (664. 1 ± 7. 51 mg / kg DM) ...|$|R
40|$|Four {{absorbent}} materials {{incorporated into}} grass at ensiling were compared {{in terms of}} their effects on silage quality, effluent production, diet digestibility, ad libitum intake and growth of lambs. The materials used (50 kg t - 1 grass) to retain <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> flow were molassed and unmolassed sugar beet shreds (MSBS, SBS), a commercial product (CP) based on MSBS (75 %) and wheat bran (20 %), and rolled barley (RB). With the exception of MSBS and a control (C 2), all silages were ensiled with formic acid solution. Unmolassed sugar beet shreds were also ensiled with a granulated formic acid product (grFA). The silages were fed to 56 Finnish Landrace lambs for 21 days. <b>Silage</b> <b>effluent</b> retention rates were similar (1. 44 - 1. 55 kg kg - 1 absorbent) for the sugar beet shred-based absorbents but zero for RB. The organic matter digestibilities of the diets were not affected (p> 0. 05) by the silage absorbent treatment. The digestibility of SBS silage was, however, improved by grFA as an additive. Silage intake was generally increased by absorbent inclusion, and was about 29 % higher in lambs receiving silages treated with sugar beet shreds than in those receiving untreated silages. The daily growth rate of lambs was highest with the SBS treatment (124 g) followed by SBS ensiled with grFA (108 g) and MSBS (86 g); it was lowest with RB (36 g). With regard to effluent chemical oxygen demand, digestibility and silage intake, the use of SBS as an absorbent material is recommended by ensiling with either liquid or grFA. ...|$|E

When the two periods, 1969 - 74 and 1980 - 87 are compared, {{it can be seen}} that the numbers caused by sewage and industrial wastes have not changed significantly, but the damage from agriculture has risen at an alarming rate. The fact that problems from sewage and industry remained at a low level in the period, in spite of increasing urbanisation, suggests that measures to combat these sources of pollution have had some effect.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} fish kills in 1993 showed a {{dramatic}} change {{from that of the}} previous ten years. The number of incidents showed a very welcome reduction to a total of 33, the lowest since systematic records began to be kept in 1982. Only one case of damage caused by <b>silage</b> <b>effluent</b> was reported and two from farm effluents - in the recent past these were the most frequent and serious sources. However, fish kills provisionally attributed to 'enrichment' attained a record total of 16, most of them in the lakes in Co. Cavan in the Erne catchment. Sewage and runoff from agricultural land are the main sources of the phosphorous which brings about excessive blooms of microscopic algae. Enrichment has caused extremely serious problems in the past, in particular in Loughs Ennel and Sheelin. In both cases, remedial measures were successful, although problems have arisen again in the case of Lough Sheelin. The more widespread problem in the Erne catchment may be more difficult to contain and there are also signs of trouble in the Rivers Shannon and Lee.

The {{effect of}} harvest date and {{inoculation}} on the yield and fermentation characteristics of two varieties of white lupin (Lupinus albus) when ensiled as a whole-crop. Animal Feed Science and Technology, 119, (3 - 4), 307 - 322. Sponsorship: DEFRAAn experiment {{was conducted to}} determine the ensiling potential of whole-crop white lupins (Lupinus albus). Three replicate 0. 1 ha plots of an autumn variety (cv. Arthur) and a spring variety (cv. Nelly) were sown in spring and harvested at 12. 5, 14. 5, 16. 5 and 18. 5 weeks after sowing. Following yield determinations the forages were artificially wilted for a 24 h period, and sampled to determine chemical composition. Representative sub-samples of forage from each harvest were then ensiled in 10 kg mini-silos, either untreated or treated with an inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum). The silos were opened after 97 days, and the ensiled forages sampled to determine chemical composition. The aerobic stability of the different silages was then determined over an 8 -day period. The optimum growth stage for harvesting for both varieties occurred at 16. 5 weeks after sowing. Although the fresh matter yield of Nelly {{was significantly higher than}} that of Arthur (47, 590 kg ha? 1 versus 36, 580 kg ha? 1), the dry matter (DM) yield of the two varieties was similar (overall mean 5953 kg DM ha? 1). Choice of harvesting date significantly affected the DM, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) and nitrate concentrations of the wilted forage, but did not influence the crude protein (CP) concentration or buffering capacity. The silages prepared from the Arthur variety had lower concentrations of CP (209 g kg? 1 DM versus 229 g kg? 1 DM), WSC (12. 2 g kg? 1 DM versus 16. 3 g kg? 1 DM) and free amino acids (FAA) (0. 510 moles kg? 1 DM versus 0. 666 moles kg? 1 DM) than those produced from Nelly. Between-harvest date differences in the concentrations of DM, ammonia-N, WSC, NDF, lactic acid, acetic acid and FAA of the lupin silage were observed, together with effects on dry matter digestibility. Inoculation was found to significantly reduce the pH and ammonia-N, acetic acid, FAA and CP concentrations, and increase the DM and WSC concentrations of the lupin <b>silages.</b> <b>Effluent</b> production and DM losses were higher for silages prepared from the Nelly variety, but the aerobic stability of the silages from the two varieties was similar. The results obtained indicate that white lupins can be successfully ensiled as a whole-crop, and that the application of an inoculant is beneficial. In terms of agronomy and silage composition the spring variety Nelly out-performed the autumn variety Arthur when both were sown in spring. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Presently {{there are}} two forms of {{biological}} fibre extraction, water retting or dew retting, which use bacteria or fungi, respectively. Microbial action results in release of the cellulose fibres due to modification of the pectin, hemicellulose and lignin content from parenchyma cells and the middle lamellae. Water retting results in pollution, high costs associated with labour and drying, as well as significant waste water production, while disadvantages to dew retting include the need for appropriate climates, variable and inferior fibre quality, risks of over-retting as well as health effects due to dust and fungal contaminants. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to explore silage retting as a new pre-processing technique allowing use of available farm infrastructure and contained retting conditions to produce plant-derived fibres with improved physical and chemical characteristics suitable for application in biocomposites. The corn processing ability of the hemp retting agents Clostridium felsineum and Bacillus subtilis was also investigated. Pleiotropic and/or crop management practices were assessed by comparing the physico-mechanical properties and the microbial populations during silage fermentation of genetically equivalent conventional, Roundup Ready® (RR) and Bt-Roundup Ready® (Bt-RR) corn isolines. Potential recovery of volatile organic acids in <b>silage</b> retting <b>effluent</b> as value-added chemicals was also explored. The results indicated that C. felsineum is an effective corn retting agent given the effective release of the fibre bundles from the corn pith, with B. subtilis contributing to the retting process by reducing the oxygen content and providing the required anaerobic conditions for clostridial growth. The native microflora present in the plant phyllosphere also showed some retting ability. Composition, thermostability and mechanical properties of the biocomposites produced using the fibres from the retted corn were all found to vary depending on the variety of corn. Specifically, retted Bt-RR cornstalk showed a 15 °C increase in onset of degradation. Divergences between corn silage microbial communities analyzed by community-level physiological and enzyme activity profiling indicated that metabolic shifts were time-, region-, and contaminant-sensitive. Acetic and butyric acid production in <b>silage</b> retting <b>effluent</b> was found to be highest under anaerobic conditions and was also influenced by corn hybrid variety, although a specific variety was not identified as most or least favourable for organic acid production due to high variability. Bt-RR cornstalk material was found to have higher cellulose content and better thermostability with an onset of degradation of up to 45 °C higher than its genetic RR and conventional counterparts. However, fibres from the RR corn isoline produced biocomposites with the highest flexural strength and modulus. RR cornstalk-reinforced polypropylene showed a 37 and 94 % increase in flexural strength and modulus, respectively when compared to the mechanical properties of the pure polypropylene. The Bt-RR and conventional varieties produced biocomposites with an average increase of 26. 5 % in flexural strength and 83. 5 % in flexural modulus. The thermostability of ensiled corn biomass was found to be influenced by region, use of inoculants and silage treatment, while the silage treatment accounted for most of the variability in corn biomass composition. Polypropylene matrix biocomposites produced with (30 wt%) pre- and post-silage corn did not show significant differences in mechanical properties. However, ensiled corn resulted in an increase in fibres and potential microbial biomass of smaller particle sizes with more optimal thermostability and purity, producing biocomposites with higher flexural strength and modulus especially at higher extrusion temperatures. Cornstalk is an effective reinforcement material, producing biocomposites with higher flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength. Whole corn biomass presents a potential alternative to other plant fibres, especially as filler material. Silage retting resulted in fibres with a higher thermostability and smaller particle size distribution that, given their already smaller aspect ratio, could result in better mechanical properties in thermoplastics with a higher melting temperature or biocomposites requiring higher shear for mixing...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, the {{downward}} trend in numbers of fish kills continued, the total {{for the year}} being 32. However, in 1995 a long spell of dry weather greatly reduced the flow in rivers {{in all parts of}} Ireland and the number of fish kills rose to 84, the highest since 1989. In 1994, farmyard <b>effluents,</b> <b>silage</b> and slurry together accounted for one third of the fish kills. Industrial effluents and enrichment both caused 19 % of the total. Storm water runoff and cement spillage in building operations were the other identified causes. In 1995, enrichment was the most frequent problem, followed by agriculture. Inadequately treated sewage was implicated in five cases and waterworks effluent in two. In 17 cases the mortalities were associated with reduced water flows or high temperatures or a combination of the two. The dry summer in a number of cases revealed unsatisfactory levels of pollution which are usually masked by higher water flows such as occurred in 1994. The increase in farm-based problems suggested that some of the improved facilities for storage and treatment of farm waste which were made in the late 1980 s may now be due for maintenance. Enrichment of lake systems, particularly those of the Erne and Shannon, has now established itself as the most serious threat to the condition of natural waters.

40|$|Next to soil, {{water is}} the {{resource}} mostly threatened with agricultural practices. Agricultural pollutants (fertilizers, pesticides, <b>silage</b> <b>effluent,</b> organic manures and other farm wastes) enter the water through the run off, erosion, leaching and rarely by direct input. Studies from {{various parts of the}} world have shown that agriculture represents major, much more serious source of water pollution than any other sector (industry, transport, population, tourism, etc.) or sometimes all these sectors together. The same counts for Danube, and this has been confirmed by the recent Danube Environmental Integrated Study. The damage to priority functions of ground and surface water in the Danube basin (DB) and part of the north western shelf of the Black Sea is estimated at some 8 billion DEM/year. More than a half of the territory of the Danube basin is used for agricultural activities and agriculture represents an important economic activity of the region. Except in Germany and Austria, farmers in all other Danube countries currently practice mostly low-input agriculture. This is due to the post-communistic economic transition resulting in price liberization and serious disproportion between change of producer, input and retail price of agricultural commodities. This situation resulted in reduced purchasing power and demand for agricultural commodities inducing a mere negative profit margins for farmers.

40|$|Biogas {{production}} is {{the conversion of}} the organic material into methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used in continental and Scandinavian communities as both a waste treatment option and a source of renewable energy. Ireland however lags behind this European movement. Numerous feedstocks exist which could be digested and used to fuel a renewable transport fleet in Ireland. An issue exists with the variety of feedstocks; these need to be assessed and quantified to ascertain their potential resource and application to AD. From literature the ideal C:N ratio is between 25 and 30 : 1. Low levels of C:N (< 15) can lead to problems with ammonia inhibition. Within the digester a plentiful supply of nutrients and a balanced C:N is required for stable performance. Feedstocks were sampled from a range of over 100 different substrates in Ireland including for first, second and third generation feedstocks. The C:N ranged from 81 : 1 (Winter Oats) to 7 : 1 (<b>Silage</b> <b>Effluent).</b> The BMP yields were recorded ranging from 38 ± 2. 0 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS for pig slurry (weaning pigs) to 805 ± 57 L CH 4 kg− 1 VS for used cooking oil (UCO).

We also determined gas production and effluent. There was a linear increase in DM content and pH, and a linear decrease of CP, NDF and ADF, lignin, cellulose, caffeine, Ca and P. This reduction occurs because the coffee hulls have lower levels than pulp to CP, NDF, ADF, caffeine, Ca and P.

Efficiency of {{microbial}} {{protein synthesis}} on red clover and ryegrass silages supplemented with barley by rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC). Animal Feed Science and Technology, 118, (1 - 2), 79 - 91. Bacterial protein supply from the rumen is frequently low in animals fed on silage-based diets, partially {{because of the}} lack of rumen available sources of energy. An in vitro experiment was designed to determine the optimum rate of inclusion of rolled barley to optimise rumen efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis (EBPS) of diets comprising a typical ryegrass silage (GR; crude protein (CP) = 139 g/kg dry matter (DM); water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) = 71 g/kg DM; NH 3 ?N = 133 g/kg N; pH 4. 23) or red clover silage (RC; CP = 168 g/kg DM; WSC = 28 g/kg DM; NH 3 ?N = 80 g/kg N; pH 4. 12). Both silages were mixed with increasing proportions of barley grain (0, 150, 300 and 450 g/kg DM). Treatments were tested using the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC), replicated in three independent 10 -day incubation periods (blocks). Artificial saliva was infused at a rate of 0. 5 ml/min, and on day 4 of incubation 15 NH 4 SO 4 was added as a microbial marker. Ammonia?N and pH of the effluent were above 50 mg/l and 6. 6, respectively, in all treatments and at all time points measured. Inclusion of barley grain reduced the effluent concentrations of acetic, propionic and total volatile fatty acids (P ? 0. 06). Apparent digestibilities of DM (DMAD) and organic matter (OMAD) did not differ between RC or GR silages, but RC had lower (P < 0. 001) neutral and acid detergent fibre digestibilities than GR <b>silage.</b> The <b>effluent</b> concentrations of acetic, propionic, butyric and total volatile fatty acids from GR was higher (P < 0. 05) than from RC diets. Inclusion of barley grain linearly (P < 0. 06) reduced the effluent acetic, propionic and total volatile fatty acid concentrations, but increased DMAD, OMAD and efficiency of bacterial dry matter synthesis (EBDMS). However, there was no clear response in EBPS from GR silage supplemented with barley, but in RC silage, EBPS increased up to a barley inclusion rate of 300 g/kg DM. It is concluded that rumen microorganisms reduced the amount of substrate fermented in correspondence with the increment in barley grain. The EBPS increased in RC silage by adding barley at rates of up to 300 g/kg DM. Conversely, the addition of barley to GR silage had no apparent effect on EBPS. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of different quantities of grape pomace added to Calotropis procera silage on its fermentation, in vitro digestibility, total digestible nutrients and microbiology. A completely randomized experimental design was used with four treatments (0, 10, 20 and 40 % fresh matter) and four replicates. The silos were opened after 90 days of ensilage, and the soluble carbohydrate, ethanol, organic acid and ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations; pH; fermentation loss; dry matter (DM) recovery; DM density, and microbial populations were determined. The pH (3. 96 - 3. 87) was adequate for ensiling in all silage samples. The soluble carbohydrate concentration decreased (p< 0. 05), and the ethanol concentration increased with increasing quantities of grape pomace. The lactic acid concentration decreased (p< 0. 05) from 5. 3 to 1. 94 % DM, and the acetic, propionic and butyric acid concentrations increased with increasing quantities of grape pomace. The lactic acid bacteria decreased linearly (p < 0. 05), varying from 6. 43 to 5. 82 log CFU/g silage. The mold and yeast population variations fit best using a third-order polynomial equation (p < 0. 05). Enterobacteria and Clostridium spp were not observed. Adding grape pomace to the <b>silage</b> increased the <b>effluent</b> and gas loss; the latter varied from 5. 35 to 14. 4 %.

Houve efeito do processamento, dos níveis de casca e dos dias nas demandas química e bioquímica de oxigênio. A casca de café é eficiente em reduzir a produção de efluente da silagem de capim-elefante, principalmente quando moída, pois tem mais efeito que inteira. A composição do efluente é influenciada pelos dias de coleta do efluente e pelos níveis e processamento da casca de café. The {{experiment was}} carried out to evaluate the effects of processing (whole or ground) and including coffee hulls in elephant grass <b>silage</b> on the <b>effluent</b> production and composition. A randomized complete design in a 2 &# 215; 5 factorial design with two processes (whole or ground) and five coffee hull levels (0; 6; 12; 18 and 24 %) each with three replications. A split-plot design {{was used to assess}} the effluent composition, where the main plot consisted of a 2 &# 215; 3 factorial with two processes and three coffee hull levels (0, 6, 12 %) and the split-plot consisted of the effluent collection days, with three replications. The total effluent production was 243. 1 L/t silage for silage without hulls, 196. 8; 93. 2; 30. 8; 3. 1 and 149. 1; 52. 3; 30. 8; 0. 0 L/t for the silages with whole and ground hulls at levels of 6, 12, 18 and 24 %, respectively. The hull processing and inclusion levels had a quadratic effect, according to the days, on the total solids and total nitrogen contents. A quadratic effect of the processing and days and the hull levels and days, respectively, on the composition in calcium and magnesium. The hull levels and the coffee hull processing had a linear effect on the phosphorus content in the effluent. There were effects of processing, hull levels and of the days on the contents of chemical and biochemical demands for oxygen. Coffee hulls were efficient in reducing effluent production in the elephantgrass silage, especially when ground, because they had more effect than when whole. The effluent composition is influenced by the day of collection and inclusion and processing of coffee hull levels...|$|R
