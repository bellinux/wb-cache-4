40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>texturing</b> with {{purposely}} made regular micropatterns on flat or curved surfaces, {{as opposed}} to random roughness inherited from machining processes, has attracted significant attention in recent years. At the 2013 World Tribology Congress in Turin alone there were over 40 presentations related to <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> for tribological applications, from magnetic hard discs and hydrodynamic bearings to artificial joints. Although <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> has been reported being successfully applied in industrial applications such as seals, pistons, and thrust pad bearings, the demand for robust design is still high. Etsion has recently reviewed the modeling research mainly conducted by his group Etsion I (2013 Friction 1 195 – 209).

40|$|Micro-scale <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> {{have found}} {{profound}} application in various industrial sectors, including the biomedical and tribological communities. While numerous manufacturing methods {{are available for}} the fabrication of these micro-features, advancements in high-precision machinery and piezoelectric actuation have allowed {{for the development of}} new and scalable processes for mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> based on modulation-assisted machining. The present study aims to understand the effects of micro-scale <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> produced by modulation-assisted machining on surface performance in biomedical and tribological configurations. To accomplish this, a predictive geometric model was developed to simulate surfaces generated in multiple mechanical texturing orientations. Experimental studies were carried out to generate controlled <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> over a range of characteristics in terms of feature size and morphology. The surface performance of the resulting textures in a biomedical implant application were tested for osseointegration capability with in vivo and in vitro tests. For these tests, a bilateral rat tibia model and precursor osteoblast MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell culture were used, respectively. Surface performance of the micro-scale <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> in a tribological application was evaluated using a pin-on-disk wear testing configuration.

5|$|The mass of spores is blackish brown, {{or brown}} if viewed under polarised light. The <b>surface</b> <b>texture</b> ranges from almost smooth to warty, and the spores measure 7–9µm in diameter. Material {{collected}} from Oregon, however, varies from European material in several ways: the fruit body is brown; the branching of the capillitium from the columella differs (having {{primary and secondary}} branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip); the spore mass is tan, and individual spores measure 10–12µm.|$|E

The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail.

It has been demonstrated in gallium nitride (GaN) devices operating at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, that <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> increase the overall device efficiency. In this work, we fabricated eight different <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> in GaSb {{to be used in}} enhancing efficiency in infrared wavelength devices. Through chemical etching with hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and tartaric acid we characterize the types of <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> formed and the removal rate of entire layers of GaSb. Through optimization of the etching recipes we lower the reflectivity from 35. 7 % to 1 % at 4 μm wavelength for bare and textured GaSb, respectively. In addition, we simulate <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> using ray optics in finite element method solver software to provide explanation of our experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|The water {{contact angle}} and {{self-cleaning}} property of microfabricated <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> possessing different topologies are compared.

We find that the water apparent contact angle of the connected textures agrees with the Cassie equation [Discuss. Faraday Soc. 3, 11 (1948) ], but that of the disconnected textures is much larger. Nevertheless, the disconnected textures exhibit inferior self-cleaning property, contrary to conventional conception. We discuss the possible reasons for these observations...|$|R

They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient ring.

25|$|Sampson {{and others}} studied centrosaurine bonebeds {{and found that}} the {{individuals}} preserved therein could be categorized into three broad phases of developments; juveniles, subadults, and adults. The researchers defined these age groups based on specimens' body size, the <b>surface</b> <b>texture</b> of their bones, and how completely closed the sutures between their bones were. They observed that the juveniles and subadults of different centrosaurine species are practically indistinguishable and can only be told apart upon reaching adulthood when their horns and frills were fully developed.|$|E
25|$|The cyprid larva is {{the last}} larval stage before adulthood. It is not a feeding stage; its role {{is to find a}} {{suitable}} place to settle, since the adults are sessile. The cyprid stage lasts from days to weeks. It explores potential surfaces with modified antennules; once it has found a potentially suitable spot, it attaches head-first using its antennules, and a secreted glycoproteinous substance. Larvae assess surfaces based upon their <b>surface</b> <b>texture,</b> chemistry, relative wettability, colour, and the presence/absence and composition of a surface biofilm; swarming species {{are also more likely to}} attach near other barnacles. As the larva exhausts its finite energy reserves, it becomes less selective in the sites it selects. It cements itself permanently to the substrate with another proteinaceous compound, and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle.|$|E
25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same <b>surface</b> <b>texture,</b> crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E
40|$|An n-side-up GaN/mirror(Pd/Au) /Si {{light-emitting}} diode (LED) with <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> has been fabricated {{by a combination}} of wafer-bonding, laser lift-off, and <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> techniques. Two concentrations of KOH solution were used to roughen the n-GaN surface. In order to obtain a uniformly roughened surface, the solution was heated instead of being subjected to photoirradiation. The GaN/Pd/Au/Si LEDs with <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> exhibited a maximum luminance intensity of 130 mcd (at 20 mA) with a forward voltage of 3. 2 V. The luminance intensity is over two times larger than that of the original planar GaN/sapphire LEDs (at 20 mA). Under high current injection, the surface textured GaN/Pd/Au/Si LEDs also showed a more stable luminance intensity. This feature is attributed to the Si substrate providing a good heat sink and surface roughening enhancing the external quantum efficiency. Furthermore, the n-side-up GaN/mirror(Pd/Au) /Si LEDs with <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> have been demonstrated to have high reliability...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been great {{interest}} {{in the application of}} the <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> method to enhance material surface performance. Material surfaces sometimes experience rapid temperature changes, and the local surface will obviously generate thermal stresses, which may be detrimental to the material structure. In order to understand the relationship between <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> and stresses, a numerical approach is used to investigate the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> on stresses. The results show that <b>surface</b> <b>texturing</b> can generate compressive stresses along the normal direction of the surface, and that strong tensional stresses can be formed {{in the center of a}} surface at the same time that are beneficial to material surface performance. However, a smooth surface cannot generate these beneficial stresses. In addition, there is an optimum design size with respect to textures, and the most desirable state of stress in a surface layer can be achieved at this size...|$|R

25|$|In health, the dorsal {{surface of}} the tongue is covered in tuft like {{projections}} called lingual papillae (some of which are associated with taste buds), which give the tongue an irregular <b>surface</b> <b>texture</b> and a white-pink color. Geographic tongue is characterized by areas of atrophy and depapillation (loss of papillae), leaving an erythematous (darker red) and smoother surface than the unaffected areas. The depapillated areas are usually well demarcated, and bordered by a slightly raised, white, yellow or grey, serpiginous (snaking) peripheral zone. A lesion of geographic tongue may start as a white patch before the depapillation occurs. In certain cases there may be only one lesion, but this is uncommon; the lesions will typically occur in multiple locations on the tongue and coalesce over time to form the typical map-like appearance. The lesions usually change in shape, size and migrate to other areas, sometimes within hours. The condition may affect {{only part of the}} tongue, with a predilection for the tip and the sides of the tongue, or the entire dorsal surface at any one time. The condition goes through periods of remission and relapse. Loss of the white peripheral zone is thought to signify periods of mucosal healing.|$|E
25|$|Texture mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, <b>surface</b> <b>texture,</b> or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E
25|$|The statue {{measures}} 74 centimetres (29inches) in height; {{the pedestal}} is 27 centimetres (10.6inches) in width. The {{core of the}} sculpture was carved from {{a single piece of}} wood, most likely from a poplar tree, though earlier art historians have assumed it to be pear, plum or lime. The sculpture’s surface is entirely covered with sheets of gold leaf less than 0.25 millimetres (0.01in) thick, which are held in place by minute golden bolts. The size of the individual gold leaves varies to suit the <b>surface</b> <b>texture.</b> The faces of both mother and child are pounded out of one single leaf each. The coloured eyes of the figures are made of cloisonné enamel. While the eyes of the mother are inset into carved fittings, those of the child are merely pasted on the wooden core.

There are traces of original tenth century adornments on the orb in the Virgin's right hand, on the right back leg of the stool, {{as well as on the}} child's book and halo.

40|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} analysis was performed for 570 quartz grains from desert and coastal dune sands in NW Mexico. Our main goal is to present a new application {{in the use of}} ternary diagrams with logistic normal confidence region boundaries of normalized data based on quartz <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> (i. e., constrained data) of desert and coastal dune sands. This was done to demonstrate that quartz <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> from desert and coastal dune sands are not significantly different even though there are apparent dominant processes (mechanical, chemical) that produce different <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> in quartz grains from both dune types. This may be associated with the fact that quartz grains deposited in the dune sands do not reflect a second cycle of transport associated with an aeolian environment because of their low textural maturity, provenance, closeness to the source rock, and little attrition process. This study indicates that quartz grains from the desert dunes display mechanical textures probably associated with the Colorado River Delta and granitic sources that do not reflect accurately the aeolian mechanisms controlling the transport of these grains. Also, some quartz grains display chemical <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> probably linked to the hydrothermal activity near the Colorado River Delta. In general, quartz grains display conspicuous <b>surface</b> <b>textures.</b> Quartz from coastal dune sands displays chemical <b>surface</b> <b>textures</b> that indicate quartz precipitation from silica-saturated water and, to a lesser extent, it displays mechanical features.

500|$|Differences between Hydnellum species {{tend to be}} more {{distinguishable}} {{in younger}} specimens. Fruitbody development is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as levels of rainfall, drying winds, and temperature. The blue tooth (H.caeruleum), for example, develops a deeper blue color when it grows during cooler autumn weather. [...] Optimal growth occurs during periods of frequent light rains and high humidity; if the habitat dries out, growth will stop, but may resume after further precipitation. This intermittent growth affects the fruitbodies of different species to variable extents, leading to large variations in form, <b>surface</b> <b>texture,</b> and color. The morphological variability of fruitbodies and the dependence of their appearance upon environmental conditions has made Hydnellum a difficult group to study. Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison, who described several new species from North America, noted [...] "he remarkable longevity of individual sporophores of many species and the changes in appearance that occur during the long period of their development have confused all workers studying this group." [...] For example, H.aurantiacum, initially white, becomes in turn shades of orange, rusty-brown, and brownish-black. Its fruitbody initially has a turbinate (cushion-like) shape with a lumpy surface, later becoming flattened to funnel-shaped with a smooth to corrugated <b>surface</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|E
