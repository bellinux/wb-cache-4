30|$|The quality <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> aims to make {{data and}} {{information}} available to the authorized users when it is needed. Very often, data is time-sensitive and the value may diminish if delayed. A typical failure mode for availability of a system occurs when access to the information is delayed or denied due to denial-of-service attacks, power outages, floods, fires, or other environmental or man-made disasters. The best corrective actions to ensure data availability are regular data backups, off-site data storage, redundant parallel systems, and physical protection of information systems.|$|E

With the advent of simplified computing technologies, it is not impossible to achieve a high availability firewall setup within a reasonably short span of time. The focus of this paper is on the subject of high availability (HA). Key fingerprint = AF 19 FA 27 2 F 94 998 D FDB 5 DE 3 D F 8 B 5 06 E 4 A 169 4 E 46 It kicks off by acquainting oneself with the term HA, analyzing the need for HA, categorizing the modes of HA, understanding the technicalities of HA, and finally setting up an HA model based on the WatchGuard Firebox Vclass V 60, including troubleshooting procedures. It wraps up by emphasizing the fact that high availability is not the sole factor for total system reliability. Interdependency between other factors {{plays a key role in}} ensuring the availability aspect of information security. Preface In the era of Information Technology: High Availability (HA) refers to a system or component that is continuously operational for a desirably long length of time. Availability can be measured relative to " 100 % operational " or "never failing. " A widely-held but difficult-to-achieve <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> for a system or product is known as "five 9 s " (99. 999 percent) availability 1, equivalent to five (5) minutes of downtime per year.

In particular, taking finiteness of the available production capacity explicitly into account, {{has been a major}} improvement <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> practice. <b>Availability</b> <b>of</b> raw materials, however, which is another important constraint in practice, has been largely disregarded in scheduling theory. This paper considers basic models for scheduling problems in contemporary manufacturing settings where raw material <b>availability</b> is <b>of</b> critical importance. We explore single scheduling machine problems, mostly with unit or all equal processing times, and Lmax and Cmax objectives. We present polynomial time algorithms, complexity and approximation results, and computational experiments. 1...|$|R

In this paper, we present a methodology for identifying and formally analysing safety and security requirements, based on the STPA methodology and combined with modelling, traceability and formal verification through use of the Event-B formal method. Our STPA approach is then leveraged to generate ‘critical requirements’ to mitigate against undesirable system states, which are subsequently translated into constraints on an Event-B representation of the system. The Rodin toolset allows us to demonstrate that these critical requirements fully mitigate against the undesirable system states and therefore provide automated verification of the critical requirements...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The urban {{environment}} can cause obstruction {{of the sky}} thereby affecting sunlight and daylight availability on the building fenestration and also further inside the building. This study uses the Preferable Sky Window (PSW) parameter to analyze daylighting availability in different urban scenarios with the objective to obtain some basic guidelines for daylighting access in {{urban environment}}s. The PSW consists of a sky zone which identifies the sky section that has the greatest daylight potential in a horizontal plan located in the indoor environment. The scenarios with the most unobstructed PWS parameter were assumed {{to have the most}} daylight availability. The urban scenarios tested consisted of a fixed volume of buildings located in a pre-determined plot area. A computational daylighting simulation was also performed to correlate the PSW obstruction with the indoor daylighting performance. Daylighting simulation and PSW analyses were performed using Apolux code. According to this work, guidelines can be developed restricting building height and spacing in order to provide minimum <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> daylight <b>availability.</b> However, the same rules cannot be directly applied when the occupation pattern is not the same...|$|R

30|$|Discussion and conclusion: Due to the {{unexpected}} high RCP values after addition of impurities to sestamibi, all the analytical methods lacked specificity and accuracy. The MN test method showed exceptionally high values for sestamibi due to co-elution {{of the free}} pertechnetate with sestamibi. The MN RCP test method could therefore {{not be used as}} a reference standard. All three methods met the acceptance criteria for repeatability, intermediate precision, and robustness. Validating an analytical procedure in a hospital setting is only possible once some important prerequisites are met, such as <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> specified materials for the reference procedure, reliable reference <b>standards,</b> and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> HPLC for radiopharmaceuticals that have impurities other than pertechnetate and colloid.
