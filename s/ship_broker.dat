25|$|In 1822, Brodie McGhie Willcox, a London <b>ship</b> <b>broker,</b> and Arthur Anderson, {{a sailor}} from the Shetland Isles, {{northern}} Scotland, went into partnership {{to operate a}} shipping line, primarily operating routes between England and Spain and Portugal.

The company flag colours are directly connected with the Peninsular flags: the white and blue represent the Portuguese flag in 1837, and the yellow and red the Spanish flag.|$|E
2500|$|Sanctions {{tightened}} further when major supertanker {{companies said}} they would stop loading Iranian cargo. Prior attempts to reduce Iran's oil income failed because many vessels are often managed by companies outside the United States and the EU; however, EU actions in January extended the ban to ship insurance. This insurance ban will affect 95 percent of the tanker fleet because their insurance falls under rules governed by European law. [...] "It's the insurance that's completed the ban on trading with Iran," [...] commented one veteran <b>ship</b> <b>broker.</b> This completion of the trading ban left Iran struggling to find a buyer for {{nearly a quarter of}} its annual oil exports. Iran has sought to manage the impact of international sanctions and limit capital outflows by promoting a [...] "resistance economy," [...] replacing imports with domestic goods and banning luxury imports such as computers and mobile phones. [...] This is predicted to lead to an increase in smuggling, as [...] "people {{will find a way to}} smuggle in what the Iranian consumer wants." [...] To sustain oil imports, Iran has also provided domestic insurance for tankers shipping Iranian oil. Iran had hoped to sell more to Chinese and Indian refiners, though such attempts seem unlikely to succeed, particularly since China—the single-largest buyer of Iranian crude—has been curtailing its oil imports from Iran down to half their former level.|$|E
