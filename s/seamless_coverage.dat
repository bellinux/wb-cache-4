This article describes a recent technology development that provides a breakthrough in this capability for platforms carrying a dual-frequency GPS receiver – <b>seamless</b> global <b>coverage</b> and roughly {{an order of magnitude}} improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art. Our reference network is a subset of NASA’s Global GPS Network (GGN), consisting of geodetic quality dual-frequency receivers. Using novel internet-based technology for editing and real-time streaming of data from the GGN as input to a real-time orbit determination software, JPL’s new global differential system has demonstrated ~ 10 cm horizontal and ~ 20 cm vertical real time positioning accuracy for a ground-based dual-frequency GPS receiver [Muellerschoen et al., 2000]. This performance is roughly an order of magnitude better than any differential service currently available. Although a number of private and government organizations provide localized real-time positioning services to users on or near the ground, a global system such as demonstrated here, capable of supporting global users far away from any ground reference site, has never been achieved nor attempted due to the perceived technical and cost challenges.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} set of LAS enhancements to enable support for topographicbathymetric (topo-bathy) lidar. The importance of these enhancements stems, in part, from {{the emergence of a}} new class of topo-bathy lidar systems that occupies the middle ground between conventional bathymetric and commercial topographic systems and provides <b>seamless,</b> highresolution <b>coverage</b> across the backshore, intertidal, and shallow nearshore zones. Many users of these systems and the data they provide are interested in integrating the data into existing topographic lidar processing streams. However, the stock LAS specification does not currently support these data. The Topo-Bathy Lidar Domain Profile adds point classification values for bathymetric point, water surface, derived water surface, submerged object, IHO S- 57 object, and bottom not found depth. Extra Byte Variable Length Records (EXTRA_BYTES or Extra Byte VLRs) are added for pseudo-reflectance, uncertainty, water column depth, figure of merit, and processing specific flags. Note that some of the new attributes should be equally applicable to topo-only lidar. The changes listed below have been vetted through members of the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX) and other members of the coastal lidar community.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{plans to}} replace current {{terrestrial}} navigation systems with a satellite-based system called the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The two main systems planned for navigation are the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). Both systems {{rely on the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation, augmented {{by a combination of}} additional geostationary satellites and ground reference signals. These augmentations are required to meet aviation requirements for service availability, integrity, continuity, and accuracy. Together, WAAS and LAAS will provide <b>seamless</b> navigation <b>coverage</b> throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). WAAS will provide en route and terminal guidance throughout the NAS and Category I landing guidance at most airports. LAAS will be used exclusively to provide Category II and III landing guidance at all airports, and Category I where it is not provided by WAAS. This paper presents the approach and methodology used in developing a combined cost benefit analysis of both systems. Previous analyses addressed separate and independent implementations of each system. The combined analysis is designed to capture all costs and benefits attributable to both systems, ensuring a comprehensive and fair assessment. The analysis attributes costs and benefits to air carriers and other aircraft operators, passengers of air carriers, airport operators, and the FAA. Cost avoidance is included through the decommissioning of the current terrestrial navigation infrastructure.

40|$|Satellite {{communication}} {{is regarded as}} a promising way to achieve <b>seamless</b> global <b>coverage</b> with an array of advantages over the traditional terrestrial network. However, the non-uniform distribution of users and the highly topological dynamics have been a matter of facts. The traditional load balancing technique is able to guarantee a better traffic distribution around the Inter Satellite Links with heavy loads after considering the non-uniform distribution of users, but it transmits load information passively and fails to provide a fair traffic distribution over the entire constellation. Given the highly topological dynamics, traditional routing protocols may experience the convergence processes frequently or use a large amount of storage to keep the snapshots. This paper proposes a novel routing protocol named LPR for the Satellite IP Networks, which transmits the bottleneck link load information to upstream satellites in a Hop-by-Hop manner actively, to guarantee a better distribution of traffic among satellites. In response, upstream satellites select less congested paths and communicate a portion of data according to the priority of different classes of traffic. In addition, LPR applies the geographical position when selecting the routing path to eliminate the convergence process which may cause the routing tables invalid. Finally, various aspects of performance of LPR have compared with other mechanisms. Our evaluations show that a routing protocol with load-aware and position-aided leads to higher throughput and better traffic distribution compared to the traditional routing protocol and load balancing technique...|$|R

Practical mobility and Quality of Service (QoS) aware solutions are proposed for a heterogeneous network, comprising of satellite and terrestrial access networks connected to an IP core network. The aim, in adopting a heterogeneous environment, is to provide global, <b>seamless</b> service <b>coverage</b> to a specific area, allowing access to services independently of location. An important assumption is that nomadic user terminals attached to a particular segment {{should be able to}} exchange information with any other terminal connected to the network. This is to ensure transparency of device technology. Different communication scenarios are investigated in support of IPv 4 and IPv 6 operating on user platforms and over access segments. The heterogeneous network necessitates the need to perform handover between access segments to enable <b>coverage</b> extension and <b>seamless</b> connectivity. Handover procedures are analyzed, and an approach is presented that enables various operation and segment specific parameters {{to be taken into account}} when deciding upon the need to perform handover and in selecting the optimum access segment. In order to ensure transparency of network technology, the need for end-to-end QoS support is discussed, bearing in mind the deployment of both IntServ and DiffServ enabled routers in the core network. Following this, a new admission control scheme, named Gauge&Gate Reservation with Independent Probing (GRIP), is proposed. The paper concludes with a description of a laboratory testbed, which has been developed in order to verify the presented procedures, together with performance measurements of the handover and the GRIP algorithms...|$|R
