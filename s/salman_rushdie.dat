5|$|Riya's {{on-screen}} performances {{have established}} {{her as a}} bold youth icon in India.

Such performances garnered negative attention because of the relatively conservative outlook of Indian cinema {{at that time and}} her own statements about such practices. In 2008, Riya Sen was also linked to author <b>Salman</b> <b>Rushdie.</b> Before becoming a film star, she had a reputation for partying, which started at the age of fifteen.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against <b>Salman</b> <b>Rushdie</b> by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats). In the 1995 presidential election, Le Pen rose slightly to 15% of the vote.|$|E
