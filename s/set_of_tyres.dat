5|$|Sergio Pérez was demoted to seventh {{with the}} {{application}} of a gearbox penalty, following a change made necessary after he hit the barrier in turn 15 during the last practice session. This promoted Ricciardo, Vettel, Räikkönen, Massa, and Kvyat up the grid in the process. Sainz and Magnussen were also demoted, with Magnussen having to start from the pit lane. Lewis Hamilton was given permission to change his front left tyre ahead of the race. Under the regulations, a driver who qualifies in the top ten must start the race on the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> they used to record their best time {{in the second part of}} qualifying. However, Hamilton's front left tyre, which belonged to the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> that he subsequently used to set his fastest time during his next flying lap, was deemed to be too damaged following his lock-up going into turn seven, necessitating its change on safety grounds.|$|E
5|$|In Q2, it was Hamilton {{who came}} out on top, exactly six-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Verstappen was third fastest, ahead of Ricciardo in fifth. Kimi Räikkönen had to abandon his first fast lap after running wide in turn four, but later set a time good enough for fourth. Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel {{recorded}} just one timed lap, saving a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> and was sixth. On his return to Toro Rosso, Kvyat was eliminated in 13th place, while teammate Sainz went through to Q3. Sergio Pérez advanced as well, demoting his teammate Hülkenberg into elimination in the process, who would line up eleventh on the grid. Joining him on the sidelines for Q3 were Jenson Button in twelfth, with Romain Grosjean, Kevin Magnussen and Esteban Gutiérrez lining up behind Kvyat.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:21.370, ahead of teammate Häkkinen who was two-tenths of a second slower. Ralf Schumacher (with a time of 1:21.604) was third quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher and Villeneuve. Fisichella and Frentzen followed in sixth and seventh. The two Arrows drivers were eighth and ninth (with Verstappen ahead of Pedro de la Rosa). Mika Salo rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session, Michael Schumacher used a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> and set the fastest time of 1:21.088; Coulthard finished with the second quickest lap. Barrichello was third fastest, in front of Häkkinen who struggled {{with a lack of}} grip and a loose rear end. Ralf Schumacher recorded the fifth fastest time. The Jordan drivers were sixth and seventh (with Trulli in front of Frentzen). de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
50|$|Every driver {{starts the}} weekend with {{thirteen}} <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres,</b> at least fifteen weeks before a non-European race Pirelli will announce which {{three of the five}} dry-weather compounds are available during the weekend. For European races this is nine weeks. They also nominate two mandatory sets for the race, one of which has {{to be used in the}} race. With one <b>of</b> the thirteen <b>sets</b> being the softest and reserved for the final qualifying session. This leaves ten sets being freely choosable by each driver. To the thirteen <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres,</b> three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> wet-weather <b>tyres</b> and four <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> intermediate <b>tyres</b> are added. During a weekend at certain moments drivers have to hand back <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres.</b> The first <b>set</b> has to be handed back after forty minutes in the first practice session and one at the end. For the other two practice sessions two sets have to be handed in at the end.|$|R
25|$|Tyre changes {{returned}} to Formula One in 2006. Each driver {{is limited to}} 14 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> per race weekend. This consists <b>of</b> seven <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> dry-weather <b>tyres,</b> four <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> wet-weather <b>tyres</b> and three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> extreme-weather <b>tyres.</b> The thinking behind {{this is that the}} reduced engine size will offset any performance gain. The number of constructors who were supplied tyres by Michelin was down from seven to six while Bridgestone increased from three to five. Michelin announced they would withdraw from the championship after the 2006 season.|$|R
25|$|Michelin {{were the}} sole tyre {{supplier}} in Superleague Formula. Cars were allowed four new <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> throughout a race weekend, lasting practice sessions, qualifying {{and all the}} races. Under conditions of rain, there was no limit to how many <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> wet <b>tyres</b> that can be used.|$|R
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. Conditions were dry and overcast for the Friday {{practice sessions}} and was held on a dirty track which was caused by rainfall in the run up to the event. Michael Schumacher set the first session's fastest time with an early lap of 1 minute and 21.982 seconds, half a second quicker than teammate Barrichello. Häkkinen had the third fastest time, ahead of Ralf Schumacher and Jean Alesi. The two Benetton drivers were sixth and eighth (with Fisichella ahead of Alexander Wurz); the two were separated by Johnny Herbert. Eddie Irvine and Verstappen completed the top ten. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher was unable to improve his time but remained fastest; Ralf Schumacher had the second fastest time after putting on a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> {{towards the end of the}} session. Barrichello was third-fastest, ahead of Jarno Trulli, Coulthard and Jenson Button. Häkkinen, Pedro Diniz, Frentzen and Alesi followed in the top ten.|$|E
25|$|At Shanghai, he outpaced Button in qualifying, but {{struggled}} with his car's brakes {{when one of}} them stopped working in the first stint and finished in fourth, recording the race's fastest lap. In Bahrain, his front wing adjustor failed during his qualifying run thereby compromising his aggressive 3 pit-stop race strategy, and thus managed only fifth place. He qualified third on the grid for the , but overtook Button and second place man Vettel on the first straight, to lead the race in the first corner. He was unable to capitalise on his three stop strategy {{as a result of a}} lack of pace caused by massive amounts of understeer on his third <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> in his third stint, finishing behind Button, who changed to a 2 stop strategy during the race.|$|E
25|$|At the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, Mexico, Gerhard Berger made {{a return}} despite {{continued}} {{pain in his}} fingers. However, transmission and gearbox problems forced the Ferraris to retire from point-scoring positions for the third race straight. While they lamented their results, McLaren and Senna took a third win on the trot by a differing choice of tyres. Prost's choice, and the wrong <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> being given to him at a pit stop (which prompted team boss Ron Dennis to issue Prost a public apology after the race), sent him down the order to fifth. Patrese was second for Williams, while Alboreto doubled his efforts in Monaco by scoring third. Gabriele Tarquini {{was able to bring}} his barely pre-qualified AGS home in sixth for a well-celebrated point.|$|E
5|$|In {{a further}} change <b>of</b> regulations, <b>tyre</b> {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three instead <b>of</b> two <b>tyre</b> compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, {{these were the}} super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for the third part of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> out <b>of</b> the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional <b>set</b> <b>of</b> mediums instead <b>of</b> soft <b>tyres.</b> The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four <b>sets</b> each <b>of</b> the medium and soft compounds.|$|R
50|$|Z Tyre {{designed}} a special <b>set</b> <b>of</b> Z1 <b>tyres</b> to be unveiled at Reifen Essen 2016, {{and entered the}} Guinness Book of World Records for producing the world’s most expensive <b>set</b> <b>of</b> car <b>tyres,</b> valued at $600,000. The record was announced by Guinness Book of World Records adjudicator, Sophia Greenacre.|$|R
50|$|Stewards fined McLaren, Honda and Super Aguri €15,000 {{each for}} tyre rule infringement. Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Takuma Sato used two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> wet <b>tyres,</b> {{more than the}} one set {{permitted}} during the first practice. In addition, each driver had to surrender one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> wet <b>tyres</b> to avoid gaining any advantage.|$|R
25|$|The battles {{continued}} to rage behind the leading trio, as Grosjean started to attack 4th placed Webber. The Red Bull driver {{decided to make}} a second pitstop for new tyres and rejoined in 8th place, behind Rosberg and Pérez, but ahead of Räikkönen. Felipe Massa, who was unable to regain the places he lost due to his spin, was now back up to 5th place as he too attempted a one-stopper. That did not work out however, and Rosberg had closed right up to him by lap 55, and brought Pérez, Webber and Räikkönen along. Rosberg attacked Massa on the DRS zone, but overshot the last chicane and had to give the position back. Pérez took advantage of this and was right behind Massa, which meant that he too was able to get the jump on Rosberg when he handed the place back to Massa. He then passed Massa on the same lap, with Rosberg also going through, this time doing the job cleanly. The Brazilian had enough, and pitted for a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> and rejoined in 10th place, where he stayed till the end.|$|E
25|$|Friday evening's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. In contrast to previous years, qualifying was held in night time conditions, the first such occurrence in the GP2 Series. The track was less dusty {{than it had been}} in practice, and multiple drivers stood in pole position throughout the duration of the half hour session. Palmer clinched his first pole position of the season and the second of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 38.865 seconds. He flat spotted his first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> and was aware with the second set equipped he would challenge for the pole position. Palmer was joined on the grid's front row by Vandoorne who recorded a lap three-hundredths of second slower than his rival. Vandoorne was temporarily investigated by the stewards for exceeding track limits at turn thirteen, but no action was prompted. Abt took third having been unable to improve on his lap time. Richelmi improved towards the end of the session and secured fourth. Haryanto took fifth ahead of sixth-placed Stefano Coletti. Early pace setter Evans fell once the field bettered their times and managed seventh.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the supply}} of spare parts had been assured by mid-season, the B186s were {{modified}} to incorporate a whole array of new aerodynamic features (including front and rear wings and a revised underbody), new suspension packages and revised setup concepts. The chassis was also strengthened further {{to cope with the}} stress caused by the power of the BMW engine. The development package was completed by the arrival of a new rear wing design for the Austrian Grand Prix, where the improved performance of the B186 and the high-speed Österreichring circuit made it the fastest car in the field with Fabi (pole) and Berger occupying the front row of the grid. The car's competitiveness improved throughout the season, particularly during the second half, {{as a result of this}} development. In addition, it also became more reliable, although this aspect remained suspect throughout the year with a total of nineteen retirements from 32 starts. The competitiveness of the Pirelli tyres also improved, and their relative durability compared to the Goodyears often played to the B186's advantage, exemplified by the fact that Berger won the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix due to not having to make a pit stop for a fresh <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> while most of the main contenders (with the exception of Prost's McLaren which finished 2nd) made at least two stops for tyres due to the abrasive surface of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{a motorcycle}} {{on the road}} is largely governed by tyre properties. This paper presents experimental and numerical analyses dealing with the influence <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> properties on the stability of weave and wobble in straight running. The final goal is to find optimal <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> properties that improve the stability of a motorcycle. The investigation is based on road tests carried out on a sporttouring motorcycle equipped with sensors. Three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> are tested at different speeds {{in the presence of}} weave and wobble. The analysis of telemetry data highlights significant differences in the trends of frequency and damping of weave and wobble against speed. The experimental analysis is integrated by a parametric numerical analysis. Tyre properties are varied according to the design of experiments method, in order to highlight the single effects on stability of lateral and cornering coefficient of front and rear tyres...|$|R
50|$|In 2016 {{new tyre}} rules were introduced. Pirelli will {{nominate}} 3 different compounds <b>of</b> slick <b>tyres</b> {{to bring to}} each race. Each team will have 13 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>tyres</b> for the race weekend. <b>Of</b> the 13 <b>sets,</b> two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> are chosen by Pirelli to be reserved of the race. Additionally, one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> the softest compound will be set aside for Q3. Teams are free to choose what they like for their 10 remaining sets from the three chosen compounds. Each driver must use at least two different dry weather compounds during the race (including one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> the mandatory race tyres), and drivers who make it to Q3 must start the race with the tyres they set their fastest Q2 lap on. Teams must inform the FIA eight weeks {{before the start of}} a European event and 14 weeks before a non-European race their tyre choices.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> slick <b>tyres</b> {{may be used}} per car and weekend. The number <b>of</b> wet <b>tyres</b> is unlimited. The tyres are {{identical}} for all competitors and {{are not permitted to}} be pre-warmed or chemically treated.|$|R

Three weeks later, Räikkönen finished third at the , after having qualified in fifth place, which had been promoted to fourth {{as a result of a}} penalty given to Lewis Hamilton. In Monaco Räikkönen qualified in 8th but finished one place lower in 9th place. For the 2012 Canadian Grand Prix Räikkönen again had a bad qualifying session finishing 12th. He was able to finish 8th in the race taking, as he stated, [...] "important championship points". In the [...] at the Valencia Street Circuit he finished second behind Fernando Alonso. In the 2012 British Grand Prix he finished fifth, after having qualified in sixth place. During qualifying for the , Räikkönen had good pace in Q1 with the harder <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> and was looking good for a potential shot at a higher grid place. At the start of Q2 the rain was already heavy meaning that Räikkönen lost the advantage he had in dry conditions. In the wet Q3 session he qualified in 10th place. Good pace in dry conditions from the qualifying session was proven in the race as Räikkönen succeeded to finish 4th, and eventually gaining the last podium spot after Sebastian Vettel was penalised for an illegal overtaking manoeuvre. For the [...] Räikkönen qualified 5th. He lost fifth place at the start to Fernando Alonso due to a KERS issue on his E20 car. He succeeded in gaining a position over Alonso during the first round of pit-stops, and later did the same to Button and Vettel during the second round. He finished the race in 2nd place, just one second behind the race winner Lewis Hamilton.|$|E
