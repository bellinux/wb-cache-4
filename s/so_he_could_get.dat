5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down {{to the size of}} a flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back to his place of origin.|$|E
25|$|South African born artist Kendell Geers rose to {{international}} notoriety in 1993 when, at {{a show in}} Venice, he urinated into Fountain. Artist / musician Brian Eno declared successfully urinating in Fountain while exhibited in the MoMA in 1993. He admitted {{that it was only}} a technical triumph because he needed to urinate in a tube in advance <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the fluid through a gap between the protective glass. Swedish artist Björn Kjelltoft urinated in Fountain at Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1999.|$|E

25|$|On June 7, 2012, 16-year-old Yasser Lopez made {{national}} news when he successfully underwent a delicate 3-hour neurosurgical operation {{to remove a}} spear that a speargun had fired into his skull when it was accidentally discharged during a fishing trip; 3 feet of the spear protruded from the wound above his eye socket, and that part had to be specially cut off <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a brain CT scan. Miraculously, no major blood vessels were harmed and the only impairments thus far are amnesia for the period during and around the event, which is somewhat normal, and some sluggishness in a hand.|$|E
25|$|Pickett {{crossed the}} ford just {{as some of}} Munford's cavalrymen were falling back with Kellogg's brigade {{pressing}} them closely. Pickett appealed to his cavalrymen {{to hold back the}} Union attackers long enough <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to the front. A small group of the Confederate cavalrymen, led by Captain James Breckinridge who was killed, charged the advancing Union soldiers, giving Pickett enough time to pass using the horse's head and neck as a shield. Getting to the ford a little later than Pickett, Fitzhugh Lee was unable to cross as Kellogg's men had occupied Ford's Road by that time. Lee then tried to attack the roadblock with Rosser's reserve division but they failed to breach the Union line. So Lee deployed the division north of Hatcher's Run {{in an effort to keep}} the Union force from using Ford's Road to reach the South Side Railroad.|$|E
25|$|The {{media was}} quick to criticise Marsh’s glovework in his early career, dubbing him “Iron Gloves” after he missed a number of catches. Even on his debut in the First Test in the 1970–71 Ashes series he took four catches in his first innings. His batting proved {{invaluable}} {{on a number of}} occasions and in the Fifth Test, he equalled the record for the highest Test innings by an Australian keeper, set by Don Tallon. The end of the innings was controversial; the captain Bill Lawry declared with Marsh eight runs short of a century <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> an extra hour of bowling before stumps. When questioned by the press about his lost chance to make an historic century Marsh said he had gained forty runs instead of missing eight as he thought Lawry should have declared an hour earlier. Marsh later admitted that he was underprepared as a wicketkeeper, but he learned from watching his English counterpart Alan Knott. He and Knott did, however, concede the same number of byes in the series: 44.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a favorable position." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Theatricality", Burt invites Carole and Finn {{to move in}} with him and Kurt. Aware of Kurt's {{attraction}} to him, Finn is uncomfortable with sharing a bedroom with Kurt. In the hopes of pleasing Finn, Kurt redecorates their bedroom, but Finn is appalled by its fancy appearance and lack of privacy. During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings [...] "faggy". Burt overhears Finn's homophobic words, delivers a stinging reprimand, and throws him out, even though doing so risks costing Burt his relationship with Carole. However, later on Burt is also disappointed with Kurt when he finds out from Carole that Kurt's ulterior motive for setting them up was <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> closer to Finn, and that while he accepts him for being gay, he does not accept him pursuing a straight boy who he knows does not feel the same way.|$|E
500|$|Ross also {{excelled in}} baseball, football, {{lacrosse}} and motorcycle racing. Before {{he became a}} hockey executive, he had {{a career as a}} bank clerk and ran a sporting-goods store in Montreal. Ross had moved to Brandon, Manitoba, in 1905 at the advice of his parents <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a job with a bank, with a salary of $600 per year. He gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally. He was married to Muriel, a native of Montreal, and had two sons, Art and John. During the Second World War, both sons served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the war Ross made his son Art the business manager for the Bruins. Ross was named coach and manager of the Boston Bruins in 1924 and moved his family to Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, after being hired. In 1928, he served as the traveling secretary of the Boston Braves baseball team, which was owned by Bruins owner Charles Adams. [...] He became a naturalized American citizen on April 22, 1938. On August 5, 1964, Ross died at a nursing home in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, at the age of 79. A sister, both his sons, and three grandchildren survived him.|$|E

60|$|Filled with nameless dread, Kurt rushed out. He {{saw nothing}} unusual, heard nothing. Rapidly {{he walked out}} through the yard, and {{suddenly}} he saw a glow in the sky above the barns.

According to Rimmer, games were not competitive there, and everyone won a [...] "you're really special" [...] trophy on sports day. He said that his sex life had been a [...] "shambles" [...] ever since one of Rimmer's brothers told him sex advice at school {{that the most important}} thing was the clitoris; Rimmer misheard it as [...] "to spit on her wrist".|$|E
2500|$|An {{article in}} The Guardian, on 22 December 2015, {{outlined}} {{a collection of}} what it described as [...] "outrageous claims" [...] against Abdullah Kurdi. It was {{said that he was}} an opportunist who used his status as a Syrian refugee for personal gain. Another source said that Abdullah was profiting from the tragedy, including selling his dead son’s clothes to a museum in Paris. Australian politician Cory Bernardi claimed that “The father sent them on that boat <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> dental treatment”. Some anti-immigration politicians claimed that the image of Alan on the beach had been faked.|$|E
2500|$|The {{same day}} Rhys-Davids was {{selected}} by Hugh Trenchard and Maurice Baring to have his portrait sketched by artist William Orpen.

5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|R
50|$|Joe Spinell, {{who played}} Willi Cicci in The Godfather and Stallone's boss in Rocky, is {{featured}} as Nicky, a hired thug for Frances Amthor.

2500|$|During {{a game in}} 1982, Frank Layden, {{then head}} coach of the Utah Jazz, had seen enough of his team's poor {{performance}} and wanted an early exit. Layden verbally abused Strom <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> ejected from the game. Strom knew {{what he was trying to}} do, and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, [...] "I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay out here and watch this shit, so do you". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, [...] "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring to the fact that the Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1. Strom stared back at Auerbach and said, [...] "Arnold, you're showing all the class I knew you always had." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1992, Ferguson {{was awarded}} $26,250 for his workers' {{compensation}} claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, Ferguson insisted {{he was still}} in pain and demanded the case be reopened <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, he visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation. Lauren Abramson, an attorney with the firm, said she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by Ferguson. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because [...] "I {{did not want to be}} alone with him", something Abramson said she had never done before. Although Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, Ferguson made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre that occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed Ferguson on a list of potentially dangerous people security guards were to watch out for.|$|E
2500|$|During 1980, Orndorff {{started to}} split {{his time between}} the Alabama and the Mid-South territories, until he left the Alabama {{territory}} {{by the end of}} 1980 to focus entirely on the Mid-South territory. In Mid-South, Orndorff feuded with Ken Mantell over Mantell's propensity for cutting people's hair after a match. Orndorff got the better of Mantell and won the rights to use the Freebird hair removal cream on Mantell. Orndorff earned a shot at the North American champion The Grappler but {{on the day of the}} match he overslept (storyline) and was incensed when his replacement Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts beat the Grappler for the title. Orndorff's reaction to Jake's title win signaled a change in attitude; he turned heel as he demanded a title match against Jake [...] "the Snake". While he lost the support of the fans, he won the North American title on July 4, 1981. Orndorff feuded with Ted DiBiase, JYD, Dusty Rhodes, and Dick Murdoch while holding on to the North American title. Orndorff lost the title to Ted DiBiase on November 1, 1981 in a match at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans, Louisiana. Orndorff was unable to wrestle in the rematch due to car trouble, which meant that Orndorff's friend Bob Roop got the title shot and won the match. It was soon revealed that Roop had sabotaged Orndorff's car <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the title shot instead (storyline). Orndorff turned face to feud with Roop but found himself unable to regain the title after which he left the Mid-South Territory.|$|E

5000|$|Eight months afterwards, Pastis gleefully {{quit his}} law practice. Pastis {{attributes}} his {{dissatisfaction with the}} law in being helpful insofar that [...] "humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness", and that wanting {{to get out of}} his job provided him with the impetus to create better comic strips <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> selected for syndication.|$|R
