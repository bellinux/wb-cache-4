The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he <b>saw</b> <b>U.S.</b> soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E

5|$|When the Arroyo Seco Parkway opened, it was {{the first}} freeway in the Western United States. It became a new {{alignment}} of U.S. Route 66, and the old routing via Figueroa Street and Colorado Boulevard became U.S. Route 66 Alternate. The southern extension over the Los Angeles River to downtown Los Angeles also carried State Route 11 (which remained on the old route when US 66 was moved) and U.S. Routes 6 and 99 (which followed Avenue 26 and San Fernando Road to the northwest). The 1964 renumbering <b>saw</b> <b>US</b> 66 truncated to Pasadena, and SR 11 was moved from Figueroa Street (which became SR 159) to the Pasadena Freeway. Finally, the number was changed to SR 110 in 1981, when SR 11 between San Pedro and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) became I-110.|$|E

Twagiramungu rejected {{the result of the}} election and also questioned the margin of victory, saying [...] "Almost 100 per cent? That's not possible". Twagiramungu filed a petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the result, but was unsuccessful. The EU observer also questioned the result, citing [...] "numerous irregularities", but praised the election overall, describing it as a [...] "positive step". Kagame himself, in an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, acknowledged that the opposition had been weak, but he believed the result was genuine. He told Kinzer [...] "they wanted security first of all. Even people who didn't know the RPF program in detail <b>saw</b> <b>us</b> as the party that would guarantee that". Kagame was sworn in on 12 September to begin his seven-year term.|$|E
500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people <b>saw</b> <b>us</b> as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A lot of it was just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd be on the road {{for a long time and}} we had no life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] I think everybody was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E

2500|$|Although Bill and I {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a guy from the [...] "Today Show" [...] <b>saw</b> <b>us</b> and asked if we wanted to be on the [...] "Today" [...] show.

Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, {{they decided}} to take the idea to the Walt Disney Studios, which was {{interested}} in producing more daring productions at the time. However, Disney executives were uncertain about giving $10–12 million to a first-time producer and director using techniques which, in most cases, had never been attempted. The studio agreed to finance a test reel which involved a flying disc champion throwing a rough prototype of the discs used in the film. It was a chance to mix live-action footage with back-lit animation and computer-generated visuals. It impressed the executives at Disney and they agreed to back the film. The script was subsequently re-written and re-storyboarded with the studio's input. At the time, Disney rarely hired outsiders to make films for them and Kushner found that he and his group were given a less than warm welcome because they [...] "tackled the nerve center– the animation department. They <b>saw</b> <b>us</b> as the germ from outside. We tried to enlist several Disney animators but none came. Disney is a closed group." ...|$|E
