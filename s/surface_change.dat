40|$|The {{developing}} face is {{of interest}} to orthodontists, especially if orthodontic treatment can influence the outcome of facial growth. New 3 -dimensional (3 D) modalities have enabled clinicians {{to better understand the}} facial changes in a developing child. Methods: Fifty-nine children with normal body mass indexes were evaluated with a previously validated 3 D laser imaging device over a 2 -year period. <b>Surface</b> <b>changes</b> were evaluated on normal and average faces. These changes were seen as mean <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> and color maps. Results: The results suggest that the <b>surface</b> areas of <b>change</b> in average faces were generally downward and forward with respect to the nose and soft-tissue nasion. The lips also translated in a downward direction as the nose grew, and there was a general increase in the vertical dimension. Some subjects were in the "great changes" category, boys significantly more so than girls. Conclusions: The following conclusions can be made from this 3 D study of changes of facial morphology in children: (1) <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> are greater in boys than in girls; (2) differences in the timing of <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> in boys and girls are clinically significant, with boys exhibiting more changes later; (3) positive <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> occur in the nose, brows, lips, and vertical dimensions of the face; (4) the eyes deepen, and the cheeks become flatter; and (5) 3 D imaging is a useful tool in analyzing changes to the face over time.

2500|$|Because the {{gravitational}} field {{created by the}} Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force {{on the side of}} the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to [...] "stretch" [...] the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. [...] As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's <b>surface</b> <b>change</b> constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to [...] "catch up" [...] to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.|$|E
2500|$|Frozen ground (permafrost and {{seasonally}} frozen ground) occupies approximately 54 million km2 of {{the exposed}} land {{areas of the}} Northern Hemisphere (Zhang et al., 2003) and therefore has the largest areal extent of any component of the cryosphere. Permafrost (perennially frozen ground) may occur where mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) are less than -1 or -2nbsp&°C and is generally continuous where MAAT are less than -7nbsp&°C. In addition, its extent and thickness are affected by ground moisture content, vegetation cover, winter snow depth, and aspect. The global extent of permafrost is still not completely known, but it underlies approximately 20% of Northern Hemisphere land areas. Thicknesses exceed 600 m along the Arctic coast of northeastern Siberia and Alaska, but, toward the margins, permafrost becomes thinner and horizontally discontinuous. The marginal zones will be more immediately subject to any melting caused by a warming trend. Most of the presently existing permafrost formed during previous colder conditions and is therefore relic. However, permafrost may form under present-day polar climates where glaciers retreat or land emergence exposes unfrozen ground. Washburn (1973) concluded that most continuous permafrost is in balance with the present climate at its upper surface, but changes at the base depend on the present climate and geothermal heat flow; in contrast, most discontinuous permafrost is probably unstable or [...] "in such delicate equilibrium that the slightest climatic or <b>surface</b> <b>change</b> will have drastic disequilibrium effects".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Studies of {{the effects}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2) lasers on dental enamel have {{demonstrated}} that <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> can be produced at low fluences (< 10 J/cm 2) if wavelengths are used which are efficiently absorbed by the hard tissues. In this study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the wavelength dependence of <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> in dental enamel after exposure to an extensive range of CO 2 laser conditions. Bovine and human enamel were irradiated by a tunable, pulsed CO 2 laser (9. 3, 9. 6, 10. 3, 10. 6 pm), with 5, 25, or 100 pulses, at absorbed fluences of 2, 5, 10, or 20 J/cm 2, and pulse widths of 50, 100, 200, 500 ps. SEM micrographs revealed evidence of melting, crystal fusion, and exfoliation in a wavelength-dependent manner. Crystal fusion occurred at absorbed fluences as low as 5 J/cm 2 per pulse at 9. 3, 9. 6, and 10. 3 pm, in contrast to no crystal fusion at 10. 6 pm (< 20 J/cm 2). Longer pulses at constant fluence conditions decreased the extent of surface melting and crystal fusion. The total number of laser pulses delivered to the tissue did not significantly affect <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> as long as a minimum of 5 to 10 pulses was used. Within the four easily accessible wavelengths of the CO 2 laser, there are dramatic differences in the observed <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> of dental hard tissue...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{technologies}} have seen extraordinary improvements in both spatial resolution and accuracy recently. In particular, airborne laser scanning systems can now provide data for surface modeling with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, which can effectively support {{the detection of}} sub-meter surface features, vital for landslide mapping. Also, the easy repeatability of data acquisition offers the opportunity to monitor temporal <b>surface</b> <b>changes,</b> which are essential to identifying developing or active slides. Specific methods are needed to detect and map <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> due to landslide activities. In this paper, we present a methodology {{that is based on}} fusing probabilistic change detection and landslide surface feature extraction utilizing multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to map <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> demonstrating landslide activity. The proposed method was tested in an area with numerous slides ranging from 200 m 2 to 27, 000 m 2 in area under low vegetation and tree cover, Zanesville, Ohio, USA. The <b>surface</b> <b>changes</b> observed are probabilistically evaluated to determine the likelihood of the changes being landslide activity related. Next, based on surface features, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) quantifies and maps the topographic signatures of landslides in the entire area. Finally, these two processes are fused to detect landslide prone changes. The results demonstrate that 53 out of 80 inventory mapped landslides were identified using this method. Additionally, some areas that were not mapped in the inventory map displayed changes that are likely to be developing landslides...|$|R
