5|$|Further {{complicating the}} sales {{situation}} was the announcement by JaguarSport of a road-going {{version of the}} Jaguar XJR-9, {{the last of the}} racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine. The Jaguar XJR-15 was developed by TWR and <b>styled</b> <b>by</b> Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar, and featured the V12 engine {{and a host of other}} technologies not adopted for the XJ220, including carbon fibre construction and the option of a six-speed racing gearbox. It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale; only 50 were built, each with a list price of £600,000 ($1 million) in 1990. It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road-legal vehicle. About half were built as road-going variants, which added £55,000 to the list price.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} filmed over a seven-week period at the couple's home in Malibu and nearby locations. Production began in August 2011, with an {{original}} release date scheduled for January 2012.

The series also featured Doherty's friends, Roxana Zal, Tim Bitici, and Roger Castillo, and her mother, Rosa. According to Doherty, her mother was well-received by fans on Twitter. Doherty explained that viewers liked that her mother appeared more naturally rather than being <b>styled</b> <b>by</b> the show's crew.|$|E

25|$|American Motors {{followed}} this designer influence in successive {{years with the}} Cardin Javelin in 1973 and the Cassini Matador in 1974, {{but there were no}} new signature designer versions after those.

25|$|The Countach was <b>styled</b> <b>by</b> Marcello Gandini of the Bertone design studio, {{the same}} {{designer}} and studio that designed the Miura.

Gandini again produced another striking design. The Countach shape was wide and low (74.28 inches in width and 42.05 inches in height), but not very long (162.7 in length).
