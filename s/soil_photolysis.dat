40|$|This {{research}} centers on modeling fate and transport processes affecting pesticides applied to turfgrass systems. Interest in predicting pesticide fate and transport from these systems stems from observations of pesticide residues in urban surface and groundwaters, {{and the need}} for information with which to assess human health and ecological risks of using these pesticides, total maximum daily load and other water quality management studies. The main processes that affect pesticide fate and transport in turf systems are reviewed, and general magnitudes of each process are reported. Dissipation rates for turf systems are compared to half-life values for aerobic decay in <b>soil,</b> <b>photolysis</b> and field dissipation. From this analysis, microbial decay appears to be a major factor in pesticide dissipation. Decay rates specific for turf are developed based on dissipation rates from these systems. The hypothesis that the use of soil-based decay rates leads to overestimation of pesticide runoff, volatilization and leaching losses from turfgrass systems is tested by means of long term simulations involving diverse turf, climatic and management conditions.

40|$|The Environmental Fate and Effects Division has {{revised the}} Environmental Fate and Ecological Risk Assessment chapter {{in support of}} the reregistration {{eligibility}} decision on carbaryl. The chapter has been revised to incorporate recently received fate and effects data and to reflect comments received during the public comment phase of the review process. The revised chapter is attached and contains more detailed information on drinking water monitoring studies and specialized uses of carbaryl, i. e., Section 24 c use of carbaryl to control burrowing shrimp and the use of carbaryl for the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s grasshopper and Mormon cricket suppression program. In general, carbaryl is not likely to persist in the environmental; however owing to its mobility and it extensive use, the chemical is frequently detected in surface water and to a much lesser extent in groundwater. Urban use of carbaryl appears to serve as a primary source of carbaryl residues in surface water. Carbaryl’s primary degradate, 1 -naphthol, is expected to degrade more rapidly and be less mobile than the parent. Since 1 -naphthol has many natural and anthropogenic sources other than carbaryl degradation, the presence of this compound cannot be used as a measure of carbaryl use. Furthermore, the Agency does not have <b>soil</b> <b>photolysis</b> (Guideline § 161 - 3) data an...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{developed}} a methodology to perform laboratory studies that approach field conditions. To demonstrate our methods, {{we used the}} herbicide mesotrione. Simulated solar light irradiation experiments were conducted on several cuticular wax films. Adjuvants greatly favoured the rate of mesotrione photolysis. Specifically, the photolytic transformation of formulated mesotrione was 15 times faster than that of pure mesotrione. The morphology and composition of the wax films had a greater effect on the photolysis of formulated mesotrione than of pure mesotrione, which formed aggregates on the waxes. This shows the importance of considering the formulation when studying pesticide photolysis on crops. To corroborate our model, we conducted experiments on detached leaves. The rates of photolysis on leaves and on wax films were of the same order of magnitude. Finally, the mesotrione rate of photolysis on leaves is much higher compared with data from the literature in water and on <b>soils.</b> <b>Photolysis</b> {{is likely to be}} a fast dissipation process on crops. The photodegradation of pesticide on crops should be systematically evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Acephate is hydrolyzed to the degradates DMPT and RE 17, 245. Acephate {{does not}} undergo <b>photolysis.</b> <b>Soil</b> {{microorganisms}} rapidly degrade acephate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The products {{of this are}} RE 18, 420, methamidophos, and DMPT. Acephate’s metabolites are very weakly adsorbed to the soil. They will be readily leached but will be quickly degraded in the soil. Acephate will not volatilize in any significant quantity to cause air contamination. Plants readily degrade acephate to methamidophos and DMPT.

5000|$|Dimethenamid is {{a widely}} used herbicide. In 2001, about 7 million pounds of dimethenamid {{were used in the}} United States. [...] Dimethenamid is {{registered}} for control of annual grasses, certain annual broadleaf weeds and sedges in field corn, seed corn, popcorn and soybeans. Supplemental labeling also allows use on sweet corn,grain sorghum, dry beans and peanuts. In registering dimethinamide (SAN 582H/Frontier), EPA concluded that the primary means of dissipation of dimethenamid applied to the <b>soil</b> surface is <b>photolysis,</b> whereas below the surface loss was due largely to microbial metabolism. The herbicide was found to undergo anaerobic microbial degradation under denitrifying, iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, or methanogenic conditions. [...] In that study, {{more than half of the}} herbicide carbon (based on 14C-labeling) added was found to be incorporated irreversibly into soil-bound residue.|$|R

The hypothesis that the use of soil-based decay rates leads to overestimation of pesticide runoff, volatilization and leaching losses from turfgrass systems is tested by means of long term simulations involving diverse turf, climatic and management conditions. Results indicate significant differences in estimations based on soil and turf decay rates as a result of differences in estimating the pesticide?s persistence in the turf foliage and thatch. However, care should be taken when modeling pesticides that are weakly sorbed to organic matter. The research also includes the development of a volatilization model that is based on splitting pesticides into surface and retained deposits and allowing volatilization to occur from the surface deposits only. This model replicated daily volatilization fluxes better than models previously developed for turf, and was incorporated into the Turf Pesticide Model (TPM), which was designed to predict pesticide runoff, leaching, volatilization and decay on a daily basis using relatively few input parameters. Uncalibrated tests of TPM against data from diverse field studies indicated that the model explained 75 % of the observed variation in drainage, 63 % for pesticide leaching, 65 % for runoff volumes, 64 % for pesticide loss in runoff, and 62 % for pesticide volatilization. TPM can provide information for risk, TMDL, environmental and water quality studies centered on evaluating the impacts of pesticides applied to turf...|$|E
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach involving chemistry, microbiology, ecotoxicology and environmental engineering was {{undertaken by the}} Defence Research Establishment of the Department of National Defence (DREV/DND) and the Biotechnology Research Institute of the National Research Council of Canada (BRI/NRC) to characterize and to optimize the biodegradation potential of TNT and RDX in pure form and in soil. The nature and level of contamination by RDX and TNT in various soils were determined in an interlaboratory study involving both organizations using EPA Method # 8330. Microorganisms were isolated from the native soils and found {{to be capable of}} mineralizing (92 ̆ 074 CO 2 ̆ 082 liberation) RDX under aerobic conditions when the latter was used as sole nitrogen source. RDX disappearance was accompanied by the elimination of toxicity associated with RDX, as determined by the Microtox test. Studies are underway to use the isolated indigenous strain as a bioaugmentation agent for future site application. Thus far TNT showed more toxic effects than RDX and metabolic analysis showed that TNT was biotransformed into the more toxic amine metabolites. In soil these amine metabolites react with humic acids to give recalcitrant and intractable products. To eliminate problems associated with TNT mineralization in soil we thus undertook a study to first wash TNT out of the soil using several water additives and then treat the TNT washings. Preliminary data showed that mineralization of TNT using sewage sludge under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was enhanced in the presence of cyclodextrins. Further enhancement in the mineralization rate of TNT was obtained after subjecting the <b>soil</b> extract to <b>photolysis.</b> In an integral study, soil heavily contaminated with RDX (2000 ppm) and TNT (1000 ppm) was treated in bioslurry reactors supplemented with sewage sludge under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The biological performance of these reactors was monitored using microcosms spiked with 92 ̆ 074 C-labelled TNT or RDX. Preliminary data showed that RDX was almost completely mineralized. TNT rapidly disappeared (biotransformation to amino derivatives) with little mineralization. The data obtained from the present aerobic, soil washing and bioslurry reactors studies will be used for the development of practical soil remediation technologies.
