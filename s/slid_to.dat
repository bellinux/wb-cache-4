5|$|Nevada {{posted a}} final record of 7–6. The game {{was the third}} {{consecutive}} postseason loss for Chris Ault and Nevada. Ault's post-season bowl record <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> 1–5as a result.|$|E
5|$|In week 12 of the 2008 season, Maryland {{possessed a}} 7–3 record and stood atop the ACC Atlantic Division. However, the Terps lost their final two regular season games and <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> a four-way tie for {{third place in}} the division. Earlier in the season, Maryland {{defeated}} four ranked opponents, a feat surpassed only by the two teams that played in the BCS National Championship Game, Florida and Oklahoma—and those each played an extra game with their conference championships. Maryland spent three weeks ranked in the top-25 of the Associated Press Poll.|$|E
5|$|Dangerously in Love debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with sales of 317,000 copies {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan. In its second week the album <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> number two with 183,000 sold, behind Ashanti's Chapter II. Although the album's first-week sales failed to match that of Survivor, which sold 663,000 units in its debut in 2001, Beyoncé earned the highest among Destiny's Child members' solo albums by best weeks: Rowland sold 77,000 copies for Simply Deep while Williams earned 17,000 copies for Heart to Yours in its strongest week. The album has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Dangerously in Love remains Beyoncé's best-selling album to date, with cumulative sales of five million copies in the United States as of June 2016.|$|E

5|$|Gailey's most {{successful}} year at Georgia Tech was in 2006 with nine victories and the ACC Coastal Division championship. The Yellow Jackets football team reached its first New Year's Bowl since the 1999 Gator Bowl {{and played the}} West Virginia Mountaineers in the Gator Bowl. Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards and Calvin Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage. After an impressive 33-3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season, the team <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> finish 7-6. On the morning of Monday, November 26, 2007, Gailey was fired from the Yellow Jackets, two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 and in 1913 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{toured the}} West Indies, with four matches played in total between the MCC and Trinidad at the Queen's Park Oval across both tours. Then, on 20 February 1913, the MCC played a {{combined}} West Indies cricket team, who was playing {{one of its}} earliest matches as a representative eleven, and only its fourth against an MCC side. Harry Ince scored 167 in the West Indian first innings, Richard Ollivierre took a five-wicket haul and Joseph Rogers took a six-for as the MCC <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> a heavy defeat. The match was the first between the West Indies and the MCC {{to have taken place}} at the Queen's Park Oval. Though cricket was largely interrupted by World War I, normal practice resumed with the ground hosting the Inter-Colonial Tournament finals in 1921, 1925 and 1929.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> 70 for 5 and seemed certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an {{improbable}} draw.|$|E

5|$|In {{its second}} {{week on the}} Billboard 200, Graduation <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> number two {{with the release of}} Reba McEntire's , selling 226,000 copies while {{maintaining}} its dominance over Curtis, which sold 143,000. The next week, with the releases of over 40 new albums, Graduation dropped three spaces to number five and registered 133,300, reaching a cumulative total of 1.3 million copies by October 3. Selling 92,400 copies, the album descended two spots the following week to reach number seven. During its fourth week on the chart, Graduation experienced a slight rebound and rose from number seven to six on October 17, selling 71,000 copies. The following week, the album began to descend once more, selling an estimated 54,000 copies and dropping three places to reach the ninth position on October 24. By year's end, Graduation was the third most-downloaded and best-selling album of 2007 on iTunes Store. Graduation became West's third consecutive studio album to sell over two million copies in the United States, and it was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 18, 2007. As of June 14, 2013, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Graduation has since grossed over 2,700,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Lambert was {{replaced}} by Birmingham City's manager Chris Hughton. With Norwich one place above the relegation zone and five matches remaining in the 2013–14 season, Hughton was sacked, and replaced by youth coach and former Norwich player Neil Adams. However, they could not avoid the drop to the Championship. Under Adams, Norwich began the 2014–15 season in the Championship with good form and were second in the table in September, but performances became mixed, the club <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> seventh place and a 2–0 defeat in the 2014–15 FA Cup by Preston North End F.C. (then in League One) led to Adams' resignation. He {{was replaced}} by Hamilton Academical coach Alex Neil. A revitalised and disciplined Canaries side achieved 17 victories in the remaining 25 games, qualifying {{for the end of}} season Football League playoffs. Neil's side secured victory over local rivals Ipswich Town, before defeating Middlesbrough in the final at Wembley Stadium, to return to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E

5|$|Benfica opened November with a UEFA Cup match away against German side VfB Stuttgart. They conceded {{the first}} goal by Cacau {{in the first}} half and let in two more—both headers—in the second. Trapattoni attributted the defeat to the {{superior}} physical ability of the Germans. On 7 November, Benfica hosted Vitória de Setúbal and defeated them 4–0, retaining first place in the league. Six days later, Benfica dropped two points after a 1–0 loss at the Estádio dos Barreiros to Marítimo. On 21 November, Benfica hosted Rio Ave and had a chance to regain the top spot. After building a 3–1 lead at half-time, Benfica allowed the visitors to equalize the game, costing them two more points. Trapattoni criticized his team for the way it conceded the 3–3 draw after a free-kick for Benfica turned into a deadly counter-attack against them. On the following Thursday, Benfica received Dinamo Zagreb for the UEFA Cup. Two first-half goals secured the second win in the group stage for Benfica. On the last match of November, Benfica visited the Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa, home of União de Leiria, where they conceded a goal in a counter-attack and were unable to equalize in over 70 minutes, losing the match. The loss was their first as visitors; the club <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> fourth place, having lost 12 points since the Clássico. Trapattoni said Benfica lacked composure in the conceded goal, a problem he had previously addressed but still occurred. He remained confident because the league was long and very balanced.|$|E
25|$|On 17 January 2008, a British Airways Boeing 777-236ER, G-YMMM, {{operating}} flight BA038 from Beijing, crash-landed at Heathrow.

The wrecked aircraft was initially stored but was later declared as damaged beyond economic repair and was subsequently scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Argentina {{surprisingly}} reduced Zimbabwe to 98/5, {{but then}} a stand of 174 between Rawson (125) and Gary Wallace (77) saw the Africans through to a daunting 357/7. Argentina were never likely to threaten such a target, and so it proved as they were bowled out for 150 to lose by a massive 207 runs. In the other Group A game, Jahangir Shah took 4-37 for Bangladesh but could not stop Malaysia making 239 (Asgari Stevens 68, Yazid Imran 64); DP John took 5-40 as the Bangladeshis <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> a 57-run defeat despite Rafiqul Alam's 51.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{followed}} their upset in Naples with {{a game at}} home to Serie A new boys Atalanta. Ex-Atalanta hitman Sergio Floccari, who was impressive against Napoli, left {{the field in the}} 8th minute, but Parma still had the better of the first-half chances. However, it was Atalanta that broke the deadlock, taking advantage of some dozy Parma defending that left Maximiliano Moralez free at the back post with what was almost an open goal in the 55th minute. Just three minutes later, Moralez scored a second, squeezing a loose ball into the goal at Antonio Mirante's near post. Jaime Valdés – making his 300th appearance in Italian league football – then reduced the arrears with ten minutes to go, neatly finishing from Massimo Gobbi square ball from the left. Valdés' goal turned out to be consolatory and Parma <b>slid</b> <b>to</b> 14th position in the league.|$|E
