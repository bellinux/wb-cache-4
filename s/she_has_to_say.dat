25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close {{and listen to what}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact that}} even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E

2500|$|Tsvetaeva's poetry was {{admired by}} poets such as Valery Bryusov, Maximilian Voloshin, Osip Mandelstam, Boris Pasternak, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Anna Akhmatova. Later, that {{recognition}} was also {{expressed by the}} poet Joseph Brodsky, pre-eminent among Tsvetaeva's champions. Tsvetaeva was primarily a lyrical poet, and her lyrical voice remains clearly audible in her narrative poetry. Brodsky said of her work: [...] "Represented on a graph, Tsvetaeva's work would exhibit a curve - or rather, a straight line - rising at almost a right angle because of her constant effort to raise the pitch a note higher, an idea higher (or, more precisely, an octave and a faith higher.) She always carried everything <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to its conceivable and expressible end. In both her poetry and her prose, nothing remains hanging or leaves a feeling of ambivalence. Tsvetaeva is the unique {{case in which the}} paramount spiritual experience of an epoch (for us, the sense of ambivalence, of contradictoriness in the nature of human existence) served not as the object of expression but as its means, by which it was transformed into the material of art." [...] Critic Annie Fitch describes the engaging, heart-felt nature of the work. [...] "Tsvetaeva is such a warm poet, so unbridled in her passion, so completely vulnerable in her love poetry, whether to her female lover Sofie Parnak, to Boris Pasternak. [...] Tsvetaeva throws her poetic brilliance on the altar of her heart’s experience with the faith of a true romantic, a priestess of lived emotion. And she stayed true to that faith to the tragic end of her life.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he told himself, [...] "I don't think I {{can blame}} her, after all, {{and with what}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it would hurt if I kept her waiting." ...|$|E
60|$|There, Lucy {{found herself}} {{at a loss}} how <b>to</b> express what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> next--and took refuge in silence.|$|R
60|$|Anne rose. At a {{sign from}} Geoffrey, the servant and the lad {{waited in the}} room <b>to</b> hear what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, but {{she wishes}} you would <b>have</b> heard what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the supposing Ida <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone in that direction.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't b'lieve Eureka {{would do}} such a dreadful thing!" [...] cried Dorothy, much distressed. [...] "Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we'll hear what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That rather {{depends on}} how much <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about herself," [...] {{returned}} Aurelia, after some reflection. [...] "She likes to hear about other people's affairs, but she had much rather talk of her own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can I, with my face swollen {{as it is}} now? Besides, {{what would}} be the good? What can I say to her? I know well enough what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to me, without {{listening}} to it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mountjoy {{replied that}} he was ready <b>to</b> hear what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>She</b> at once stepped up to him, and {{addressed}} him in these words: ...|$|R
60|$|If a dog {{had been}} {{under one of the}} chairs, and had barked, Lady Montbarry could not have {{proceeded}} more impenetrably with the last words <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Agnes.|$|R
60|$|They {{were both}} silent. He could not persuade himself <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more unless she {{led up to}} it by a question; and she was {{apparently}} meditating something that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Twould give grave offence {{to leave}} the lady, without knowing all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> The answer now {{concerns}} you, worthy Alderman; and the rattan will do its turn, in your hand, {{as well as in}} that of another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't say a {{thing about}} it until some time when Granny scolds me for being careless," [...] muttered Reddy, with a sly grin. [...] "Then I'll see what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I guess she won't scold me so much after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is--it is {{my cousin}} Ginevra. Every time she has leave to visit Mrs. Cholmondeley she calls here, and {{whenever}} she finds me alone {{she begins to}} talk about her admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about love." ...|$|E
60|$|The Grand Master had {{collected}} the suffrages, {{and now in}} a solemn tone demanded of Rebecca what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> against the sentence of condemnation, which {{he was about to}} pronounce.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, {{and listened to}} him, {{as if he was}} {{speaking}} to her in an unknown tongue, and went on with what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> as quietly as ever.|$|R
6000|$|Josie {{was a good}} listener. She did not {{interrupt}} Mary Louise, but let her <b>say</b> all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{concerning this}} interesting matter. When her friend paused for lack of words, Josie remarked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said Holmes, [...] "my {{suggestion}} is that we lock this door, leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form our opinion after we have heard {{what it is that}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That a {{young woman}} earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,' said Nancy; 'and that if the lady will only hear the first word <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll go to Hope anyway, {{and if she}} isn't there I'll {{leave my}} card, so she'll know I called. Then I'll see what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about matters," [...] he told himself; and setting his teeth {{somewhat}} grimly he started up the automobile and continued his trip.|$|E
60|$|He made {{an effort}} to rise then and there. With some difficulty, Carrie induced him to lie down again. He listened <b>to</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with evident impatience, and then shook his head.|$|R
60|$|Madam Rachel saw, {{while she}} was speaking, that Dwight did not look sullen and dissatisfied, but good-natured and pleasant; and so {{she knew that he}} <b>had</b> {{concluded}} <b>to</b> listen, candidly, <b>to</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed a}} long time before Cecily <b>had</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and then what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> said in a softened, indistinct voice. [...] "You're very kind," [...] she said, and kept hold of the little photograph.|$|R
6000|$|The two persons {{addressed}} {{waited in}} silence to hear more. Carmina's head drooped: she looked down. Miss Minerva attentively observed Mrs. Gallilee. [...] "Why am I invited {{to hear what}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about her son?" [...] was the question which occurred to the governess. [...] "Is she afraid that Carmina might tell me about it, if I was not let into the family secrets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] Falkenberg replied pleasantly, [...] "my {{wife will}} be here herself in a few moments. You shall hear what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> from her own lips. You must {{remember}} that I have paid a price. I have given up the guardianship of my son. You yourself," [...] he continued, looking steadfastly at Julien, [...] "may know if any other cause exists likely to have influenced my wife in granting my request." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much obliged--no harm done--much obliged, ma'am," [...] said Doctor Joyce. [...] "Now, Valentine, if {{you don't}} leave off apologizing, {{and sit down}} {{directly}} in that arm-chair against the wall, I shall take Mrs. Peckover into my study, and hear everything <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> at a private interview. There! we are all comfortable and composed again at last, and ready to be told how little Mary and the good friend who has been like a mother to her first met." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{resolute}} eyes {{rested on}} him with a look which said plainly, [...] "I mean to be heard." [...] He {{followed her into the}} sitting-room, and waited in sullen submission <b>to</b> hear what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray {{what came}} {{of her at}} last?" [...] said I, for I was willing to hear a little (seeing she would talk of it) what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> as well of Amy as of myself.|$|R
6000|$|The captain <b>had</b> listened <b>to</b> {{all this}} because he very much wanted <b>to</b> know what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but now he exclaimed: [...] "Do you suppose I shall pay any {{attention}} to all the gossip about my affairs?" ...|$|R
