The main aim of my thesis was to test modern autonomous conductivity meter (Levelogger, Solinst co. Canada) for this method in the artificially assembler well, where the real flow rate can be measured and controlled unlike in case of real wells. To compare the flow rate directly measured on inflow tubes to well and indirectly derived from tracer dilution technique the mean residence time in vertical segments was used. Based on 8 experiments the autonomous conductivity meter and also conductivity meters with probe on cable can be used for tracer dilution technique. Experiments clearly demonstrated that salt solution is slowly leached even from dead zones in unscreened part of the well at lest several tens of cms from boundary with creened casing. Salt solution is migrating from dead zones to <b>sreened</b> parts of the well. As a result the tracer dilution technique gives up to 2 times slower horizontál flow rate than directly measured flow.

Wheras the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) protocol does not routinely include {{examination of the}} infra renal andominal aorta, the protocol is performed quickly and easily for AAA screening. The main {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the utility of transthoracic echocardiography in the study of infrarenal aorta and AAA <b>sreening</b> in selected popultion. MethodsThe study included 674 patients (452 men, 222 women) consecutively assessed by TTE and, where possible, abdominal ulrasound for any reason in a cardiology department.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the metabolic function on gInA and gInII in Streptomyces, we have constructed single knockout mutants of S. coelicolor ginA and gInII. Both GS mutants are glutamine prototroph, suggesting that GSI as well as GSII are each capable of supplying the cells with the minimal need for glutamine alone. Interestingly, the gInII mutant showed a strongly reduced production of actinorhodin during growth on minimal medium supplemented with glutamate as sole nitrogen source. In contrast, actinorhodin production from the gInA mutant is {{comparable to that of}} wild-type cells. Thus, GSII might posses a specific function during differentiation and secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor. Attempts to construct a double GS knockout mutant and genetic <b>sreening</b> experiments revealed that besides GSI and GSII no further GS is present in S. coelicolor. In order to identify N-regulators the gInA as well as the gInII region of S. coelicolor were isolated and sequenced. Directly upstream from gInII orf 4 was identified which might encode a transcriptional regulator. For the first time, we have identified, isolated and sequenced gInB and gInE homologous genes in S. coelicolor. Both genes are localized in close proximity on a 8 kb genomic DNA fragment and are flanked by gInA and gInII. Insertional inactivation of ginE was successful and characterization of the mutant showed that the gGInE protein of Streptomyces coelicolor is a posttranslational regulator of GSI, which acts as an adenyltransferase like its counterpart in Enterobacteria.

We conducted a systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron {{emission tomography}} in patients suspected of recurrent papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. Two reviewers independently selected, extracted and assessed data from relevant literature found in computerized databases and by reference tracking. Prospective and retrospective studies with 10 human subjects, or more, that evaluated the accuracy of ring positron omission tomography, using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose in follicular and papillary thyroid cancer, were included. Studies on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging using cameras, reviews, case reports, editorials, letters and comments were excluded. The methodological quality was assessed by applying the criteria for diagnostic tests recommended by the Cochrane Methods Group on <b>Sreening</b> and Diagnostic Tests. A rating system was used for qualitative analysis consisting of four levels of evidence (1 = highest level; 4 = lowest level). Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies claimed a positive role for positron emission tomography but, at evidence levels 3 or 4, precluding quantitative analysis. Methodological problems included poor validity of reference tests and a lack of blinding of test performance and interpretation. The reviewed material was heterogeneous with respect to patient variation and validation methodology. The most consistent data were found on the ability of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to provide an anatomical substrate in patients with elevated serum Tg and negative iodine- 131 scans. In conclusion, the results seem to support the potential of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to identify and localize foci of recurrent cancer in the latter patient subset. However, implementation of positron emission tomography in a routine diagnostic algorithm requires additional evidence. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Transmission of {{information}} in the CNS is processed via synaptic connections and is modulated. The protein plasticity related gene 1 (PRG- 1) was recently described as modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission. According to the current postulated mechanism, the postsynaptic expressed PRG- 1 modifies the concentration of bioactive lipids in the synaptic cleft and modulates thereby the signal transmission via the presynaptic localized LPA 2 -receptors. In the present study a mouse model was generated expressing the reporter gene yellow flourescent protein (YFP) under control of elements from the native PRG- 1 promoter. Expression of the reporter was controlled by a 200 kb cotransfected sequence, encompassing the transcription start site of prg 1. Immunohistologic analysis of the generated reporter mouse documented that the choosen 200 kb sequence stretch was effectual to confer strict neuronal expression of YFP. Additional all regulation elements necessary for the intraneuronal expression pattern of PRG- 1 seem to be present on the tranferred sequence stretch. Another aim was the analysis of prg 1 transcriptional regulation. Using RLM-race it could be shown that transcription of prg- 1 is initated at multiple start points. Another transcription start point localized further upstream which was previously published from our group could be confirmed with PCR-analysis. Reporter gene-assays of deletion constructs in primary cultivated neurons and astrocytes identified the sequence of a minimal promotor, which stimulates specific transcription in neurons forty-fold. The functionality of the identified minimal promotor could be documented via electroporation of a reporter gene construct in organotypic slice constructs. Investigation of the identified minimal promoter via EMSA determined sequence fragments with DNA-protein-complexes. In silico analysis revealed conserved binding sites for the transcription factors SP 1 and CREB in the rodent and human minimal promoter sequence. The detected DNA-protein-complexes could be specifically competed with SP 1 and CREB consensus oligonucleotides. The direct regulation of PRG- 1 transcription through the transcription factor Nex 1 was published prior to this study. The question emerged, if transcriptional regulation of the identified minimal promoter was influenced by Nex 1. No significant transcriptional stimulation could be detected in cotransfection experiments with a Nex 1 expression vector, indicating a new Nex 1 independent regulation mechanism. No alteration regarding the PRG- 1 protein content in brain homogenates was detected in Nex 1 deficient mice via western blot analysis. No variation regarding the spatial expression of PRG- 1 could be detected via analysis of reporter gene expression in the generated PRG- 1 reporter mouse. Another {{aim of this study}} was the identification of putative interaction partners of PRG- 1. The cytoplasmatic C-terminus of PRG- 1 was subcloned in an expression vector, which was used in a two-hybrid assay performed by “Yeast Two-Hybrid <b>Sreening</b> Service at DKFZ”. NSF was identified as putative interaction partner. This interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of affinity tagged proteins expressed in HEK 293 cells.

An approach with a one stop clinic for assessment of risk for fetal anomalies, where pre-test counseling, blood test, ultrasound and post-test counseling is offered in one hour visit is described. Based on maternal age, biochemistry and fetal nuchal translucency measurement an estimated risk for fetal trisomies 13, 18 and 21 is calculated. The main benefit of this approach in screening for fetal aneuploidy is the short turnaround time, with immediate results and a low screen positive rate. This approach leads to diagnosis of the majority (95 %) of fetal aneuploidy cases. If screening is positive a diagnostic test is available with chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis. In Iceland, fetal karyotyping is offered to women 35 years and older and performed during the second trimester, but by using this approach prenatal diagnosis can be moved to the first trimester and also offered to women of all ages. A screening approach {{with a series of}} steps from 10 - 15 weeks, including maternal blood test at 10 and again at 15 weeks, as well as an ultrasound and nuchal translucency measurement at 11 - 13 weeks, with integrated results at 15 + weeks has been proposed. This method offers even lower screen positive rate (1 %) while detection rates of fetal aneuploides are high (> 90 %) but it requires four visits instead of one and the prolonged approach is likely to cause excess anxiety for the parents to be. If all women are to be offered prenatal <b>sreening</b> in the first trimester the structure of prenatal care in Iceland needs some modifications including scheduling the first prenatal visit at 8 - 10 weeks and teaching healthcare providers counseling regarding prenatal testing.

Kostir við þessa aðferð eru að niðurstaða úr skimun fæst samdægurs, tíðni jákvæðrar skimunar er í lágmarki (6 - 7 %) en greiningarhlutfall litningagalla hátt (95 %). Ef skimun er jákvæð má taka fylgjusýni og fæst svar eftir tvo daga. Þannig fæst fósturgreining á fyrsta þriðjungi meðgöngu í stað annars, eins og nú er á Íslandi. Einnig hefur verið lýst aðferð sem felur í sér enn lægri tíðni jákvæðrar skimunar (1 %), með ámóta greiningarhlutfalli litningagalla, en sú aðferð felur í sér fjórar heimsóknir, fyrst vegna blóðprufu, síðan ómskoðun, annarrar blóðprufu og loks heimsókn til túlkunar á niðurstöðum. Samþætt líkindamat er síðan gefið út nokkrum dögum eftir seinni blóðprufuna. Ferlið allt tekur fimm til sex vikur, sem getur verið kvíðavaldandi fyrir verðandi foreldra. Ef færa á fósturgreiningu á Íslandi frá öðrum þriðjungi meðgöngu til fyrsta þriðjungs og til allra sem þess óska, þurfa konur að koma fyrr í mæðravernd en nú er og fagfólk í heislugæslu þarf að kynna sér þessa nýjung til að geta veitt skjólstæðingum sínum sem bestar upplýsingar...|$|R
