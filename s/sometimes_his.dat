5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether or not}} he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed some details and <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> series was unbalanced. Trained as an artist, his works lacked archaeological descriptions, {{the main purpose}} of his contract. The {{printing}} quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. His photographs were shown to the public both in the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E

25|$|Though {{known for}} his {{portrayal}} of Gomer Pyle, Nabors became a popular guest on variety shows in the 1960s and 1970s (including two specials of his own in 1969 and 1974), which showcased his rich baritone voice, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> higher-pitched voice. He subsequently recorded numerous albums and singles, most of them containing romantic ballads.|$|E

His opinion pieces are occasionally political, sometimes historical, but most focus on timely issues involving race, immigration or religion. His essays, in contrast, are often cultural critiques of popular books, television shows or movies. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>his</b> essays explore his own family or his personal life; sometimes they are serious, but often they are light-hearted or comic.|$|E
25|$|Ward is a Solomon-like {{figure of}} quiet dignity who {{dispenses}} parental justice tempered with understanding. He sometimes finds himself punishing his sons for deeds {{he admits he}} committed as a child. Ward relates to the peer-pressure the boys sometimes face as when he defends them for wanting to view a horror movie with Eddie Haskell. June objects, but Ward responds by telling her he saw hundreds of horror films as a boy and even had a subscription to Weird Tales. Ward often finds himself learning {{the most in the}} episode from something his sons, or <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> wife, do.|$|E
25|$|Besides the Navy, Generalissimo Guards {{and twenty}} battalions of the Guangdong Army, Sun Yat-sen lacked strong support of {{military}} {{strength in the}} Guangzhou Military Government, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> order was only effective in the Generalissmo Government. Sun had thoughts of mutiny at once, hoping to overthrow the Guangxi influence, and had personally ordered the Navy to fire at the Guangxi headquarters at one time. Near the end of 1917, Lu Rongting, Tang Jiyao, Mo Rongxin and others along with Tang Shaoyi convened a conference, and they advocated recognition of Feng Guozhang's presidency and formation a united government.|$|E

25|$|Defensive {{armament}} - armour – {{at first}} included the gambeson, then developed into the brigandine and scale armour, followed by hauberk, and then mail with some plate elements, such as breastplates and brassards, and finally panoply, {{which by the}} end of 16th century gained its perfect form, protecting the whole of a knight's body, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> horse. There were some differences between the rich knights of Małopolska, Wielkopolska or Śląsk and those of Mazowsze, who, because they faced enemies from the East, like Old Prussians, Lithuanians, and Tartars, partially adopted their fighting manners, and lighter armament as well. Even their horses were smaller and lighter.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest and}} oldest Patriarchal See was {{based at the}} Rabban Hormizd monastery of Alqosh, near Mosul. It spread from Aqrah up to Seert and Nisibis, {{covering}} the South rich plain of Mosul (it is known also as Eliya line). Since the 15th century, its Patriarchs belonged to the Bar Mama (or Abuna) family and they were appointed through a strict hereditary system: the old patriarch chose one of his nephews (or <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> young brother), and consecrated him as metropolitan bishop with right of succession. The nephew was known as natar kursi (designated successor). In 1760 the patriarch of this See was Eliya XII (or XI) Denkha, the uncle of Yohannan Hormizd.|$|E
25|$|Necessarily {{much of the}} {{information}} in this large compilation varies in value. The Panarion reflects the character of Epiphanius and his method of working. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>his</b> intense passion prevents him from inquiring carefully into the doctrines he opposes. Thus, on his own avowal (Haer., lxxi), he speaks of Apollinarianism on hearsay. At Constantinople, he had to acknowledge to the Origenist monks, whom he opposed, that he was not acquainted with either their school or their books, and that he only spoke from hearsay (Sozomen, Hist. eccl., VIII, xl). There is, however, much information not found elsewhere. Chapters devoted only to the doctrinal refutation of heresies are rare. As an apologist, Epiphanius appeared generally weak to Photius.|$|E

500|$|The {{month after}} Tremaine {{announced}} his [...] "thought variant" [...] policy, Hornig launched his own [...] "New Policy" [...] at Wonder Stories; as with thought variants, {{the goal was}} to emphasize originality and bar stories that merely reworked well-worn ideas. [...] Hornig's rates were lower than Astoundings, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> writers were paid very late, or not at all; despite these handicaps, Hornig managed to find some good material, including Stanley G.

In Latin documents, he was called Stephanus Vladislav, Serbiae rex (1238). He also signed himself with the expanded title of his father: [...] "King of All Rascian Lands, and Diocletia, and Dalmatia, and Travunia, and Zachumlia".

500|$|When Hornig {{took over}} from Lasser {{at the end}} of 1933 he {{attempted}} to continue and expand Lasser's approach. Hornig introduced a [...] "New Policy" [...] in the January 1934 issue, emphasizing originality and barring stories that merely reworked well-worn ideas. He asked for stories that included good science, although [...] "not enough to become boring to those readers who are not primarily interested in the technicalities of the science". However, Astounding was moving into the lead position in the science fiction magazine field at this time, and Hornig had difficulty in competing. His rates of payment were lower than Astoundings one cent per word; <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> writers were paid very late, or not at all. Despite these handicaps, Hornig managed to find some good material, including Stanley G. Weinbaum's [...] "A Martian Odyssey", which appeared in the July 1934 Wonder and has been frequently reprinted.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Daniel Chun, and was his first script for the series. The episode also was the {{inception}} of two major story arcs, the first being the season-long arc of Dunder Mifflin {{going out of business}} and its purchase by the printer company Sabre in the episode of the same name, and the second being the budding romance between Andy and Erin. According to series creator and episode director Greg Daniels, the episode explores the idea that Michael is positively motivated due to his subconscious; although his antics seem nonsensical to many members of the office, in the end, his idea to take his coworkers' minds off of the fiscal trouble proves to be the best choice. This was first explored in the third season episode [...] "Grief Counseling". Chun later explained in a Q with The Office fansite OfficeTally that [...] "the episode was partly about Jim realizing that sometimes Michael isn't crazy, he's crazy like a fox" [...] in that <b>sometimes</b> <b>his</b> underlying motives are clever.|$|E
