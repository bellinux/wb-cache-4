5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b> This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b> If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E

5|$|A <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> is an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee to benefit a person {{without having to}} specify that person in a will. The trustee is transferred property {{under the terms of}} the will which he or she then holds on trust for others.|$|E
5|$|For a fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid, therefore, it must {{be proved}} that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee {{accepted}} his obligations. Intention {{is one of the}} three certainties, and applies to fully secret trusts {{in the same way as}} it does to other express trusts.|$|E
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> — fully secret and half-secret. A fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
50|$|Blackwell v Blackwell 1929 UKHL 1 is an English trusts law case, {{concerning}} {{the doctrine of}} <b>secret</b> <b>trusts.</b>|$|R
500|$|Evidential issues also exist. Because <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are by {{definition}} secret, they {{are difficult to}} prove in court. The parol evidence rule states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the parol evidence rule extended to <b>secret</b> <b>trusts,</b> and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the testator intended to create a trust. As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] that it exists.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are {{sometimes}} considered constructive trusts. They {{do not follow}} the Wills Act 1837; a requirement for express trusts. The argument {{is that it is}} such trusts are intended to prevent fraud by statute. Under this rule, <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> would be constructive trusts; the reason {{they do not have to}} follow the Wills Act is because they are created by the courts. This is a difficult argument with which to justify half-secret trusts, because since the will mentions the trust, fraud is not directly possible. A more modern argument is that <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are independent and operate outside the will. The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by Megarry VC in Re Snowden, where he said [...] "The whole basis of secret trusts...is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to operate according to its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property in the hands of the recipient". This suggests that <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are not constructive trusts but rather express trusts.|$|R
5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust,</b> but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b> Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to {{at all on the}} face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In the case of a half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem is to consider them constructive. Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E
500|$|A {{more modern}} {{argument}} is that <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are independent and operate outside the will. This {{would mean that the}} trust is not testamentary in nature but falls within the ordinary equitable jurisdiction of the court. The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by Megarry VC in Re Snowden, where he said [...] "The whole basis of <b>secret</b> <b>trusts...</b> is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to operate according to its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property {{in the hands of the}} recipient".

500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under a <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> predeceases the testator, his or {{her personal}} representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part of {{his or her}} residuary estate by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> predeceases the testator, or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the testator, the position of the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> in unclear. In the case of a half-secret trust, the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee". Of a fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust,</b> it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a personal obligation as thus fails if renounced or if the trustee predeceases the testator.|$|E

500|$|The {{result of}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory has been seen with respect to witnesses to the will. Section 15 of the Wills Act states that any person [...] " [...] the execution of any will to whom or to whose wife or husband any beneficial ... shall be thereby given or made, such ... shall, so far only as concerns such person attesting the execution of such will, or the wife or husband of such person, or any person claiming under such person or wife or husband, be utterly null and void". In Re Young, an attesting witness was the beneficiary of a <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b> The court decided that [...] "the Wills Act 1837 {{had nothing to do with}} it" [...] and the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> valid. The effect of the Wills Act 1968 has been to allow the trustee of a half-secret trust to attest the will and this may also apply to the fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b>|$|E

5|$|Whether <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> are express or {{constructive}} trusts is unclear. Snell's Equity includes them in its {{section on}} express trusts, as does Underhill and Hayton, although both opine {{that they are}} better classified as express trust with constructive elements.|$|R
500|$|Fully secret trusts are awkward {{because of}} the lack of {{evidence}} pertaining to their existence and terms. In Ottaway v Norman, Brightman J set out the test for proving the existence of a fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b> This is: ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{requirement}} {{is that both}} the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> and its terms are communicated to the trustee. This may be done after {{the writing of the}} will, {{as long as it is}} prior to death; without it, the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> is void. Exactly what must be communicated depends on the nature of the property and trust; if there are multiple beneficiaries for example, this will need to be communicated. In Re Boyes, Kay J came to the conclusion that communication requires allowing the trustee the chance to refuse his office; as such, it cannot be done after death. Lastly, the office of trustee must be accepted by the trustee. The two ways this can be done were laid out by Wood VC in Wallgrave v Tebbs, when he said: ...|$|E
500|$|Some authors place fully {{secret and}} half-secret trusts in {{different}} categories, including Alastair Hudson and Lionel Astor Sheridan. To this {{it has been}} argued that, if the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory is the true basis for the <b>secret</b> <b>trust,</b> whether the mention of the existence of the trust {{on the face of the}} will should affect its nature. In Hudson's opinion, fully secret trusts are constructive trusts, because they exist to prevent fraud. But sometimes they are express trusts, if [...] "au dehor" [...] doctrine is concerned. Half-secret trusts are constructive trust, because their mention in wills makes fraud unlikely; they are instead in line with a constructive notice, e.g. the use of sealed document. The House of Lords in Blackwell v Blackwell, however, considered the half-secret trust to have the same basis as the fully <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{special court}} handed down its {{unanimous}} decision, {{in favor of}} the Woodmen, on May 23, 1925. Ward wrote the majority opinion, in support of the decision by the El Paso Court of Appeals; concurring opinions were written by associate justices Brazzil and Henenberg. The decision was based mainly on an upholding of the state law regarding <b>secret</b> <b>trusts</b> and deeds. Thereafter the court disbanded.|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} two grounds on which this rule has been based. The {{narrower}} ground is that the trustee should be debarred from denying {{the existence of the}} trust because of his wrongful conduct at the time he made the undertaking, as identified by Lord Westbury in McCormick v Grogan. The wider ground extends to attempting to renege on the promise made during the testator's lifetime, even when his intention at the time of making the promise may have been to fulfill the testator's wishes. The wider ground appears to have been adopted by the Court of Appeal in Bannister v Bannister. D. R. Hodge has argued that [...] "acceptance of the narrower view would not only impose upon a person seeking to establish a <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> the heavy onus of showing at what point of time the secret trustee decided to resile from his promise, but would also make the validity of the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> dependent upon what is in fact an irrelevant consideration".|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a <b>secret</b> <b>trust.</b> Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
500|$|... 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{requires}} that [...] "a {{declaration of trust}} respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person {{who is able to}} declare such trust or by his will". section 53(1)(a) said [...] "no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law". [...] Two cases, [...] Re Baillie and Ottaway v Norman, have concerned secret trusts over land. In neither case the formality requirements are said to be neglected, but neither judgment expressly considered why 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) made an impact that an prima facie express trust could be set up. This has been used to be an argument that secret trusts are constructive but in light of both cases it appears not. However, an express trust may still be exempted from the requirements of 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) by a separate application of the equitable maxim [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud" [...] the fraud would be for the trustee to deny the existence of the <b>secret</b> <b>trust,</b> but this time the statute concerned would be the Law of Property Act, a line of reasoning dependent upon the case of Rochefoucauld v Boustead. Also, the correct interpretation of <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> in light of [...] "au dehor" [...] theory strongly affirms that the <b>secret</b> <b>trust</b> can operate outside the Law of Property Act and still be an express trust.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{types of}} {{constructive}} trust not relating to unconscionable dealings are constructive trusts over property, mutual wills, and arguably <b>secret</b> <b>trusts.</b> Where property is sold or transferred, {{the signing of}} an agreement to do so automatically transfers the equitable interest to the buyer or transferee; until the property itself is transferred, it is deemed to be held on constructive trust for the recipient. Mutual wills are irrevocable wills made by multiple people to come into force at the writer's death; similarly, these are also considered constructive <b>trusts.</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>trusts</b> {{are the subject of}} much debate over their classification, but one theory holds them to be constructive in nature. Related to constructive trusts are constructive trustees, or trustees de son tort; these are where [...] "one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to intermeddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee". Where their actions are reckless or dishonest, the court makes that person a constructive trustee, forcing them to account to the beneficiaries for any loss suffered and look after the trust property in their possession.|$|R
