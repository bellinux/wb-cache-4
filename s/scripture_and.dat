5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of <b>Scripture</b> <b>and</b> Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{from many}} traditions were critical, saying the {{movement}} was hyper-emotional, misused <b>Scripture</b> <b>and</b> lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit.

5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce <b>scripture</b> <b>and</b> allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of <b>scripture</b> <b>and</b> passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. Unlike many of her colleagues, Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society. She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical <b>scripture</b> <b>and</b> sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E

5|$|Symeon endured severe {{opposition}} from church authorities, {{particularly from the}} chief theologian of the emperor's court, Archbishop Stephen, who at one time was the Metropolitan of Nicomedia. Stephen was a former politician and diplomat {{with a reputation for}} a thorough theoretical understanding of theology, but one which was removed from actual experience of the spiritual life. Symeon, in contrast, held the view that one must have actual experience of the Holy Spirit in order to speak about God, at the same time recognizing the authority of <b>scripture</b> <b>and</b> of the earlier church fathers. Their differing views on the source of authority to speak on spiritual matters was the cause of several years of intense conflict, ending with Symeon's eventual exile.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This {{can be explained by}} the close relationship he saw between exegesis of <b>scripture</b> <b>and</b> theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E
