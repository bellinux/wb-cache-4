5|$|After {{struggling}} with the rare liver disease primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> for several months, Payton died on November 1, 1999, aged 45, from cholangiocarcinoma. His legacy includes the Walter Payton Award, the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, and a heightened {{awareness of the need}} for organ donations.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis,</b> which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis has a {{significant}} association with primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large bile ducts. As many as 5% of patients with ulcerative colitis may progress to develop primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests are}} performed {{to screen for}} bile duct involvement: primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis.</b> PSC is a {{progressive}} cholestatic disorder presenting with pruritus, steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and metabolic bone disease. There {{is a strong}} association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Rarely are {{diseases}} of the bile ducts, such as primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis,</b> causes of cirrhosis. Imaging of the bile ducts, such as ERCP or MRCP (MRI of biliary tract and pancreas) may aid in the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Cholangitis. CD {{also found}} at higher than {{expected}} frequencies in autoimmune cholangitis and primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis.</b> CD is frequently linked to pancreatitis {{but also to}} papillary stenosis and, in India, tropical calcific pancreatitis appears also {{to be associated with}} CD.|$|E
25|$|Gallstones are {{a common}} cause of {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder, called cholecystitis. Inflammation of the biliary duct is called cholangitis, which {{may be associated with}} autoimmune disease, such as primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis,</b> or a result of bacterial infection, such as ascending cholangitis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{autoimmune}} hepatitis have other autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune hepatitis {{is distinct from}} the other autoimmune diseases of the liver: primary biliary cirrhosis and primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis.</b> However, all of these diseases can lead to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{localized}} enlargements {{of normal}} structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis,</b> cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It {{can be dangerous}} to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision {{in an attempt to}} avoid such severe complications.|$|E
25|$|ANCAs are {{associated}} with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in inflammatory bowel disease, primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> and rheumatoid arthritis (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens {{are associated}} with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced vasculitis, autoimmune liver disease, drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced systemic vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 19 she was {{diagnosed}} with the liver condition primary <b>sclerosing</b> <b>cholangitis</b> and in June 2010 she became patron of the Children's Liver Disease Foundation. Baltacha {{was diagnosed}} with liver cancer in January 2014. She died from the disease on 4 May 2014 at the age of 30. Several players paid tribute to Baltacha on Twitter including Grand Slam champions Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams, Billie Jean King, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, Kim Clijsters, Petra Kvitová, Marion Bartoli, Chris Evert, Sam Stosur and Svetlana Kuznetsova. A host of ATP and WTA tennis players past and present came together on the centre court at the Madrid Open as a mark of respect for Baltacha. Baltacha's funeral took place on 19 May and was attended by Tim Henman, Annabel Croft, Laura Robson, Jo Durie and Judy Murray among others. Mourners were asked to wear bright colours instead of black and to donate to Rally for Bally rather than buying flowers. The money will be split equally between the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, which she set up to help disadvantaged children take up the sport.|$|E
