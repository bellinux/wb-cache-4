Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and upkeep. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, this work began to <b>slack</b> <b>off.</b> As the money ran out, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E

Social facilitation increases the dominant responses likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to <b>slack</b> <b>off</b> when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.|$|E
500|$|Regular Show is an American [...] {{animated}} comedy {{television series}} created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network. It ran from September 6, 2010 to January 16, 2017, concluding {{with a total}} of 261 episodes through eight seasons. The series revolves around the lives of two friends who are 23 [...] – a blue jay named Mordecai (Quintel) and a raccoon named Rigby (William Salyers) – both of whom are employed as groundskeepers at a local park. Regular Show depicts their daily routines at work and usual attempts to <b>slack</b> <b>off,</b> which often result in surreal misadventures. Other major characters include fellow groundskeepers Skips (Mark Hamill), Muscle Man (Sam Marin), and Hi-Five Ghost (Quintel), park manager Pops (Marin), and their boss Benson (Marin).|$|E

Rather than waiting for nighttime raids, Japanese attack formations, escorted by A6M Zero fighters, conducted strikes on TGs38.1 and 38.4 from dawn to dusk. Combat air patrol over TG38.4 had to be augmented with additional fighters to intercept incoming Japanese aircraft. Approximately two dozen Japanese attack and fighter planes were shot down between 10:45–10:56 hours {{by a combination of}} CAP fighters and ships' guns. Fighters from [...] accounted for many more planes destroyed throughout the afternoon hours. Though Franklin took a glancing bomb hit during these battles, the damage proved superficial. TG38.4 planes did battle with the enemy over land as well. Air Group 13 (CAG-13) aboard Franklin encountered a large group of enemies at Nielson Field during the morning strikes against Luzon. They claimed at least 20 enemy planes for a loss of just one Hellcat fighter.|$|E

The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to where we are in our career begin to <b>slack</b> <b>off,</b> smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it."

[...] Lauren Hoffman of Vulture gave the episode a 2 out of 5, signaling mixed to negative reviews, saying [...] "The main problem with last night’s episode is that “Are you a Katy or a Gaga?” isn’t a particularly interesting question. I’m not even sure what that question is asking. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry certainly aren’t the same , but they’re not exactly polar opposites."

2500|$|Quantrill {{spent the}} winter in his family's {{diminutive}} shack in the impoverished town, and he soon grew rather restless. Concurrently at this time, many Ohioans were migrating to the Kansas Territory in search of cheap land and opportunity. This included Henry Torrey and Harmon Beeson, two local men hoping to build a large farm for their families out west. Although they didn't trust the 19-year-old William, Bill's mother's pleadings persuaded them to let her son accompany them [...] {{in an effort to}} get him to turn his life around. The party of three departed in late February 1857. Torrey and Beeson agreed to pay for Quantrill's land in exchange for a couple of months' worth of work. They settled at Marais des Cygnes, but things did not go as well as planned. After about two months, Quantrill began to <b>slack</b> <b>off</b> when it came to working the land, and he spent most days wandering aimlessly about the wilderness with a rifle. A dispute arose over the claim, and he went to court with Torrey and Beeson. The court awarded the men what was owed to them, but Quantrill only paid half of what the court had mandated. While his relationship with Beeson was never the same, Quantrill nevertheless remained friends with Torrey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} hook in Sînt o babă comunistă! {{is provided}} by Emilia's attempt to define her political convictions, after being questioned by her daughter, Alice. The content Emilia finds in juxtaposing communism and the happier moments of her life, peaking into episodes of utopianism, are seen as observation-based attempts to characterize {{an entire generation of}} Romanians. Emilia's erroneous train of thought becomes apparent in episodes where she recalls her employment at a state-owned factory. Her ideal, Ursa notes, is actually that of an [...] "anti-world", where negative values are made to look positive: [...] "work before the lunch break, so that one could <b>slack</b> <b>off</b> afterward , 'creative' solutions for increasing productivity, generalized theft ('there was enough to steal from'), painting fir trees green when a visit by Ceaușescu was due, the presence of a good-natured man who traded in political jokes (the assigned informer, as it would turn out)." [...] The constant movement between [...] "before" [...] and [...] "after", Soviany notes, follow [...] "the pendulum principle", serving to illustrate Emilia's sense of time and the experience of change as nauseating. The object of the novel, according to the critic, is comparable to the scope of a Bildungsroman: [...] " [...] becomes the book about the female protagonist's transition from the infantile and paradise-like stage [...] toward reflection and doubt, therefore toward maturity." [...] The importance of this transformation to the plot is also discussed by Axinte, who argues that its revelations compensate {{for the fact that the}} novel [...] "does not provide anything new (as information and biographical document) for those born and bred under communism." [...] Cosmin Ciotloș sees the manner in which Lungu [...] "tames with candor" [...] the elements of a communist-style biography as [...] "socialist realism redeeming itself on the last stretch of the race", stripped of conventions to become [...] "purebred sociological realism". In Lungu's own definition, the book is built around [...] "the decision process blueprint, where pros and cons confront themselves in the present, while invoking their timely roots." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would <b>slack</b> <b>off,</b> he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E
