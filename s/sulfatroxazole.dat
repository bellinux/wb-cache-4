40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb) raised against sulfamethazine (21 C 7) was applied in an optical biosensor (Biacore Q) {{to develop a}} rapid biosensor immunoassay (BIA) {{for the detection of}} several sulfonamides in chicken serum. The performance of this MAb was compared with two polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) raised against sulfamethazine (Qflex sulfamethazine binding protein (SBP) and RIKILT 464 b). Using these PAbs, the limits of detection (LODs) in 10 times diluted chicken serum were approximately 30 ng ml- 1 and the two BIAs were found to be specific for sulfamethazine. Using MAb 21 C 7, the LOD for sulfamethazine in 10 times diluted chicken serum was lower (10 ng ml- 1), high cross-reactivities were measured for sulfisoxazole (149 ¿ sulfachlorpyridazine (112 ¿ sulfachlorpyrazine (94 ¿ sulfamerazine (87 ¿ sulfadiazine (56 ¿ <b>sulfatroxazole</b> (56 ¿and sulfathiazole (50 ¿and low cross-reactivities (11 ¿ 25 ¿were measured with six other sulfonamides. Compared with the polyclonal antibodies, the MAb-based BIA resulted in a better sensitivity and was found suitable for the detection of 8 sulfonamides in 10 times diluted chicken serum with LODs between 7 and 20 ng ml- 1. The total run time for each cycle was 7 min...|$|E
40|$|To prepare {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{against the}} generic part of sulfonamides, a sulfathiazole derivative was chemically linked to carrier proteins {{in such a}} way that the aromatic amino group, common to all sulfonamides, was distal to the proteins. Four mice were immunized with the sulfathiazole-protein derivatives. The spleen cells of one of the mice were fused with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas of which the supernatants were screened in an indirect ELISA (iELISA) for the presence of sulfathiazole antibodies. After cloning, positive supernatants were tested in a competitive iELISA (ciELISA) for inhibition with 18 sulfonamides. This resulted in four different mAbs (all IgG 1 kappa light chain) which recognized several sulfonamides. By use of the best monoclonal (27 G 3) and an optimized ciELISA protocol, eight structurally different sulfonamides showed 50 % inhibition at concentrations less than 100 ngml- 1 or 5 ng/well. However, other relevant sulfonamides (such as sulfadimidine, <b>sulfatroxazole</b> and sulfachloropyrazine) were detected at a high level only with this mAb. This means that the ciELISA (with the best Mab) showed a broad specificity for sulfonamides but the sensitivity towards the different sulfonamides varied too much to call it a generic sulfonamide ELISA...|$|E
