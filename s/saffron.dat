5|$|Human {{cultivation}} {{and use of}} <b>saffron</b> spans {{more than}} 3,500 years and extends across cultures, continents, and civilizations. <b>Saffron,</b> a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the <b>saffron</b> crocus (Crocus sativus), has through history remained among the world's most costly substances. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, the apocarotenoid-rich <b>saffron</b> {{has been used as}} a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine.|$|E
5|$|In Greco-Roman times <b>saffron</b> {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their {{customers}} {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of <b>saffron</b> in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, <b>saffron</b> was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used <b>saffron</b> baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a <b>saffron</b> dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Persia, <b>saffron</b> (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian <b>saffron</b> threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. <b>Saffron</b> was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, <b>saffron</b> threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian <b>saffron</b> threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian <b>saffron</b> was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian <b>saffron</b> was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed <b>saffron</b> into teas and dined on <b>saffron</b> rice. Alexander personally used <b>saffron</b> sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in <b>saffron</b> grew with each treatment. He even recommended <b>saffron</b> baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized <b>saffron</b> as a perfume or {{deodoriser}} {{and scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread <b>saffron</b> along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily <b>saffron</b> baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred <b>saffron</b> threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took <b>saffron</b> {{with them when they}} settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that <b>saffron</b> only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Chinese Buddhist {{accounts}} from the mula-sarvastivadin monastic order (or vinaya) present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an arhat Indian Buddhist missionary {{by the name}} of Madhyântika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri <b>saffron</b> crop. From there, <b>saffron</b> use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, <b>saffron</b> stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye.|$|E

5|$|For {{the ancient}} Mediterraneans, <b>saffron</b> {{gathered}} around the Cilician coastal town of Soli was of top value, particularly for use in perfumes and ointments.

5|$|In France, <b>saffron</b> {{production}} {{became very}} important in the 17th and 18th centuries, reaching a few tons.

Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century, possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops, to particularly cold winters, and to competing market from the Mediterranean countries.|$|E

5|$|<b>Saffron</b> {{cultivation}} in Europe declined steeply {{following the}} fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, <b>saffron</b> cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle the Iberian peninsula as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced <b>saffron</b> corms to the region around Poitiers after they lost the Battle of Tours to Charles Martel in AD 732. Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted <b>saffron</b> throughout the southern provinces of Andalucia, Castile, La Mancha, and Valencia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saffron</b> {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating <b>saffron</b> after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of <b>saffron,</b> and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch <b>saffron</b> was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E
5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the <b>saffron</b> crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in <b>saffron</b> cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the <b>saffron</b> market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the <b>saffron</b> harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E

5|$|Various {{conflicting}} accounts {{exist that}} describe saffron's first arrival in South and East Asia. The {{first of these}} rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that <b>saffron,</b> among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire. Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri <b>saffron</b> by utilising their extensive trade routes.

5|$|In England, {{cultivation}} persisted {{only in the}} light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of {{the north}} Essex countryside.

Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation.
