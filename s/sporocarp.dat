5|$|In two {{regions of}} Australia, the central west coast and eastern central Australia, forms of early {{agriculture}} {{may have been}} practiced. People living in permanent settlements of over 200 residents sowed or planted {{on a large scale}} and stored the harvested food. The Nhanda and Amangu of the central west coast grew yams (Dioscorea hastifolia), while various groups in eastern central Australia (the Corners Region) planted and harvested bush onions (yaua - Cyperus bulbosus), native millet (cooly, tindil – Panicum decompositum) and a <b>sporocarp,</b> ngardu (Marsillea drumondii).|$|E
5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known <b>sporocarp</b> fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizal fungi do {{not play}} {{a large role in}} {{agricultural}} and horticultural systems. Most of the economically relevant crop plants that form mycorrhizas tend to form them with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Many modern agricultural practices such as tillage, heavy fertilizers, and fungicides have extremely detrimental effects on crops’ associated mycorrhizas and on the surrounding ecosystem. Thus, it is possible that agriculture indirectly affects nearby ectomycorrhizal species and habitats, such as increased fertilization decreasing <b>sporocarp</b> production.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{population}} {{structure of the}} saprotrophic basidiomycete Tulostoma brumale was investigated at a site in south eastern Sweden. <b>Sporocarps</b> were mapped and collected, and somatic incompatibility tests between mycelial cultures cultivated from the <b>sporocarps</b> were used to identify genets. Calculations of the size and numbers of genets and their distribution were performed. The spatial distribution of the tested <b>sporocarps</b> and the identified genets are presented graphically in a grid. The total number of identified genets within the investigated area (1210 m 2) was 27 based on 48 tested <b>sporocarps.</b> The size of the genets was calculated by measuring {{the distance between the}} furthermost <b>sporocarps</b> with somatically compatible mycelial cultures. 16 of the 27 identified genets displayed 2 or more <b>sporocarps.</b> The most extensive genet, as reflected by the tested <b>sporocarps,</b> was 1. 25 meters in diameter. The shortest distance between <b>sporocarps</b> from different genets was 32 cm. The results indicate that the population contains of relatively small, short-lived and spore established genets. A moderate but continuous disturbance by (preferably horse) grazing can maintain open sand bares that probably favour the establishment of new genets from spores. The size, age and life strategies of genets are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Marsileas {{are very}} easy to {{germinate}} from their <b>sporocarps.</b> However, the <b>sporocarps</b> must be abraded, cracked, or have an edge sliced off before submerging them in water so that the water can penetrate to swell the tissues, and germination is infrared-light dependent. Full sunlight is fine for this purpose.|$|R
25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{nitrogen}} eutrophication decreases the amount of carbon allocation to soil biota over longer periods of time. This can pose problems to the mycobionts, whose production of sporocarps later in the growing season is totally dependent upon the allocation of photosynthates from host plants. Unlike the major community shifts that can occur in <b>sporocarp</b> responses to nitrogen addition, root tips and soil hyphae respond in a considerably subtler manner in the short term. However, over longer periods of time, eutrophication can cause major shifts in the dominant fungi and dramatically alter belowground diversity.|$|E
500|$|The spores remain dormant {{inside the}} <b>sporocarp</b> through {{unfavorable}} conditions, but when conditions are suitable and wet, the <b>sporocarp</b> will germinate. [...] It splits into halves, allowing the tissue coiled inside to become hydrated. [...] As this internal tissue swells with water, it pushes the {{halves of the}} hard outer covering apart, and emerges as a long gelatinous worm-like sorophore. [...] The sorophore is a sorus-bearing structure unique to the Marsileaceae; it may extend to more than ten times {{the length of the}} <b>sporocarp</b> inside which it was coiled. [...] This extension carries the numerous spore-producing sori attached along each side of the sorophore out into the water.|$|E
500|$|The sporocarps are {{functionally}} and developmentally modified leaflets, {{although they}} have much shorter stalks than the vegetative leaflets. Inside the <b>sporocarp,</b> the modified leaflets bear several sori, each of which consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue (the indusium). [...] Each sorus includes a mix of two types of sporangium, each type producing only one of two kinds of spores. [...] Toward {{the center of each}} sorus and developing first are the megasporangia, each of which will produce a single large female megaspore. [...] Surrounding them {{at the edge of the}} sorus and developing later are the microsporangia, each of which will produce many small male microspores.|$|E
40|$|Mesophellia and Castorium {{are common}} hypogeous macrofungi in the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell.) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) forests of south‐western Australia. <b>Sporocarps</b> of Mesophellia and Castorium develop 5 ‐ 20 cm below {{the soil surface}} in close {{association}} with eucalypt roots. During differentiation of the <b>sporocarps,</b> eucalypt roots become trapped within the peridium where they branch profusely and form a dense ectomycorrhizal layer. Mature <b>sporocarps</b> of M. trabalis nom. ined. contain approximately S m of roots of 45 cm 2 surface area. Anatomical {{studies have shown that}} these roots have Hartig nets penetrating to the hypodermis and are similar to the superficial eucalypt ectomycorrhizas formed in soil and litter. The association of Mesophellia and Castorium <b>sporocarps</b> with tree roots suggests that these are important mycorrhizal fungi in forests of southern Australia...|$|R

40|$|Some Basidiomycetes exude latex, {{but very}} {{little is known about}} the nature of fungal latex. In this study, we {{examined}} the nature of latex in Lactarius Pers. 1797 spp. to clarify the role on fungivorous predation. In the field, we compared the degree of predation on taxonomically closely related latex-exuding Lactarius spp. and latex-non-exuding Russula Pers. 1796 spp. (Russulaceae) at developmental stages of <b>sporocarps.</b> We clarified that Russula spp. suffered more infestation than did Lactarius spp. at young and mature developmental stages, whereas Lactarius spp. did only at decaying stages. We measured the amount of latex exuded varied according to developmental stage and <b>sporocarps</b> parts in Lactarius spp. : mature <b>sporocarps</b> exuded more latex than did younger ones, while decaying <b>sporocarps</b> exuded the least, and the same patterns were observed at <b>sporocarps</b> parts: the amount of latex was more intense at hymenophore and cap than at stripe. At feeding experiments, three-band garden slugs Ambigolimax valentianus F´erussac, 1822 avoided feeding on sporophores of Lactarius spp. when they exuded latex, but fed on them when they did not. Our observations suggest that fungivores generally escape higher density of the latex at feeding using signs volatized by sporophores with exuding latex...|$|R
500|$|Like other ferns, {{members of}} the Marsileaceae produce spores, but not seeds when they reproduce. [...] Unlike other ferns, the spores in this family are {{produced}} inside sporocarps. [...] These are hairy, short-stalked, bean-shaped structures usually 3 to 8mm in diameter with a hardened outer covering. [...] This outer covering is tough and resistant to drying out, allowing the spores inside to survive unfavorable conditions such as winter frost or summer desiccation. [...] Despite this toughness, the sporocarps will open readily in water if conditions are favorable, and specimens have been successfully germinated after being stored for more than 130 years. [...] Each growing season, only one <b>sporocarp</b> typically develops per node along the rhizome near {{the base of the}} other leaf-stalks, though in some species of Marsilea there may be two or occasionally as many as twenty. [...] The resemblance of the sporocarps to peppercorns gives the family its common name of pepperwort.|$|E
500|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the Marsileaceae are the Salviniaceae, which are also aquatic and heterosporous. [...] However, both of these other fern families float freely {{on the surface of}} ponds or lakes instead of rooting in soil or mud. [...] The close relationship of these groups to the Marsileaceae is supported by both morphologic and molecular analysis, {{as well as by the}} discovery of an intermediate fossil named Hydropteris. [...] In general, the Salviniaceae and Azollaceae have a much better fossil record than the Marsileaceae. [...] Until recently, Rodeites dakshinii was the oldest fossil member known; it is a preserved <b>sporocarp</b> containing spores, found in Tertiary chert of India. [...] In 2000, the discovery of fossilized sporocarps from the Cretaceous of eastern North America was announced. [...] These fossils were assigned to the species Regnellidium upatoiensis, and pushed the known history of the Marsileaceae back into the Mesozoic. [...] The oldest fossil known for the Marsileaceae is Regnellites nagashimae from the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous of Japan. The fossils include leaves with visible veins, as well as sporocarps.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Sclerodermatineae is the diversity of morphologies within the group. The hymenomycete genera Boletinellus, Gyroporus, and Phlebopus are typical boletes with a cap and stipe. However, each of the gasteroid Sclerodermatineae has a distinct morphology. Species of Astraeus have an [...] "earthstar" [...] morphology where the outer peridium peels back in sections. The gleba of Pisolithus is partitioned into hundreds of membranous chambers. Scleroderma is a simple puffball with a thin outer skin and a powdery gleba at maturity. Diplocystis and Tremellogaster are each distinct in their morphologies: the former comprises compound fruit bodies each with 3–60 spore sacs crowded together, while the latter forms a roughly spherical <b>sporocarp</b> with a thick multi-layered peridium. Calostoma (Greek for [...] "pretty mouth") is morphologically distinct from other gasteroid members, having a fruit body that forms a globed, spore-bearing head composed of a three-layered peridium. About two-thirds of Sclerodermatineae species have a gasteroid morphology, although this may be an underestimate due {{to the existence of}} cryptic species that have yet to be formally described. For example, studies of the gasteroid genera Astraeus and Pisolithus indicate the existence of numerous cryptic taxa.|$|E

40|$|Objective of this diploma thesis was {{to select}} the most {{appropriate}} composition and thermal treatment of a substrate and the optimal temperature for planting {{and development of the}} <b>sporocarps</b> of mushrooms Pleurotus eryngii and Pleurotus nebrodensis. Within the objective of this thesis there was a hypothesis that different levels of the thermal treatment of a substrate {{have an impact on the}} colonization of such substrate by mycelium and subsequent crop of <b>sporocarps</b> Pleurotus eryngii and Pleurotus nebrodensis and that within those selected strains there can be found a strain which tolerates temperatures in a grow room above 15 °C. Straw pellets, beech sawdust, spruce sawdust and Douglas tree sawdust were selected as substrates for the growth of <b>sporocarps</b> P. eryngii and P. nebrodensis. Some substrates were enhanced by a wheat bran or coniferous sawdust was fermented without and with 5 % fugate. Obtained data were statistically processed using the Statistica (StatSoft) programme by the ANOVA method. Statistical assessment of results is presented graphically in the thesis. Results of the experiment proved that Pleurotus eryngii and Pleurotus nebrodensis have the highest growth of their <b>sporocarps</b> on the substrate from fermented coniferous sawdust with added fugate. The results further shown that the mushrooms had higher growth when they were on the substrate without a wheat bran compared to the substrate with a wheat bran, which was even more prone to its contamination. Optimal temperature for planting and development of the <b>sporocarps</b> Pleurotus eryngii was determined to be 12 - 15 °C. There were significant differences in the fructification of P. eryngii and P. nebrodensis which produced only minimal crop. Duration of a growing cycle of Pleurotus eryngii was 72 - 134 days. Development of <b>sporocarps</b> lasted 11 - 21 days...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was {{chemical}} analysis of polysaccharide fractions from <b>sporocarps</b> of Sarcodon imbricatus collected in natural sites and from the mycelium of in vitro cultures. Three polysaccharide fractions (FOI, FOII, FOIII) were isolated from <b>sporocarps</b> and two (FKI, FKII) from in vitro cultures. Qualitative analysis by HPLC method showed that they are composed of galactose and fucose (FOI, FKI) or glucose and fucose (FOII, FKII). FOIII fraction of the <b>sporocarps</b> consisted of glucose only. Molecular weights of isolated fractions ranged from 3. 8 to 16. 3 kDa for fractions from the <b>sporocarps</b> and from 5. 8 to 14. 7 kDa for that ones isolated from in vitro culture. The total percentage of sugar content for all fractions ranged from 97. 8 % to 99. 1 %. The percentage of uronic acids contents in acidic fractions was 2. 6 % and 2. 7 % for the FOI and FKI respectively.

40|$|In most ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{community}} studies involving molecular identification methods {{there is}} a poor cor-respondence between fungi that appear dominant as <b>sporocarps</b> and those that appear dominant on EM roots and the species richness belowground is higher than that above ground. As a consequence, many fungi from root tip samples remain unidentified. In most studies, genetic data from multiple samples of an EM morphotype collected from various sampling locations are compared to genetic data from one to a few <b>sporocarps</b> of each species for identification purposes. The mismatch between above- and belowground species richness {{may be influenced by}} these different sampling efforts.

40|$|The genus Astraeus (Diplocystidiaceae) forms ectomycorrhizal {{associations}} with many tree species {{and is a}} common gasteromycete in tropical and temperate ecosystems worldwide. In Thailand, Astraeus is most prevalent in deciduous dipterocarp-oak forest (DOF) {{in the north and}} north-east and its ecology is uniquely associated with fire. Rural villagers often burn the seasonally dry DOF ground vegetation causing significant environmental disturbance to promote the growth of Astraeus sporocraps—a local culinary delicacy and important source of household income. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether the practice of burning DOF stimulates the production of Astraeus <b>sporocarps</b> in DOF. Burned and unburned Astraeus habitat was surveyed over two years at two sites in Chiang Mai province and one site in Mae Hong Son province. Changes in soil fungi after a fire as well as vascular vegetation growing with Astraeus were studied. All <b>sporocarps</b> collected were identified as Astraeus odoratus. Astraeus <b>sporocarps</b> were found in both burned and unburned areas in 2010. In 2011, an unusually wet year, no <b>sporocarps</b> were found in burned or unburned areas. The top 2 cm of soil experienced high temperatures which killed fungi, but lower depths were well insulated from the heat. A wide range of vascular flora grew in Astraeus habitat, the most common tree species being Dipterocarpus tuberculatus var. tuberculatus and Dipterocarpus obtusifolius var. obtusifolius.
