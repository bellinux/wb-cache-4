5|$|ConnDOT {{plans call}} for the Kawasaki M8 to replace {{most or all of}} the {{locomotives}} and coaches currently in service on Shore Line East in 2018. ConnDOT has proposed to use up to 32 M8's in SLE service as far as Old Saybrook; the step-fitted diesel equipment will then be used on the Hartford Line and for New London / Mystic / Westerly service. Limited direct service from Grand Central Terminal to Old Saybrook may be added once the M8s are in <b>service.</b> <b>Testing</b> of M8 cars on the Shore Line East route began in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for <b>service</b> <b>testing</b> by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{their return}} to Kelly Field, both flights of the {{squadron}} were consolidated on 2 July 1921 and the last personnel from both detachments returned. The squadron was re-designated as an Attack squadron and received a Boeing GA-1 bi-motored tri-plane. It was designed especially to strafe ground troops while remaining immune to attack from the ground {{as well as from}} other enemy aircraft. However, it was found during <b>service</b> <b>testing</b> that it was so well armored its five-ton weight proved excessive.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this diploma thesis is web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI.

The guidance serves as a manual to web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The theoretical part of the thesis explains basic terms: <b>testing,</b> web <b>service</b> and methodology. This part is also devoted to the introduction of the SoapUI and Eclipse Process Framework Composer. The practical part of the thesis is focused on the methodology for web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> itself.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI tool, {{particularly}} on verification methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The main objective of this thesis is to verify the methodology. Specific goals include introduction to basic concepts and principles related to web services, {{a description of the}} testing process including types of the tests and specifics of <b>testing</b> web <b>services,</b> introduction of methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI, practical verification of the methodology on the real information system and a suggestion of how to adapt the methodology {{on the basis of the}} verification. The theoretical part summarizes basic knowledge of the web services technology and web <b>services</b> <b>testing.</b> Especially it is devoted to description of the methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI and to the introduction of the SoapUI tool. The practical part consists of the introduction of the test system in Česká pojišťovna, a. s. and Generali pojišťovna, a. s., where the methodology is verified. Next the methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI is verified. Based on this verification, there are suggestions of how to adapt or extend the methodology...|$|R
25|$|In early 1996, {{the first}} OH-1 {{prototype}} was rolled out. On 6 August 1996, {{the first of}} four OH-1 prototypes (designated XOH-1) performed the type's maiden flight. All four prototypes were flying by March 1997. The four prototypes were delivered to the Japanese Defence Agency for <b>service</b> <b>testing</b> from June to August 1997. By April 1998, flight testing of the prototypes was reportedly around half way complete, having accumulated a combined 400 flight hours during testing, further tests focused on flight validation, operational evaluation, and mission equipment functionality. These four prototype aircraft were all later remanufactured to conform to production standards and redelivered under new serial numbers to the JGSDF.|$|E
25|$|By 1 February 2007, 38 three-car {{sets were}} {{withdrawn}} due to continuing braking failures, meaning that {{almost half of}} the Siemens Nexas fleet (or around 10% of the total fleet) was out of revenue service. Amidst the media reporting an escalating problem with the risk of the entire fleet potentially having to be suspended, Siemens issued a statement on 31 January 2008 saying that they believed there had been no evidence during investigations of the braking failures that would require the entire fleet of trains to be withdrawn from <b>service.</b> <b>Testing</b> of affected trains was carried out on the Werribee line between Newport and Laverton, with soapy water sprayed onto the rails {{to increase the amount of}} wheel slip experienced, in an effort to replicate the brake fault. The entire fleet has now re-entered service, although with a restriction not to run single unit (3 car) operations.|$|E

2500|$|In May {{the group}} began its move to Army Air Base, Boise (later named Gowen Field). [...] Gowen {{was not ready}} for {{occupancy}} when the advance echelon arrived, so they were initially quartered at a National Guard armory near Boise, Idaho, named Camp Bonneville. By 4 June the group was assembled at Gowen Field. [...] By August the group received its first six Douglas B-18 Bolos {{and was able to}} begin flying training. [...] The group was notified in October that it would be equipped with the Martin B-26 Marauder. [...] Several crews were sent to Patterson Field, Ohio, where they participated in the <b>service</b> <b>testing</b> of the Marauder. [...] Once the testing was complete, the group began to pick up brand-new B-26s at the Martin plant.|$|E
2500|$|The first prototype, {{serial number}} N515 first flew at Castle Bromwich in late 1917, but {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} problems. The Puma engine, despite being ordered in large numbers, was unreliable and suffered from severe vibration, which considerably delayed <b>service</b> <b>testing.</b> The aircraft's layout, with the pilot sitting so far aft, gave him a poor view, and sitting [...] away from the Vickers gun, could no nothing to resolve any gun stoppage. When eventually formally tested, in August 1918, {{it proved to be}} heavier and carry fewer bombs than the private venture Sopwith B.1 of similar concept. The second prototype was abandoned before it was completed, and no orders were placed either for the Sunbeam or the Sopwith, which were incapable of defending themselves against attacking enemy fighters Existing two-seat aircraft such as the Airco DH.4 better met the RNAS's (and later the Royal Air Force's) requirements.|$|E
