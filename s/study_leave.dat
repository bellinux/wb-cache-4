On the voyages to and from England on the Orcades and , he wrote a book, Facing the Atomic Future (1956), in which he examined social, ethical and political issues surrounding nuclear power and nuclear weapons. He was a strong public advocate of nuclear power in Australia, writing letters to and articles in the Canberra Times. In 1979, he wrote that [...] "nuclear power is the cheapest, cleanest and safest method of power production yet devised by man", an argument he repeated in a second book, with Frank Robotham, titled Uranium, Energy Source of the Future?, in which he put the case for nuclear power.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the trace element distribution in atmospheric particles and leaves of some exposed plants in the environment was recently demonstrated. This indication {{would suggest that the}} trace element analysis of leaves in these plants could provide information about the composition, nature and origin of the atmospheric dust dispersed in the environment. In order to corroborate this hypothesis, the distribution of trace elements and Rare Earths were <b>studied</b> in <b>leaves</b> of some endemic plants, in the atmospheric fallout and in soils of rural, urban and industrial ecosystems in Sicily. These elements have been chosen to discriminate the source and nature of different source on atmospheric dust and the larger capability of the composition of the latter materials to influence the metal ion distribution in <b>leaves</b> of <b>studied</b> plants rather than the soil composition. These evidences are related to the recognition both of positive La anomaly and trace element enrichments in <b>studied</b> <b>leaves</b> and to their particular V/Th and Co/Ni signature. On the other hand, some particular normalised REE features recognised in leaves suggest that a limited contribution to the REE budget in <b>studied</b> <b>leaves</b> is provided by the REE migration from roots...|$|R
