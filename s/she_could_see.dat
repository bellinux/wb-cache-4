5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen {{what appeared to be a}} red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Catherine {{agreed to}} a {{commercial}} treaty with Great Britain in 1766, but stopped short of a full military alliance. Although <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the benefits of Britain's friendship, she was wary of Britain's increased power following its victory in the Seven Years' War, which threatened the European balance of power.|$|E
25|$|Gasparotto and Moduco {{would not}} be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had heard of a widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa. While she did not claim to be a benandante, she did claim that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> and {{communicate}} with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she had such an ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> {{the outline}} of his head silhouetted against the wind-tossed sky; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> his eyes, nor his lips, but she felt his nearness, and the {{happiness}} of that almost caused her to swoon.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{calculated}} {{she must}} have seen a thousand miners {{in less than two}} miles of the gulch, and then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> up the draws and washes that intersected the slope, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> beyond the camp.|$|R
60|$|Devine {{seemed to}} smile, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> him very well.|$|R
25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E
25|$|Webb {{wrote his}} first poems as a {{birthday}} present for his paternal grandmother when he was seven years old, {{under the tutelage of}} an aunt who died before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them in print. When Webb was 14 years old his much loved grandfather died. Webb's first major individual publication came with the appearance of 'Palace of Dreams' in The Bulletin (10 June 1942).|$|E
25|$|Black-and-white film in {{that era}} was {{sensitive}} to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted {{in some of the}} best steel factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> him. A pillar hid the chancel {{from her}} view.|$|R
60|$|<b>She?</b> What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>see,</b> save {{what all}} women see--that they only are real, {{and that all}} the rest are dreams.|$|R
60|$|He bowed low. It was as {{well that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> his face.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the ancient}} designations are still adhered to, in modern Shinto many priests also {{consider}} kami to be anthropomorphic spirits, with nobility and authority. One such {{example is the}} mythological figure Amaterasu-ōmikami, the sun goddess of the Shinto pantheon. Although these kami can be considered deities, they are not necessarily considered omnipotent or omniscient, and like the Greek Gods, they had flawed personalities and were quite capable of ignoble acts. In the myths of Amaterasu, for example, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the events of the}} human world, but had to use divination rituals to see the future.|$|E
25|$|As the Paroubeks {{were not}} Catholics but freethinkers, {{there were no}} prayers, and the service was read by Rudolf Jaromír Pšenka, editor of the Bohemian Chicago Daily Svornost. He spoke {{of the need to}} {{cooperate}} with police to find Elsie's killers. As the undertaker went to lift the coffin into the hearse, Karolina begged him to open it so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Elsie's face once more, but her relatives persuaded her not to insist on this and led her away. Most of the attendees followed Elsie's casket to Bohemian National Cemetery, where Pšenka gave another address.|$|E
25|$|Emma {{has decided}} to help Elsa search for Anna. The {{necklace}} leads them to the beach, but Anna is not there. Emma explains that magic is not always accurate, and {{that she needs to}} accept that Anna may no longer even be alive. Elsa weeps and wishes that she could know what happened to Anna and that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her again. Suddenly the necklace begins to glow. The necklace is revealed to be the Wishing Star. A trunk appears in the water and Anna and Kristoff emerge as Gerda's message in the bottle for her daughters appears ashore on the beach, but goes unnoticed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> his face, but {{his voice}} was steady and his manner earnest.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} speak. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> her lover, as if transfigured, limned dark against the looming red wall.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> how he felt, for he {{kept his}} face averted from her inquiring gaze.|$|R
25|$|On August 1, Greenlee asks David {{for help}} about her leg numbness. She tells David {{that she saw}} someone else besides herself, him and Gale, in the {{hospital}} room. He admits that there is someone {{in the room and}} that he will help her. However, she has to go with him to a clinic that is in Brazil. On August 2, Ryan tells Greenlee that he wants her to go to Brazil. On August 4, it was revealed that Greenlee lied about her leg numbness. The only reason she went with David was so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Leo. David injects her with something before leaving. When Greenlee wakes up, she sees Leo, laying on the hospital bed. On August 5, when Greenlee and Leo share a kiss, it turns out that Greenlee was dreaming; it is revealed that the person who was next to her was Zach. She is soon brought back from The Orpheus Project that David created.|$|E
25|$|Regina and Robin Hood {{go to the}} {{hospital}} ward to see Zelena. Zelena agrees to help if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the wand, but needs something meaningful to Emma so the spell will work. She also cannot use her magic unless Regina removes the cuff that is restricting Zelena's magic, so she asks her to remove it. Regina refuses. Later, at Granny's, Hook and Henry formulate a plan to release Zelena. However, their plan backfires, and Zelena breaks free from the cell, after cutting off her hand to remove the magic cuff. Zelena takes Robin captive and trades him for the wand, which she intends to use to return to Oz. As Zelena opens a portal, which {{takes the form of a}} cyclone and substantially drains her powers, Regina takes advantage of Zelena's weakened state to put the cuff back on her wrist, as well as to redirect the portal to take them to the Enchanted Forest, using Emma's blanket to locate her. The cyclone immediately heads towards Granny's diner, and transports everyone in the establishment to the location of Emma's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{felt the}} same. She {{was fond of}} Sybil, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her as the fore-ordained Mrs. Bailey.|$|R
60|$|He nodded, {{and though}} she had scored her point <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> that it had any {{material}} bearing after all.|$|R
60|$|The man {{drew his}} arm away. Though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>see</b> his face, {{he appeared to}} be looking down upon her gravely.|$|R
25|$|Yasuna's {{character}} changes {{between the}} manga and anime {{in regard to}} her level of devotion towards Hazumu and how much she {{is willing to do}} to be with her, especially after Hazumu's transformation into a girl. The first instance of this is when Yasuna confesses her love to Hazumu the first day she returns to school as a girl, but in the anime she does not confess to Hazumu after the change and in fact starts to avoid her. Similarly, during the time when Hazumu is shopping for her first bra, Yasuna shows up in the manga version and helps Hazumu into a very feminine bra, but in the anime it is Tomari who helps her try on her first bra. In episode three of the anime, Yasuna continues to avoid Hazumu despite still longing for her, and it takes an effort by Hazumu to restore their previous friendship, but Yasuna never once tries to avoid Hazumu in the manga; on the contrary, Yasuna tries to be around Hazumu as much as possible in the manga version. During the time when Yasuna holds a curry party in the manga, which is combined with the beach trip in episode seven of the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she wants all of Hazumu to herself and she invited the others to the party so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Hazumu's brightest smile. However, during the same scene in the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she invited Tomari and the others so that she could learn more about Hazumu and her likes and dislikes.|$|E
500|$|The inquest into Davison's death {{took place}} at Epsom on 10 June; Jones was not well enough to attend. Davison's half-brother, Captain Henry Davison, gave {{evidence}} about his sister, saying that she was [...] "a woman of very strong reasoning faculties, and passionately devoted to the women's movement". The coroner decided that, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, Davison had not committed suicide. The coroner also decided that, although she had waited until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the horses, [...] "from the evidence {{it was clear that the}} woman did not make for His Majesty's horse in particular". The verdict of the court was: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004 Josephson criticized an {{experiment}} by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> inside people's bodies using {{a special kind}} of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] to determine any effect.|$|E
60|$|His {{wife said}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> {{what he had}} to {{complain}} of. She was sure better-hearted children no man could have.|$|R
60|$|It {{was growing}} dark, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>see</b> his face. He hesitated, {{but he did}} not attempt to evade the question.|$|R
60|$|She {{picked up}} the dead bird and paddled towards the dim figure who was evidently wrestling with something, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> what.|$|R
500|$|... "Spending All My Time" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Shenmue {{wrote that the}} new mix for the album “fits the album's concept.” Selective Hearing's writer Nia felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the song alongside [...] "Enter the Sphere" [...] and [...] "Party Maker" [...] “blasting in a club, {{but there are also}} some surprisingly calm tracks on the album. It’s kind of like a series of crescendos and decrescendos”. Ian Martin, who had written their extended biography at Allmusic, had highlighted the song as an album standout and career standout. Patrick St. Michael, writing for The Japan Times, said the composition wasn't an “improvement” but commented that it was “simple, catchy pop”. A writer from CDJournal had favored the production and composition, comparing it to Western music.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Michael Howard, a {{young man}} {{interested}} in witchcraft and the occult wrote to Montalban after reading one of her articles in Prediction; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the [...] "Mark of Cain" [...] in his aura. She invited {{him to become a}} student of the ONS, which he duly did. Over the coming year, he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what she called a [...] "magical mystery tour" [...] to the West Country, visiting Stonehenge, Boscastle and Tintagel. In 1969, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, something she disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently [...] "hit a stormy period" [...] with the pair going [...] " [...] own ways for several years." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{then started}} taking LSD {{on a regular}} basis, {{as well as his}} daily use of cannabis. After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the change taking place in her husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to just eat it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E
