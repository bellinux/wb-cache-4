500|$|Although Clements and Musker had {{originally}} intended to hire animator Glen Keane to animate Ursula due to his history of animating Disney villains, Keane specifically requested that he be allowed to animate Ariel after hearing Benson sing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the first time. Captivated by her performance, he {{decided to make the}} scene his most important assignment, volunteering to animate the entire [...] "Part of Your World" [...] musical sequence himself and becoming its lead animator. Animating one particular scene to appear as though the camera is rotating around Ariel while she sings [...] "Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?" [...] was particularly challenging for the animators to perfect without the aid of computer animation, taking them considerably longer to complete. Keane described the song as the moment [...] "the audience starts thinking of Ariel as this real, living thing. A girl who's dreaming of something more.

500|$|The {{content of}} Illmatic is also {{informed}} by notions of artistic authenticity. The promotional press sheet {{that accompanied the}} album's release implied Nas’s refusal to conform to commercial trends, stating: “While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot.” At {{the time of the}} album's release, the hip hop community was embroiled in a debate about artistic authenticity and commercialism in popular music. Rapper Common, describes in the preface to Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic the concerns that were felt by him and his contemporaries: “It was that serious for <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We didn’t just grow up with hip hop; we grew up with hip-hop as hip-hop was also growing, and so that made for a very close and intimate relationship that was becoming more and more urgent – and we felt it.

[...] The Post called for extending statutes of limitations in sex-abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote that Hastert's case underscored the danger that comes with the [...] "quickness and frequency with which <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude," [...] noting that Hastert's public displays of Christian faith during his time in office were [...] "a factor in his colleagues' assessments of him as safe, uncontroversial."

2500|$|As Carol Polsgrove {{has shown}} in Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause, Padmore {{and his allies}} in the 1930s and 1940s—among them C. L. R. James, Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta, the Gold Coast's Kwame Nkrumah and South Africa's Peter Abrahams—saw {{publishing}} as a strategy for political change. They published small periodicals, which were sometimes seized by authorities {{when they reached the}} colonies. They published articles in other people's periodicals, for instance, the Independent Labour Party's New Leader. They published pamphlets. They wrote letters to the editor; and, thanks to the support of publisher Fredric Warburg (of Secker & Warburg), they published books. Warburg brought out Padmore's Africa and World Peace (1937), as well as books by both Kenyatta and James. In a Foreword to Africa and World Peace, Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps wrote: [...] "George Padmore has performed another great service of enlightenment in this book. The facts he discloses so ruthlessly are undoubtedly unpleasant facts, the story which he tells of the colonization of Africa is sordid in the extreme, but both the facts and the story are true. We have, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> been brought up in the atmosphere of 'the white man's burden', and have had our minds clouded and confused by the continued propaganda for imperialism that we may be almost shocked by this bare and courageous exposure of the great myth of the civilizing mission of western democracies in Africa." [...] The Biographical Note on the cover describes Padmore as European correspondent for the Pittsburgh Courier, Gold Coast Spectator, African Morning Post, Panama Tribune, Belize Independent and Bantu World.|$|E

500|$|Consequently, {{there was}} a demand for bootleg {{recordings}} of the band. The most notorious of these was an LP entitled H Bomb, recorded at Aachen on 11 July 1970, {{which led to a}} subsequent court case when Virgin Records' Richard Branson was prosecuted for selling it. An article in Melody Maker that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that H Bomb was the best selling one at that time. This success, along with albums from other artists such as the Who's Live at Leeds and the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out convinced the band that an official live album would be commercially successful.

5000|$|The {{death of}} Acharya Narendra Dev is {{something}} much bigger for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and, I think, {{for the country}} than just the passing away of an important person.

It is that we have gone on still further, and are beyond that desolation. Never more shall we return to those who gather under the cross. By faith we disbelieved and denied.

40|$|Annual Report (2004) of the Econometric Institute, Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University RotterdamThe year 2004 {{has been}} a year of extremes. The Erasmus School of Economics faced large deficits, and also the Econometric Institute had its share. For {{the first time in}} many years, {{temporary}} contracts could not be continued. Even some full time positions were cancelled or their requirements were changed. The new focus of the School (starting from 2005 onwards) dismissed a strong emphasis on mathematics and statistics as research areas, and it embraced areas as finance, marketing and economics in general. Much to our relief, it turned out that the focus of our Institute had already been diversified to these areas, <b>so</b> for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> only few changes were required. On the other hand, our Institute kept its high level of teaching, culminating in being awarded the best programme in the country, and also <b>many</b> <b>of</b> its members kept their substantial research achievements at the usual top level. We had many visitors, reports and publications, and our conference participation was high. We also saw our first successful entries in the leading business and management journals, while maintaining a high level of contributions to the core journals in management science and econometrics. The year 2004 has been tough, for all <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> but without any doubt, I can say that we made it through. We have seen that even in hard times, the members of our Institute stand together, and there are many reasons to believe that we will continue to do so...|$|R

Although this sounds similar to a spam filtering problem, we wanted to consider all major forms of electronic communication: phone, email, and Facebook. Furthermore, this type of classification is highly individual, compared to spam filtering, so one’s own communications provide the best source for training data. Using Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers trained on a sizeable set of communication metadata, cross-validation showed that the algorithms performed decently on these different sources, achieving a best accuracy around 84 % for Facebook data, 89 % for cellular data, and 98. 5 % for email data. These data sources appear to be weakly correlated, and so it is difficult to improve classification accuracy by linking various communications using an address book...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{therapists}} {{are turning}} {{more and more}} to nature’s worst in a desperate bid to overcome the extensive failures. The <b>US</b> National Institutes <b>of</b> Health Report by a special panel in 1995 already deplored the lack of basic research and disregard of the risks involved, and expressed concern that scientists have been overselling gene therapy. Little seems to have changed since. Angela Ryan reports on the continuing fiasco of attempts to genetic engineer human beings. Last month’s New Scientist reported the combination of two notorious killer viruses, HIV and Ebola [1], in an attempt to find an effective gene therapy vector for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. When this work was presented at a scientific meeting the audience laughed out loud. Gene therapy is targeted at virtually every ill known to human beings, especially those inhabiting the first world, including pain relief, cosmetic hair replacement and muscle building. Massive investment has gone in but no clinical efficacy has ever been proven, despite anecdotal claims of success. Last year in the US, gene therapy clinical trials ground to a halt amid scandalous reports of deaths and conflicts of interest [2]. The <b>US</b> National Institutes <b>of</b> Health (NIH) set up a special telephone hot line for victims that counted 652 cases of serious adverse events along with six unexplained deaths. Effects included high fevers, infections and severe changes in blood pressure, all of which went previously unreported to the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). David Baltimore, Nobel laureate and president of Caltech, agene therapy based biotech company, said " I disagree we’ve had any benefit from gene therapy trials <b>so</b> far, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are now asking, what the hell are we doing putting these things into people?"
