40|$|PURPOSE: {{although}} {{laparoscopic surgery}} {{for the treatment}} of colorectal diseases represents a major advance, it is currently performed in {{less than a third of}} patients undergoing colectomies. The aim of this study is to analyze the initial results of laparoscopic-assisted colorectal surgeries (LACS) performed in a department of Coloproctology in a tertiary hospital, as well as to study the impact of age, gender and body mass index (BMI) and use of ultrasonic scissors or vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>devices</b> in relation to conversion rate. METHODS: this is a prospective observational study with 215 patients who underwent LACS between January 2006 and June 2010 in the Department of Coloproctology at Felicio Rocho Hospital, Belo Horizonte. The data obtained from a specific electronic database included demographics, diagnosis, use of ultrasonic scissors or vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>devices,</b> reason for conversion, duration of hospitalization, lymph node harvest in cancer specimens, complications, and deaths. RESULTS: the laparoscopic-assisted approach corresponded to 36. 4 % of all colorectal surgeries performed during the study period. Most patients were female (74 %), with a mean age of 53. 2 years. Ultrasonic scissors or vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>devices</b> were used in 32 % of LACS. Specimen extraction and anastomosis were performed through an auxiliary incision in most cases. The overall conversion rate was 12 %, with a decrease of 47 % after the first year. We did not observe any association between conversion rate and age, gender, BMI, and the use of ultrasonic scissors and vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>devices.</b> The average hospital stay was of 7. 7 days and the overall rate of complications was 20 %, including 10 anastomotic leaks (4. 65 %). The rate of postoperative mortality was 1. 86 %. CONCLUSIONS: despite the difficulties related to the learning curve and unavailability of ultrasonic scissors or vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>devices</b> in most cases, the implementation of LACS in our department can be considered successful in relation to short-term results and conversion rates...|$|R

Patients and Methods: Altogether 59 patients undergoing elective lung surgery ex-cept pneumonectomy between February 2001 and April 2002 were prospectively rand-omized to receive postoperative pleural drainage by 28 F chest tube(s) attached to un-derwater <b>seal</b> <b>device</b> placed on negative pressure of 15 cm of water or flutter valve drain-age bag. Following withdrawal of four patients from the study, 55 patients were evalu-ated (31 patients in the underwater <b>seal</b> <b>device</b> group and 24 patients in the flutter valve drainage bag group). Results: In the conventional underwater <b>seal</b> <b>device</b> group the mean drainage time was 2. 6 (SD ± 2. 0) days and in the flutter valve drainage bag group the mean drainage time was 3. 3 days (SD ± 4. 0); difference – 0. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 2. 4 to 0. 9. The mean length of hospitalization in the surgical ward was 3. 6 (SD ± 2. 7) and 4. 1 (SD ± 4. 4) days respectively (difference – 0. 5, 95 % CI – 2. 5 to 1. 4). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that flutter valve drainage system is a safe and feasible alternative in managing postoperative air leaks and haemorrhage af-ter lung surgery other than pneumonectomy if air leaks are not extremely massive.

40|$|Abstract: Duett™, a novel {{vascular}} <b>sealing</b> <b>device,</b> {{was first}} clinically used in July 1997. A European multi-center registry {{was established to}} evaluate the safety and procedural success of the Duett ™ <b>sealing</b> <b>device</b> in {{a broad range of}} patients un-dergoing diagnostic or interventional endovascular proce-dures. At 25 European sites 1587 patients were enrolled. All pa-tients (‡ 18 years) must have given informed consent {{for the use of the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>device</b> after a diagnostic and/or interventio-nal endovascular procedure performed via a femoral arterial approach. Standard length (≤ 10 cm) 5 to 9 F introducer sheaths had to be used. An ACT of ≤ 400 s, and any approved GP IIb/IIIa platelet receptor antagonist was permitted. Successful deployment could be achieved in 96. 2 % (1526 / 1587 patients) with complete hemostasis within 2 to 5 minutes in over 95 % of the patients. The complication-free rate was 96. 4 %. Arterial occlusions were rare (4 patients) and successfully treated with surgical repair in 1 and with throm-bolysis in 3 patients. Pseudoaneurysms occurred in 34 pa-tients, the majority (30 / 34) were successfully treated with ul-trasound-guided compression or resolved spontaneously. The total rate of major complications was 2. 6 % (41 / 1587). The final results of the European registry demonstrate that the Duett ™ <b>sealing</b> <b>device</b> can be used with a high procedural success following diagnostic and interventional endovascular procedures. The incidence of major complications is low and comparable to all other approved vascular closure devices and manual compression. CE-mark certification was ap-proved at the end of 1998.

40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{splenectomy}} (LS) {{became the}} first procedure of choice in the years of 90 in many institutions. Initially staplers were used to ligate hilar vessels. Recently harmonic scalpels are being used for dissection and ligations. Here we present our experience with vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>device</b> (Ligasure) during whole procedures of dissection in laparoscopic splenectomy. Material and Methods: Between June 2006 and September 2007, 25 children (8 girls and 17 boys) aged 1 - 16 years were hospitalized for laparoscopic splenectomy. Results: Indications for splenectomy were idiopatic thrombocytopenic purpura (n= 10), hereditary spherocytosis (n= 6), thalassemia (n= 8) and autoimmun hemolitic anemia (n= 1). Ultrasonograpically measured spleen length varied between 80 and 192 mm. Three trocars were used for 16 patiens, but a fourth trocar was needed in nine patients. Vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>device</b> was used for sealing and cutting of all vascular structures. Staplers or suture ligation were not necessary. Spleen was put into the retrieval bag and removed from the umbilical trocar site after fragmentation with an ovary forceps. In four patients conversion to open surgery was made because of problems in dissection in two patients, bleeding in one and hypercarbia in another patient although the diseection was completed. Splenic sizes were larger than the sizes given by ultrasonograpy. Operative time was between 45 and 240 minutes (mean 154. 6 minutes). No complication developed except one patient who suffered pleural effusion. Patients were discharged in mean 4. 04 (2 - 12) days. Conclusion: In LS as a gold standart in elective splenecyomy, use of vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>device</b> (Ligasure) {{has a lot of}} advantages including higher comfort provided to the surgeon, reduction in bleeding and thus providing a good view, acceptable decreased length of operation time, being effective and safe method to be applied in children undergoing elective splenectomy...|$|E

Advanced vessel <b>sealing</b> <b>devices</b> provide an alternative to the conventional clamp and tie technique. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the outcome of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for substernal goitre using Ligasure Small Jaw, Harmonic Focus, or conventional technique. Methods Between 2011 and 2014, from a population of 393 patients undergoing surgery for thyroid disease, 75 (49 females, 26 males, mean age: 57. 9 years; range: 28 – 83 years) underwent total thyroidectomy by the same surgeon for substernal goitre. Patients were divided into three groups: group A (n =  26) in which total thyroidectomy was performed using conventional technique; group B (n =  22), and group C (n =  27) in which total thyroidectomy was performed using Ligasure Small Jaw and Harmonic Focus, respectively. Operative time, time to drain removal, hospitalization and morbidity (hypoparathyroidism, vocal cord palsy, haemorrhage, seroma, other) were analyzed. Results Mean duration of surgery was 136. 5  ±  26. 7  min in group A vs 110. 5  ±  24. 8 in B, and 101. 6  ±  25. 4 in C, with significant statistical differences between A vs B (p <  0. 005) and C (p <  0. 0001). There was no mortality. The overall morbidity was 29. 3 %. There was no significant difference in time to drain removal, postoperative hospitalization, and morbidity among the three groups.
