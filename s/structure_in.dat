40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of tactile corpuscle-like <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> Schwannomas, Neurofibromas and Neuroid Intradermal Melanocytic Nevi is well-documented. We report a case describing the {{presence of}} such <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> the lamina propria of grossly normal gastric mucosa. Case presentation A 30 year-old male underwent esophagogastrectomy for carcinoma. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections reveal tactile corpuscle-like <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> the mucosa adjacent to the main tumor mass. Conclusion This is a rare phenomenon and a literature search revealed only one paper describing such <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> the benign colonic mucosa of a colectomy done for carcinoma. We did not come across any cases in the literature describing such <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> gastrointestinal specimen resected {{for reasons other than}} carcinoma. To our knowledge this would be the first case reporting the existence of tactile corpuscles-like <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> gastric mucosa. </p...|$|R
