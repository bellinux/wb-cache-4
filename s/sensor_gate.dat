40|$|This paper {{describes}} an alternate experimental technique to deposit the polycrystalline silicon (Poly-Si) thin film for the fabrication of diffused piezoresistors. In this process the deposition of poly-Si film (2000 &Aring;) {{was carried out}} using e-Beam evaporation metho high vacuum with controlled deposition rate on the bed of oxidized p-type Si &lt; 100 &gt; wafers. The grain size of Poly-Si was analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), which {{is found to be}} around 45 to 50 nm. The thermal doping of boron was performed at different temperature for fixed time in a horizontal quartz furnace. The sheet resistance of all samples was measured using four probe techniques. The sheet resistance of deposited film decreases continuously with doping temperature, which itself describes like the conventional polysilicon nature. The diffused piezoresistors were fabricated and their measured values are analyzed and reported in this paper. The developed experimental process provides a sufficient yield, low cost and highly repeatability in the realization of polysilicon film while developed technology for diffused resistors is useful in the fabrication of electronic <b>sensor,</b> <b>gate</b> metal in CMOS process and so on...|$|E

40|$|Hyperpolarization-activated (pacemaker) {{channels}} are dually gated by negative voltage and intracellular cAMP. Kinetics of native cardiac f-{{channels are}} not compatible with HH gating, and require closed/open multistate models. We verified {{that members of}} the HCN channel family (mHCN 1, hHCN 2, hHCN 4) also have properties not complying with HH gating, such as sigmoidal activation and deactivation, activation deviating from fixed power of an exponential, removal of activation “delay” by preconditioning hyperpolarization. Previous work on native channels has indicated that the shifting action of cAMP on the open probability (Po) curve can be accounted for by an allosteric model, whereby cAMP binds more favorably to open than closed channels. We therefore asked whether not only cAMP-dependent, but also voltage-dependent gating of hyperpolarization-activated channels could be explained by an allosteric model. We hypothesized that HCN channels are tetramers and that each subunit comprises a voltage sensor moving between “reluctant” and “willing” states, whereas voltage <b>sensors</b> are independently <b>gated</b> by voltage, channel closed/open transitions occur allosterically. These hypotheses led to a multistate scheme comprising five open and five closed channel states. We estimated model rate constants by fitting first activation delay curves and single exponential time constant curves, and then individual activation/deactivation traces. By simply using different sets of rate constants, the model accounts for qualitative and quantitative aspects of voltage gating of all three HCN isoforms investigated, and allows an interpretation of the different kinetic properties of different isoforms. For example, faster kinetics of HCN 1 relative to HCN 2 /HCN 4 are attributable to higher HCN 1 voltage sensors' rates and looser voltage-independent interactions between subunits in closed/open transitions. It also accounts for experimental evidence that reduction of sensors' positive charge leads to negative voltage shifts of Po curve, with little change of curve slope. HCN voltage gating thus involves two processes: voltage <b>sensor</b> <b>gating</b> and allosteric opening/closing...|$|R

40|$|Mechanosensitive (MS) {{channels}} are ubiquitous molecular force sensors that {{respond to a}} number of different mechanical stimuli including tensile, compressive and shear stress. MS {{channels are}} also proposed to be molecular curvature <b>sensors</b> <b>gating</b> in response to bending in their local environment. One of the main mechanisms to functionally study these channels is the patch clamp technique. However, the patch of membrane surveyed using this methodology is far from physiological. Here we use continuum mechanics to probe the question of how curvature, in a standard patch clamp experiment, at different length scales (global and local) affects a model MS channel. Firstly, to increase the accuracy of the Laplace’s equation in tension estimation in a patch membrane {{and to be able to}} more precisely describe the transient phenomena happening during patch clamping, we propose a modified Laplace’s equation. Most importantly, we unambiguously show that the global curvature of a patch, which is visible under the microscope during patch clamp experiments, is of negligible energetic consequence for activation of an MS channel in a model membrane. However, the local curvature (RL < 50) and the direction of bending are able to cause considerable changes in the stress distribution through the thickness of the membrane. Not only does local bending, in the order of physiologically relevant curvatures, cause a substantial change in the pressure profile but it also significantly modifies the stress distribution in response to force application. Understanding these stress variations in regions of high local bending is essential for a complete understanding of the effects of curvature on MS channels...|$|R

40|$|Voltage-dependent ion {{channels}} transduce {{changes in}} the membrane electric field into protein rearrangements that gate their transmembrane ion permeation pathways. While certain molecular elements of the voltage <b>sensor</b> and <b>gates</b> have been identified, {{little is known about}} either the nature of their conformational rearrangements or about how the voltage sensor is coupled to the gates. We used voltage clamp fluorometry to examine the voltage sensor (S 4) and pore region (P-region) protein motions that underlie the slow inactivation of the Shaker K+ channel. Fluorescent probes in both the P-region and S 4 changed emission intensity in parallel with the onset and recovery of slow inactivation, indicative of local protein rearrangements in this gating process. Two sequential rearrangements were observed, with channels first entering the P-type, and then the C-type inactivated state. These forms of inactivation appear to be mediated by a single gate, with P-type inactivation closing the gate and C-type inactivation stabilizing the gate's closed conformation. Such a stabilization was due, at least in part, to a slow rearrangement around S 4 that stabilizes S 4 in its activated transmembrane position.

40|$|Voltage-gated ion {{channels}} play fundamental {{roles in}} neural excitability and thus dysfunctional channels can cause disease. Understanding how the voltage-sensor of these channels activate and inactivate could potentially be useful in future drug design of compounds targeting neuronal excitability. The opening and closing of the pore in voltage-gated ion channels {{is caused by the}} arginine-rich S 4 helix of the voltage sensor domain (VSD) moving in response to an external potential. Exactly how this movement is accomplished is not yet fully known and an area of hot debate. In this thesis I study how the opening and closing in voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels occurs. Recently, both experimental and computational results have pointed to the possibility of a secondary structure transition from α- to 3 (10) -helix in S 4 being {{an important part of the}} gating. First, I show that the 3 (10) -helix structure in the S 4 helix of a Kv 1. 2 - 2. 1 chimera protein is significantly more favorable compared to the α-helix in terms of a lower free energy barrier during the gating motion. Additional I suggest a new gating model for S 4, moving as sliding 310 -helix. Interestingly, the single most conserved residue in voltage- gated ion channels is a phenylalanine located in the hydrophobic core and directly facing S 4 causing a barrier for the gating charges. In a second study, I address the problem of the energy barrier and show that mutations of the phenylalanine directly alter the free energy barrier of the open to closed transition for S 4. Mutations can either facilitate the relaxation of the voltage-sensor or increase the free energy barrier, depending on the size of the mutant. These results are confirmed by new experimental data that supports that a rigid, cyclic ring at the phenylalanine position is the determining rate-limiting factor for the voltage <b>sensor</b> <b>gating</b> process.
