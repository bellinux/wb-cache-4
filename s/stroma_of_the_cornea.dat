5000|$|CSK is immune-mediated in nature, {{characterized}} by an infiltration of white blood cells into the superficial <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b> These cells are predominantly CD4-expressing T lymphocytes {{and to a lesser}} extent CD8-expressing T cells. [...] The CD4-expressing T-cells secrete gamma interferon, which causes expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in the cells of the cornea. These class II molecules cause further inflammation by interacting with the T cells and triggering an immune response. [...] Ultraviolet light is important in the genesis of the disease which is seen at higher prevalence at elevated altitude and has a seasonal variation with most cases occurring in the summer. There is likely also a genetic component to the cause of CSK due to its predominance in certain breeds.|$|E

Methods: We examined seven fungal keratitis patients prospectively. All yeast was identified by molecular phylogenetic analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chromosomal regions coding for the D 1 /D 2 domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large-subunit 26 S ribosomal RNA gene. All filamentous fungi were identified by <b>the</b> sequencing <b>of</b> internal transcribed spacers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribosomal DNA gene regions. Approximately 0. 1 mL of voriconazole diluted with saline to 1. 0 % was injected with a 30 -gauge needle inserted obliquely into the three to five clear <b>cornea</b> sites around <b>the</b> abscess. All subjects were administered natamycin ointment and oral itraconazole. When needed, intravenous micafungin, voriconazole, and/or intracameral voriconazole were added. Clinical courses were observed by the slit lamp microscope. Histopathology was examined when <b>the</b> <b>corneas</b> were removed. Results: All cases that were caused by yeast healed quickly after injections. Two cases of keratitis caused by Fusarium, and one case caused by Aspergillus, did not heal completely. In the Fusarium cases, additional antifungal medications (3. 0 % topical voriconazole and intravenous injection of micafungin) were needed. After optical penetrating keratoplasty in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases, fungi were found in <b>the</b> deep <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> removed <b>cornea.</b> In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Aspergillus keratitis, pathological findings also showed fungi deep in <b>the</b> <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> removed <b>cornea</b> and <b>the</b> keratitis recurred after therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty.

40|$|Purpose : Morphological {{examination}} of {{the efficiency of the}} influence of various doses of riboflavin-UV induced crosslinking {{on the state of the}} corneal stroma in experimental animals. Methods : In the work were used rabbits males breed Chinchilla mass of 1. 5 - 2. 0 kg. the experiment was conducted on 20 eyes of 10 animals, which performed the routine crosslinking. Experimental animals, depending on the power UV-laser irradiation, were divided into 4 groups: the animals of the 1 group with the minimum intensity of radiation (30 minutes, 0. 27 J), animals 2 group with medium intensity of radiation (15 minutes, 0. 34 J)), animals 3 groups with high intensity of radiation (30 minutes, 0. 34 J)), the control group 4 (without UV-radiation). Date of dynamic observation of the experimental animals was 5 days, after which the animals were taken out of the experiment. Morphological investigations were carried out by means of light and electron microscopy. Results : In groups of experimental animals with the impact of riboflavin UV-radiation in the <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> were found the appearance of the areas of cross-stitched collagen fibers and fibrils. In the zone of the crosslinking were found activated keratoblasts. Near the membranes of these cells the contents of the vacuoles are released and filaments finish building of the collagen fibers. the epithelium of the corneas of all experimental animals recovered fully, with no morphological signs of endothelial damage has been found. Electron-microscopic investigation of stroma of corneas of the experimental animals of the control group after the experiment showed the presence of keratocytes in an inactive form and collagen fibers of stroma, packed in the form of plates or beams with a characteristic orientation.

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} the molecular defects in the TGFBI gene in a Chinese family {{with an unusual}} phenotype of Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD). Methods: Three generations of the family with RBCD {{were enrolled in the}} present study. In addition to ophthalmologic examinations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and nucleotide sequencing of exons of TGFBI were performed. Exon 14 was also sequenced in 100 healthy controls unrelated to the family for comparison. Results: The clinical features of the disease were characterized by geographic opacities in the anterior to mid <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b> Molecular genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous point mutation at exon 14 (c. 1915 G>A) in all affected members of the family. The unusual opacities involving the anterior to mid-cornea stroma were different from the phenotypic features of families previously reported to have the same genetic change.

METHODS: A detailed ocular examination {{was taken for}} all participants of a LCD family. Peripheral blood leukocytes from each participant were extracted to obtain the DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of all seventeen exons of TGFBI gene was performed. The products were sequenced and analyzed. Histological examination was carried out after a penetrating keratoplasty from <b>the</b> right eye <b>of</b> proband. RESULTS: Genetic analysis showed that the proband and all 6 affected individuals harbored both a heterozygous CGC to TGC mutation at codon 124 and a heterozygous GCC to GAC mutation at codon 546 of TGFBI. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 100 control subjects and unaffected family members was positive for these two mutations.

METHODS: <b>The</b> central <b>cornea</b> <b>of</b> 51 eyes of 29 {{subjects with}} keratoconus was observed using a slit-lamp biomicroscope, slit-scanning confocal microscope (TOMEY Confoscan 1), and corneal topographer (EyeSys 2000). RESULTS: Alternating {{dark and light}} bands were seen in <b>the</b> stromal images <b>of</b> 23 eyes examined. The bands corresponded with <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> Vogt striae on slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination. Bands were found most commonly in the posterior stroma. Posterior bands varied in width, ran mainly in a nearly vertical direction, and appeared to run a straight course through individual image frames. Keratocyte nuclei were located in between the bands. Posterior keratocyte density was unaffected by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> bands. Nerve fibers appeared to run a straight course through the bands. When present, bands in the anterior stroma showed greater variability in width and direction within a single frame.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the density and {{spatial distribution of}} estradiol, progesterone and androgen receptors in corneal cryosections. Methods: Bovine corneas including the limbus were cryoprotected and snap frozen using isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections of 10 µm thickness were prepared and subjected to antibodies raised against receptors for estradiol, progesterone and androgen at dilutions of 1 : 10, 1 : 50 and 1 : 100 respectively. Staining was visualised using a Mouse ExtraAvidin® Peroxidase Staining Kit and nuclei were counterstained with bisbenzimide. Results: Assessment of tissue sections demonstrated immunostaining for estradiol, progesterone, and androgen receptors in the epithelium and in the keratocytes. Staining for all three receptors was nuclear and was detected in the limbal and peripheral regions of the cornea in both basal and suprabasal cell layers. With respect to the central corneal regions immunostaining was more diffuse within the cell layers. Immunostaining for all receptors was nuclear in the keratocytes throughout the corneal stroma. Conclusions: Estradiol, progesterone and androgen receptors {{are present in the}} epithelium and the <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> and may be influenced by their ligands that we have previously identified in the tear film.

Materials and methods: Ten cadaver corneas were used in this study. During use, all were affixed in an artificial chamber. Thermal delivery entailed a continuous wave laser at 2013 nm wavelength, approximately 650 mW power under scanner control (about 3 mm/sec linear draw speed), with a planoconcave sapphire applanation lens cooled to 8 &deg;C. Group 1 (n = 5, myopic treatment) eyes were exposed to three concentric annuli with diameters of 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm. Group 2 (n = 5, hyperopic treatment) eyes were exposed to three concentric annuli with diameters of 6 mm, 7 mm, and 8 mm. The clinical change in shape of the cornea was visualized immediately under a slit-lamp. A transepithelial higher fluence corneal collagen cross-linking step followed each thermal treatment, comprising 0. 1 % riboflavin drops with 0. 02 % benzalkonium chloride and 0. 2 % carboxymethlycellulose in deuterated water (D 2 O) applied on the epithelium corneal surface for 10 minutes. Next, each cornea was exposed to 10 mW/cm 2 of ultraviolet A (365 nm) light for 10 minutes. The corneas were evaluated before and after thermal remodeling and cornea collagen cross-linking for corneal topography, corneal optical coherence tomography, cornea Scheimpflug tomography, and clinical photographs. Results: The histopathology effect was noted clinically as concentric white rings underneath the epithelium and Bowman&# 39;s membrane, with the lesion depth extending down to 400 &micro;m in the mid <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b> This was confirmed by corneal anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The topographic change noted was a 4 &ndash; 8 diopter hyperopic shift in group 1 and a 2 &ndash; 6 diopter myopic shift in group 2.

40|$|Background: Retinoblastomas {{account for}} 4 % of {{malignancies}} in children, 1 - 2 % {{of which are}} diffuse infiltrating retinoblastomas. Diffuse anterior retinoblastoma is rare and does not involve the retina. Here, we report on a diffuse anterior retinoblastoma with large sarcoidosis-like nodules on the iris that were responsive to anti-inflammatory therapy. Case: We present a 6 -year-old girl who had anterior uveitis with white nodules on the iris and posterior surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> in her right eye. The nodules initially responded well to anti-inflammatory treatment. However, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) showed that the nodules gradually grew, shrinking the iris.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE. <b>The</b> <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{developing}} <b>cornea</b> is {{a highly}} organized extracellular matrix formed essentially by uniform, small-diameter collagen fibrils with constant interfibrillar spacing. Unlike <b>the</b> fibrillogenesis <b>of</b> chicken <b>cornea,</b> <b>the</b> assembly and maturation of human corneal fibrils have been poorly investigated. In the current study, the authors aimed to ascertain the heterotypic organization (collagens I and V) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human corneal fibrils at the supramolecular level. To gain more insight into <b>the</b> molecular structure <b>of</b> collagen V, its cellular source, {{and its role in}} fibrillogenesis, the authors used cultured human corneal fibroblasts. METHODS. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> human corneal <b>stroma</b> after brief homogenization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tissue was analyzed by immunogold labeling using specific polyclonal antibodies and rotary shadowing. Biochemical, electron microscopic, and immunolabeling approaches were used to investigate the collagen fibril formation and the extracellular matrix synthesis using human corneal fibroblasts grown in culture as a model system. RESULTS. The authors showed that in human corneal stroma, collagen I is distributed uniformly along the striated fibrils, in contrast to collagen V, which could be identified only at sites at which the fibrils partially were disrupted. Rotary shadowing observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homogenate revealed that collagen VI, a major component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>cornea,</b> was associated closely with the collagen fibril surface. Corneal fibroblasts synthesize and deposit a collagenous matrix with fibrils resembling those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>cornea</b> in appearance and collagen composition. Biochemical data indicate that a high concentration (20 % to 30 %) of collagen V is synthesized by stromal fibroblasts and that collagen V molecules are processed similarly to matrix forms in which the extension peptides are retained on the molecules. CONCLUSIONS. The heterotypic nature (collagens I and V) of human corneal fibrils was determined. Results indicate that human corneal fibroblasts synthesize the major collagen types in human cornea (collagens I, V, and VI) and express all the posttranslational equipment for correct collagen molecular assembly and processing in a manner that closely resembles the situation in situ, offering the opportunity for more detailed study of this process, which is essential for optical transparency. PURPOSE. <b>The</b> <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing <b>cornea</b> {{is a highly}} organized extracellular matrix formed essentially by uniform, small-diameter collagen fibrils with constant interfibrillar spacing. Unlike <b>the</b> fibrillogenesis <b>of</b> chicken <b>cornea,</b> <b>the</b> assembly and maturation of human corneal fibrils have been poorly investigated. In the current study, the authors aimed to ascertain the heterotypic organization (collagens I and V) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human corneal fibrils at the supramolecular level. To gain more insight into <b>the</b> molecular structure <b>of</b> collagen V, its cellular source, and its role in fibrillogenesis, the authors used cultured human corneal fibroblasts. METHODS. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> human corneal <b>stroma</b> after brief homogenization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tissue was analyzed by immunogold labeling using specific polyclonal antibodies and rotary shadowing. Biochemical, electron microscopic, and immunolabeling approaches were used to investigate the collagen fibril formation and the extracellular matrix synthesis using human corneal fibroblasts grown in culture as a model system. RESULTS. The authors showed that in human corneal stroma, collagen I is distributed uniformly along the striated fibrils, in contrast to collagen V, which could be identified only at sites at which the fibrils partially were disrupted. Rotary shadowing observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homogenate revealed that collagen VI, a major component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>cornea,</b> was associated closely with the collagen fibril surface. Corneal fibroblasts synthesize and deposit a collagenous matrix with fibrils resembling those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>cornea</b> in appearance and collagen composition. Biochemical data indicate that a high concentration (20 % to 30 %) of collagen V is synthesized by stromal fibroblasts and that collagen V molecules are processed similarly to matrix forms in which the extension peptides are retained on the molecules. CONCLUSIONS. The heterotypic nature (collagens I and V) of human corneal fibrils was determined. Results indicate that human corneal fibroblasts synthesize the major collagen types in human cornea (collagens I, V, and VI) and express all the posttranslational equipment for correct collagen molecular assembly and processing in a manner that closely resembles the situation in situ, offering the opportunity for more detailed study of this process, which is essential for optical transparency...|$|R
40|$|The {{surgical}} {{correction of}} hyperopia and hyperopic astigmatism {{has always been}} a challenge for refractive surgeons. The efficacy, quality of vision and most im-portantly safety, provided by the existing laser surgical techniques are often not satis-factory. On the other hand, thermokeratoplasty procedures are minimally invasive, do not require corneal tissue removal, and operate outside the central clear zone of the cornea. The goal of conductive keratoplasty, which is a thermokeratoplasty technique, is to produce structural changes in the three-dimensional grating of collagen in the <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b> These changes are achieved through the elevation of the tissue temperature. The increased tissue temperature is induced by electric impedance in the flow of energy through the collagen fibrils. Controlled-release radiofrequency energy (350 KHz) is delivered to the depth of 500 μm {{with the help of a}} Keratoplast tip ViewPoint™ CK (Refractec, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA). With the increase of the tissue temperature the collagen fibrils shrink by 30 % of their original length. The application of the energy takes place in the periphery of the cornea where the increase of tempera-ture causes “corneal shrinkage” and flattening of the corneal surface, the fact that leads to a comparative increase of curvature in the central optically active part of the cornea. This new technology is currently used for the correction of low to moderate hyperopia and most recently presbyopia in patients of 45 years and older. In the course of the current study conductive keratoplasty was used to primarily treat hyper-opic astigmatism through the application of an original astigmatic nomogram. The current study reports on the results of conductive keratoplasty treatment of primary and secondary astigmatism trough the application of the original astigmatic nomogram, the safety profile of the new technique obtained trough human and animal histological studies, as well as the expansion of the existing nomogram for the spheri-cal corrections to higher degrees of hyperopia. The purpose of the current thesis is to study the shrinkage of the corneal tissue with the means of conductive keratoplasty in order to produce safe, predictable and effective treatment of low to moderate hyperopia as well as hyperopic astigmatism. In order to achieve this goal the technique was applied for the treatment of low to moderate hyperopia in individuals over 45 years of age. The safety of the treatment was evaluated through the histological studies of CK-treated human and rabbit cor-neas. The technique was applied for the treatment of higher levels of hyperopia due to the modification of the surgical technique as well as for the treatment of primary and secondary astigmatism. ...|$|E
40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> oxygen {{radical damage}} in <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> after excimer laser ablation.  METHODS—The 193  nm argon fluoride excimer laser was programmed {{for an average}} fluence of 150  mJ/cm 2, with a firing rate of 5  Hz and an ablation zone diameter of 6  mm. Phototherapeutic keratectomy was performed to remove 30  µm of epithelium and 50  µm <b>of</b> <b>stroma</b> from <b>the</b> <b>corneas</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand white rabbits. Oxidative tissue damage after laser was determined by measuring oxidised lipids (conjugated dienes and ketodienes) in corneal lipid extracts, and by fast blue B staining to localise the lipid peroxide in the tissue.  RESULTS—Conjugated diene levels were 3. 73  (SD 0. 56) nmol per hemicornea in ablated corneas and 1. 99  (0. 33) nmol per hemicornea in normal corneas (p =  0. 0044). Ketodiene levels were 2. 72  (0. 38) nmol per hemicornea in treated corneas and 0. 91  (0. 12) nmol per hemicornea in normal corneas (p <  0. 001). Fast blue B staining disclosed that the tissue damage occurred primarily on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ablated <b>cornea.</b>  CONCLUSION—The presence of lipid peroxidation in the superficial corneal stroma in excimer laser treated corneas was demonstrated. This lipid peroxidation could be from oxygen free radicals generated by the infiltrating polymorphonuclear cells at <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> tissue damage. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Inflammatory {{cells and}} antigen {{presenting}} cells (APC) are not present {{under normal circumstances}} in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> healthy <b>cornea.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} investigate and phenotype the inflammatory cell populations, particularly with reference to T cell subpopulations and macrophages, and to localise dendritic cells (DC) and other MHC class II positive cells in three groups of grafted corneas: rejected non-inflamed, rejected inflamed grafts, and control dystrophic explants.  METHODS— 15 corneal buttons removed during keratoplasty from non-inflamed "quiet" previously grafted corneas, five inflamed corneas requiring urgent regrafting for "graft melting" (in "high risk" corneas), and 10  control dystrophic opaque corneas explanted during their first graft procedure were examined. Cryosections of corneas were immunostained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 14, CD 25, CD 68, HLA-DP, and HLA-DR molecules using the StreptABC method. DC were detected by dual immunostaining as CD 1 a+ and MHC class II+ and CD 19 −. Cell densities in immunostained tissue sections were evaluated using a scale from 0  to + 4.  RESULTS—Immunostaining in control dystrophic corneas was negative for all antibodies. A moderate to high density of CD 8 +, CD 14 +, and CD 68 + cells was observed in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> rejected non-inflamed as well as in rejected inflamed corneal buttons. Strong positivity for HLA-DP and HLA-DR molecules in the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium was also demonstrated. Weak positivity for CD 4 and CD 25 was observed in six of 15  and 11  of 15  rejected <b>corneas,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> dendritic cells in <b>the</b> basal layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epithelium and in the stroma was observed in 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grafts.  CONCLUSIONS—A high frequency <b>of</b> macrophages, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> DC in <b>the</b> explants, and strong expression of HLA-DP and HLA-DR molecules on resident cells are characteristics of rejected corneal allografts, whether actively inflamed or not. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> DC in <b>the</b> <b>stroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grafted <b>cornea</b> suggests that they may be mainly responsible for T cell activation and graft rejection since DC are known to be a 100 -fold more potent than macrophages as APC. ...|$|R
