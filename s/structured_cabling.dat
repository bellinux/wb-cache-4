40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with advantages of high strength and light weight, giving it great {{potential to be}} a new, reliable <b>cable</b> material. Ideal <b>structures</b> for CFRP <b>cables</b> are orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> <b>structures,</b> where <b>cables</b> are loaded orthogonally or approximately orthogonally by external loads. Using CFRP <b>cables</b> in such <b>structures,</b> e. g. <b>cable</b> roofs and cable facades, has advantages over traditional steel <b>cable</b> <b>structures.</b> In order to demonstrate this point, two typical orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> <b>structures,</b> i. e. a CFRP spoked wheel cable roof and a CFRP cable net façade, were investigated in a case study. Their mechanical properties and economies are compared with that of the steel counterparts.

Several types of <b>structures</b> (<b>cable</b> truss, hyperbolic paraboliod) are being studied in order to make an explicit comparison between the linear and nonlinear responses.

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>structure</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} of long-span bridges, such as cable-stayed and suspension bridges, and it transfers the main loads of bridges to the pylons. As these <b>cable</b> <b>structures</b> are exposed to continuous external loads, such as vehicle and wind loads, vibration control and continuous monitoring of the cable are required. In this study, an electromagnetic (EM) damper was designed and fabricated for vibration control and monitoring of the <b>cable</b> <b>structure.</b> EM dampers, also called regenerative dampers, consist of permanent magnets and coils. The electromagnetic force due to the relative motion between the coil and the permanent magnet can be used to control the vibration of the structure. The electrical energy {{can be used as a}} power source for the monitoring system. The effects of the design parameters of the damper were numerically analyzed and the damper was fabricated. The characteristics of the damper were analyzed with various external load changes. Finally, the vibration-control and energy-harvesting performances of the <b>cable</b> <b>structure</b> were evaluated through a hybrid simulation. The vibration-control and energy-harvesting performances for various loads were analyzed and the applicability to the <b>cable</b> <b>structure</b> of the EM damper was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{application}} of <b>cable</b> <b>structures</b> in buildings has gained huge popularities. Although cable technology has been established since the 1950 s, there is suddenly a surge {{in the number of}} its building application starting in the late 90 s. This phenomenon is attributed to the recent advances in computational form finding, analysis and construction simulation, which make the design and construction of <b>cable</b> <b>structures</b> simpler and more economical. Although <b>cable</b> <b>structures</b> have been employed for different building applications, this thesis will concentrate only on the use of <b>cable</b> <b>structures</b> in wide span system. Five cable systems: simply suspended cables, pretensioned cable beams, pretensioned cable nets, tensioned straight cable nets and tensegric shells are studied for their mechanical properties and suitability for wide span uses. A case study is presented {{at the end of each}} system's description to illustrate its possible application. The paper will then conclude with a presentation of a general design methodology of a <b>cable</b> <b>structure.</b> by Katherina Santoso. Thesis (M. Eng.)
