500|$|In his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray {{analyzed}} the many advertisement parodies featured in The Simpsons. He commented on [...] "Bart to the Future", writing: [...] "As if ads in children's toys or in churches are not enough, in 'Bart to the Future,' an episode {{in which an}} Indian shaman at a casino treats Bart to a vision of his future, even his vision is interrupted when future-Bart says, 'I guess I am an embarrassment,' and a ghost responds, 'You <b>sure</b> <b>are.</b> But, hey, there's an embarrassment of riches at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!' Here [...] The Simpsons uses parody with great effect, not only to illustrate how annoyingly and disrespectfully ads infringe on any territory, but also to mock their logic and rhetoric." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{retirement}} from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general {{director of the}} United Church Men, a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "Great faith and devoted service, I am very <b>sure,</b> <b>are</b> for ordinary folk {{as well as for the}} clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in my day ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.|$|E

2500|$|Vietnam Inc. {{had a major}} {{influence}} on American perceptions of the war, and became a classic of photojournalism. The book was the result of Griffiths' work between 1966 and 1971 in the country, and it stands {{as one of the most}} detailed surveys of any conflict. It includes critical descriptions of the horrors of the war as well as a study of Vietnamese rural life, and views from serving American soldiers. Probably one of its most quoted passages is of a US army source discussing napalm: 'We <b>sure</b> <b>are</b> pleased with those backroom boys at Dow. The original product wasn't so hot – if the gooks were quick they could scrape it off. So the boys started adding polystyrene – now it sticks like shit to a blanket. But if the gooks jumped under water it stopped burning, so they started adding Willie Peter (white phosphorus) so's to make it burn better. And just one drop is enough, it'll keep on burning right down to the bone so they die anyway from phosphorus poisoning.' ...|$|E
