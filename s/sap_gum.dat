40|$|Acacia senegal, which {{produces}} gum arabic, has suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the drought. This tree with the golden <b>sap</b> (<b>gum</b> arabic) does not thrive in plantations, so the only viable method of restoring it to previous numbers is to protect its natural environment. Trees in the Sahel have a variety of ways of resisting the vagaries of the climate. Acacia tortilis delays blooming until the last rains because the onset of the cool season fluctuates so much. The baobab keeps its reserves of water inside its trunk. Most species have developed huge root systems which can seek water as far away as possible. But the Acacia senegal, has perhaps the most interesting drought defence system of all: to avoid dehydration when the wind, animals or insects damage its trunk, it secretes a viscous liquid known as gum arable. Gum arabic- a rare and precious commodity Man has long harvested gum arabic as something rare and precious. In ancient fumes it had considerable commercial value and this has not diminished. Its rarity {{comes from the fact that}} only the gum tree produces it, and a satisfactory substitute has never been found. It is used for glue, sweets, pills and lozenges; it stabilizes wine and fizzy drinks; it is a fixative for paintings and ceramics; and local people use it for starching their traditional costumes, for cooking, and for medicine. Over the years, the tapping of the trees for gum has developed into a skilled operational In Mauritania, northern Senegal, Niger and Mali all the stockmen, from the Moors to the Peulhs, shepherds and nomads, collect the gum when they go in search of new pastures for their flocks and herds. Some even take their cattle to those areas where there are gum trees to tap because they know they can sell what they get as additional income. A small tree well adapted During the drought years of the Seventies, the Sahelian landscape lost many gum trees, despite the fact that this five-six metre tree with its low thorny bushy branches is well suited to the Sahelian climatic conditions. It needs only about 250 - 270 mm rainfall, and can withstand nine to eleven months of drought and temperatures of 45 C. Its rough thick bark protects it from this heat. Its main roots can descend one metre, and its secondaries are long and supple and can spread out through the sand so the strong Harmattan winds cannot uproot the tree. However, the disappearance of the gum tree is more the result of disarry in herd movements than of the drought. Herdsmen lead their stock into the least arid areas, but that is precisely where the gum tree is most likely to flourish again and young shoots get eaten and the trees destroyed. Nomads have not yet gone back to their old routes and they need to graze their herds and flocks where they are at present but the gum tree is specially enjoyed by goats, cattle, and - above all - camels. As a result the production of gum declined sharply, from 60, 000 tonnes in 1970 to 20, 000 tonnes in 1980, and has now stabilized around 45, 000 tonnes Large-scale plantations There have been various attempts to domesticate this tree, but large plantations have not been successful Acacia senegal plantation, principally in Mali have had variable results: some trees produce gum well (between five and ten kilo per annum) but others produce only one kilo. Scientists have not yet managed to isolate, and then reproduce, the most productive strains. Research programmes are in train but no results will be published for some years. Meanwhile the best means of preserving this useful tree is still to protect it from the ravages of man, beast and fire where it occurs naturally.

500|$|The species {{acts as an}} {{important}} seed disperser and pollinator, {{as well as a}} prey item for several carnivores. [...] The Bengal slow loris feeds on plant exudates such as <b>sap,</b> <b>gums,</b> resins, and latexes, particularly those from the family Fabaceae. Even though the species does not have keeled nails, it will scrape the plant, actively breaking its surface; this behavior resembles that of marmosets and the fork-marked lemurs. Exudates are also obtained by gouging holes in the bark. The winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates. The bastard myrobala (Terminalia belerica), a deciduous tree common in Southeast Asia, is a preferred source for exudates, but it has also been observed taking plant exudates from a number of families: Moraceae (Artocarpus), Magnoliaceae (Manglietia), Fabaceae (Acacia, Bauhinia), Lecythidaceae (Careya arborea), and Sterculiaceae (Pterospermum). Although it will feed on large insects (such as katydids and crickets), gum, snails, small birds, and reptiles, it is primarily frugivorous. Lianas of the flowering plant genus Bauhinia are a commonly used food source.|$|R

50|$|A rat king is a {{collection}} of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together by one of several possible mechanisms, such as entangling material like hair or sticky substances like <b>sap</b> or <b>gum.</b> The number of rats joined together varies from a few to as many as 30. Historically, the phenomenon is particularly associated with Germany, which produced many reported instances. Rat kings occur so rarely that they have sometimes been thought to be cryptids, but there are several well-attested modern occurrences. A similar phenomenon happens with other small rodents such as forest mice and squirrels.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{the use of}} exudates in {{traditional}} medicine has been commonly observed during ethnopharmacological surveys, few records have been made concerning the scientific merits of these products. The {{aim of this study}} was to document ethnopharmacological data and to classify exudates used as medicine by the “caboclos” river-dwellers from the Unini River of Amazonas, Brazil, on chemical analyses basis. Using an ethnographic approach, indicated plants and their respective exudates were collected, identified and incorporated into herbarium of the National Institute of Amazonian Research. To classify these exudates, plant material was extracted using methanol, and obtained extracts were analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and mass spectrometry aiming identification of main compounds. Fifteen exudates were indicated by “caboclos” river-dwellers as home remedies; among their therapeutic uses, inflammatory processes, culture-bound syndromes and respiratory diseases are most prominent. Based on their solubility and chemicals classes, fifteen exudates were classified into: latex (7), resins (5), <b>sap</b> (1), <b>gum</b> (1), oleoresin (1); and eleven of them have not been mentioned on pharmacological literature until this moment. The obtained results may contribute to chemical/pharmacological application of exudates from these species, several of which have been classically used in Brazilian folk medicine...|$|R
5000|$|Phanerochaete salmonicolor has a {{very broad}} host range. The host plants of {{greatest}} importance include rubber, tea, coffee, cocoa, grapefruit, orange, nutmeg, mango, apple, coca, and kola. Pink Disease can cause heavy losses including individual branch death {{to the loss of}} the whole tree in cases where the main stem or several branches are affected. P. salmonicolor causes girdling cankers which prevent the normal function of some physiological processes, eventually leading to defoliation and die-back of outer branches. Symptoms include cobwebby, pink to salmon encrustation, creamy pustules and orange fruiting bodies. On rubber trees, initial stages of infection appear as drops of latex and silky-white mycelial growth on the bark surface. In pepper plants, sterile pink to white pustules approximately 1 mm in diameter appear on young green stems. In citrus trees, sterile pustules may appear first, and in some cases the trees may have oozing <b>sap</b> or <b>gum.</b> In cacao trees, first symptoms of infection usually present as a sparse white mycelium on the bark surface, which can be easily overlooked. Trees are most susceptible in areas with high levels of rainfall, such as tropical rainforests. Diagnosis of Pink Disease is typically achieved through the use of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to observe sporulation of the pathogen.|$|R
50|$|Pariente's fork-marked lemur (Phaner parienti), or the Sambirano fork-marked lemur is {{a species}} of lemur endemic to the Sambirano region of {{north-western}} Madagascar. This lemur has light brown to gray upperparts, a prominent facial fork and dorsal stripe that runs from the tail's tip {{to the point where}} it splits on the lemur's head to rejoin at the nose, and a white-tipped tail. It is found in lowland and mid-altitude humid forests and is nocturnal. It is an omnivore, eating tree <b>gum,</b> <b>sap,</b> bud exudes, insects and larvae. It sleeps in nests that have been abandoned by other lemurs, particularly Coquerel's giant mouse lemur. This species is relatively unknown, though it is threatened by habitat destruction. It was previously considered a subspecies of the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer). It is listed on CITES Appendix I.|$|R
30|$|Plant resin has a {{large number}} of {{desirable}} characteristics, including water-resistance, anti-microbial and biocide properties, adhesiveness, and thermo-plasticity (i.e. its ability to become malleable when heated). It is used in Australia and Papua New Guinea for hafting heads onto shafts of composite tools, waterproofing baskets and bark buckets, caulking boats, and making and decorating ornamental items. Plant resin also burns well, has a pleasant aroma, and can be mixed with other materials, and thus is also used for illumination, incense, medicinal and narcotic purposes, and as a paint binder [10, 11]. Resin preserves relatively well and is periodically found in an archaeological context. While ethnographers have also recorded plant exudates such as polysaccharide <b>gums,</b> <b>saps</b> and latexes as useful products, resins are more likely to survive archaeologically as they are not water-soluble and are often contained by or adhered to long-lasting materials such as pottery, stone, obsidian or shell.|$|R
50|$|The Bengal slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{occurring}} in both evergreen and deciduous forests. It prefers rainforests with dense canopies, and {{its presence in}} its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem. It is a seed disperser and pollinator, {{as well as a}} prey item for carnivores. Its diet primarily consists of fruit, but also includes insects, tree gum, snails, and small vertebrates. In winter, it relies on plant exudates, such as <b>sap</b> and tree <b>gum.</b> The species lives in small family groups, marks its territory with urine, and sleeps during the day by curling up in dense vegetation or in tree holes. It is a seasonal breeder, reproducing once every 12-18 months and usually giving birth to a single offspring. For the first three months, mothers carry their offspring, which reach sexual maturity at around 20 months. The Bengal slow loris can live up to 20 years.|$|R
40|$|The greater peachtree borer (Order Lepidoptera, Family Sesiidae) is {{native to}} North America where wild {{cherries}} and plums are its native hosts. It is a sporadic pest in Utah stone fruit orchards, but if left unmanaged it can be severe enough to cause tree loss. The adults are clearwing moths (Fig. 1). The larvae are pinkish-white caterpillars that bore into the trunks where they feed just under the bark in the cambial tissue (Fig. 2). There is one generation per year, but some larvae may require 2 years to complete development (Fig. 3). Extensive larval feeding can girdle and kill trees. The larvae primarily attack tree trunks just at or below the soil line (Fig. 4), but may enter trunks up to 12 inches above the ground. Other tree problems that are confused with peachtree borer injury include winter freeze and mechanical injury, and infection by canker-causing fungi such as Cytospora. All of these problems can cause copious <b>sap</b> or <b>gum</b> to exude from holes or cracks in the bark. Key symptoms of peachtree borer infestation are the presence of sawdust and frass mixed with the gummy exudate near {{the base of the}} trunk (Fig. 5). Prevention is the most effective approach to management. Pheromone-based mating disruption and trunk sprays with synthetic insecticides are the primary management tactics. Adult peachtree borers become active in mid to late June in northern Utah (Fig. 3) and trunks should be protected from tunneling larvae beginning the first week of July (3 - 4 weeks earlier in southern Utah) through late August to early September...|$|R
