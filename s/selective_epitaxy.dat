50|$|Selective growth through {{dielectric}} masking {{is readily}} achieved using CBE {{as compared to}} its parent techniques of MBE and MOCVD. Selective growth is hard to achieve using elemental source MBE because group III atoms do not desorb readily after they are adsorbed. With chemical sources, the reactions associated with the growth rate are faster on the semiconductor surface than on the dielectric layer. No group III element can, however, arrive at the dielectric surface in CBE due {{to the absence of}} any gas phase reactions. Also, it is easier for the impinging group III metalorganic molecules to desorb {{in the absence of the}} boundary layer. This makes it easier to perform <b>selective</b> <b>epitaxy</b> using CBE and at lower temperatures, compared to MOCVD or MOVPE.In recent developments patented by ABCD Technology, substrate rotation is no longer required, leading to new possibilities such as in-situ patterning with particle beams.

40|$|The use of {{semiconductor}} {{quantum dots}} (QDs) in photonic devices has become widespread {{in recent years}} and QDs themselves have received a considerable amount of attention from the photonics community. Not only do they offer many potential advantages in lasers, but they have also become interesting from an applied physics perspective as tools for exploring strong coupling in nanoscale cavities, as single photon emitters, and possibly as elements of quantum information circuits. 	 To a great extent many of the promises made about the advantages QDs would bring to photonic devices remain unfulfilled, largely due to the size inhomogeneity and random placement inherent with the self-assembled growth technique.

These QDs are fabricated using electron beam lithography combined with wet-etching and regrowth techniques. We also present a detailed theoretical analysis of a novel structure which can only be formed by patterning techniques known as the nanopore or inverse quantum dot structure.

40|$|In {{order to}} predict {{the quality of the}} {{fabricated}} devices as a function of growth conditions in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors, a model should describe multiple time and length scales. These scales include the reactor scale ([approx] 0. 1 - 1 m), the feature scale ([approx. ] 0. 1 - 100 [mu]m), and the atomistic morphology evolution scale ([approx. ] 10 nm). At present, good reactor and feature scale models are available. However, the linking between them has been done only for low pressure CVD. Also, the atomistic Kinetic Monte Carlo models have been developed only for deposition on unpatterned substrates or over V-grooves. In this work the linking between reactor and feature scale models for both low and high pressure CVD is achieved by matching concentrations and fluxes across the interface. For low-pressure systems, we improve the convergence of the previously developed linking schemes by applying a flux-split algorithm. We analyze the assumptions underlying the linking, and demonstrate that the size of the feature domain is constrained by these assumptions and not simply by the assumption of collisionless gas phase transport. At high-pressure, mass transport between features complicates solution of the entire feature field. To capture the diffusive inter-feature transport, we develop the overlapping computational domains method.
