40|$|Robots {{are defined}} and {{described}} for various applications. The key feature of robots is programmability, which allows teleoperation, repair work in hazardous situations, and unsupervised operation in industrial functions. Two types of robots now exist: special purpose, with equipment {{for a specific}} task; and general purpose, which include nonservo-controlled robots, servo-controlled <b>robots,</b> and <b>sensory</b> <b>control</b> <b>robots.</b> <b>Sensory</b> robots are the most sophisticated, and are equipped with both internal control sensors and external sensors such as TV cameras, pressure detectors, laser range finders, etc. Sensory feedback to a central computer enables the robots to make appropriate modifications to the control program to adapt to new situations. Pattern recognition and scans for size are features of the TV sensors, and programs to develop a universal effector (hand) are outlined. Finally, robot programming in terms of manual, walkthrough, and textual methods are described, and the potential uses of robots for space and undersea construction and repair are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian {{research}} programme on advanced robot systems {{has been focused}} on <b>sensory</b> <b>control</b> of <b>robots</b> for industrial applications and telerobotics for underwater operations. This paper gives an overview of experimental work and ongoing research. An exciting area in <b>sensory</b> <b>control</b> is visual servoing where camera images at video rate are used to grasp moving objects. Also compliant motion in partially unknown environments is a research topic. New <b>robot</b> <b>control</b> systems have been developed to apply <b>sensory</b> <b>control</b> to robotic manipulators at an acceptable sampling rate. In telerobotics the main work has been on the combination of remote <b>control</b> and local <b>sensory</b> loops in the manipulator. Also in this case visual servoing anti force control are important. The generation and updating of a world model used in a graphic display of the worksite using sensory information has been tested in combination with large delay times in the communication channel. The use of visual and acoustic data for the control of remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles is studied for use in robotic systems. Light-weight robot manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom and high performance joints are being designed for mobile robot applications...|$|R
40|$|This book presents recent {{advances}} in <b>robot</b> <b>control</b> theory on task space <b>sensory</b> feedback <b>control</b> of <b>robot</b> manipulators. By using sensory feedback information, the <b>robot</b> <b>control</b> systems are robust to various uncertainties in modelling and calibration errors of the sensors. Several <b>sensory</b> task space <b>control</b> methods {{that do not}} require exact knowledge of either kinematics or dynamics of robots, are presented. Some useful methods such as approximate Jacobian control, adaptive Jacobian control, region control and multiple task space regional feedback are included. These formulations and methods give robots a high degree of flexibility in dealing with unforeseen changes and uncertainties in its kinematics and dynamics, which is similar to human reaching movements and tool manipulation. It also leads to the solution of several long-standing problems and open issues in <b>robot</b> <b>control,</b> such as force control with constraint uncertainty, <b>control</b> of multi-fingered <b>robot</b> hand with uncertain contact points, singularity issue of Jacobian matrix, global task-space control, which are also presented in this book. The target audience for this book includes scientists, engineers and practitioners involved in the field of <b>robot</b> <b>control</b> theory...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>control</b> of <b>robots</b> {{requires}} {{information about}} position and orientation of workpieces and other objects. Especially important fields of application in {{the automobile industry}} are concentrated in the chassis and final assembly, where three dimensional sensory data are crucial for <b>robot</b> <b>control.</b> Optical rangefinders represent a type of sensor providing particularly useful information about depth and surface orientation which vision can hardly supply. This paper presents a systmatic classification for optical range sensors according to task, sensor type and application strategy. The classification system is explained through four different examples arising from projects carried out at IPA {{in the domain of}} automobile applications. First we present a robot arm with a hand-mounted rangefinder, which performs a one dimensional scan {{in order to determine the}} opening angle of a car door. A three dimensional position measurement using an optical rangefinder mounted on a moving vehicle is a further step in terms of complexity. Combining several rangefinders in a parallel arrangement allows measurement of surface orientation. It is demonstrated with a modular tool-integrated sensor-system developed at IPA. Finally, the assembly of waterhoses with the help of a two dimensional laserscanner is presented...|$|R
40|$|Robot manipulators, {{some thirty}} years after their {{commercial}} introduction, have found widespread application in structured industrial environments, performing, for instance, repetitive tasks in an assembly line. Successful application in unstructured environments however has proven much harder. Yet there are many such tasks where robots would be useful. We present a promising approach to visual (and more general <b>sensory)</b> <b>robot</b> <b>control,</b> that does not require modeling of robot transfer functions {{or the use of}} absolute world coordinate systems, and thus is suitable for use in unstructured environments. Our approach codes actions and tasks in terms of desired general perceptions rather than motor sequences. We argue that our vision space approach is particularly suited for easy teaching /programming of a robot. For instance a task can be taught by supplying an image sequence illustrating it. The resulting robot behavior is robust to changes in the environment, dynamically adjusting the mot [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Advanced Robotics {{requires}} robots with mobility, {{high level}} <b>sensory</b> <b>control,</b> wireless communication and graphics user interfaces. It IS {{important to have}} effective algorithms for <b>controlling</b> the <b>Robot</b> In unconstrained environment besides having a friendly graphic user interface (GUI) {{to make it easy}} for the user to <b>control</b> the <b>Robot.</b> This thesis deals with these two important points. Firstly a friendly graphic user interface called Charlie Operating System for Windows (ChaOS/or Windows) is created to. Mlable the user to control the movement. of the Robot in an easy way either on-line or off-line. This operating system is designed to benefit from the great capabilities of Windows to facilitate controlling CharlieÃ‚Â·robots. It uses multitasking to allow the user to monitor and <b>control</b> the <b>robot</b> using simple commands. Secondly, Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC) are simulated to <b>control</b> Charlie Mobile <b>Robots.</b> These controllers are designed to combine Collision Avoidance with Goal Achievement according to certain priorities. Three different modes of controlling the vehicle are used. The first mode is to control the vehicle while roving in an unknown environment with,. unconstrained obstacles. The second mode is controlling the vehicle searching for a target located at an undetermined place. The third mode is controlling the vehicle searching for a specific target located at a known place in a partially known environment. Finally, after testing the Fuzzy Logic Control algorithms using a single vehicle and having satisfactory results, these techniques have been used to control multiple vehicles moving in the same workspace.

40|$|Master-slave {{system is}} a vital {{technique}} for <b>controlling</b> <b>robot</b> motions, especially in underwater robotics applications. This paper describes {{the development of a}} novel master controller for an experimental dual-arm underwater robot. By using the proposed master controller, a human operator is able to <b>control</b> an underwater <b>robot</b> movement in 3 -dimensional space. The master controller also includes two units of 3 -link manipulator controller. Moreover, each end-tips of the manipulator controller are attached with a joystick, one for <b>controlling</b> <b>robot</b> position, while the other <b>controls</b> <b>robot</b> attitude. The uniqueness of the proposed master controller is that a human operator is able to control the motion of robot base and two units of 3 -link slave manipulator simultaneously.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to combine the concept of {{wireless}} power transfer and GSM <b>controlled</b> <b>robot</b> for the application of home automation. The wireless power transfer concept can be well utilized to charge battery of the GSM <b>controlled</b> <b>robot.</b> When the robot has completed its task, it can come to the origin where it can charge itself. Robot can be charged wirelessly, when it is not performing any task. Combination of GSM <b>controlled</b> <b>robot</b> and wireless power transfer provides greater advantage such as; no wastage of charge stored in the battery when the robot is not doing any task. This provides greater reliability that at any instant, robot can do its work once it receives a message through GSM module. GSM module of the robot and user mobile phone must be interfaced properly, so that robot can do task when it receives message from same user mobile phone, not from any other phone. This paper approaches a robotic movement control through the smart phone and <b>control</b> of GSM <b>robot</b> is done by programming in Arduino environment.
