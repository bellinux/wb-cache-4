40|$|<b>Stall</b> flutter is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon resulting in unwanted oscillatory loads on the blade, such as wind turbine blade, helicopter rotor blade, and other flexible wing blades. Although the <b>stall</b> flutter and related aeroelastic control {{have been studied}} theoretically and experimentally, microtab control of asymmetric limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) in <b>stall</b> flutter cases has not been generally investigated. This paper presents an aeroservoelastic model to study the microtab control of the blade section undergoing moderate <b>stall</b> flutter and deep <b>stall</b> flutter separately. The effects of different dynamic <b>stall</b> conditions and the consequent asymmetric LCOs for both <b>stall</b> cases are simulated and analyzed. Then, {{for the design of}} the <b>stall</b> flutter controller, the potential sensor signal for the <b>stall</b> flutter, the microtab control capability of the <b>stall</b> flutter, and the control algorithm for the <b>stall</b> flutter are studied. The improvement and the superiority of the proposed adaptive <b>stall</b> flutter controller are shown by comparison with a simple <b>stall</b> flutter controller...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated unsteady {{events such}} as <b>stall</b> inception, stall-cell development, and surge. <b>Stall</b> {{is characterized by a}} decrease in overall pressure rise and nonaxisymmetric throughflow. Compressor <b>stall</b> can lead to surge which is characterized by quasi-axisymmetric fluctuations in mass flow and pressure. Unsteady measurements of the flow field around the compressor rotor are examined. During the <b>stall</b> inception process, initial disturbances were found within the rotor passage near the tip region. As the <b>stall</b> cell develops, blade lift and pressure ratio decrease within the <b>stall</b> cell and increase ahead of the <b>stall</b> cell. The <b>stall</b> inception event, stall-cell development, and <b>stall</b> recovery event were found to be nearly identical for stable rotating <b>stall</b> and surge cases. As the <b>stall</b> cell grows, {{the leading edge of the}} cell will rotate at a higher rate than the trailing edge in the rotor frame. The opposite occurs during <b>stall</b> recovery. The trailing edge of the <b>stall</b> cell will rotate at the approximate speed as the fully developed <b>stall</b> cell, while the leading edge decreases in rotational speed in the rotor frame...|$|R

40|$|Lameness in {{dairy cows}} {{continues}} to be a major problem for the industry world-wide. Prevalence appears higher in free <b>stall</b> housed dairy herds than in tie <b>stall</b> herds in Wisconsin, and is especially a problem in free <b>stall</b> herds using mat or mattress <b>stall</b> surfaces compared to those herds using sand. This article describes some of the behavioral differences which contribute to this difference. In particular, lame cows housed in mattress free <b>stall</b> barns appear to spend longer standing in the <b>stall,</b> compared to lame cows in sand <b>stalls.</b> This time spent standing appears to reflect a difficulty in performing the process of lying down and standing up. Future <b>stall</b> design recommendations must be based on providing a <b>stall</b> in which lame cows can maintain normal daily activity patterns...|$|R
40|$|Several nascent {{peptides}} <b>stall</b> ribosomes {{during their}} own translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Leader peptides that induce <b>stalling</b> can regulate downstream gene expression. Interestingly, <b>stalling</b> peptides show little sequence similarity {{and interact with}} the ribosome through distinct mechanisms. To explore the scope of regulation by <b>stalling</b> peptides and {{to better understand the}} mechanism of <b>stalling,</b> we identified and characterized new examples from random libraries. We created a genetic selection that ties the life of Escherichia coli cells to <b>stalling</b> at a specific site. This selection relies on the natural bacterial system that rescues arrested ribosomes. We altered transfer-messenger RNA, a key component of this rescue system, to direct the completion of a necessary protein if and only if <b>stalling</b> occurs. We identified three classes of <b>stalling</b> peptides: C-terminal Pro residues, SecM-like peptides, and the novel <b>stalling</b> sequence FXXYXIWPP. Like the leader peptides SecM and TnaC, the FXXYXIWPP peptide induces <b>stalling</b> efficiently by inhibiting peptidyl transfer. The nascent peptide exit tunnel and peptidyltransferase center are implicated in this <b>stalling</b> event, although mutations in the ribosome affect <b>stalling</b> on SecM and FXXYXIWPP differently. We conclude that ribosome <b>stalling</b> can be caused by numerous sequences and is more common than previously believed...|$|R
