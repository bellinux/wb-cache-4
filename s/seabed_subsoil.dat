40|$|When President Harry S.

Less clear, however, are the rules that govern the delineation of the boundaries on the shelf between adjacent and opposite states. Different interpretations of rather ambiguous rules has led to friction between several neighboring coast states.

Although U. S. credibility with its Arctic allies would be enhanced by its becoming a party to the Law of the Sea Convention, this remote possibility is not a prerequisite for a successful U. S.

40|$|I, the undersigned, hereby {{declare that}} the work {{contained}} in this thesis is my own original work and that I have not previously in its entirety or in part submitted it at any university for a degree. Signature: Date: The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{provides an opportunity for}} qualifying coastal signatory states to claim extended maritime estate. The opportunity to claim rests on the precept that in certain cases a continental shelf extends beyond the traditionally demarcated two hundred nautical mile (200 M) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) mark. In these cases a successful claim results in states having sovereign rights to the living and nonliving resources of the <b>seabed</b> and <b>subsoil,</b> as well as the sedentary species, of the area claimed. Where the continental shelf extends beyond the 200 M mark, the Foot of the Continental Slope (FoS) has to be determined as one of the qualifying criteria. Article 76 of UNCLOS denes the FoS as. ̇. the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base. " Currently Caris Lots is the most widely used software which incorporates public domain data to determine the FoS as a step towards dening the oshore extent of an extended continental shelf. In this software, existing methods to compute the FoS are often subjective, typically involving an operator choosing th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} of China on its maritime claims based on UNCLOS and {{history has been}} ambiguous, particularly with the nine dash line map. For example, in its notes verbales in 2011, the first phrase stated that China has undisputed sovereignty over the islands and the adjacent waters, suggesting China is claiming sovereignty over its territorial waters, a position consistent with UNCLOS. However, the second phrase in its notes verbales stated that China enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters along with the <b>seabed</b> and <b>subsoil</b> contained in this region, suggesting that China is claiming sovereignty over all of the maritime space (includes all the geographic features and the waters within the nine dash line). The third phrase indicates support for basing their claims on historical basis as well. Recently in its notes verbales in 2011, China has explicitly stated that it claims the territorial waters {{and all of the}} islands in which each island has its own exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. A major problem with this claim is that it fails to distinguish between geographic features considered as [...] "islands" [...] or [...] "rocks" [...] under UNCLOS. The vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China's claims based on historical claims are invalid. Many ambiguities arise from the notion of historical claims as a basis for claiming sovereignty and is inherently ambiguous.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{technical aspects of}} the maritime boundary dispute between Bangladesh and Myanmar (the 2 ̆ 7 Bay of Bengal case 2 ̆ 7). This dispute was the first maritime delimitation determined by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). The 2012 decision {{was also the first}} time that a maritime boundary for the <b>seabed</b> and <b>subsoil</b> of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the extended continental shelf (ECS) was determined by international adjudication. This was also therefore the first time that detailed technical quantification of seabed areas within the EEZ and ECS was needed for achieving an equitable division of these maritime zones in an international forum. Following review of the principles of maritime delimitation on which the ITLOS reached its determination, this article analyzes the legal status and delimitation effect of St. Martin 2 ̆ 7 s Island. Concerning the question of whether the legal regimes of the EEZ and continental shelf should be treated differently in a single delimitation line, although the ITLOS determined that the legal regimes should not be distinguished in the present case, a different approach is proposed for future cases. The article identifies how quantitative modelling can be used to achieve an equitable boundary and proposes a model to adjust provisional equidistance lines in accordance with the complex geophysical rules prescribed for the outer limits of the ECS in Article 76 of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{basin of}} the Sebeto covers a {{triangular}} area of about 20 km 2, bordered to the north-east by the “Pendino” which {{saw the first}} settlement of Neapolis, in 474 B. C., and the hill of Capodichino, now {{the site of the}} airport; to the south-east the slopes of Vesuvius; and to the south, the <b>sea.</b> The <b>subsoil</b> is alluvional and volcanic, while the surface soil is prevalently volcanic. The area was always marshy, and it conserved its natural state of equilibrium until it was built over during the last century. In the recent past three factors in particular have compromised this equilibrium: the imposition of a road network, the location of highly polluting factories and the sharp increase in residential density and building activity. The first proposal for the Park of Sebeto goes back to 1987, and was presented during the Exhibition celebrating the 500 th Anniversary of the Faculty of Architecture. It derived from the urgent need to liberate the city centre by decentralising factories that produced pollution and redistributing the urban modal points throughout the metropolitan area. The area which can still be safeguarded of the Sebeto basin covers some 900 hectares and was proposed as a Great Park with naturalistic, agricultural and recreational attributes. The project included the repristination of the extant water courses and those which had been suppressed, and the creation of an artificial lake as a catchment area for the flood waters which cause periodic flooding in the eastern area of the city...|$|R
