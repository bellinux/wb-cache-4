5|$|Laurence Olivier's 1948 moody {{black-and-white}} Hamlet won Best Picture and Best Actor Oscars, and is still, , {{the only}} Shakespeare film {{to have done}} <b>so.</b> <b>His</b> interpretation stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play, and cast 28-year-old Eileen Herlie as Hamlet's mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Manlius {{started his}} war {{preparation}} by summoning the Pergamese to help. However, the King of Pergamum, Eumenes II, was in Rome <b>so</b> <b>his</b> brother, Attalus, who was serving as regent, took {{command of the}} Pergamese army. He joined the Roman army {{a few days later}} with 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Tallon again dropped Compton from Johnston when the batsman was on 73. England {{eventually}} finished on 363, with Compton not out on 145. Thus Tallon's drops cost 95 runs {{as well as}} allowing Compton to hold up one end <b>so</b> <b>his</b> partners could score. Tallon also conceded seven byes.|$|E

5|$|When {{the puppet}} for Marion was first created, he was {{depicted}} as having stripy fur, but {{looked more like}} a mouse {{in the eyes of the}} crew, <b>so</b> <b>his</b> puppet was changed. Marion's image was based on topless photos of the comic actor James Corden.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond I died in Apulia in 1111. Bohemond II {{was still}} a minor, <b>so</b> <b>his</b> mother {{took charge of the}} {{government}} of Taranto. The Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent envoys to Tancred to demand control of Antioch, but Tancred refused to obey and continued to govern the principality. Tancred died in 1112 and bequeathed Antioch to his sister's son, Roger of Salerno.|$|E

5|$|Boortz's {{first foray}} into authorship was in 1997 with The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear, in which he {{delivers}} his opinions on various topics {{in the form of}} a commencement speech he would give to new college graduates, if ever invited to do <b>so.</b> <b>His</b> second book, entitled The Terrible Truth About Liberals, was published in 1998, and contains reprinted material from his first book, along with a significant amount of new material.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, <b>so</b> <b>his</b> initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{indicated}} {{a desire to}} join the United States Army from a young age; in high school he begged his parents {{to allow him to}} drop out and enlist, wanting to fight in World War II, but his parents refused.

5|$|Despite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA {{title with}} a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt <b>so</b> <b>his</b> {{catchers}} {{could handle the}} knuckleball. Richards was well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By {{the middle of the}} season, he said that eight of his pitchers could serve as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, {{but that he had}} made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done <b>so</b> <b>his</b> letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, <b>so</b> <b>his</b> flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do <b>so.</b> <b>His</b> successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States. Even <b>so,</b> <b>his</b> political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do <b>so.</b> <b>His</b> own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E

As a child, Hickenbottom disliked the name Michael, <b>so</b> <b>his</b> family and friends just called him Shawn. Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} the {{outbreak}} of a wider war, American officials ordered the U.S. Army to arrest the Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees. General Gaines was ill, and <b>so</b> <b>his</b> subordinate, Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, received the assignment. Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 Winnebago War, {{but he had never}} seen combat. On April 8, he set out from Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.|$|E
