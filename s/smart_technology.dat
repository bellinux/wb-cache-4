25|$|In {{response}} to rising concerns about privacy and <b>smart</b> <b>technology,</b> in 2007 the British Government stated it would follow formal Privacy by Design principles when implementing their smart metering program. The program {{would lead to}} replacement of traditional power meters with smart power meters, which could track and manage energy usage more accurately. However the British Computer Society is doubtful these principles were ever actually implemented. In 2009 the Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program, basing their decision on privacy concerns. The Dutch program later revised and passed in 2011.|$|E

Over the years, many innovative policies have been attempted to achieve an efficient, safe, and sustainable transport system. Those policies often require <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> to assist implementation process and enhance effectiveness. This paper discusses how sustainability can be promoted by embedding <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> in a modern transportation system. In particular, this paper studies the transport system of Singapore to address how this system is addressing sustainability through the use of <b>smart</b> <b>technologies.</b> Various technological initiatives in managing traffic flow, monitoring and enforcement, sharing real-time information, and managing revenues are discussed in light of their potentiality in addressing sustainability issues. The Singapore experience provides a useful reference for the cities intending to develop and promote a sustainable transport system...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> have become {{important}} enabling technologies that cut across traditional boundaries {{in science and}} engineering. Here smart {{is defined as the}} ability to respond to a stimulus in a predictable and reproducible manner. While multiple successes have been achieved in the laboratory, we have yet to see the general applicability of <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> to actual aircraft and spacecraft. The NASA Morphing program is an attempt to couple research across a wide range of disciplines to integrate <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> into high payoff applications on aircraft and spacecraft. The program bridges research in several technical disciplines and combines the effort into applications that include active aerodynamic control, active aeroelastic control, and vehicle performance improvement. System studies are used to assess the highest-payoff program objectives, and specific research activities are defined to address the technologies required for development of smart aircraft and spacecraft. This paper will discuss the overall goals of NASA's Morphing program, highlight some of the recent research efforts and discuss the multidisciplinary studies that support that research and some of the challenges associated with bringing the <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> to real applications on flight vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Mireille Hildebrandtâs <b>Smart</b> <b>Technologies</b> and the End(s) of Law (2015) is an {{extraordinary}} piece of work, looking back to the co-evolution of law, {{the state and the}} technology of the printing press, and forward to the contribution that <b>smart</b> <b>technologies</b> of machine learning, big data, artificial agents and pre-emptive environments will make to our society and the threats they make to us individuals (the onlife world). <b>Smart</b> <b>Technologies</b> presents history at an inflection point, where technology has the capacity to introduce a step-change in our relations with our selves, our fellows and our society. Hildebrandt defends our plural society with an agonistic reading, resisting the Rawlsian project of developing consensus, and instead suggesting a Mouffe-like position of accepting, even welcoming conflict. Yet the focus on forthcoming change implies that a more interesting philosophical lens would be conservatism, the ideology that problematizes and examines social change. And indeed, reading <b>Smart</b> <b>Technologies</b> through conservative spectacles results in many insights into the politics of technology, conservatism and Hildebrandtâs work as well. In its scope, scale and ambition, <b>Smart</b> <b>Technologies</b> brings Michael Oakeshottâs masterwork On Human Conduct (1975) to mind, and in many ways updates that statement of liberal conservatism for the 21 st century. Both books focus on human decision-making and action at the individual level, the use and purpose of law for constraining action, {{and the role of the}} law and the state for creating the circumstances for autonomous, authentic, free individuals to flourish. Oakeshottâs themes of human behaviour and civil association, and modernityâs challenges to individuality, are replicated and extended in Hildebrandtâs work...|$|R
