Leicestershire were then bowled out for 160 runs after just 46.3 overs, giving Somerset a 91-run victory. Somerset's second round match against Warwickshire, in Birmingham, took three days to complete. Somerset batted first again, and scored 206 for 8. No batsmen {{particularly}} stood out; Roy Virgin, Bill Alley and Colin Atkinson all made scores in the forties, while Kitchen scored 35, and no other batsman reached double figures. Warwickshire then reached 84 for 4 just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to bad weather. Cricket {{at the time was}} not played on Sundays, and no further play was possible on Monday, so the game continued on Tuesday, when economical bowling from Fred Rumsey, along with the wickets taken by Alley on the first day, helped to restrict Warwickshire to 181 runs. Somerset batted first again in their quarter final match against Northamptonshire, but only managed to score 184 runs. No Somerset player managed to score more than 40 runs during the innings. The Somerset bowlers played well in comparison; Rumsey took four wickets, while Alley conceded only eight runs from his twelve overs, and Northamptonshire were bowled out for 148. Somerset once again had no stand-out batting performance in their semi-final; Kitchen was their highest scorer with 40 runs, as they posted 210 for seven in a rain-interrupted innings which continued into {{the second day of the}} match.

40|$|Partial {{miscibility}} in {{the solid}} state is an undesireable property of chiral substances {{with regard to}} separation by crystallisation. Nevertheless, the incorporation of molecules of the counter enantiomer into the lattice of either the pure enantiomer or the racemic compound is known for various substances, e. g. [1, 2]. Partial solid solutions at the enantiomer <b>side</b> <b>limit</b> the attainable purity of this enantiomer (fig. 1) and miscibility {{in the vicinity of}} the racemic compound makes an enantiomeric enrichment more difficult (fig. 1 a). While from the thermodynamic point of view chiral resolutions for systems showing miscibility in the solid state are not feasible, the kinetics of solid-solid transformations must not be neglected. The temporal course of the crystallisation is a key factor to estimate the potential of a chiral separation in a more comprehensively manner. Therefore a quantitative study is performed to assess possible process routes to cope with chiral systems exhibiting solid solutions. The chiral malic acid was chosen for investigations since the enantiomer is incorporated into the racemic compound lattice in significant quantities. The focus of research is on the roles of cooling and vaporization rates, initial purity and solvent composition. An evaluation of obtained crystallisation trajectories and crystal growth rates on the basis of the applied crystallization conditions is done. The need for complementary use of different analytical techniques (XRPD, FT-IR/ ATR, DSC) for solid phase characterization is emphasized. Different possibilities to achieve enantiomeric enrichment on the basis of a kinetic approach are outlined and evaluated experimentally. [1] Li Z. J., Grant D. J.

40|$|The Rift Valley between 36 " 42 'N and 36 " 55 'N in the Atlantic Ocean is 31 km wide, with half-widths of 12 and 19 km for {{the western}} and eastern sides respectively. Both outer edges of the Rift Valley stand about 1500 m above an Inner Floor where very fresh pillow lavas occur. The Inner Floor {{probably}} includes the locus of new crust; and its bordering slopes, which are particularly well-defined on the western <b>side,</b> <b>limit</b> to less than about 2. 5 km {{the width of the}} zone over which new crust rnay have evolved with little or no vertical displacement. the width of the locus of new crust rnay be less than 0. 5 km between 36 " 45 'N and 36 " 47 'N, where the deepest slopes of the Rift Valley walls nearly merge. Near 36 " 50 rN, the Inner Floor accommodates an approximately 1 km wide, 4 km long Central High, with a height of up to 250 m. In this area, the locus of new crust rnay also occupy a very narrow zone; it rnay lie either along the Central High or along a trough flanking the Central High. The magnetic anomaly pattern indi-cates that, {{since the beginning of the}} Brunhes epoch (6. 9 X 10 ' yr B. P.), the eastern limb has grown approximately twice as fast as the western limb. Using extrapolated spreading rates, the ages of the outer edges of the Rift Valley are 1. 3 and 1. 7 m. y. for the eastern and western sides respectively. Comparison with data for the Rift Valley in other parts of the ocean further suggests that the residence time of new crust in the Rift Valley is about 1. 5 m. y.

Trabalhamos com a hipótese de que políticas administrativas da Educação, elaboradas à margem dos agentes limitam as ações docentes e dificultam a prática pedagógica compartilhada e a criação de novas propostas pedagógicas. Os sujeitos da pesquisa são quatro professores em duas escolas da Rede Municipal de Ensino de São Paulo, procurando-se identificar como integram a sua atuação à proposta pedagógica da escola. Utilizamos três instrumentos de coleta de dados: entrevista, questionário e observação dos professores de Educação Física na Jornada Especial Integral de Formação (JEIF). Fundamentam a pesquisa, entre outros teóricos, Sacristán (1999), Tardif e Raymond (2000), Apple (2006) e autores da Educação Física, entre eles: Bracht (1997), Kunz (2000) e Molina Neto (1997). Os resultados encontrados apontam que a prática pedagógica do professor de Educação Física, ainda que incipiente, tem contribuído para a sua integração à proposta pedagógica da escola, apesar da formação técnica dos professores e da insuficiente estrutura. Nossa hipótese foi respondida parcialmente, uma vez que a maioria das ações dos professores de Educação Física ficou restrita à execução de tarefas e ao cumprimento de atividades elaboradas pela SME. Alguns desses professores, embora de forma tímida, conseguem colocar em prática ações compartilhadas com outras disciplinasThe {{objective of}} this research is to investigate the participation of the Physical Education teacher in the formulation and the pedagogical project performance in Elementary School, aiming in knowing the intervening factors that influence it fundamentally saying.

The participants of the research are four teachers in two schools in the two Municipal Schools of São Paulo, looking forward to identifying how they integrate its performance with the school pedagogical proposal. We use three instruments of data collection: interview, questionnaire and Physical Education teachers´ observation in the Jornada Especial Integral de Formação (JEIF).

The results found indicate that the pedagogical practice of the Physical Education Teacher even though being incipient contributed to the school pedagogical proposal despite the teachers technical graduation and scarce structure.
