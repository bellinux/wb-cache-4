25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years back data), the tribunal estimated the average water yield in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The live storage capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the average yield. The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved <b>salt</b> <b>load</b> generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in industrial, agriculture and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its aquatic ecosystem conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E

50|$|Adélie {{penguins}} {{are faced}} with extreme osmotic conditions, as their frozen habitats offer little fresh water. Such desert conditions means {{that the vast majority}} of the available water is highly saline, causing the diets of Adélie penguins to be highly saline. They manage to circumvent this problem by eating krill with internal concentrations of salt at the lower end of their possible concentrations, helping to lower the amount of ingested salts. The <b>salt</b> <b>load</b> imposed by this sort of diet is still relatively heavy, and can create complications when considering the less tolerant chicks. Adult Adélie penguins feed their chicks by regurgitating the predigested krill, which can impose a heavy <b>salt</b> <b>load</b> on the chicks. Adults address this problem by altering the ion concentrations while the food is still being held in their stomachs. By removing a portion of the sodium and potassium ions, adult Adélie penguins protect their chicks from heavy salt loads. Adélie penguins also manage their salt loads by concentrating cloacal fluids to a much higher degree than most other birds are capable of. This ability is present regardless of ontogeny in Adélie penguins, meaning that both adults and juveniles are capable of extreme levels of salt ion concentration. However, chicks do possess a greater ability to concentrate chloride ions in their cloacal fluids.|$|E

50|$|The uplands of Krishna {{river basin}} located in Maharashtra and Karnataka are {{situated}} on the Deccan Traps which comprises thick seems of basalt rock formations. Basalt rock is prone to chemical weathering contributing more TDS to the river water. Water is not safe for drinking if the TDS exceeds 500 mg/l. The average yearly salt export requirement is nearly 12 million tons in Krishna basin area up to Prakasam Barrage. At least 850 TMC water is required for salt export purpose to maintain water TDS below 500 mg/l. This is including 360 TMC of Krishna river water being used outside the Krishna basin in AP. This water used outside the basin area is also serving the salt export purpose since salts are transferred outside the basin. Thus another 490 TMC is to be let to the sea for salt export purpose. If salt export and environmental needs are considered, no further water allocation is feasible by KWDT-2 in excess of water use allocations made by KWDT-1 earlier. Ultimately, Krishna river basin would be net importer {{of water from the}} adjoining rivers such as Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh and west flowing rivers in Karnataka.

OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the concordance of the two methods of blood pressure measurements in protocols of acute <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> and depletion. METHOD: Systolic blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer at the completion of salt infusion (2 L NaCl 0. 9 %, 4 h) and salt depletion (furosemide, 120 mg/day, p. o.) in 18 volunteers. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient (&# 961;), these readings were compared with the mean systolic blood pressure measured using the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device during the following periods: 4 h of saline infusion and 12 h of salt depletion; 4 h of saline infusion and the last 6 h of salt depletion; 12 h of <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> and the last 6 h of depletion; 12 h of <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> and 12 h of depletion. Salt sensitivity was defined by a difference in the systolic blood pressure between <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> and <b>salt</b> depletion greater than 10 mmHg when measured with the sphygmomanometer, and the Kappa analysis of concordance (K) was used with a significance level of P< 0. 05. RESULTS: Only the blood pressure readings obtained using the ambulatory blood pressure device during 4 h of intravenous NaCl and during 12 h of salt depletion showed a high correlation with the variation in the systolic blood pressure measured by the sphygmomanometer, with a full agreement with the salt sensitivity classification (p = 0. 71; P = 0. 001 and K= 1).

The hypertensive SHRSP and normotensive WKY strains were used in a speed congenic approach to confirm the existence of a QTL on rat chromosome 2. Systolic baseline and <b>salt</b> <b>loaded</b> blood pressures were measured by radiotelemetry. Transfer of the chromosome 2 blood pressure QTL region from WKY into an SHRSP background significantly reduced blood pressure, with the increased significance at the <b>salt</b> <b>loaded</b> period, compared to the SHRSP. The reciprocal congenic blood pressure showed a significantly increased baseline systolic pressure compared to the WKY, with no change in significance at the <b>salt</b> <b>loaded</b> period. Thus we have successfully captured a gene(s) which contribute to blood pressure regulation in both congenic strains. This will facilitate further positional cloning of the causative genes first in this model and then in human essential hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} {{receptor}}s in glomeruli during chronic <b>salt</b> <b>loading.</b> The {{effects of}} chronic <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor density and affinity were studied in isolated renal glomeruli of male Sprague-Dawley rats, which received 0. 9 % saline as drinking fluid (NaCl-rats) and a normal rat chow diet for 35 days (N = 12). Animals on a low sodium intake received the same diet, but deionized water and served as controls (C) (N = 12). After 35 days blood pressure was only slightly increased to 136 ± 9 in NaCl-rats versus 120 ± 2 mm Hg in C (NS). Glomerular filtration rate, plasma cGMP and plasma ANP remained unaltered. Determination of total ANP receptor characteristics in these rats indicated a significant down-regulation of ANP receptors in <b>salt</b> <b>loaded</b> rats. Since ANP-stimulated cGMP formation was not affected by <b>salt</b> <b>loading,</b> the roles of clearance (C) and of biologically active (B) receptors were further evaluated at 21 °C on freshly isolated and acid washed (pH 5) glomeruli in seven animals after 35 days of <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> and in seven animals on a low sodium intake. B-receptors were assessed by blocking C-receptors with 4 - 23 cANP. C-receptor numbers were lower in NaCl-rats (97 ± 8 vs. 184 ± 14 fmol/mg protein in C; N = 7; P < 0. 02), while C-receptor affinity was increased (Kd: 12 ± 3 pM in NaCl-rats vs. 22 ± 5 pM in C; P < 0. 02). Binding sites of B-receptors did not significantly change with high sodium intake (211 ± 16 in NaCl-rats vs. 244 ± 21 fmol/mg protein), but B-receptor affinity was moderately reduced (Kd: 529 ± 27 in NaCl-rats vs. 437 ± 14 pM in C; P < 0. 02). Thus, the decrease in total ANP receptors after <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> was exclusively due to a decrease in C-receptors. During chronic high sodium intake, down-regulation of C-receptors for ANP may indirectly enhance ANP-binding to biologically active B-receptors for ANP within the rat kidney to promote sodium excretion {{in the absence of}} augmented circulating ANP...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{previously}} suggested that <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> produces structural changes of the arteries in hypertensive patients who respond to <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> with a greater rise of blood pressure. This study examined the possibility that <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> alters venous distensibility in hypertensive patients. Twenty-one patients with essential hypertension were placed on a low-sodium diet (70 meq) for 7 days and then were placed on a high-sodium diet (345 meq) for 7 days. Patients were arbitrarily {{divided into two groups}} based on the response of their blood pressure to salt loading: (1) those whose mean blood pressure increased by more than 10 % while on the high-salt diet as compared with those on the low-salt diet (salt-responsive patients, n = 8) and (2) those whose mean blood pressure did not increase by more than 10 % (salt-nonresponsive patients, n = 13). The venous pressure-volume relationship was deter-mined in the forearm with a water-filled plethysmograph when patients were on the low- and high-salt diet. Venous pressure-volume curves were not different between salt-responsive and salt-nonrespon-sive patients while on the low-salt diet. High-salt intake shifted the curve toward the pressure axis for salt-responsive patients (p <. 05) but not for salt-nonresponsive patients. Phentolamine, 1 mg adminis-tered intravenously for 5 min, did not significantly alter venous pressure-volume curves for either group while on the low- or high-salt diet. These results suggest that <b>salt</b> <b>loading</b> decreased venou...|$|R
