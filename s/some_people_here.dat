6000|$|Two men, famous, admired, beloved, {{have just}} left us, the Goldsmith and the Gibbon of our time.* Ere {{a few weeks}} are over, many a critic's pen will be at work, {{reviewing}} their lives, and passing judgment on their works. This is no review, or history, or criticism: only a word in testimony of respect and regard from a man of letters, who owes to his own professional labor the honor of becoming acquainted with these two eminent literary men. One was the first ambassador whom the New World of Letters sent to the Old. He was born almost with the republic; the pater patriae had laid {{his hand on the}} child's head. He bore Washington's name: he came amongst us bringing the kindest sympathy, the most artless, smiling goodwill. His new country (which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>here</b> might be disposed to regard rather superciliously) could send us, as he showed in his own person, a gentleman, who, though himself born in no very high sphere, was most finished, polished, easy, witty, quiet; and, socially, the equal of the most refined Europeans. If Irving's welcome in England was a kind one, was it not also gratefully remembered? If he ate our salt, did he not pay us with a thankful heart? Who can calculate the amount of friendliness and good feeling for our country which this writer's generous and untiring regard for us disseminated in his own? His books are read by millions** of his countrymen, whom he has taught to love England, and why to love her. It would have been easy to speak otherwise than he did: to inflame national rancors, which, at the time when he first became known as a public writer, war had just renewed: to cry down the old civilization {{at the expense of the}} new: to point out our faults, arrogance, short-comings, and give the republic to infer how much she was the parent state's superior. There are writers enough in the United States, honest and otherwise, who preach that kind of doctrine. But the good Irving, the peaceful, the friendly, had no place for bitterness in his heart, and no scheme but kindness. Received in England with extraordinary tenderness and friendship (Scott, Southey, Byron, a hundred others have borne witness to their liking for him), he was a messenger of good-will and peace between his country and ours. [...] "See, friends!" [...] he seems to say, [...] "these English are not so wicked, rapacious, callous, proud, as you have been taught to believe them. I went amongst them a humble man; won my way by my pen; and, when known, found every hand held out to me with kindliness and welcome. Scott is a great man, you acknowledge.

40|$|This paper aims {{to throw}} {{some light on}} {{problems}} of growth and employment that {{appear to have been}} somewhat neglected in the recent development of mainstream economics. As the subtitle suggests we shall make use of a framework of thought that might be called Schumpeterian, in honor of Joseph Schumpeter, who taught in Vienna and Bonn as well as at Yale and Harvard, and who deserves - as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>here</b> in Kiel think - more credit than he usually receives in the shadow of Keynes. This system of thought emphasizes - a medium run time horizon, as distinct from the Keynesian short run and the classical, neoclassical, or Marxian long run; - the cyclical nature of capitalist development, rather than the notions of short run or long run equilibrium, as a basic postulate; the catallactic features of activity in the private sector and hence the information and coordination problems arising in decentralized systems - in contrast to a view which Hicks calls plutologist or social accounting Keynesianism (Hicks 1976); - active or dynamic competition of all sorts (Schumpeter's creative destruction) among entrepreneurs, whom Schumpeter (1912) defined as everyone who carries out new combinations; - autonomy, spontaneity, curiosity, experimenting, and-risk taking as essentials of human action under competitive conditions in business as well as in research - in contrast to the notion of perfect competition and its implicit situational determinism (Latsis 1976); - supply activities rather than demand mechanics, such as demand induced (accelerator) investments or multiplier processes. This approach certainly is supply oriented, in contrast to the demand bias of short run macro-economics. Effective demand is taken to be a consequence (multiplier effect) of private supply activities, i. e. of autonomous investments. A shortfall of demand can be explained in this framework as a consequence of unfavorable conditions for autonomous investments, including - a shortage of technological breakthroughs, - a shortage of factors complementary to investments, - institutional constraints, - a shortage of entrepreneurs, and - a distortion of relative prices depressing profits and profit expectations. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{debate on}} the government’s legal {{response}} to September 11 shows how bad laws can emerge from hasty decisions made in times of danger, according to George Williams, {{the director of the}} Gilbert & Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales. This article is based on his contribution to the conference, ‘The War on Terrorism’: Democracy Under Challenge, held in Melbourne on 9 August. MY STARTING point may be different from that of <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>here.</b> I believe that the federal parliament should enact new anti-terrorism laws. After September 11, such laws are required from the perspective of community confidence and also to fulfill Australia’s international obligations. Before September 11, there were no federal laws dealing specifically with terrorism (in fact such laws could only be found in the Northern Territory). While we need a national legislative response to terrorism, any new laws must strike a balance between national defence and security, and important public values and fundamental human rights. We must not pass laws that damage the same democratic freedoms we are seeking to protect from terrorism. My paper today addresses whether the government’s legislative response to September 11 has achieved the right balance. I argue that it has clearly failed to do so. In fact, the bills introduced in March 2002 into parliament pose as great a threat to Australian democracy as Prime Minister Robert Menzies’ attempt to ban communism in 1950. If passed, the new terrorism bills may do more to undermine the long term health of our democratic system than any threat currently posed by terrorism. I will begin with an examination of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 (Terrorism Bill). That bill has now been enacted by Parliament, but only after being substantially amended to meet a number of objections. I then examine the ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 (ASIO Bill), which has yet to be passed and arguably poses the greater threat to our democratic system. THE FIRST package of anti-terrorism legislation comprised five bills. The bills failed to pass in their original form and were substantially amended after a highly critical and unanimous report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and advocacy by the legal and community sectors. The most important of the first bills was the Terrorism Bill. It defined ‘terrorist act’ as an act or threat that: • involves serious harm to a person or serious damage to property; or • endangers another’s life or creates a serious risk to public health or safety; • seriously interferes with, disrupts or destroys an electronic system; and • is done ‘with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause’. This definition lacked a focus on the ultimate intent of the terrorist act or, put another way, what distinguishes terrorist violence from offences or forms of violence covered in other acts. The definition was so wide that it would have criminalised (with life imprisonment) many forms of civil protest. For example, farmers, unionists or other protesters marching, blockading or mass e-mailing could fall within the definition (the legislation excepted only lawful advocacy, protest or dissent). This aspect of the bill has been amended. The definition of ‘terrorist act’ as enacted includes a new element: the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of: 	(i) 	coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or of part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or (ii) 	intimidating the public or a section of the public. The reference to lawful advocacy, protest or dissent has been removed. Advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action is now excluded from the definition of terrorism so long as it is not intended to, among other things, cause serious physical harm to a person or to create a serious risk to public health or safety. Section 102. 2 of the original bill would also have given the federal attorney general the power to proscribe (or ban) an organisation, followed thereafter by criminal offences, including 25 years jail, for members and supporters of the banned organisation. This power would have enabled the attorney general to ban an organisation for reasons including that the organisation ‘has endangered, or is likely to endanger, the security or integrity of the Commonwealth or another country’. ‘Integrity’ would at least have referred to the geographical, or territorial, integrity of a nation, and hence this power could have been used to proscribe an organisation that advocated or supported non-violent independence movements within other nations. Over recent years, a good example would be organisations supporting independence for East Timor. The power to ban organisations could have been exercised unilaterally by the attorney general and not as part of a fair and accountable process. The attorney general need not have given any reasons for a decision, and any decision would not have been subject to meaningful independent review. It was intended by the government that a decision to proscribe an organisation could be reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth). But this may not have always been available. The capacity to review a decision under section 102. 2 could have been removed by regulation made under section 19 B of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (which would be subject to disallowance, but only when Parliament next sat). A judge might in any event have refused to review a decision made under section 102. 2 where the decision related to a matter of national security. Such matters are usually seen by the courts as non-justiciable. Even if a court was prepared to examine a decision, effective review would require that a proscribed organisation could marshal the evidence needed to show that a decision had not been properly made. This would likely require access to sensitive national security information. This hurdle would almost always be insurmountable. Even if a judge were to proceed to review a decision made under section 102. 2, the grounds of review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act are narrow and procedural. There would be no scope for review on broader proportionality grounds. In orders words, it could not be argued that a decision was wrongly made because it was not ‘reasonably appropriate and adapted’ to the relevant purpose or object. This is a serious limitation upon the scope of review under the Act. If a wrongfully proscribed organisation was successful in having a decision under section 102. 2 overturned, the process of review could take a considerable period during which its reputation and standing in the community could be tarnished irrevocably. Retrospective judicial remedies provide an insufficient means of controlling a power like that under section 102. 2. Clearly, the power to proscribe an organisation (and effectively to destroy it by prosecuting any person who continues {{to be associated with the}} organisation) should not be vested solely in a member of the executive. The Terrorism Bill was similar in design to the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950 (Cth). That Act granted the governor general an unfettered, and unreviewable, power to declare an organisation to be unlawful or a person to be a communist. The act was struck down by the High Court because it granted the governor general an unreviewable and unfettered power. The Terrorism Bill may not have suffered from the same constitutional defect as the Communist Party Dissolution Act because review of a decision of the attorney general would have been available, even if it was ineffective. Despite this, its similarity with the Dissolution Act is of grave concern. Both give a very broad power to a member of the executive to ban an organisation. The separation of powers, including the notion that power must not be concentrated in any one arm of government, suggests that the proscription power should be vested instead in a court, or at least must be subject to a more strict form of scrutiny by an independent tribunal. The dangers of not doing so are obvious. As Sir Owen Dixon stated in the Communist Party Case: History and not only ancient history, shows that in countries where democratic institutions have been unconstitutionally superseded, it has been done not seldom by those holding the executive power. The Terrorism Bill was amended to remove its proscription element. The legislation as enacted does not vest any general power in the attorney general to proscribe organisations and to criminalise their members. Instead, it contains criminal sanctions for involvement with a terrorist organisation, including recruiting members, providing support or funds, directing their activities or being a member. The act defines a terrorist organisation to be ‘an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs) ’. Under a very limited form of proscription, an organisation will also be a terrorist organisation where the attorney general is satisfied that the Security Council of the United Nations has made a decision about terrorism identifying the organisation and ‘the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur) ’. DESPITE a victory in achieving significant changes to the Terrorism Bill, the battle over the legislative response to September 11 has not been won. The Senate has yet to deal with the second package of legislation that would confer unprecedented new powers upon ASIO. The ASIO Bill will likely be debated in the next sittings of the federal parliament beginning on 19 August. This will be a more difficult process than the debate over the Terrorism Bill as it may be more of a challenge to engage Australians and the media in debate on anti-terrorism measures a second time. The politics of the bill will also be more difficult. Objections to the Terrorism Bill could be met through careful amendment. By contrast, the flaws in the ASIO Bill are at a more fundamental level and may require outright rejection of the Bill rather than piecemeal change. Although it is not the intention of the government, the ASIO Bill would establish part of the apparatus of a police state. It is a law that would not be out of place in some former dictatorships. The ASIO Bill would allow adults, and even children, to be detained and strip searched, and to be held by ASIO for rolling periods of two days that could be extended indefinitely. While detained, they could be denied access to people outside of ASIO, and could not inform their employer, family members or even a lawyer of their detention. Section 34 F(8) of the bill states: ‘A person who has been taken into custody, or detained, under this Division is not permitted to contact, and may be prevented from contacting, anyone at any time while in custody or detention. ’ ASIO would require a warrant from a ‘prescribed authority’ for the detention of an Australian citizen. However, this need not be obtained from a judge. The bill enables a warrant to be granted by a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), a non-judicial body whose officers are members of the executive. Moreover, members of the AAT, other than presidential members, are appointed for fixed periods and lack entrenched independence or tenure. They are dependent upon the favour of the executive if seek reappointment. The ASIO Bill would authorise the detention of Australians without charges being laid, or even the possibility that they might be laid. Australians could be held by ASIO not because they have engaged in terrorism or are likely to do so, but because they know something about a terrorist offence. They could be held without access to legal advice and without the normal rights to silence and to avoid self-incrimination (a five year jail term applies for refusing to answer a question). While the bill says that detainees ‘must be treated with humanity and with respect for human dignity’, there is no penalty for ASIO officers who subject detainees to cruel, inhumane or degrading punishment. In fact, under section 92 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) it is an offence to even publish the identity of an ASIO officer. The ASIO Bill is inconsistent with basic democratic and judicial principles. Australians should not be detained except as a result of a finding of guilt by a judge or as part of the judicial process (such as being held in custody pending a bail hearing). Neither parliament nor any part of government should be given the power to detain Australians without a trial except for well known exceptions such as mental illness or infectious disease. This underpins Australia’s democratic system and the separation of powers entrenched by the Australian Constitution. The ASIO Bill breaches basic principles and could be challenged in the High Court. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD reported in May 2002. The committee, including members of the government, found that the legislation ‘would undermine key legal rights and erode the civil liberties that make Australia a leading democracy’. Despite this, the committee made only modest recommendations about the operational aspects of the legislation, including that it not apply to children and that people be detained for a maximum of seven days. The committee failed to address the main issue. That is, a government should not have the power to detain Australian citizens where there is no suspicion that they have committed an offence. It has never been recognised that Australian citizens should be detained incommunicado to help ASIO with its inquiries. Australians should not accept the imprisonment of citizens except as part of a fair and independent judicial process resulting from allegations of criminal conduct. There are grave dangers in allowing a government to bypass the courts, especially where a secret government organisation is involved. It would not be acceptable to the community for a state police force to secretly detain people for lengthy periods, nor should it be for ASIO. Even lesser police powers should not be granted to an organisation except in circumstances where their exercise is subject to a high level of accountability, including public scrutiny. If ASIO is to be granted new police powers it must be subject to the political and community scrutiny and controls that would apply to any other police force. However, this is not compatible with the current intelligence gathering work of ASIO and its organisational structure (such as in regard to the secrecy applying to the identity of its employees). It would be difficult, if not impossible, for ASIO both to be sufficiently secretive to adequately fulfil its primary mission, as well as sufficiently open to scrutiny as would be necessary for it to exercise the powers set out in the ASIO Bill. DESPITE substantial amendment of the Terrorism Bill, it remains likely that Parliament will enact legislation abrogating civil liberties and our democratic principles to a greater extent than any piece of legislation since the anti-communist law of 1950. The powers to be given to ASIO may not be used against the Australian people today, or even over the next decade, but we cannot guess at the wisdom and motives of a government in 10, 20 or even 50 years time. The stakes are high and we are now in the thick of the debate. The following weeks will be crucial. We must deny ASIO the power to detain Australians where there is no suspicion that they have committed a crime. If we do not, a new precedent in law enforcement will have been set, and once that line is crossed there may be no coming back. The {{debate on the}} government’s legal response to September 11 shows how bad laws can emerge from hasty decisions made in times of danger. We must keep this in mind in ensuring that our Parliament does not enact anti-terrorism laws that we are likely to regret for many years to come.

Therefore, the population is divided into tribes who are part of the Kelmend region: Lajç, Nikç, Muriq, Vukël and Selcë. According to legend, the tribes were created by the four sons of the tribe leader, with the origin from Bishtanini. The sons of Nikë Deda came to the land of Rugova, and they gave the villages names that reflected their origins, such as Drelaj from Dreli, Stankaj from Stank, Pepaj (Pepiq) from Pepi, Nokshiq from Noku. However, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> settled <b>here</b> because of the feud.|$|R

I thought at first I'd pretend to be sick and not go to church next day, but I decided I couldn't do that, {{because it would be}} acting a lie, and father told us after mother died that was {{something}} we must never, never do. It is just as bad to act a lie as to tell one, though I know <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> right <b>here</b> in the Glen, who act them, and never seem to feel a bit bad about it. I will not mention any names, but I know who they are and so does father.|$|R

Aaron Rubashkin, {{the owner of the}} company said that he had no idea that his workers were illegal and that they had produced what appeared to be legitimate work documents. Getzel Rubashkin, one of his grandsons who worked at the plant, was reported as saying: “Obviously <b>some</b> of the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> were presenting false documents.
