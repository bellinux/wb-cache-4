The next day, Dr. Arden visits her, concerned, though he eyes her scantily-clothed body. When she awakens, {{he tells her}} he is embarrassed seeing {{her out of her}} habit.

25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance behaviors. For instance, a student may leave the room when talking {{in front of the}} class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable <b>shaking.</b> <b>A</b> fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E

The music video for [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] was {{directed}} by Jackson and Vincent Paterson. It premiered on Top of the Pops in the UK on March 28, 1997, several weeks ahead of its release as a single. The video opens with a thrown switchblade impaling a spray painted image. The impaled image is that of a blood dripping love heart with [...] "SUSIE + ME" [...] scrawled across it. Jackson and a group of dancers then enter a salsa dance hall and he begins to dance with a woman, [...] "Susie", while <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> piece of percussion. The singer then appears seated while the woman dances seductively above him on a table top.|$|E

500|$|The male {{displays}} {{in a tree}} in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviours such as <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over three or four days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when re-nesting following nest failure. The nest is a small untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. The clutch size can be anywhere from one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval-shaped and measure [...] Incubation lasts around 23days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with down at hatching, but are not capable of fending for themselves; they become capable of regulating their temperature at 9–12days and are fully feathered in 13–21days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2weeks, fledge at 30days and become independent at around the 45th day.|$|E
500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if {{you have to go to}} Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E

2500|$|The gold {{sovereign}} appears quite a small coin, {{but with}} a face value of £1 it had, in 1895, the same purchasing power as £103 in 2014. Gold is a dense metal: the sovereign contains 0.23542 ounces of gold, with a total weight of 0.25682 ounces. A reason to limit production of double sovereigns (£2) and quintuple sovereigns (£5) was the relative ease of removing gold from these larger coins — chemically, by filing, or using other techniques; for example, drilling small holes into the coin followed by hammering to conceal the holes, or [...] "sweating": <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> leather bag full of coins {{for a long period}} and collecting the gold dust that was knocked off.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous images of the event was the live {{broadcast}} of Hoy Mismo, a news program in the Televisa television network, when the earthquake struck. In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were María Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing {{the underside of the}} desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped no one could see how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating [...] "...it's still <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will wait just a second so we can keep talking." [...] Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had bent over and crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Niños Héroes and Dr. Río de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores.|$|E
2500|$|After Never So Few, the film's {{director}} John Sturges cast McQueen in {{his next}} movie, promising to [...] "give him the camera". The Magnificent Seven (1960), in which he played Vin Tanner and co-starred with Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson and James Coburn, became McQueen's first major hit and led to his withdrawal from Wanted: Dead or Alive. McQueen's focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches {{in many of the}} shots, such as <b>shaking</b> <b>a</b> shotgun round before loading it, repeatedly checking his gun while in the background of a shot, and wiping his hat rim, annoyed costar Brynner, who protested that McQueen was trying to steal scenes. (In his autobiography, Eli Wallach reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral-procession scene where Brynner's and McQueen's characters first meet: Brynner was furious at McQueen's shotgun-round-shake, which effectively diverted the viewer's attention to McQueen.) Brynner refused to draw his gun in the same scene with McQueen, not wanting his character outdrawn.|$|E
