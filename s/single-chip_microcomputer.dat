This was disputed by Gilbert Hyatt, {{formerly of the}} Micro Computer Company, in August 1990 when he was awarded a patent superseding TI's. This was over-turned on June 19, 1996 in favor of TI (note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor).|$|E
50|$|The MC6801 was a <b>single-chip</b> <b>microcomputer</b> with a 6802 CPU with 128 bytes of RAM, a 2 KB ROM, a 16-bit timer, 31 {{programmable}} parallel I/O lines, and {{a serial}} port. It could {{also use the}} I/O lines as data and address buses to connect to standard M6800 peripherals. The 6801 would execute 6800 code but it had ten additional instructions and the execution time of key instructions was reduced. The two 8-bit accumulators could act as a single 16-bit accumulator for double precision addition, subtraction and multiplication. It was initially designed for automotive use with General Motors as the lead customer. The first application was a trip computer for the 1978 Cadillac Seville. This 35,000 transistor chip was too expensive for wide-scale adoption in automobiles so a reduced function MC6805 <b>single-chip</b> <b>microcomputer</b> was designed. The MC6809 was the most advanced 8-bit microprocessor Motorola produced. It had a new instruction set that {{was similar to the}} 6800 but abandoned op-code compatibility for improved performance and high-level language support; the two were software compatible in that assemblers could (and generally did) generate code which was equivalent to 6800 opcodes the 6809 did not directly emulate. In that sense, the 6809 was upward compatible with the 6800. The 6809 had many 16-bit operations, including the first 8-bit multiply instruction (generating a 16 bit product) in a microprocessor, two 16-bit index registers and stack pointers, and full support for both position independent (object code could run wherever it was loaded in memory) and reentrant (object code could be written to be reused by other routines), these last features previously seen only in much larger machines such as IBM 360 mainframes.|$|E
