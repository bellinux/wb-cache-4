The power performance and the fuel economy are key indicators in practical cargo transportation, resulting from the matching performance in the transmission system, being relative and restricted to each other. The indicators on evaluation and test methods are put forward depending on the analyses on factors of power performance and fuel economy. The weights of factors are defined by analytic hierarchy process, and the model on power performance and fuel economy of articulated vehicle trains are established and verified by practicing on real road tests. The evaluation model is serving as an indicator on matching power performance and fuel economy of articulated vehicle trains and an important indicator in assembling articulated vehicle trains for road cargo transport enterprises.

40|$|A novel {{control scheme}} is {{proposed}} to improve the yaw stability of a <b>tractor</b> <b>semitrailer</b> vehicle in critical situations. The control scheme is a two-layer structure consisting of an upper yaw moment controller and a lower brake force distributor. The tractor and the trailer are, respectively, stabilized by two independent fuzzy logic based yaw moment controllers. The controllers for the tractor and the trailer are, respectively, designed to track the reference yaw rate of the tractor and the hitch angle between the tractor and the trailer while considering the variation of the hitch angular rate at the same time. The corrective yaw moments determined by the corresponding upper fuzzy yaw moment controllers are realized by active wheel braking. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated by simulations on a nonlinear vehicle model. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is robust and effective in stabilizing the severe instabilities such as jackknife and trailer oscillation in the chosen simulation scenarios. It is believed that this control scheme is robust to the variation of road adhesion conditions...|$|R
40|$|Handling {{instability}} is {{a serious}} threat to driving safety. In order to analyze the handling stability of a <b>tractor</b> <b>semitrailer,</b> a handling diagram can be used. In our research, considering the impact of multiple nonsteering rear axles and nonlinear characteristics of tires on vehicle handling stability, the handling equations are developed for description of stability of tractor semi-trailer. Then we obtain handling diagrams so as to study the influence of driving speed, loaded mass, and fifth wheel lead on vehicle handling stability. The analysis results show that the handling stability of a tractor semi-trailer when the tractor has two nonsteering rear axles is better than that when the tractor has only one nonsteering rear axle. While the stability in the former case is slightly influenced by driving speed and loaded mass, the latter is strongly influenced by both. The fifth wheel lead is found to only slightly influence handling stability for both tractor semi-trailers. Therefore, to ensure the driving safety of tractor semi-trailers when the tractor has only one nonsteering rear axle, much stricter restraints should be imposed on driving speed, and the loaded mass must not exceed the rated load of the trailer...|$|R
40|$|Lateral load {{transfer}} ratio (LTR) is a criterion {{that is often}} used for designing ground vehicle rollover warning technologies to indicate the vehicles rollover status. Generally, LTR index depends on road geometry and vehicle characteristics. However, crosswind loads {{have the potential to}} influence the roll stability and therefore the safety of road vehicles particularly large commercial units. This study provides improved methodology for the computation of the LTR index for a high-sided <b>tractor</b> <b>semitrailer</b> vehicle under crosswind conditions. For this purpose, since experiments on real vehicles for active safety technology are difficult to carry out, a coupled simulation of transient crosswind aerodynamics and multi-body vehicle dynamics has been proposed. Based on CFD method, a large-eddy simulation (LES) technique was employed to predict the transient crosswind aerodynamic forces. Then, the predicted aerodynamic forces were input into multi-body dynamic simulations of the tractor semi-trailer vehicle that were performed through ADAMS/Car software. Simulation results show that comparing to the traditional LTR index, the LTR under crosswind is more efficient to detect manoeuvre-induced rollovers. This trailer rollover indicator that has been improved by the proposed methodology can provide more reliable information to the warning or control system in the presence of wind conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} part of a series of reports {{evaluating}} the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash file was incomplete. This report examines the factors that are associated with reporting rates for the state of Ohio. This is the second MCMIS evaluation for the state of Ohio. Using 2005 data, MCMIS Crash file records were matched to the Ohio Police Accident Report (PAR) file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Based on this procedure, it is estimated that Ohio is reporting 42. 5 percent of crash involvements that should be reported to the Crash file. This represents an improvement over the 35. 8 percent reported in the first evaluation using 2000 data. Although the overall reporting rate was 42. 5 percent, the reporting rate for carriers operating in interstate commerce was 79. 1 percent, compared to 17. 0 percent for intrastate carriers. Reporting rates also varied by crash severity, vehicle type, and reporting agency. The reporting rate for fatal involvements was 85. 4 percent, compared to 52. 7 percent for injured and transported involvements, and 32. 3 percent for towaway. Crashes involving large trucks such as <b>tractor</b> <b>semitrailers</b> were more likely to be reported than single-unit trucks or buses. Crashes covered by the Ohio State Patrol were more likely to be reported than those covered by sherriff’s offices or local police departments.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research presented in this thesis is to enhance driver comfort and handling of a heavy truck that in turn leads to better vehicle safety and stability. The focus {{has been put on}} studying two suspension systems of the truck, engine and front axle suspensions, due to their significant impact on the dynamic performance of the vehicle. At first, a computational model that evaluates the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the elastomeric engine mounts is developed and successfully verified and validated against measurement data. This model is then utilized to examine adaptronic mounting systems in which actuators, sensors and controller are incorporated in the passive engine suspension. Widely used conventional engine mounts in commercial vehicles cannot fulfill the conflicting requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced excitations. Hence, to improve the noise and vibration suppression it is necessary to go beyond passive isolators and use semi-active/active suspension. The results of simulations of engine vibration dynamics and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure have shown good potential for adaptronic engine mount setup. Subsequently, the effects of front axle suspension design, i. e. Individual Front Suspension (IFS) as well as semi-active damper, on the comfort and handling characteristics of the vehicle are discussed. Employing the model of the <b>tractor</b> <b>semitrailer</b> combination, the study presents the results of comparison between the trucks with IFS and rigid front axle by assessing the responses of the vehicles to various road excitations and steering input. The obtained results show enhanced comfort and steering feeling for the truck with IFS. Moreover, the capabilities of a semi-active front axle suspension are investigated through control strategies such as skyhook, Linear Quadratic (LQ) and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The developed controllers are verified by simulation with respect to the identified road inputs and maneuvers. The outcome of the semi-active damper compared to that of the passive suspension that are presented quantitatively and qualitatively clearly show the great influence of the semi-active dampers on the vehicle dynamic performance. With continuous semi-active dampers accelerations in the cab are decreased particularly up to wheel hop frequency. Also, tire forces are either unchanged or improved. Hence, unlike passive suspension that is a compromise between ride comfort and handling, semi-active suspension facilitates enhancing both target criteria...|$|R
