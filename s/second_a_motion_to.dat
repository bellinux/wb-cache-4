In September 1943, he became Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services and was responsible for implementing the Labor government's ambitions to expand social security programs. During World War II, his three sons served in the Second Australian Imperial Force, one was captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore and another died as a prisoner of war in Germany. In June 1946, he became Minister for Trade and Customs (losing the Social Services portfolio) on the death of Richard Keane, but was not re-elected to the ministry in November 1946. As a backbencher, he became a forceful critic of Labor leader, H. V.

50|$|On 1 May 1861 the Bishop of London and Bishop CR Sumner of Winchester {{proposed}} and <b>seconded</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> adopt <b>a</b> new {{title for the}} Society: the Colonial and Continental Church Society. The aim was to reflect more accurately the twin spheres of its work. During this period it became the pioneer of popular education in Canada, developed subsidiary missions and established theological education there, and missions to the Eskimo. It supported expansion into the Canadian Far West {{which led to a}} new departure following Archbishop Matheson's (Rupertsland) speech to the Society's AGM in 1905, 'Fancy what it would mean {{for the future of the}} Church if the Church could be established concurrently with incoming settlement...to plant the Church and sustain it for a few years, and it will soon sustain itself.' Now the Church's missionaries were to accompany the tide of settlers rather than follow them. In the early years of the 20th century there was a vastly increased immigration into the NW Territories where a large 'colony' of British subjects was being organized for settling in a district of Saskatchewan, and GE Lloyd (a deputation Secretary of the Society) volunteered to accompany it. It was called the 'Britannia' Colony. It settled an area larger than Yorkshire with 22 townships of 36 square miles each - initially of 157,000 rising to 404,000 people. In 1906 he returned to England, appealed for, and took out, 60 ordination candidates (the 'Saskatchewan 60'). Lloyd originated other ideas: Sunday School by Post and a Church Workers' Hostel (to train women for Church work). By 1913 some 200 clergy and lay workers had gone out to western Canada.|$|R
50|$|In 1851, Ironside <b>seconded</b> <b>a</b> council <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> call <b>a</b> {{public meeting}} {{to decide whether}} a local bill should be applied for that year. The meeting was little-attended, but {{supported}} the proposal. The bill claimed for Sheffield {{a wide range of}} powers, which would include the absorption of the Church Burgesses and the Town Trustees. These two measures were later dropped in order to minimise Parliamentary opposition. A public meeting was held in December and was dominated by Chartists. They opposed it {{on the grounds that it}} did not introduce a universal male franchise for the council, and that it would for the first time impose rates on housing with a rateable value of Â£7 or less per year. The meeting rejected the bill. Ironside also moved to oppose it, but his change in position alienated both colleagues in favour of it and members who had opposed it from the start.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} July, {{public opinion}} started to turn against the scheme and at least four public {{petitions}} were tabled in the Legislative Assembly about the scheme. On 29 July 1953, M.V Krishna Rao, the minister for education moved <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> for considering the new scheme. After a discussion, Communist leader K. P Gopalan moved <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> drop the scheme. The house was deadlocked with 138 ayes to 138 noes on dropping the scheme. The speaker of the assembly J. Shivashanmugam Pillai used his casting vote <b>to</b> defeat the <b>motion.</b> <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> defer the scheme and refer it to a committee of experts was moved by K.R Viswanatham. This motion passed with 138 ayes against 137 noes. The Scheme was stayed and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme.|$|R

The Senate Democratic Leadership, Democrats opposed to civil unions, and Senate Republicans {{voted in favor of}} an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between civil unions and marriage and allowing same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter civil unions. The amendment was adopted, which killed the bill, as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Legislature adjourned May 8, 2009. Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not be taken up again before 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Senator Will Espero {{offered an}} {{amendment}} to the bill that would have reduced the number of benefits granted, stating this would remove concerns that civil unions were similar to marriage. Passing an amended bill would have required the House to vote on it again or to establish a conference committee to negotiate differences between versions of both chambers. Supporters of civil unions stated they would not support the compromise, and a senator argued that [...] "an amendment will kill it." [...] Hawaii Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser stated in March 2009 he would try to bring the bill to a vote if no other senator did so {{by the end of the}} legislative session in May 2009. It was not clear how many senators supported Hooser and opposing groups announced protests if action was taken. On March 25, 2009, the attempt to bring the bill before the full Senate failed when six senators supported the measure instead of the required nine senators. Senate President Colleen Hanabusa and JGO chairman Brian Taniguchi had opposed recalling H.B. 444 from Taniguchi's committee, citing unwillingness to change the traditional lawmaking process.On May 7, 2009, <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> recall the bill from committee, initiated by Senator Les Ihara, Jr., was successful after 10 Democrats voted in favor.

25|$|When a court {{considers}} <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> dismiss, it {{must take}} the allegations in the Plaintiff's complaint as true and construe the Complaint {{in a manner that}} is favorable to the Plaintiff.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{requiring}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{is to prevent}} time being wasted by the assembly's having <b>to</b> dispose of <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> that only one person wants to see introduced. Hearing <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> is guidance <b>to</b> the chair that he should state the question on the motion, thereby placing it before the assembly. It does not necessarily indicate that the seconder favors the motion.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> lay on {{the table}} <b>to</b> kill <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> is improper; instead, <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> {{postpone}} indefinitely should be used. Similarly, it is improper <b>to</b> use the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> lay on the table <b>to</b> postpone something; <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> postpone <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain time {{should be used in}} this case. If debate is not desired, <b>a</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> close debate (the previous question) should be used. One of the disadvantages of trying to kill a measure by laying it on the table is that, if some opponents of the measure subsequently leave the meeting, a temporary majority favoring the measure can then take it from the table and act on it; or they may do so at the next session if held within a quarterly time interval.|$|R
