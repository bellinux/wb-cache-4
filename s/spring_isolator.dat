40|$|Abstract. A {{molecular}} <b>spring</b> <b>isolator</b> {{which consists}} of water and hydrophobic zeolites as working medium is investigated. When the isolator undergoes periodic excitation, water intrudes into hydrophobic pores of zeolites depending on the external pressure and extrudes from the pores as hydraulic pressure decreases. As a result, molecular spring absorbs, releases and dissipates mechanism energy. To obtain the stiffness properties of molecular <b>spring</b> <b>isolator,</b> the mechanics modal of water column intruding into a hydrophobic pore is established utilizing force equilibrium. Subsequently, the process of water infiltrating large numbers of hydrophobic pores is explored. Then the quasi-static experiment is carried out to validate the theoretical modal. It is found that the molecular spring exhibits high static and low dynamic stiffness. Finally, the effect of quantity of zeolites and temperature on stiffness of molecular spring is investigated experimentally...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{commonly}} used performance indicator for vibration isolation - force transmissibility - over-simplifies the vibration problem. Therefore, Mak and Su propose a power transmissibility approach that includes the effect of floor dynamics and the interactions of the mounting points between machine and floor. However, their model does not consider transient vibration excitation. The question motivating {{this study is the}} occasional problem which arises due to the sudden or frequent starting and stopping of vibratory machines. In this paper, a transient power transmissibility approach is proposed to assess the performance of isolators in a transient vibration excitation. A spring-mass-movable floor system is considered in the simulation, and the <b>spring</b> <b>isolator</b> is first selected using the steady-state power transmissibility approach of Mak and Su. A system disturbed by two transient excitations as typically experienced by building services equipment is then analyzed. The results indicate the necessity of using transient power transmissibility in the selection of isolators for a transient vibration. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Molecular <b>Spring</b> <b>Isolator</b> (MSI) {{is a novel}} passive {{vibration}} isolation technique, providing High-Static-Low-Dynamic (HSLD) stiffness based {{on the use of}} molecular spring material. The molecular spring material is a solid-liquid mixture consisting of water and hydrophobic nanoporous materials. Under a certain level of external pressure, water molecules can intrude into the hydrophobic pores of nanoporous materials, developing an additional solid-liquid interface. Such interfaces are able to store, release, and transform mechanical energy, providing properties like mechanical spring. Having been only recently developed, the basic mechanic properties of a MSI have not been studied in depth. This paper focuses on the stiffness influence factors, the dynamic frequency response, and the {{vibration isolation}} performance of a MSI; these properties help engineers to design MSIs for different engineering applications. First, the working mechanism of a MSI is introduced from a three-dimensional general view of the water infiltration massive hydrophobic nanoporous pores. Next, a wide range of influence factors on the stiffness properties of MSI are studied. In addition, the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the MSI vibration isolation system are studied utilizing the matching method based on equivalent piecewise linear (EPL) system. Finally, the vibration isolation properties of MSI are evaluated by force transmissibility...|$|E
40|$|Force {{transmissibility}} {{is usually}} employed by engineers to select suitable vibration isolators for building services equipment. In the derivation of this usual engineering force transmissibility, floor structure {{is assumed to}} be unmovable and the effect of floor mobility is neglected. Based on this assumption, the use of <b>spring</b> <b>isolators</b> will certainly reduce sound power transmitted to the floor for all values of the ratio of forcing frequency and natural frequency greater than 1. 414. However, floor structure is flexible and movable in reality. This paper will therefore discuss the effect of floor mobility on structure-borne sound power transmission from which it is shown that <b>spring</b> <b>isolators</b> do not help in vibration isolation at disturbing frequencies near the resonant frequency of the floor and may even worsen the problem at those particular frequencies.

50|$|A block lift (often {{referred}} to as a budget lift) is a modification that is similar to a body lift in the way it works, but used in a different location. Block lifts are used to provide more room between the body and axle of a vehicle for larger tires. A block lift consists of either extended <b>spring</b> <b>isolators</b> or blocks that are inserted between a vehicles axle and spring, or a spring and the vehicles body. This type of lift is often preferred due to the affordability and ease of installation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Spring</b> {{vibration}} <b>isolators</b> {{and rubber}} damping vibration isolators {{are often used}} in active isolation engineering of {{water source heat pump}} units. The method is inefficient in shock and low frequency vibration isolation. Because the stiffness of equipments reduces with the isolation system the vibration severity itself becomes too big for working safely. Particle damping materials can absorb vibration energy to reduce vibration. The paper testifies that successful application of particle damping materials in vibration reduction of water source heat pump units is a practical simple way with low cost...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{automotive}} Front End Accessory Drives (FEAD), the crankshaft supplies {{power to}} accessories like alternators, pumps, etc. When the FEAD undergoes forced vibration due to crankshaft excitation, dynamic tension fluctuations {{can cause the}} belt to slip on the accessory pulleys.

40|$|International audienceBelt drives {{employing}} a single, flat serpentine belt tensioned by a passive tensioner {{are found in}} automotive engine Front End Accessory Drive (FEAD) where the crankshaft supplies power to accessories like alternators, air-conditioning compressors, pumps, etc. [1]. When the FEAD undergoes forced vibration due to crankshaft excitation, dynamic tension fluctuations can cause the belt to slip on the accessory pulleys [2]. The probability of belt slip increases with the peak drop in belt tension over the pulley during steady state operation [3]. In this paper, one possible solution is analyzed, using a decoupler to isolate/separate the accessory inertia (e. g. alternator) from the FEAD system. This is achieved by placing between the pulley and the accessory {{a combination of a}} one-way rigid clutch and an <b>isolator</b> <b>spring.</b> In this study, the rotational response of a typical FEAD is extended to include the clutch and isolator. An analytical solution is then obtained by considering it as a piecewise-linearized system moving about an equilibrium angular displacements. The performance of the ordinary FEAD with regard to tension fluctuation is then compared to that of the system equipped with a decoupler/isolator. The results obtained indicate that within the practical working range of engine speeds, use of either an isolator or a decoupler-isolator could significantly lower the dynamic tension drop across the accessory pulley...|$|R
40|$|A {{vibration}} {{source is}} commonly coupled to a receiving structure by a vibration isolator. A key trade-off {{in the choice}} of vibration isolator is the requirement for a wide frequency range of isolation without excessive static deflection. This compromise can, in principle, be circumvented by employing a softening nonlinear isolator that presents a high stiffness to the weight of the isolated mass but a low tangent stiffness {{in the vicinity of the}} equilibrium position. The first part of this thesis is concerned with the static response of a number of elements that are expected to exhibit such a nonlinear stiffness characteristic. A mechanism with geometrical nonlinearity is studied first and found to offer some benefits compared with a similar one reported in the literature. Beams are commonly employed as linear springs and their suitability as nonlinear isolators is considered here. It is shown that the stiffness of a simply supported beam loaded transversely at its centre is of a hardening type in contrast to what is reported in the literature. Post-buckled beams are also investigated as candidates for nonlinear <b>springs</b> of vibration <b>isolators</b> although the sudden change in stiffness at the buckling point is unfavourable. Curved beams and beams with eccentric loading are investigated as alternatives to a straight axially loaded post-buckled beam. Static analyses are presented which show that curvature or eccentricity in loading can be incorporated to smooth the force-deflection curves. A commercially available rubber isolation mount is also studied as an example of an axially loaded curved element and its force-deflection characteristic measured. The hypothesis that it can be modelled by a curved beam is found not to hold. The inter-variability observed between samples is evaluated which illustrates the potential for mistune of nonlinear mounts in general. Nonlinear stiffness gives rise to the possibility of asymmetry about the equilibrium position, either as an inherent characteristic of the isolator or as a result of a mistuned added mass or static preload. A nonlinear isolator with asymmetric stiffness is modelled as a Duffing oscillator. The force transmissibility of the oscillator is obtained analytically using the Harmonic Balance Method from which the performance of the isolator is evaluated quantitatively as a function of both static load and mistuned mass. A study is presented for the case of a nonlinear isolator comprised of a curved beam. The high stiffness of the beam in extension causes impulsive behaviour in the transmitted force which is alleviated by the inclusion of a linear spring placed in series. It is shown that this combination significantly outperforms a linear isolator with the same static deflection...|$|R
