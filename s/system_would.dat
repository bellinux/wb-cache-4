5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be needed to provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with {{a limited number of}} warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E

5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This <b>system</b> <b>would</b> {{be similar to the}} existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading <b>system</b> <b>would</b> allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E
50|$|Many years later, {{successful}} commercial {{speech recognition}} <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> {{use the technology}} developed by the Carnegie Mellon team (such as hidden Markov models) and the market for speech recognition <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> reach $4 billion by 2001.|$|R
5000|$|More complex, {{and often}} more open <b>systems,</b> <b>would</b> have {{relatively}} lower extent of predictability, due to absence of clearly structured behavioural patterns. Analysing such system, is therefore much harder. Such <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> be stochastic, or probabilistic, {{this is because}} of the stochastic nature of human beings whilst performing various activities. Having said that, designed <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> still be considered as deterministic, due to a rigid structure of rules incorporated into the design.|$|R
5000|$|Interoperability: WBAN <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> have {{to ensure}} {{seamless}} data transfer across standards such as Bluetooth, ZigBee etc. to promote information exchange, {{plug and play}} device interaction. Further, the <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> have to be scalable, ensure efficient migration across networks and offer uninterrupted connectivity.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a {{forecast}} by city planners in 1967 which stated {{the need for a}} rail-based urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be more cost-effective, then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong, {{came to the conclusion that}} an all-bus <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country.|$|E
5|$|After the two-car draft style {{dominated}} the 2011Budweiser Shootout, NASCAR reduced the front grille opening to 50square inches and the overflow valve for the cooling <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be supplied by NASCAR and set at 33pounds per square inch. Also, high speeds {{in the race}} caused NASCAR {{to reduce the size}} of the restrictor plate by 1/64-inch, with the expectations of cutting 10horsepower from the engines.|$|E
5|$|At {{particular}} issue was {{the ability of}} sensors to differentiate an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts argued that a more comprehensive compliance <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be necessary.|$|E

25|$|The Wang VS product line, not {{actively}} marketed since the 1993 bankruptcy {{and a tiny}} portion of the Getronics business, survived in use into the 21st century; by 2006 about 1,000 to 2,000 systems remained in service worldwide. In 2014, CompuCom announced that all support for legacy VS <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> cease {{at the end of}} 2014, while support for New VS <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> continue through TransVirtual Systems.|$|R
5|$|At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona {{players that}} had {{graduated}} from the club's La Masia youth <b>system</b> <b>would</b> {{play a major role}} in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of which were Barcelona players whom started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Illinois, Polish-born {{research}} engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner {{was working}} independently {{on a similar}} process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture {{to members of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers. As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's <b>system</b> <b>would</b> never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's soon would.|$|E
5|$|Brønnøysund Airport {{installed}} the SCAT-I satellite-based landing system on 29 October 2007. Avinor's Steinar Hamar stated {{at the opening}} ceremony that the <b>system</b> <b>would</b> have prevented both Flight 710 and Flight 744 at Namsos Airport in 1993. The roll-out, taking place at most of Avinor's regional airports, is scheduled for completion in 2013.|$|E
30|$|Thus, it is {{expected}} that good quality of E-learning software <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> be developed using the proposed prioritization technique. It is also expected that Mobile compatible E-learning <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> be launched soon so that “any time and any place” access could be provided (M-Learning). Advancement in the area of Software engineering, Mobile Communications and Web Technologies would improve quality of E-learning and hence teaching quality.|$|R

5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be best to {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, {{there had been a}} series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
5|$|In Dyson's {{original}} paper, he {{speculated that}} sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern {{to that of}} humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors. Constructing such a <b>system</b> <b>would</b> make such a civilization a Type II Kardashev civilization.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune <b>system</b> <b>would</b> potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E

5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} {{operable}} {{with the}} current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be capable of integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for Barbados, St. Vincent, and Saint Lucia on August15. The following day the watches were changed to warnings, since forecasters predicted that the <b>system</b> <b>would</b> reach tropical storm status. Additional watches and warnings were also issued {{for the rest of}} Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France. The revised points <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed a little bit in 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Gliese 581c and its mass have been {{measured by the}} radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets. The mass of a planet is calculated by the small periodic movements around a common centre of mass between the host star Gliese 581 and its planets. When all six planets are fitted with a Keplerian solution, the minimum mass of the planet is determined to be 5.5 Earth masses. The radial velocity method cannot by itself determine the true mass, but it cannot be very much larger than this or the <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be dynamically unstable. Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system which assume the orbits of the planets are coplanar indicate that the planets cannot exceed approximately 1.6 to 2 times their minimum masses or the planetary <b>system</b> <b>would</b> be unstable (this is primarily due to the interaction between planets e and b). For Gliese 581c, the upper bound is 10.4 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} {{if the air}} is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his <b>system</b> <b>would</b> cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|While Nike-X {{could be}} {{expected}} to attack these with a reasonable 1 to 1 exchange ratio, compared to Zeus' 20 to 1, it could only do so over a limited area. Most nationwide deployment scenarios contained thousands of Sprint missiles protecting only the largest US cities. Such a <b>system</b> <b>would</b> cost an estimated $40 billion to build ($ billion in , about half the annual military budget).|$|E
50|$|AA+ {{would use}} 60 ns DRAM, but AA+ <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> {{need at least}} 4 MB as a {{standard}} to support RTG and packed (Chunky) pixels, an A1200 like <b>systems</b> (A1400?) <b>would</b> most likely be shipped with 8 MB which was the standard in 1994 for low end PCs.|$|R
