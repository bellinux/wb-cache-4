5000|$|Fordham Road is {{the largest}} station on the Concourse Line in terms of space, as it {{contains}} numerous closed stairs and passageways. The southbound island platform widens {{at the north end}} of the station to facilitate a wall that splits it half, creating two [...] "side" [...] platforms. The northbound island platform is like others found throughout the system. During construction of the station, the main road of Grand Concourse was diverted into an underpass below Fordham Road, while the subway tracks were placed underneath either service road; the space in between the split southbound platform is likely where the underpass dips below grade-level. The <b>split</b> <b>portion</b> of the southbound platform once had a passageway from the northernmost staircase at the Fordham Road side from the middle track to the local one; it is cordoned off permanently by a wall and employee-only door.|$|E

There is no {{data on the}} quality of first-line drugs content in split fixed-dose combination tablets. To determine Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide and Rifampicin content uniformity in split FDC tablets used in the treatment of childhood tuberculosis. Drug contents of 15 whole tablets, 30 half tablets and 36 third tablets were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The content uniformity was assessed by comparing drug content measured in <b>split</b> <b>portions</b> with their expected amounts and the quality of <b>split</b> <b>portions</b> was assessed applying qualitative specifications for whole tablets. All whole tablets measurements fell into the USP proxy for the three drugs. But a significant number of half and third portions was found outside the tolerated variation range and the split formulation failed the requirements for content uniformity. To correct for the inaccuracy of splitting the tablets into equal portions, a weight-adjustment strategy was used but this did not improve the findings. In split tablets the content of the three drugs is non-uniform and exceeded the USP recommendations.

During routine experiments, a new stem-split symptom was observed in M. phaseolina-infected plants resulting in poor growth and reduced size of inflorescences. Stem-split was observed in 30 -day-old plants as minute cracks approximately 2 - 3 cm above the soil surface, which over time extended to both upward and downward directions, resulting in the formation of a wider split. The <b>split</b> <b>portion</b> was hollow and brown with a white to grey mycelial mat of the fungus on the inner surface. Such plants became lodged, ultimately resulting in poor seed yield compared with healthy plants. The stem-split plants showed delayed flowering by 1 week over healthy plants.
