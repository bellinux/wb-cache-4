40|$|Ningbo Hi-Tech Park is {{a special}} zone in Ningbo City of China. It has seen great {{economic}} growth after its establishment. The reasons behind the astonishing economic growth have seldom been investigated. Especially, no {{research has been done}} to explain the specific economic phenomena in the NHTP from the perspective of institutions. We aim to have more knowledge about the relationship between institutions and economic growth. Further the result of the dissertation will be presented to the NHTP administrative committee as well as some suggestions to improve economic management. Four theories that are the theory of institutional change, the theory of state, the theory of property rights and transaction costs theory are used to explain the establishment of the NHTP with new institutions and how these new institutions motivate investment. The Solow Growth Model and Porter’s Diamond Model were shortly introduced in order to give a picture of the relationship between institutions, investment and economic growth. The research results indicated that all the institutional changes in the NHTP are important to attract investment. The five most important institutions can be grouped into two categories. They are the visible profits including “the favorable tax policies and subsidies from the local government” on one hand, the efficiency of government including “the stability of regulations and policy, the <b>simplified</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> and the high quality service of servant” on the other hand. The favourable tax policies head the list of the five institutions. There are no significant differences among companies in different industries, different sizes and different type...|$|E

However, the potentials of the new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) are not always so easy to translate into practice. Rapid successes can be achieved above all in cases where a solid institutional base is already in place and good expert and infrastructural resources are available – a set of conditions not given in many developing countries. The aim of e-government is to open up new internal and external communications channels, to <b>simplify</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures,</b> to improve the accessibility of public actors and services, and to enhance access to information. This often also means that these new technologies are vehicles of democratic, customer-oriented, and decentralized models of political decision-making and public administration. If these models are to be translated into practice, reforms must be embedded in an overall concept that takes account of both customer and target-group demand and the challenges posed by internal administrative cooperation and networking. In the foreseeable future it will be mainly industrialized and advanced developing countries that {{are in a position to}} draft and implement comprehensive strategies of this kind. But potential uses are also opening up for poorer countries. The obstacles to modernization of government institutions must often be sought less in financial or infrastructural bottlenecks than in blockades in the political sphere. Development cooperation (DC) can use e-government as a means of supporting partner countries in devising and implementing political and administrative reforms and in improving market-oriented frameworks.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the reforms aimed at <b>simplifying</b> the <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> for labor registration and {{the payment of}} social security contributions that were carried out in Argentina in 2005 and 2007. Analysis of the legislation, {{as well as a}} survey conducted among accountants, reveals that although the reforms did reduce the administrative burden, the effect was only partial. By using microdata gathered from household surveys conducted quarterly between 2003 and 2009, and the discontinuities according to company size that the legislation engenders, differences-in-differences coefficients have been estimated regarding the impact of the simplification reforms on the labor market. The results indicate that the simplification reforms had a positive, although limited, effect on the labor registration rate (of approximately two percentage points for all workers and nine percentage points for newly-hired workers), but that there was no effect on employment levels. Finally, policy recommendations are put forward aimed at deepening the administrative simplification process and thereby improving its effectiveness as a labor registration promotion mechanism. ...|$|R

Another pessimistic statement related to the issue is that corruption {{seems to be very}} “sticky, once is there it stays there” (Rothstein, 2007). This opinion is sustained also by {{the fact that in the}} last decades there were only two successful stories in eradicating corruption: Hong Kong and Singapore. But these are small countries and the anticorruption measures were not always consistent with democratic principles. Romania resembles a case of persistent corruption so, according with what was said above, the conclusion would be that there are few chances to improve our country’s situation.

40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} technology (PV) is {{a promising}} clean energy source that assists in climate change mitigation. This {{is due to}} solar PV having minimal greenhouse gas emissions when operating compared to burning fossil fuel. Solar PV is also a versatile technology owing to its multiple applications within the built environment. Buildings are responsible for {{nearly half of the}} world’s energy consumption; thus, reducing buildings’ energy usage through environmentally-responsive design techniques, in addition to the application of PV products, can not only assist in reducing the energy consumed by buildings, but also contributes to mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Architects, in particular, play a substantial role in achieving sustainable/environmentally responsive designs; hence, their collaboration is essential. This study investigated American and Canadian architects’ level of awareness and interest in Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) and Building Applied Photovoltaic (BAPV) products. It also aimed to shed light on the barriers that are responsible for slowing down the adoption process. This study was conducted in two phases: a) a web-based survey questionnaire administered to architects who have an active membership in the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC), and the American Institute of Architects (AIA); b) in-depth interviews with architects and key informants in the solar industry. The results indicated that architects are aware of PV benefits and the products available for buildings’ application; however, they lack essential practical knowledge. Furthermore, the results indicated that PV systems’ capital cost is the major perceived barrier to PV adoption in the building industry. Other reported barriers are: the lack of government financial incentives in some jurisdictions, the problematic grid connection process and the lengthy application lead times. Recommendations based on this study’s results include, but are not limited to, providing financial support mechanisms, <b>simplifying</b> the <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> of financial support mechanisms and grid access permits, and offering education and training to architects through architectural associations and academic institutions. 4 month...|$|R

In this context, we may observe the need to harmonize the Serbian <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> with the EU legislation. The key issue is to which extent the process of harmonizing the Serbian regulations with the EU law extends to the basic <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> regulations governing the work of public administration and public services in deciding on particular cases. Does the General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act diverge from the EU law and does it have to be harmonized with the EU law? EU member states are not obliged to harmonize their <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> legislations with EU regulations as the applicable principle in this respect is the principle of procedural autonomy of each Member State. Moreover, there are member states that do not have a codified <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure.</b> On the other hand, there are significant differences among the EU member states which have codified their <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> Some countries have regulated only general procedural issues, while other countries have enacted detailed <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> acts.
