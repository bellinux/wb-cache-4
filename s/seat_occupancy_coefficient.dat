40|$|Abstract — Seat Belt Reminder (SBR) {{systems are}} {{effective}} in avoiding deaths and injuries in traffic accidents. However, their implementation can be unpractical in removable vehicle seats {{because of the difficulty}} in wiring the associated sensors, e. g. a <b>seat</b> <b>occupancy</b> sensor and a seat belt detector, to an electronic control unit (ECU). This paper proposes the use of inductive links to avoid wiring the sensors. Both sensors, which can be roughly modeled as switches, form part of a secondary resonant network. Their state (open- or short-circuit) is attained by estimating the resonance frequency of the equivalent input resistance of a primary network inductively coupled to the secondary network. Attending to the possible states of the sensors, four different resonant frequencies result. Because the application is space-constrained, small coils have been used. Commercial ferrite-core models were selected in order to achieve high coil inductance and quality factor. Furthermore, computer simulations showed the higher coupling factor achieved with respect to that achieved with air-core coils. Experimental tests were carried out using an impedance analyzer and commercial sensors for <b>seat</b> <b>occupancy</b> and belt detection. Detection was feasible at distances up to 2 cm between the primary and secondary coils...|$|R

Our approach integrates a stable SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) background seat modeling mechanism with a human shape model into a weighted Bayesian framework to detect passengers on-board buses. SIFT background modeling extracts local stable features on the pre-annotated background seat areas and tracks these features over time to build a global statistical background model for each seat. Since SIFT features are partially invariant to lighting, this background model can be used robustly to detect the <b>seat</b> <b>occupancy</b> status even under severe lighting changes.

40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} how people move about in manual wheelchairs (MWCs) during everyday life by evaluating bouts of mobility or continuous periods of movement. Methods. A convenience sample of 28 MWC users was recruited. Participants' everyday mobility was measured using a wheel-mounted accelerometer and <b>seat</b> <b>occupancy</b> switch for 1 - 2 weeks. Bouts of mobility were recorded and characterized. Results. Across 29, 200 bouts, the median bout lasted 21 seconds and traveled 8. 6 [*]m at 0. 43 [*]m/s. 85 % of recorded bouts lasted less than 1 minute and traveled less than 30 meters. Participants' daily wheelchair activity included 90 bouts and 1. 6 [*]km over 54 minutes. Average daily occupancy time was 11 hours during which participants wheeled 10 bouts/hour and spent 10 % of their time wheeling. Spearman-Brown Prophecy analysis suggested that 7 days were sufficient to achieve a reliability of 0. 8 for all bout variables. Conclusions. Short, slow bouts dominate wheelchair usage in a natural environment. Therefore, clinical evaluations and biomechanical research should reflect this by concentrating on initiating movement, maneuvering wheelchairs, and stopping. Bouts of mobility provide greater depth {{to our understanding of}} wheelchair use and are a more stable metric (day-to-day) than distance or time wheeled...|$|R

However, enforcement {{of the rules of}} these lanes is currently performed by roadside enforcement officers using visual obser-vation. Manual roadside enforcement is known to be inefficient, costly, potentially dangerous, and ultimately ineffective. Violation rates up to 50 %− 80 % have been reported, while manual enforcement rates of less than 10 % are typical. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} automated vehicle occupancy detection to support HOV/HOT lane enforcement.
