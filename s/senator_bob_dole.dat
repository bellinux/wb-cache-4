5|$|In 1991 Abu-Jamal {{published}} {{an essay in}} the Yale Law Journal, {{on the death penalty}} and his death row experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio's All Things Considered program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> (Kansas Republican Party). Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of Live from Death Row.|$|E

He began working again with fellow former <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> to convince the Senate to support this effort, as well as expanded school lunch, food stamps, and nutritional help for pregnant women and poor children in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> of Kansas.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{to control}} {{the sale of the}} drug date back to 1986, when federal {{officials}} at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> R-KS, that would have placed a number of chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward, and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed.|$|E

5000|$|The drive {{behind this}} protest was not {{based solely on}} the initial {{selection}} of a new hearing president: the need for a deaf president began when deaf advocacy groups and organizations made it clear well in advance that they wanted a deaf president. Letter-writing endorsement for the cause included people like Vice-President George H. W. Bush and <b>Senators</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> <b>Bob</b> Graham, Tom Harkin, and Lowell Weicker.

25|$|Ford {{chose to}} seek {{election}} {{to a full}} term in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. The pardon of Nixon and the disastrous 1974 mid-term elections had weakened Ford's standing within the party, and Ford's other actions as president had alienated the conservative wing of the party. Conservative Republicans were disappointed with the selection of Rockefeller as vice president and faulted Ford for the Fall of Saigon, the amnesty for draft dodgers, and the continuation of détente policies, particularly {{with regards to the}} signing of the Helsinki Accords. Ronald Reagan, a leader among the conservatives, launched his campaign in autumn of 1975. Hoping to appease his party's right wing and sap Reagan's momentum, Ford requested that Rockefeller not seek re-election, and the vice president agreed to this request. Ford defeated Reagan in the first several primaries, but Reagan gained momentum after winning North Carolina's March 1976 primary. Entering the 1976 Republican National Convention, neither Ford nor Reagan had won a majority of delegates through the primaries, but Ford was able to win the support of enough unpledged delegates to win the presidential nomination. <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> of Kansas won the vice presidential nomination.|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E

500|$|His {{campaign}} {{focused on}} balancing the federal budget, strict crime laws, and establishing relations with North Korea. His candidacy {{was not expected}} to succeed in winning the Republican nomination due to the overwhelmingly large number of social conservatives in the Republican Party. He was, however, able to gain support. Fellow Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum was supportive of his candidacy. Other supportive Republicans were hopeful Specter could trim the party's [...] "far-right fringe". Although his campaign was ultimately unsuccessful at wooing conservatives, it was widely believed {{he could have had}} a strong showing among independents. On November 23, 1995, {{before the start of the}} primaries, Specter suspended his campaign to endorse Kansas <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole.</b>|$|E
500|$|Initial White House {{explanations}} {{for what had}} happened varied, but generally characterized it {{as a series of}} mistakes made without bad intent and offered apologies to those affected. [...] President Clinton said that, [...] "It {{appears to have been a}} completely honest bureaucratic snafu." [...] However his Republican opponent in the ongoing 1996 presidential election, <b>Senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole,</b> compared it to the enemies list kept by the Nixon administration. [...] Republicans made other charges, including that the White House was trying to dig up damaging information about Republicans in general and that the file transfer was motivated by a desire to slander Dale and other White House Travel Office officials in order to justify their dismissal.|$|E
500|$|Restoration of the Everglades, however, briefly {{became a}} {{bipartisan}} cause in national politics. A controversial penny-a-pound (2 cent/kg) tax on sugar was proposed to fund {{some of the}} necessary changes {{to be made to}} help decrease phosphorus and make other improvements to water. State voters were asked to support the tax, and environmentalists paid $15million to encourage the issue. Sugar lobbyists responded with $24million in advertising to discourage it and succeeded; it became the most expensive ballot issue in state history. How restoration might be funded became a political battleground and seemed to stall without resolution. However, in the 1996 election year, Republican <b>senator</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>Dole</b> proposed that Congress give the State of Florida $200million to acquire land for the Everglades. Democratic Vice President Al Gore promised the federal government would purchase [...] of land in the EAA to turn it over for restoration. Politicking reduced the number to , but both Dole's and Gore's gestures were approved by Congress.|$|E
