50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} {{the drag}} link is {{connected}} via the Pitman arm and <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox</b> to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.|$|E
50|$|A {{steering}} transmission combines the two functions {{needed for a}} tracked vehicle transmission: a transmission to couple the relatively constant engine speed to varying road speeds and a <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox</b> to drive the two output shafts (and so the tracks) at different speeds, thus steering the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} called A6. In March 1927 a wooden mock-up was {{presented}} and after approval {{a second and}} prototype were ordered which had to incorporate the new hydraulically operated Wilson epicyclic <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox,</b> the predecessor of the Merrit-Brown gearbox. By June 1928 both prototypes (A6E1 and A6E2) were presented to the Mechanized Warfare Experimental Establishment for trials. Vickers was on this occasion ordered to add armour skirts but keep within the weight limit {{even if it meant}} removing armour elsewhere. Meanwhile, a third prototype had been ordered: A6E3.|$|E
50|$|Cross-drive {{transmissions}} {{were developed}} from the earlier controlled-differential <b>steering</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> Their innovation was to cross-couple the two sides, so that excess power from the slow side of the gearbox could be supplied to the faster side. This reduced the power to be dissipated by braking and it increased the power available to drive the fast track. Implementing this was difficult for most transmissions as it required a varying gear ratio between the sides. Most gearboxes simply offered a single ratio, through fixed gears and clutches, which restricted steering to a single radius.|$|R
50|$|It was {{followed}} in 1963 by the 408, with drastic restyling {{as well as}} improved suspension. This was succeeded by the 409. Many buyers preferred the crisp <b>steering</b> and <b>gearbox</b> of the earlier six-cylinder cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of following British tank designs utilised the Meteor engine and Merritt-Brown <b>steering</b> & <b>gearbox</b> combination initially {{developed for the}} Cromwell, lasting {{all the way through}} Centurion. This proved {{to be one of the}} primary elements in the development of the Main Battle Tank.|$|R
50|$|The skidders use {{the same}} 6V53 Detroit Diesel engine and <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox</b> as the M113, but {{utilized}} a more heavily built undercarriage and a 4-speed Clark powershift transmission. The skidder either came as a cable arch model, with a tilting tray to set the logs on (A hydraulic grapple attachment was later offered to fit over the cable fairleads). Or as a Clam-Bunk forwarder, with a Prentice grapple mounted {{on the roof of}} the cab. Dealers also modified the base tractor to handle various forestry and utility jobs.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of these transmissions also integrated the transmission and <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox</b> functions {{into a single}} casing. This gave reduced overall weight and volume, and reduced servicing times. A related development at this time was the 'power pack' concept, where engine and transmission could be removed as a single unit. As size and complexity increased, fitter time became short but mechanical handling through mobile cranes became available in the field. It was now quicker and simpler to exchange one large unit than to dismantle and re-assemble more connections to remove a smaller component.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steering}} linkage which connects the <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{to the front}} wheels consists {{of a number of}} rods. These rods are connected with a socket arrangement similar to a ball joint, called a tie rod end, allowing the linkage to move back and forth freely so that the steering effort will not interfere with the vehicles up-and-down motion as the wheel moves over roads [...] The steering gears are attached to a rear rod which moves when the steering wheel is turned. The rear rod is supported at one end.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{revisions}} for 1962 were extensive. The {{electrical system}} was extensively upgraded, {{with a new}} starter, new alternator, more fuses, and printed circuit boards rather than individual wires for the instrument cluster. Carburetors were improved again, the manual transmission gearshift was moved from the floor to the steering column, there were new 45°-shear engine mounts replacing the previous vertical-shear items, exhaust systems were made of more corrosion-resistant materials, and axle ratios were altered for better fuel economy. Manual steering ratio was changed from 20:1 to 24:1, and both power and manual <b>steering</b> <b>gearboxes</b> were new, the latter now housed in aluminum rather than iron. Most of the front suspension components were redesigned, and it was claimed they needed lubrication only every 32000 mi.|$|R

Both were produced over many years. The 20.9 with a 3-litre engine producing 70 bhp shared components with the 3-litre Super Sports (brakes, suspension, <b>steering,</b> axles, <b>gearbox,</b> transmission).|$|R
5000|$|Major W. G. Wilson (1874-1957) {{was rewarded}} {{as one of}} the major co-inventors of the tank after World War I. He had mainly been {{involved}} with the development of transmissions for tanks, particularly the problem of their <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox.</b> He had become an advocate for the benefits of the epicyclic gearbox, which allowed large torques to be transmitted whilst still being controllable through a small input force. In 1917, Wilson designed the Mark V tank, which incorporated his epicyclic steering gear. Wilson's major claim for its advantage was that the epicyclic system allowed control through a brake, rather than through a clutch, [...] "a brake can stand more punishment than a clutch and is easier to judge in its application". This {{was the first of the}} heavy tanks that could be driven by a single driver, without requiring him to signal orders inside to others working the secondary gear levers.|$|E
50|$|The DJ-5A (Kaiser Co.) used a {{standard}} CJ front end, with a four-cylinder Chevrolet Nova 153 CID L engine and two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission. In 1971, this {{was changed to}} a unique five-slot grille without turn signals that was used only on postal Jeeps. The 1971 model actually has the grille extend past {{the front of the}} hood edge. This allowed more room for the AMC Straight-6 engine and radiator. While resembling the CJ series, these were built as a completely enclosed, rear-wheel drive vehicle, with sliding doors (which could be opened while driving), and a swinging rear door. Most models only had the driver's seat and a mail tray where the second seat would normally be located. One improvement over earlier Jeeps was mounting the rear springs outside of the frame rails, thus providing greater stability for the vehicle with its top-heavy enclosed cargo area, especially at highway speeds. Most models were also equipped with a limited slip differential and a heavy-duty <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{body frame}} {{comprising}} welded steel tube longitudinals, uprights and diagonals to the waistrail: with heavy duty stress-panels and aluminium upper frame sections riveted thereupon was constructed {{to a joint}} design by either Weymann or Metro-Cammell in England or by the MCW group's South African subsidiary Bus Bodies (South Africa) in Port Elizabeth; this was permanently attached to a Leyland under-frame, not drivable unless bodied. To this under-frame, Leyland attached all running units comprising radiator, engine, axles, suspension, <b>steering,</b> <b>gearbox,</b> brakes, controls etc. Once under-frame and body were permanently married up, the frame would be clad in aircraft-grade aluminium and finished. The original idea was to offer a bus {{to one of three}} specifications: home market, right hand drive export or left hand drive export. It would be a stronger bus than any built before. It would be a standard bus for all world markets. The Olympic took some of its technology from Metro-Cammell's work prior to World War II building integral trolleybuses for London Transport, some from Leyland's pre-war work on underfloor-engined buses but it also used the know-how acquired by Leyland, Weymann and Metro-Cammell in the war effort. Metro-Cammell built armoured vehicles and airframe sections for Supermarine Spitfires, Weymann assembled modules for the Handley-Page Halifax heavy bomber and Leyland's workforce spent the war building tanks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tank was}} steered by {{conventional}} tillers hydraulically actuating onto external brake discs. The discs worked via the epicyclic gearbox providing [...] "regenerative" [...] <b>steering.</b> The <b>gearbox</b> was operated motorcycle-style with a kick up/kick down [...] "peg" [...] on the left, which actuated electro-hydraulic {{units in the}} gearbox, the accelerator cable was operated by the right foot. In the turret, the loader was {{on the left and}} the gunner on the right of the gun with the commander situated behind the gunner. The suspension was of the Horstmann bogie type with large side plates to protect the tracks and provide stand-off protection from hollow charge attack.|$|R
40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, <b>steering</b> <b>gearbox,</b> and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring loaded rack and pinion. This spring loading arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The spring loading arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the spring loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to cut costs, new {{regulations}} required mechanical front and rear differentials, while the central differential remained active. Active suspension and water injections were also prohibited. Cars entered by a manufacturer had to be equipped with the same engine for two rallies; further limitations were imposed on the changing of some parts, including suspension, <b>steering,</b> turbochargers and <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The right pedal applies iron-lined {{external}} bands on {{the rear}} brake drums through levers and horizontal shafts. The left pedal first releases the clutch then when moved further the same pedal to ease the gear change applies the brake on the propellor shaft drum behind the <b>gearbox.</b> <b>Steering</b> is by rack and pinion. Wheels are of steel wire with tangent spokes.|$|R
50|$|The Giulietta was {{designed}} with {{a target of}} a 5-star EuroNCAP safety rating. The car also has many electronic devices as standard: VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) electronic stability control, DST (Dynamic Steering Torque), Q2 electronic differential and Alfa Romeo DNA selector which allows driver to choose between three different driving settings; Dynamic, Normal and All-Weather, this setting controls the behaviour of engine, brakes, <b>steering,</b> suspension and <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The engine’s {{power is}} {{transferred}} via a sequential six-speed sport gearbox, which is operated pneumatically using shift paddles {{mounted on the}} <b>steering</b> wheel. The <b>gearbox</b> {{is one of the}} standard components, which are used by all the DTM manufacturers. It has 11 final drive ratios, which allow the engineers and drivers to react to the respective circuit and engine characteristics when setting the car up.|$|R
50|$|The Starion uses a {{traditional}} front-mounted engine with rear-wheel drive layout. Many {{came with a}} limited slip differential and anti-lock brakes (single channel, rear wheels only) as standard features. The entire chassis {{was derived from the}} previous high-performance variant of the Mitsubishi Sapporo or Mitsubishi Galant Lambda sports coupe, with a MacPherson strut suspension and swaybars that were fitted to front and rear. Rack and pinion steering was not offered, instead <b>gearbox</b> <b>steering</b> was standard on all models.|$|R
5000|$|The higher {{specification}} {{also have}} a new [...] "SEAT Drive Profile" [...] system which allows the driver to choose between four different driving settings: eco, normal, sport, and an individual setting. This system controls the behaviour of the engine, <b>steering,</b> and DSG <b>gearbox.</b> Additionally, the 1.8 TSI 180PS and 2.0 TDI 184PS engine-equipped models will vary their engine sound via a sound actuator, {{as well as their}} interior ambient lighting between white (normal, eco and individual) and red (sport).|$|R

50|$|The first Pope-Tribune, a single-cylinder runabout, was {{introduced}} in 1904. It was {{to the design of}} Hiram Percy Maxim, son of Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim (the inventor of the Maxim gun). The model that is on display in the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, is an early model with a single cylinder and shaft drive. Model II also had a front-mounted, vertical, single-cylinder engine (with a 4.5in bore and a 4in stroke), wheel <b>steering,</b> sliding pinion <b>gearbox,</b> shaft drive and a bevel rear axle with a differential.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{has a new}} [...] "Alfa DNA" [...] {{system which}} allows the driver to choose between three {{different}} driving settings: Dynamic, Normal, and All-Weather.

The MiTo also features a Q2 electronic differential on the front wheels, which is active with the DNA switch in Dynamic position, and allows for faster and tighter cornering without loss of traction.|$|R
50|$|Consider the {{relation}} of an automobile to its parts, specifically: the automobile has or is composed from objects including <b>steering</b> wheel, seat, <b>gearbox</b> and engine. This relation might be fixed in a computer program as a composition relation. However, the real world relation is softer and fuzzier. The engine in one automobile may {{be replaced by the}} engine from another automobile, meaning {{the relation}} is better described as an aggregation than a composition. Generally speaking, as time passes, what looks like compositions tend to turn into aggregations, and aggregations tend to turn into looser associations.|$|R
25|$|The {{front-wheel drive}} Medallion used the 2.2L I4 engine that also powered the European Renault 25. It was mounted in a {{longitudinal}} (front-back) configuration, driving {{the front wheels}} through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed computer-controlled automatic. The longitudinal engine placement is unusual for a front-wheel drive car, as the transverse engine layout is typically more space-efficient. It {{was one of a}} few cars with this layout, which helps reduce torque <b>steering.</b> The <b>gearbox</b> is centrally mounted resulting in equal-length axle shafts. In Europe, Renault 21 versions with engine displacements below 2L had transverse engines, just like smaller models such as the Renault 9. Higher-end R 21 versions with engines of 2L or more, retained the longitudinal layout of the previous Renault 20 and 30 series. The longitudinally mounted versions had a shorter wheelbase than the European transverse versions. Product plans also called for a four-wheel drive Medallion to be imported in late-1988.|$|R
5000|$|With the new engine, and in {{simplified}} trim, {{the new car}} was re-christened as GAZ-3102. Still {{hoping to}} introduce the V6 powerplant at a later date, the GAZ-3101 designation was retained for it (and will used for the V8 [...] "Chaser" [...] models). Power <b>steering</b> and automatic <b>gearbox</b> were also removed from the make-up. The [...] "new" [...] Volga was re-submitted to Moscow for the go-ahead to production in early 1980 and was showcased at the Moscow Olympics to the wider public.
