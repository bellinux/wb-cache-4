40|$|Introduction 1. 1. Glad {{to be here}} I am very {{grateful}} to the organizers for providing me {{with the opportunity to}} talk about nuclear physics to nuclear physicists. Solar neutrino research originated in the attempt to verify experimentally that the sun shines by nuclear fusion reactions among light elements in its interior. During the first few years I worked on the subject, in 1961 [...] 1968, almost everyone that had a real interest in solar neutrino research was a nuclear physicist and the things that we most needed to determine for interpreting the proposed experiments were nuclear reaction rates and neutrino absorption cross sections. <b>So,</b> almost <b>everyone</b> <b>I</b> talked to about solar neutrinos in those days was a nuclear physicist and I enjoyed the experience very much. I am delighted to be back among the physicists of my youth. Looking around the room, I see many people who have made important contributions to the nuclear physics of solar fusion, the reactions which ultimately determine s...|$|R

The {{speaker of}} the house, David Ralston stated [...] "The Republican majority in the House chose to stand with Georgia's families and with children. That bill chooses to stand with sex offenders and pedophiles. And that's something that I can't fathom." [...] Moore defended his bill stating: [...] "There's already {{laws on the books}} to handle everything that I've heard thus far as far as child molesters or whatever they're worried about attacking children, or whatever; there's already existing laws for that. This is kind of a vague blanket law that applies to <b>everyone,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> didn't see a problem with removing it, and until I hear something specific I still don't have a problem." ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{my first}} {{days in the}} Cradle Roll Department of Sunday School, {{the merits of the}} bad place against the good place have been impounded upon my mind. In my childish fancy heaven {{represented}} a place where everyone wore water wings, balanced embroidery hoops on their heads, and sat all day on cloud tufts eating water melons. This connotation was no doubt derived from the picture Green Pastures. One of my first thoughts about heaven was that it would be very boring with <b>everyone</b> <b>so</b> good. <b>I</b> 2 ̆ 2 had never heard of night in heaven and wondered if the angels ever became sleepy. My grandfather once remarked facetiously that he didn 2 ̆ 7 t want to go to heaven because none of his friends would be there...|$|R

Florence went as a senior to high school in Indiana and also began to teach Sunday school in nursery class and had finished reading the entire Bible as part of her senior English class. She was upset that the Bible was ordered taught in a literal fashion according to the denomination’s rules at the Sunday school. She remembered particularly the Adam-and-Even story being trouble and was “brought to a half” by the rendering of the story of Jonah. She confronted the local minister that she couldn’t accept it as literal “And furthermore” she recalled saying “I will never join any church which leave out any people. Because I believe God made the whole world and all the people in it. I will only join a church which doesn’t divide by denominations, color, heathens, nothing, just one for <b>everyone.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> can't teach Sunday School class here any longer.” ...|$|R
