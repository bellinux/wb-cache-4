5000|$|Windproof/waterproof full-finger gloves {{are useful}} in spring and autumn, when real warmth is not an issue. These are also {{generally}} <b>showerproof</b> but will become soggy in heavy rain. Palms may be treated to improve friction with brake levers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{beach tent}} {{is often a}} {{simplified}} form of dome tent and provide a useful (relatively sand-free) place to temporarily store beach equipment, but is at most <b>showerproof.</b> Some beach tents use specially treated fabric which is opaque to ultra-violet light, and so provide some protection against sunburn. Maximum height is typically about 120 cm, and they are usually not large enough for an adult to lie down in.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, some car coats were being {{designed}} in nylon, {{a report from}} the British Nylon Spinners' Fair in London in 1961 described a new washable mock suede car coat with brushed fleece nylon lining as: [...] "one of the good possibilities" [...] of the technology. Real leathers remained popular - <b>showerproof</b> suede models with detachable collars and large leather buttons were being designed for women by 1964. These were also in the shorter length, ending at mid thigh. Another new motoring design was the roebuck suede (deerskin) jacket, designed at hip length for both women and men, and described as a real innovation because: [...] "A suede upon which grease, alcohol, even motor oil has no effect is a find indeed." ...|$|E
50|$|A tent {{required}} only for summer use {{may be very}} different from one {{to be used in the}} depths of winter. Manufacturers label tents as one-season, two/three-season, three/four season, four season, etc. A one-season tent is generally for summer use only, and may only be capable of coping with light showers. A three-season tent is for spring/summer/autumn and should be capable of withstanding fairly heavy rain, or very light snow. A four-season tent should be suitable for winter camping in all but the most extreme conditions; an expedition tent (for mountain conditions) should be strong enough to cope with heavy snow, strong winds, as well as heavy rain. Some tents are sold, quite cheaply, as festival tents; these may be suitable only for camping in dry weather, and may not even be <b>showerproof.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some garments, and tents, are {{designed}} to give greater or lesser protection against rain. For urban use raincoats and jackets are used; for outdoor activities in rough weather there is a range of hiking apparel. Typical descriptions are [...] "showerproof", [...] "water resistant", and [...] "waterproof". These terms are not precisely defined. A <b>showerproof</b> garment will usually be treated with a water-resisting coating, but is not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. This is suitable for protection against light rain, but after a short time water will penetrate. A water-resistant garment is similar, perhaps slightly more resistant to water but also not rated to resist a specific hydrostatic head. A garment described as waterproof will have a water-repellent coating, with the seams also taped to prevent water ingress there. Better waterproof garments have a membrane lining designed to keep water out but allow trapped moisture to escape ("breathability")â€”a totally waterproof garment would retain body sweat and become clammy. Waterproof garments specify their hydrostatic rating, ranging from 1,500 for light rain, to 20,000 for heavy rain.|$|E
