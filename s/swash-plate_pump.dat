50|$|For the 1965 model year, Wheel Horse Products, Inc., of South Bend, Indiana, USA, {{introduced}} the first garden tractors {{equipped with an}} hydraulic CVT. The models 875 and 1075 included an Eaton-manufactured variable-displacement <b>swash-plate</b> <b>pump</b> and fixed-displacement gear-type hydraulic motor combined into a single compact package, which attached directly to the patented Wheel Horse Unidrive™ transaxle. Reverse was produced by reversing {{the flow of the}} pump through over-centering of the swash plate. Acceleration was limited and smoothed through use of pressure accumulator and relief valves located between the pump and motor, to prevent the sudden changes in speed possible with a direct hydraulic coupling. Subsequent versions included fixed swash plate motors, and ball pumps and were sourced from both Eaton and Sundstrand Corp.|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{both the}} ideal and non-ideal torque on the {{cylinder}} block of an axial-piston <b>swash-plate</b> type hydrostatic <b>pump</b> are examined. Traditionally, the torque on the cylinder block {{has been estimated}} by using a standard theoretical-expression that does not consider the compressibility of the fluid or the frictional characteristics within the pump. Furthermore, past research that has considered fluid compressibility and friction has been conducted on a macroscopic level and simply emphasizes test results without offering sufficient explanations for them. As the need for improved efficiency of hydrostatic pumps increases, an improved understanding of the torque characteristics within these machines is required;This research compares {{the results of a}} detailed mathematical-model with actual test-data for the torque on the cylinder block of an axial-piston <b>swash-plate</b> type hydrostatic <b>pump.</b> As a result of this analysis, an improved model for the idealized torque on the cylinder block is offered in closed-form. Furthermore, a numerical program is written to calculate the net torque on the cylinder block which includes the torque that is lost due to friction. Using the numerical model, the torque losses are separated for each component within the machine and compared with each other to determine where the torque losses are greatest. Lastly, basic design parameters are numerically varied by small amounts to determine the magnitude of influence that specific design changes might have and it is shown that some design changes have greater influence on the torque loss than others...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of a {{variable displacement pump}} to a control signal {{can be an important}} factor in the overall system response. It is therefore necessary in simulating such systems to have an accurate model of the dynamic behavior of the pump and its interaction with the system. This paper presents a comprehensive model of a typical variable displacement <b>swash-plate</b> piston <b>pump</b> and its servo controller. Because of the complex and non-linear form of the pumping dynamics previous researchers have used over-simplified models, particularly in respect of swash-plate forces during the pumping cycle. This paper describes a hybrid approach which combines physical models and a neural network to simulate swash-plate dynamics. Training data for the neural network is obtained through a detailed simulation of pumping dynamics. This allows the creation of a black-box model of swash-plate moments as a function of delivery pressure and swash-plate position and velocity. Training data and the hybrid model of the pump system have been verified experimentally. The final pump system model takes into account the interactions between pump, its controller and the delivery lin...|$|R

In this work modern control methods are used to design and analyze control methods for a variable-displacement hydraulic pump. More accurate uncertainty descriptions are derived by using a structured uncertainty model as opposed to an unstructured uncertainty model. The system studied includes one variable-displacement <b>swash-plate</b> hydraulic <b>pump</b> with a constant engine speed model. The input to the system is the current actuating the control valve position, while the system output is the discharge pressure of the pump. The established PID controller design lacked robustness, encouraging design of a two degrees-of-freedom control scheme. Frequency domain tests show robustness improvement over the classical PID control scheme. Time domain results show similar performance from both the PID controlled system and the two degrees-of-freedom controlled system. Time domain tests also show improved robustness to parametric variation from the modern control method, while system responses to large disturbances are similar among both the classical and modern control schemes...|$|R
40|$|Temperature of bearing/seal {{parts of}} axial piston pumps was measured. Both of a {{rotating}} cylinder-block type pump and a rotating <b>swash-plate</b> type <b>pump</b> were prepared; five thermo-couples were {{embedded in the}} swash-plate and one thermistor {{was placed in the}} suction conduit for the former pump, and five thermo-couples were installed in the cylinder-block and one was at the casing for the latter pump. Hydraulic mineral oils with ISO VG 22, 32, 46 and 68 and the waterglycol type hydraulic fluid with VG 32 were used at the test fluids. The maximum discharge pressure was 20 MPa and the maximum rotational speed was 28. 3 rps. The inlet oil temperature was specified at 30 to 50 ℃. At the atmospheric pressure to the maximum discharge pressure, the temperatures, flow rates and the torque were measured. In conclusion, i) The temperature of the swash-plate between the crescent-shaped discharge and suction ports increased greatly; ii) The temperature of the cylinder-block at the bottom dead center of the pistons increased markedly; iii) The temperature increased as the discharge pressure and the rotational speed became higher; iv) The temperature rise was larger as the fluid viscosity was higher and the inlet oil temperature was lower, and v) The temperature rise {{in the case of the}} water-glycol fluid was noticeably smaller than the rise of the mineral oils...|$|R
40|$|Combining working {{principle}} and failure mechanism of RZU 2000 HM hydraulic press, with its present fault cases being collected, the {{working principle}} of the oil pressure and faults phenomenon of the hydraulic power unit –swash-plate axial piston pump were studied with some emphasis, whose faults will directly affect the dynamic performance of the oil pressure and flow. In order to make hydraulic power unit work reliably, PARD-BP (Pruning Algorithm based Random Degree) neural network fault algorithm was introduced, with <b>swash-plate</b> axial piston <b>pump’s</b> vibration fault sample data regarded as input, and fault mode matrix regarded as target output, so that PARD-BP algorithm could be trained. In the end, the vibration results were verified by the vibration modal test, and it was shown that the biggest upward peaks of vacuum pump in X-direction, Y-direction and Z- direction have fallen by 30. 49...|$|R
40|$|This work proposes an MDO (multidisciplinary design optimization) {{procedure}} for a <b>swash-plate</b> axial piston <b>pump</b> based on co-simulation and integrated optimization. The integrated hydraulic-mechanical {{model of the}} pump is built to reflect its actual performance, and a hydraulic-mechanical co-simulation is conducted through data exchange between different domains. The flow ripple of the pump is optimized by using a MDO procedure. A CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation of the pump’s flow field is done, which shows that the hydrodynamic shock of the pump is improved after optimization. To verify the MDO effect, an experimental system is established to test the optimized piston pump. Experimental {{results show that the}} simulated and experimental curves are similar. The flow ripple is improved by the MDO procedure. The peak of the pressure curve is lower than before optimization, and the pressure pulsation is reduced by 0. 21 MPa, which shows that the pressure pulsation is improved with the decreasing of the flow ripple. Comparing the experimental and simulation results shows that MDO method is effective and feasible in the optimization design of the pump...|$|R
