5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. <b>She</b> <b>dreamed</b> of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with his will, Pius' fortune {{passed on to}} Faustina. (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune. Indeed, at his accession, Marcus transferred part of his mother's estate to his nephew, Ummius Quadratus.) Faustina was three months pregnant at her husband's accession. During the pregnancy <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> of giving birth to two serpents, one fiercer than the other. On 31 August she gave birth at Lanuvium to twins: T. Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus. Aside {{from the fact that}} the twins shared Caligula's birthday, the omens were favorable, and the astrologers drew positive horoscopes for the children. The births were celebrated on the imperial coinage.|$|E

25|$|Blanka Vlašić {{was born}} on 8 November 1983 in Split, Croatia (which was then part of Yugoslavia). From a young age, she was {{involved}} in sports: her mother Venera was a seasoned amateur in basketball and cross country skiing while her father, Joško Vlašić, was an international athlete who broke the Croatian record in the decathlon. Her father brought her to the track while he practised and <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> of becoming a professional sprinter. As she grew up she tried a number of sports but found that the high jump was particularly well-suited to her tall and slender frame. Vlašić shunned the idea of competing in more profitable sports, such as basketball, saying that she preferred the thrill of individual sports. She reached the international standard for a high jumper at an early age, setting a personal best of 1.80metres at fifteen years of age and quickly improving to 1.93m at sixteen.|$|E

After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2001, she met OutKast's Big Boi, and then founded the Wondaland Arts Society with some like-minded young artists. She released her first EP The Audition in 2003. Although it did not place highly on the Billboard charts – reportedly only 400 physical copies were pressed – it did showcase her vocal abilities and unique Metropolis concept that would also figure in her future releases. The CD album itself is extremely rare in its original compact disc format, and as such is a valuable collector's item.|$|E

25|$|Radulovics' final {{major event}} was the European Championship in 2004, as she retired from {{international}} handball after the tournament. Although <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> about winning {{the gold medal}} in front of home crowd, Radulovics had to be content herself with a bronze after Hungary lost to Norway in the semifinals and beat Russia in the third place match. The Hungarian team set off with a three match winning run, with that they easily won their preliminary group. Radulovics played in terrific form, especially against Austria, hitting the back of the net 13 times. During the main round phase Hungary continued to play top quality handball, but suffered a one-goal defeat against Denmark, which cost them the top spot of the group and as a result, they had to face prime title candidates and eventually winners Norway in the semifinal. Radulovics scored ten goals against the Hammerseng-led Scandinavians, but it was not enough to go through the finals, since {{the rest of the team}} slightly underperformed and Hungary suffered a heavy loss (29–44).|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E

2500|$|... "Miss Clare Remembers" [...] is a {{reworked}} {{version of}} a same-titled piano instrumental that Enya originally recorded in 1983, her first project as a solo artist. It was released on Touch Travel (1984), an audio cassette of music from various artists. When the track was re-recordeded for Watermark, Enya and Nicky and toyed with adding vocals and other instruments into the arrangement, but agreed to keep it solely as a piano piece, thinking it was how the track sounded best. Its title refers to the same-titled book by English novelist Miss Read, whose depictions of country and village life, {{and the people who}} lived there, appealed to Enya. Roma thought the piece [...] "recaptures the naivety and innocence of an age and a place far removed from the whirl and pressure of a sophisticated society". [...] "Evening Falls..." [...] is a track that Roma described as [...] "a song of a spirit travelling". It is based on a ghost story that Roma had heard, about a woman who had recurring dreams of a house in America, only to accidentally come across it years later in England. Upon entering the house, its inhabitants become frightened of the woman as they explain she had haunted the house each time <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> about it. Nicky thought a melody Enya had written suited the story, which led to Roma writing a lyric inspired by it.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} began September 1996, in San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Poteet, Houston, and Lake Jackson, Texas. Nava used locals as extras for the film.

During {{the opening of}} the Selena Etc. boutique scene, Suzette believed Lopez was wearing Selena's clothing to her disbelief that the costume crew members had replicated the suit the singer wore. Costume designer Elisabetta Beraldo remade Selena's dress she wore when she won the Grammy Award in 1994. Suzette said how she was overcome with emotions after viewing Lopez in the dress. During the elopement scene, Perez explained how he had reminiscent the event as if he was [...] "transported back in time" [...] and remembered how he had a do not disturb sign and hearing a knock on his door. He found the scene {{to be one of the}} hardest to watch after reliving the moment when Selena had told him that eloping was the only resource they had and that they would never have a wedding <b>she</b> <b>dreamed</b> about. Perez refused to visit the set and explained that he did not want to partake in the film's process. Seda convinced him to visit for the scene where his character auditions for the role as the new guitarist for the band. After researching on how to perform a riff on a guitar and having lessons from Perez, Seda felt that the scene would not come off as authentic since he could not replicate Perez' guitar riffs. He tricked Perez into visiting the scene so that he could play the riff and have the director shoot a close up of his hands for the film. Seda said how after the film was released that people believed he could play the guitar, he said he tell fans how Perez was actually the one performing the riff in the scene.|$|E
