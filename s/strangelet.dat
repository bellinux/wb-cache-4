500|$|Concerns {{were raised}} in {{connection}} with the RHIC particle accelerator, both in the media and in the popular science media. The risk of a doomsday scenario was indicated by Martin Rees, with respect to the RHIC, as being at least a 1 in 50 million chance. With regards to the production of strangelets, Frank Close, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, indicates that [...] "the chance of this happening is like you winning the major prize on the lottery 3 weeks in succession; the problem is that people believe it is possible to win the lottery 3 weeks in succession."

5000|$|This is {{the only}} {{scenario}} in which Dr. Howell reaches his laboratory unhindered, with people protesting outside and shouting, [...] "Stop the experiment!" [...] On numerous television screens, several scientists talk about {{a new type of}} matter, the <b>strangelet,</b> and just how unlikely it is for one to be formed. Upon arrival, Howell and his colleagues initiate a highly controversial experiment using the world's largest particle accelerator. The experiment quickly goes out of control, resulting {{in the creation of a}} single <b>strangelet.</b> The <b>strangelet</b> first causes the collider and most of the surrounding area to explode. The <b>Strangelet</b> then rises out of the ground and begins to convert the whole planet into strange matter, starting with New York City. The <b>strangelet</b> wreaks havoc on the Earth's climate, damaging a Boeing 747 before it collides with a Boeing 777 attempting to flee the storm, killing all on board both aircraft. Off-screen, the <b>strangelet</b> finishes consuming the planet.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the strange}} matter {{hypothesis}} is correct and its surface tension {{is larger than}} the aforementioned critical value, then a larger <b>strangelet</b> would be more stable than a smaller one. One speculation that has resulted from the idea is that a <b>strangelet</b> coming into contact with a lump of ordinary matter could convert the ordinary matter to strange matter. This [...] "ice-nine"-like disaster scenario is as follows: one <b>strangelet</b> hits a nucleus, catalyzing its immediate conversion to strange matter. This liberates energy, producing a larger, more stable <b>strangelet,</b> which in turn hits another nucleus, catalyzing its conversion to strange matter. In the end, all the nuclei of all the atoms of Earth are converted, and Earth is reduced to a hot, large lump of strange matter.|$|E
40|$|The main {{properties}} of <b>strangelets,</b> namely their energy per baryon, radius and electric charge, are {{studied in the}} unpaired magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) and paired magnetized colour flavour locked (MCFL) phases.

40|$|We {{construct}} <b>strangelets,</b> {{taking into}} account electrostatic effects, including Debye screening, and arbitrary surface tension sigma of the interface between vacuum and quark matter.

5000|$|A <b>strangelet</b> is a {{hypothetical}} particle {{consisting of a}} bound state of roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks. An equivalent description is that a <b>strangelet</b> is a small fragment of strange matter, small enough {{to be considered a}} particle. The size of an object composed of strange matter could, theoretically, range from a few femtometers across (with the mass of a light nucleus) to arbitrarily large.
