40|$|According to the European Union {{point of}} view, the {{fundamental}} principle of state aid {{is to ensure}} that inside the single market, competition is not distorted. In this context, by exception state aid can be justified when they contribute to achieving EU's social and economic goals. This may take place when market forces obstruct the achieving of the proposed objectives or permit their achieving on unacceptable long terms and costs. This article is structured in four parts, focusing on European Union's vision regarding state aid measures. The first part of the article refers to the general context of state aid in EU. The second part of the article tries to define this concept according to European Commission point of view and also studies the state aid information provided by the EU, through its benchmarking instrument regarding state aid expenditure called State Aid Scoreboard. The third part of the article mainly presents the EU state aid evolution during the period 2007 - 2012 and establishes a methodological point of view in order to classify and divide state aid in two main categories: non-crisis state aid and crisis state aid, with the purpose of avoiding the distortion trends regarding state aid expenditure granted for the financial sector. This part of the article also presents different types of state aid at EU 27 level and granted by the selected member states (Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Germany) between 2007 and 2012 and also analysis horizontal aid, <b>sectorial</b> <b>aid</b> and state aid during the economic crisis 2008 - 2012, referring to recapitalization and asset relief measures and guarantees and liquidity measures. The last part of the article presents the conclusions and also states certain recommendations regarding EU state aid practices, based on the results obtained. ...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{allocation}} of investments {{is crucial to}} achieve the Water and Sanitation target of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The present paper exposes the main results of a detailed study made about the Official Development Assistance (ODA) and the international private investment in the water sector from 1995 to 2004. Public available data sets from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), the World Bank, and from the Human Development Reports (population and water and sanitation access’ figures) have been collected in a specific database. ODA programmes have been analyzed individually, in order to separate water and sanitation subsectors, since DAC reporting system {{does not make it}} directly. The study includes a comparative analysis of public and private international investment; it analyzes the coherence, both geographical and sub <b>sectorial</b> of <b>aid</b> allocation, as well as the terms and conditions of the ODA delivered. Special focus was made on the sanitation subsector. Finally it assesses private participation success in the sector and evaluates cross cutting issues in ODA water programmes. Results of ODA’s analysis show how far donors lag behind their own commitments both in terms of quantity and quality of aid. Data show big geographical inequalities, comparing the share of aid received by regions related to the number of people without access living there. Regardless extremely low coverage in sanitation, donors are not really committed to improve it. Results from international private participation in water and sanitation projects show a little contribution to the achievement of the MDG, as well as a decrease tendency in participation. Complementarities between private and public sector were not significant, if MDG are to be achieved. As a main conclusion of the analysis, we can affirm that there is room for improvements in the water sector’s aid. A global coordination mechanism among donors is needed to ensure more efficient sector’s resources allocation; at the same time, donors should fulfil their own recommendations on terms and conditions of aid. International water and sanitation funds should add on existing national funds in order to effectively increase sector investment. Consideration of private sector’s investments could improve ODA’s allocations. The tiny amount of ODA resources dedicated to sanitation represents a huge contradiction with actual needs.
