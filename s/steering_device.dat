TMM stands for tank maloy moshchnosti or [...] "tank of low power". The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native [...] (...) and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun {{in front of the}} hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved gear box, a <b>steering</b> <b>device</b> without clutches and a 37mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2's maneuverability was found to be even worse).|$|E

40|$|Many {{different}} {{technologies are}} used to track {{the movement of the}} sun to both enable concentration of its energy and maximize the yearly energy capture. Their present main limitations are the cost, size, visual impact and wind loading, particularly for applications involving mounting to a building. A parabolic concentrator, for example, along with its steering equipment is heavy and bulky, and is not suitable for rooftop applications. Instead, thin and flat solar concentration devices are required for hassle-free rooftop applications. The use of electrowetting-controlled liquid lenses has emerged as a novel approach for solar tracking and concentration. By steering sunlight using thin electrowetting cell arrays, bulky mechanical equipment is not required. The basic concept of this technology is to change the shape of a liquid interface that is formed by two immiscible fluids of different refractive indices, by simply applying an electric field. An important challenge in electrowetting beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices</b> is the optimization of the design and fabrication process for each of their main constituent components, to maximize optical efficiency. In this paper, we report on the state-of-the-art fabrication methods for electrowetting devices for solar beam steering. We have reviewed the present status of different components types and related fabrication methods, and how they affect the efficiency and performance of such devices. The work identifies future prospects in using electrowetting beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices</b> for solar energy applications. This paper will help researchers and developers in the field to determine the components and fabrication process that affect the development of efficient beam <b>steering</b> electrowetting <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|The index grating {{lifetime}} {{in liquid}} encapsulated Czochralski-grown undoped semi-insulating GaAs {{was measured using}} a beam coupling technique. The largest lifetime measure was about 8 s under a read beam intensity of 0. 7 mW/sq cm with the grating periodicity being 0. 63 microns. The measured value decreases to milliseconds as the read beam intensity and the grating periodicity increase to about 10 mW/sq cm and 4 microns, respectively. This range of grating lifetime in this material is adequate for its use in real-time spatial light modulators, reconfigurable beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices,</b> and dynamic memory elements, for optical computing.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} applications of MOEMS in optical networks is represented by free-space electro-mechanical optical cross-connects (OXCs); these components show lower attenuation and lower insertion losses than concurrent components based on waveguides.

We study insertion losses in micromachined free-space OXCs and the related packaging challenges; we assume in our discussions single mode fiber (SMF) Cross-Connects using mirrors as beam <b>steering</b> <b>devices.</b> We start with an introduction to micromachined OXCs architectures, actuation mechanisms and collimators.

50|$|In 1868, Walter Bradford Woodgate rowing a Brasenose coxed four {{arranged}} for his coxswain to jump overboard {{at the start}} of the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta to lighten the boat. The unwanted cox narrowly escaped strangulation by the water lilies, but Woodgate and his home-made <b>steering</b> <b>device</b> triumphed by 100 yards and were promptly disqualified. This led to the adoption of Henley Regatta rules specifically prohibiting such conduct and a special prize for four-oared crews without coxswains was offered at the regatta in 1869. However in 1873 the Stewards cup was changed to a coxless four event.|$|E
