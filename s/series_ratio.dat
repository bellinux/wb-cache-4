40|$|A {{solution}} for multifrequency plane waves propagating through a dissipative and nonlinear medium is presented. It originates from the well-known Bessel function <b>series</b> <b>ratio</b> for a pure sinusiodal wave, introduced by Cole and Mendousse. The solution is exact. The only limitation, {{inherited from the}} single-frequency solution, is the slow convergence of the series when the nonlinearity is very large compared to the dissipation.

40|$|To find a {{predictive}} model for mortality at four different {{days from the}} admission for critically ill patients. Retrospective study on two consecutive series of critically ill patients admitted in ICU. 1254 critically ill patients, subdivided into two series of 813 (561 survivors and 252 non survivors) and 441 patients (291 survivors and 150 non survivors), respectively. None. All patients had APACHE II calculated within the first 24 hours from the admission in ICU and, if the patient was still in ICU, also at the 5 th, 10 th and 15 th day from the admission. Casistics was subdivided into two unequal <b>series,</b> <b>ratio</b> 2 : 1, with a random selection made {{on each of the}} 6 considered years. On the 1 st series, in 1 st, 5 th, 10 th and 15 th day, for mathematical {{predictive model}}s were made, using stepwise logistic regression (BMDP, Los Angeles). In the 1 st day the following independent variables were utilized: APACHE II score, the specific diagnosis at admission, fitted following Knaus' diagnostic criteria, united in 6 principal categories, while for the other 3 days the variation % of APACE II score as regards the previous day. For each of the considered day four mathematical models have been made. These models have been validated in both series in calibration from the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-fit test and in discrimination from the ROC curves. For each day Y (Prob. % to die) = eLogit/ 1 + eLogit, where Logit = beta 0 (constant) + beta 1 *APACHE II + beta 2 *Variat. %APACE II (difference between actual APACHE II - APACHE II of the previous day/actual APACHE II) + beta k, (coefficient pertinent to pathology). The mathematical model, as other models do, stratifies enough the casistics according to the risk of death. Waiting for further studies to make more precise prognostic mathematical models, this one and others can help the clinical assessment in single patient evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{sets out}} to use the loss <b>ratio</b> <b>series</b> of Switzerland, Germany, the USA and Japan, to test whether {{underwriting}} cycles still exist internationally and to identify possible structural changes. Design/methodology/approach – Based on financial theory and insurance pricing theory, co-integration analysis was performed to check possible causes of structural changes. Findings – All four countries have breaks in different years. This result leads to {{the hypothesis that the}} factors affecting underwriting cycles are mainly country-specific, such as economic environment and regulations, rather than global/international. Although the financial theory and the insurance pricing theory suggest that the loss <b>ratio</b> <b>series</b> should be co-integrated with the interest rate series with co-integrating coefficient - 1, the empirical results do not support the theories. Originality/value – More detailed analysis for the time series characteristics for countries other than the USA is presented to investigate the possible existence of underwriting cycles.
