5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in the Lancet reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same study also found that state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon were pterosaurs, not dinosaurs. By definition, all dinosaurs {{belong to}} one of the two groups within Dinosauria, i.e. Saurischia or Ornithischia. As such, this {{excludes}} pterosaurs. Nonetheless, Pteranodon are frequently featured in dinosaur media and are <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with dinosaurs by the general public. While not dinosaurs, they form a sister clade to dinosaurs within the clade Avemetatarsalia.|$|E

5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with an increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{has made}} a strong mark on {{national}} and international pop culture. The state is <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the image of}} the cowboy shown in westerns and in country western music. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series Dallas.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E

50|$|Mutations of the CELA1 gene were {{suspected}} to {{be associated}} with diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (diffuse NEPPK). However the suspected sequence variant was fully functional and did not <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> with the disease. More recently, a specific mutation in the KRT6C gene has been linked to some cases of diffuse NEPPK.|$|R
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with human habitations, and {{can live in}} urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied {{habitats}} and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development. It feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds, {{but it is an}} opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods. Its predators include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The tengu of {{this period}} were often {{conceived}} of as the ghosts of the arrogant, {{and as a result}} the creatures have become <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with vanity and pride. Today the Japanese expression tengu ni naru ("becoming a tengu") is still used to describe a conceited person.|$|E
5|$|Timmons was <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the}} soul jazz style {{that he helped}} initiate; this link to {{apparently}} simple writing and playing, coupled with drug and alcohol addiction, led {{to a decline in}} his career.

50|$|Although annexed by {{the city}} of Phoenix between 1982 and 1987, before {{substantial}} residential growth, many of Ahwatukee's residents do not <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> their region {{with the rest of the}} city, due in part to its geographic isolation (South Mountain and South Mountain Park separate Ahwatukee from the other 14 urban villages of Phoenix, which lie to the north).|$|R
5000|$|Some sociologists {{and critics}} refer to Reconstructionism {{as a type}} of [...] "Dominionism". These critics claim that the {{frequent}} use of the word [...] "dominion" [...] by Reconstructionist writers, <b>strongly</b> <b>associates</b> the critical term Dominionism with this movement. As an ideological form of Dominionism, Reconstructionism is sometimes held up as the most typical form of Dominion Theology.|$|R
40|$|A novel aggregation-volume-bias Monte Carlo (AVBMC) {{algorithm}} is presented which greatly enhances the eciency of sampling the phase space of uid systems consisting of <b>strongly</b> <b>associating</b> molecules. The {{algorithm is}} compared to the bond-bias Monte Carlo (BBMC) algorithm by Tsangaris and de Pablo [J. Chem. Phys. 101, 1477 (1994) ] and the monomer-addition-subtraction algorithm (MASA) algorithm by Visco and Kofke [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 5493 (1999) ]. The AVBMC algorithm is easy to implement, generally applicable, and robust. The eciency of the AVBMC algorithm is demonstrated for a large variety of processes and systems, including the vaporization of a liquid methane droplet or of a water cluster, {{an investigation of the}} temperature- and pressure dependent properties of superheated hydrogen uoride vapor, and the vapor-liquid coexistence curve of acetic acid. 2 1. Introduction <b>Strongly</b> <b>associating</b> uids are an important class of systems featuring intermolecular attractions with deep (a fe [...] ...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E

In the Flyting, for instance, Dunbar makes big play of Kennedys Carrick roots (albeit in the rankly insulting terms {{that are part of}} the genre) and <b>strongly</b> <b>associates</b> him with Erschry, which meant in other words the bardic tradition. By this time, the term Irish in Scotland signified Gaelic generally: ...|$|R
50|$|Anti-cardiolipin {{antibodies}} {{are found}} in both infectious (syphilis) and autoimmune disease (sclerosis, lupus). The activity of anti-cardiolipin antibodies in autoimmune antiphospholipid syndrome requires apolipoprotein H. The subset of antibodies that bind Apo-H and alter its activity are considered different fromantibodies that bind thrombin, serum phospholipids and are called anti-apolipoprotein antibodies. In autoimmune disease, anti-apolipoprotein antibodies (Anti β2 glycoprotein I antibodies) <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> with thrombotic forms of lupus and sclerosis.|$|R
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live {{in areas where the}} sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In some areas, pasties are a {{significant}} tourist attraction, including an annual Pasty Fest in Calumet, Michigan in late June. Pasties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have a particularly unusual history. Many ethnic groups adopted the pasty {{for use in the}} Copper Country copper mines; the Finnish immigrants to the region mistook it for the traditional piiraat and kuuko pastries. The pasty has become <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with all cultures in this area, and in the similar Iron Range in northern Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The axe and log logo was {{conceived}} {{by the first}} Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park. This logo came to be <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with Wood Badge leader training and is still used on certificates, flags, and other program-related items.|$|E
50|$|In the three-volume {{treatise}} {{on the principles}} of composition, Die Grundsätze der musikalischen Komposition, Sechter wrote a seminal work that influenced many later theorists. Sechter's ideas are derived from Jean-Philippe Rameau's theories of the fundamental bass, always diatonic even when the surface is highly chromatic; music theory historians <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> Sechter with the Viennese conception of fundamental bass theory. Sechter was an advocate of just intonation over well-tempered tuning.|$|R
50|$|Many people <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> {{money with}} happiness, {{and they believe}} that being rich will {{contribute}} greatly to making them happier, and the American society reflects this growing materialism. Although wealth is associated with some positive outcomes, i.e. lighter prison sentences for the same crime, better health, and lower infant mortality, and {{can act as a}} buffer in certain instances, as mentioned previously, the overall relationship between money and happiness is marginal.|$|R

5|$|After {{releasing}} 12-inch singles on Big Apple, they founded DMZ Records, {{which has}} released fourteen 12"s to date. They also began their night DMZ, held {{every two months}} in Brixton, a part of London already <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with reggae. DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream, Kode9, Benga, Pinch, DJYoungsta, Hijak, Joe Nice, and Vex'd. DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending from places {{as far away as}} Sweden, the United States, and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space to Mass' main room, an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egypt venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) {{as their}} war deities and {{among those in}} the Egyptian pantheon are, Bast, Mafdet, Menhit, Pakhet, Sekhmet, Tefnut, and the Sphinx; The lion was a {{prominent}} symbol in ancient Mesopotamia (from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times), where it was <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with kingship. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, {{is often referred to}} as the striding lion of Babylon. The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 BC, now in the British Museum. The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero Heracles.|$|E
5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E

50|$|Early work {{demonstrated}} {{a family of}} immune mediators was plentiful in drusen. Complement factor H (CFH) is an important inhibitor of this inflammatory cascade, and a disease-associated polymorphism in the CFH gene <b>strongly</b> <b>associates</b> with AMD. Thus an AMD pathophysiological model of chronic low grade complement activation and inflammation in the macula has been advanced. Lending credibility to {{this has been the}} discovery of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms in other elements of the complement cascade including complement component 3 (C3).|$|R
