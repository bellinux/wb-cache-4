5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the <b>spreading</b> <b>rate).</b> Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the <b>spreading</b> <b>rate,</b> the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor <b>spreading</b> <b>rate</b> change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

However, this convection mechanism is probably not strong enough under the conditions prevailing in the north Atlantic, {{with respect to the}} <b>spreading</b> <b>rate,</b> and it does not offer a simple explanation for the observed geoid anomaly.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} done to {{consider}} affecting factors on <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> and define a suitable model of <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> in banking industry. <b>Spread</b> <b>rate</b> {{is a difference between}} two related interest rates.

40|$|Upward {{flame spread}} over {{discrete}} fuels has been analyzed through experimental research on vertical arrays of alternating lengths of PMMA and insulation. By manipulating the lengths of the PMMA fuel and the insulation, several important trends related to flame spread {{were identified and}} assessed. The peak flame <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> for arrays with 4 cm lengths of PMMA occurred at a fuel percentage of 67 %; for arrays with 8 cm PMMA, a peak flame <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> occurred at fuel percentages of 67 %, 80 %, and 89 %. It has been hypothesized that increased air entrainment at these fuel percentages maximizes the flame <b>spread</b> <b>rate.</b> Based on observed trends, this study proposed a method for approximation of the fuel <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> at various fuel percentages.

50|$|The Pacific Plate {{is moving}} in a {{northwest}} direction, creating a divergence with the Gorda Plate at a speed of 5 cm per year. The Juan de Fuca Plate (including the Gorda Plate) is moving east-northeast, subducting under the North America Plate at a much slower rate of 2.5-3 cm per year. Due to the ridge being segmented into three distinct parts, each section has its own <b>spreading</b> <b>rate,</b> caused by the slab-pull and ridge-push of the surrounding tectonic plates. The northern segment is the narrowest, with portions as narrow as 3 km across, and has the fastest <b>spreading</b> <b>rate</b> of 2.9 cm per year (half-rate). The central segment is roughly 10 km wide with a <b>spreading</b> <b>rate</b> of 2.4 cm per year (half-rate).

50|$|The rate {{at which}} the mid-ocean ridge creates new {{material}} is known as the <b>spreading</b> <b>rate,</b> and is generally measured in mm/yr.

The <b>spreading</b> <b>rate</b> of the North Atlantic Ocean is ~ 25 mm/yr, while in the Pacific region, it is 80-120 mm/yr. Ridges that spread at rates <20 mm/yr are referred to as ultraslow spreading ridges (e.g., the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean and the Southwest Indian Ridge) and they provide a much different perspective on crustal formation than their faster spreading brethren.|$|E

Fuel beds of vertical sticks (13. 97 cm x 0. 455 cm x 0. 110 cm) and coarse excelsior were burned in an open-topped tilting wind tunnel. Mean fuel moisture content of sticks a d excelsior was 11 % and 12 %, respectively. Mean surface {{area to volume ratio}} was r 23 cm-. Five slopes (negative, positive, none) were combined with five wind velocities (heading, backing, none). <b>Spread</b> <b>rate</b> {{was measured with}} thermocouples; flame length was estimated from video imagery.

Mean flame length ranged from 0. 08 to 1. 69 m; 0. 25 m was the maximum observed for most backing fires. Increased fuel moisture reduced <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> and flame length.

40|$|Experiments {{show that}} {{buoyancy}} influences the downward <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> of flames consuming thermally thin fuel beds. For index cards (0. 0098 cm half-thickness) and adding-machine tape (0. 0043 cm half-thickness), {{an increase in}} the buoyancy level causes the <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> to drop until no flame propagation is possible. A dimensionless <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> is found to correlate with a Damkoehler number. As the Damkoehler number increases with decreasing buoyancy level brought about by an increase in pressure or a decrease in gravity, the dimensionless <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> approaches unity. It is also found that a small change in orientation with respect to the vertical is equivalent to a change in the magnitude of gravity in the direction of spread, and power-law relations between the dimensional <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> and pressure are only valid over a small pressure range...|$|R

The fuel studied in this thesis is Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). A mathematical model that shows how <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> is being calculated is explained. The importance of grids used in CFD was shown by choosing appropriate number of grids for a given domain and a rule for choosing the domain was established. Impact of boundary layer or flow development distance was deeply understood and a formula for flame tip velocity or equivalent velocity was developed. Computational <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> was then non-dimensionalized by dividing it with <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> obtained from de- Ris formulae and plotted against Damkohler number which was calculated based on opposed flow velocity and equivalent velocity.

The data are correlated by plotting a dimensionless <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> that {{is a measure of the}} heat transferred forward of the flame, required to sustain the flame, compared to the maximum possible forward heat transfer against a Damkoehler number.

50|$|As a {{spreading}} ridge, the Pacific Farallon Ridge was a divergent plate boundary, {{which is}} where the two plates are moving away from each other. Partial mantle melting occurs beneath such ridges, which forms new oceanic crust.

40|$|Abstract The {{frequency}} of introductions of non-indigenous forest insects into new habitats is increas-ing worldwide, often with profoundly adverse conse-quences on natural and plantation forest ecosystems. Understanding rates {{and patterns of}} spread of invasive forest insects is important for predicting when and where these species will expand their geographical range, {{with the potential to}} improve mitigation strategies. The woodwasp Sirex noctilio is a damaging invasive forest insect that kills numerous species of Pinus. Despite encountering highly variable eco-climatic conditions, S. noctilio has arrived and established in exotic pine forest production areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, we compiled historical records of S. noctilio invasion to compare <b>spread</b> <b>rates</b> among eight contrasting eco-climatic regions in the Southern Hemisphere and to explore how <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> is predicted by landscape variation in climate, habitat characteristics and anthro-pogenic effects. <b>Spread</b> <b>rates</b> for S. noctilio varied considerably among the invaded regions, ranging from 12 to 82 km per year.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Upward {{flame spread}} and flame {{interactions}} over multiple solid fuels are experimentally studied, {{and the effects}} of flame interactions on the flame <b>spreading</b> <b>rates</b> are analyzed. Flame spreading characteristics and <b>spreading</b> <b>rates</b> aremeasured and compared for six different geometric arrangements of thin solids at different solid width and separation distance between solids. The flame <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> increases as the separation distance between the parallel solids decreases because of the flow channeling effect and radiation interactions, which reaches the maximum at an intermediate separation distance and then decreases as the separation distance becomes smaller due to the flow resistance and limited thermal expansion. To compare the six types of solid geometry studied, the highest flame <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> is enclosure type of solids, followed by-shaped solids, four parallel solids, two parallel solids, L-shaped solids, and single solid.

Covariances among life-history traits are estimated from an extensive terrestrial mammal dataset using Bayesian inference. We elucidate the relative roles of different life-history traits in driving modelled <b>spread</b> <b>rates,</b> demonstrating that any one alone will be a poor predictor. We also estimate that around 30 % of mammal species have potential <b>spread</b> <b>rates</b> slower than the global mean velocity of climate change.
