Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money.

2500|$|The {{beautiful}} grisette looked {{sometimes at}} the gloves, then sideways to the window, {{then at the}} gloves, and then at me. [...] I was not disposed to break silence. I followed her example: [...] <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her, and so on alternately. I found I lost considerably in every attack: she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration, that she look'd into my very heart and reins. It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did." ...|$|E

It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. [...] "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I {{want to be a}} positive role model for young people. I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist," [...] she laughs. She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in the mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?' Music is my therapy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Martin {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: [...] "I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> , 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I {{was surprised}} when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is." [...] He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [...] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life." ...|$|E

60|$|Bun.
