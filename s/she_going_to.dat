500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Nich Maragos and David Smith of 1UP.com ranked Ibuki as {{the sixth}} overall best ninja {{character}} in video games, calling her [...] "{{one of the}} coolest-looking characters" [...] in Street Fighter III but [...] "also {{one of the least}} capable in competition."

[...] UGO's Paul Furfari further stated that she [...] "set the new standard in female fighters," [...] adding, [...] "forget Chun-Li". GameZone included the [...] "amazing" [...] Ibuki in their 2011 list of [...] "best video game ninjas" [...] and stated: [...] "We’re glad she’s still a staple in this series to this very day – but when is <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come over to Marvel vs. Capcom territory?" [...] Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed her at tenth spot of his 2014 list of top kunoichi characters in games, opining that she is [...] "far from having such status as Chun-Li, but has her charm, especially if you like Japanese schoolgirls." [...] Joe Pring from WhatCulture.com placed Ibuki at 19th spot on his 2015 list of the greatest female fighting game characters of all time: [...] "Ninja's are always cool, but Ibuki takes that awesome factor to a whole new level." [...] In 2016, Steven Hanson from Destructoid described her as [...] "everybody's favorite schoolgirl ninja."

[...] to which the reply came, [...] "A woman who can stand and walk like that doesn't have to dance." [...] The idea of a peacock costume was not new as Anna Held had worn one in Follow Me in 1916 but it was Dolores who made it her own. Gertrude Hoffmann wore a similar costume in 1920.|$|E

Furthermore, she wrote, [...] "The song seems like it's taking the message from her {{previously}} released track, 'Alive,' and giving it a boost.
