5000|$|The {{wheels of}} a {{skateboard}} are usually made of polyurethane, {{and come in}} many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters (55-85 mm) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters (48-54 mm) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available {{in a variety of}} hardnesses usually measured on the <b>Shore</b> <b>durometer</b> [...] "A" [...] scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the [...] "B" [...] or [...] "D" [...] scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness.Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually 51-54 mm), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make tricks like kickflips and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). Vertical ramp or [...] "vert" [...] skating requires larger wheels (usually 55-65 mm), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels (60-75 mm) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from 65 mm to 100 mm. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as the large soft wheels allow for smooth and easy movement over any terrain.|$|E

40|$|Room {{temperature}} vulcanized (RTV) {{silicone rubber}} is extensively used in power system {{due to its}} hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity transfer ability. Temperature has been proven to markedly affect the performance of silicone rubbers. This research investigated the degradation of RTV silicone rubber under temperature cycling treatment. Hydrophobicity and its transfer ability, hardness, functional groups, microscopic appearance, and thermal stability were analyzed using the static contact angle method, a <b>Shore</b> A <b>durometer,</b> Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetry (TG), respectively. Some significant conclusions were drawn. After the temperature was cycled between − 25 °C and 70 °C, the hydrophobicity changed modestly, but its transfer ability changed remarkably, which may result from the competition between the formation of more channels for the transfer of low molecular weight (LMW) silicone fluid and the reduction of LMW silicone fluid in the bulk. A hardness analysis and FTIR analysis demonstrated that further cross-linking reactions occurred during the treatment. SEM images showed the changes in roughness of the RTV silicone rubber surfaces.

40|$|To {{touch and}} be touched {{are vital to}} human development, well being, and relationships. However, {{to those who have}} lost their arms and hands due to {{accident}} or war, touching becomes a serious concern that often leads to psychosocial issues and social stigma. In this paper, we demonstrate that the touch from a warm and soft rubber hand can be perceived by another person as if the touch were coming from a human hand. We describe a three step process toward this goal. First, we made participants select artificial skin samples according to their preferred warmth and softness characteristics. At room temperature, the preferred warmth was found to be 28. 4 deg C at the skin surface of a soft silicone rubber material that has a <b>Shore</b> <b>durometer</b> value of 30 at the OO scale. Second, we developed a process to create a rubber hand replica of a human hand. To compare the skin softness of a human hand and artificial hands, a robotic indenter was employed to produce a softness map by recording the displacement data when constant indentation force of 1 N was applied to 780 data points on the palmar side of the hand. Results showed that an artificial hand with skeletal structure is as soft as a human hand. Lastly, the participants arms were touched with human and artificial hands, but they were prevented to see the hand that touched them. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggests that a warm and soft artificial hand can create an illusion that the touch is from a human hand. These findings open the possibilities for prosthetic and robotic hands that are lifelike and are more socially acceptable.

Material and Methods: Chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) specimens were immersed in simulated perspiration {{as well as in}} sebum. Compression tests were conducted on a Zwick testing machine. Shore A hardness measurements were carried out in a CV digital <b>Shore</b> A <b>durometer.</b> Melting and glass transition temperatures were evaluated with a differential scanning calorimeter.

Simple mathematical models were developed to correlate the measured properties with immersion time. The data were also subjected to analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey multiple range tests at a level of alpha = 0. 05. Results: Specimens immersed in perspiration became harder due to facilitation of the propagation of cross-linking reaction that probably occurred during aging of the CPE samples. Some weight increase was observed for the specimens immersed into the aqueous solutions, whereas for those immersed in sebum, weight loss was recorded, probably because of extraction of some compounds. The color change was higher for the specimens immersed in sebum than that corresponding to simulated perspiration.

Purpose: The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of different beverages on the hardness of two temporary acrylic-based soft lining materials and their bond strength to the denture base resin. Materials and Method: For the hardness test; a total of 80 rectangular specimens (40 mm× 10 mm× 3 mm) were fabricated from a heat-polymerized polymethylmethacrylate. Two commercially auto-polymerized acrylic resin-based resilient liners; Coe-Soft and Visco-gel were prepared according to the manufacturers’ instructions and applied on the specimens. For the tensile test, 160 cylindrical specimens (30 mm× 10 mm) were prepared. The liners were added between specimens with a thickness of 3 mm. The specimens of both soft liners were divided into 4 groups (n= 10) and immersed in distilled water as the control group, Coca-Cola, 8 % and 50 % ethanol. All groups were stored in separate containers at 37 oC for 12 days. All beverages were changed daily.

Results: Specimens immersed in simulated skin secretions became harder because of facilitation of the propagation of cross-linking reaction that probably occurred during aging of the polydimethylsiloxane samples, except for Elastomer 42, which seems to become more soft and ductile after immersed in sebum. Some weight increase was observed for the specimens immersed into the aqueous solutions, whereas for those immersed in sebum, weight loss was recorded, probably because of extraction of some compounds. The color change was higher for the specimens immersed in sebum than that corresponding to simulated perspiration. According to statistical analysis, all measured properties changed significantly after immersion in simulated perspiration and in sebum. Moreover, mathematical models reveal major alterations as well, which were introduced through their constants. Thus, the hypothesis investigated was rejected. Conclusions: Significant changes were observed in all the examined elastomers. The elastomers were aged for a period, which simulates 1. 5 years of clinical service. Within the limitation of this study, concerning the mechanical behavior and mostly the color changes, sebum and perspiration greatly affect the examined elastomers. Copyright © 2011 by Mutaz B.

40|$|Physical {{weathering}} {{is usually}} {{responsible for the}} degradation of maxillofacial prosthetic elastomers and the replacement of prostheses. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of outdoor weathering on the physical properties of four nonpigmented facial prosthetics after 1 year of exposure. In addition, simple mathematical models were developed to correlate the measured properties with irradiation time, including parameters with physical meaning. Three different medical-grade polydimethyl siloxanes (PDMSs) and an experimental chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) were examined in this study. The samples were exposed to solar radiation for 1 year in Athens, Greece. Mechanical tests (compression and tensile) were performed using universal-type testing machine, and hardness measurements were performed with a <b>durometer</b> (<b>Shore</b> A). Thermal tests were also performed with a differential scanning calorimeter. Simple mathematical models were developed to describe the examined properties. Changes observed in the properties of examined materials, before and after the exposure, reflected the effect of weathering. More specifically, two of the silicone prosthetics (Elastomer 42, TechSIL 25) seemed to become harder and more brittle, different from the other silicone (M 511) sample and the CPE sample, which became softer and more ductile. Moreover mathematical models correlate the measured properties with irradiation time, and their constants indicate that duration of exposure seems to increase the degradation. Significant changes in the mechanical and thermal properties of the examined materials were observed as a result of outdoor weathering. The effect of weathering on samples' properties was introduced through its effect on the mathematical models' parameters. © 2011 The Society of The Nippon Dental University...|$|R
40|$|Denture soft lining {{materials}} {{are used as}} a cushion between the hard denture base and the oral mucosa. Fluid sorption and solubility may contribute to material hardening, roughening, cracking or tearing, loss of adhesion to the hard denture base or contamination by extrinsic stains or yeasts. The ideal material is required to have low fluid uptake, good wettability, retain compliance and surface integrity, and not support fungal growth. Evaluation of behaviour in the oral environment is difficult {{and a number of}} materials, such as artificial saliva and food simulating liquids, have been recommended to simulate the environment. The two types of denture soft lining materials commonly used in clinical practice are methacrylate and silicone based. These together with an experimental elastomer were evaluated in this study. Fluid sorption and solubility were determined by immersion of disc specimens in food simulating fluids (distilled water, 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol and 50 % ethanol) and artificial saliva at 37 ± 1 °C with weighing at set time intervals. Similar experiments were carried out using liquids representing fatty food constituents with coconut oil and 1113307 H. ardness was determined using a <b>Shore</b> A <b>durometer.</b> In order to determine wettability, contact angle was measured using a computer microscope. The surface roughness was assessed using a non-contact laser profilometer. Finally, an attempt was made to identify leachable substances from the materials investigated using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. An additional part {{of this study was to}} look at the adhesion of one yeast species Candida albicans to commercial materials using various protective coatings to determine their efficacy. The resultsd emonstratedth at the type of liquid simulating foods or artificial saliva, and immersion time significantly influenced the behaviour of the commercial denture soft lining materials and the experimental elastomer during in vitro testing. The two groups of materials behaviour were different. The two methacrylate-basedd enture soft lining materials showed marked absorption and solubility which may be associated with the loss of plasticisers. The two silicone-based denture soft lining materials showed much less absorption and solubility under the same conditions. The experimental elastomer showed marked swelling in oils, which was not expected, its chemical structure being similar to a methacrylate. Shore A hardness remained unchanged during the fluid immersion with the two silicone-based materials but showed measurable changes with the two methacrylate-basemd aterials and the experimentale lastomer,I ncreaseds urface roughness was also demonstrated with the two methacrylate-based materials, and decreasedc ontact angle was found with the two silicone-basedm aterials. After various surface treatment, coconut oil reduced Candida albicans adhesion in all cases. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at (1) {{determining}} {{effects of}} the hydration process {{in the nature of}} used cooking oil, (2) studying Polyurethane synthesis from the monomer of used cooking oil from hydrated adsorption reacted using MDI, (3) studying effects of variations of oil concentration and MDI on the mechanical properties of Polyurethane, (4) studying effects of variations of oil concentration and MDI on Polyurethane cross linking, and (5) determining the thermal properties of Polyurethane of synthesis results based on mechanical properties and the most optimum cross linking. Used cooking oil utilized in this study was the three-time-used cooking oil that had undergone the process of adsorption and hydration. Adsorption process was carried out using activated carbons and hydration process using H 2 SO 4 solution with concentration variations of 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % (v/v). Characterizations of used cooking oil before and after hydration were done through (1) the analysis of functional group using FTIR spectroscopy, (2) the determination of iodine number, (3) the hydroxyl number determination, and (4) the mass density determination. Polyurethane was synthesized from a basic material of used cooking oil of hydrated adsorption using MDI. Polymerization reaction was carried out at the room temperature (29 °C) with variations of the oil mass composition to the total mass of reactants of 20 %, 40 %, and 60 % (m/m). Polyurethane characterization of synthesis results included (1) the functional group analysis using FTIR spectroscopy, (2) the determination of the cross linking through a swelling degree test, (3) the determination of mechanical properties measured with a <b>Shore</b> A. <b>Durometer,</b> and (4) the determination of thermal properties was done by using DTA. Research results showed that the most optimum hydration process of used cooking oil was done using H 2 SO 4 solution with the concentration of 20 % (v/v), the hydration process caused the hydroxyl number and density of used cooking oil increased while the iodine number of the used cooking oil decreased. Polyurethane could be synthesized from used cooking oil of the hydrated adsorption of MDI indicated by the characteristic function group for the polyurethane through FTIR analysis. This study also showed that the higher the concentration ratio of MDI to the oil, the smaller the degree of the polyurethane swelling (the more cross linking) and the higher the mechanical properties (the hardness). Polyurethanes of used cooking oil and MDI with the composition ratio of 20 % - 80 ° was best suited as a roll coating materials in paper industries.
