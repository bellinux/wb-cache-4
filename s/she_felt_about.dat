5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, O'Keeffe {{began her}} serious formal art {{training}} at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York, but she felt constrained by her lessons that focused on recreating or copying what was in nature. In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then spent seven years between 1911 and 1918 teaching in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and {{was introduced to the}} principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who espoused created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1916. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University.|$|E

It is written in verse-chorus form, and its instrumentation derives from the guitar and electronic keyboard. The song opens with an emotional piano solo {{as a tribute to}} Stefani's time with No Doubt. The verse begins at only 60 beats per minute and gradually slows, mixed with sounds of applause from the audience.

500|$|After several {{recording}} {{sessions with}} writers and producers like Paul Epworth, Fraser T Smith and Rick Rubin, Adele got enough material {{for creating a}} full LP. She released her second studio album on 19 January 2011 under the title 21. Adele first intended to title the album Rolling in the Deep, her adaptation of the slang phrase [...] "roll deep", which summarises how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> her relationship; in her loose translation, the phrase refers to having someone [...] "that has your back" [...] and always supports you. However, the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences. Although {{she had wanted to}} avoid the number motif of her debut, Adele considered [...] "21" [...] the most fitting title as it represented her age {{at the time of the}} album's composition, serving as an autobiographical period piece, [...] and symbolised the personal maturity and artistic evolution since her debut.|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I {{need to think about}} it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby I will give you more". It also has influences of Spanish music. Groove inspired music is present in [...] "Dance 2Night", which featured Timberlake.|$|E

500|$|Overall, while fan {{reaction}} to her character had previously {{resulted in a}} backlash Gilsig found [...] "tough", she hoped that [...] "Mattress" [...] would be the episode in which [...] "anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri". Asked how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> Terri being a 'love to hate' character, Gilsig replied: [...] "As long as you love to hate her, that's OK. It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig {{does not know how}} long her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will. They needed an obstacle, otherwise there's no show. What's been fun about it is that she's managed to emerge as a character unto herself with her own complexities." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN on September 7, 2012, where she was honored by Broadcast Music, Inc. for her songwriting, Carey declared [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] {{as one of her}} most [...] favorite and revealing songs that she has written. She stated that it is not always her number one or signature songs which are her [...] favorite, rather, they are [...] "lesser-known cuts from more obscure records." [...] When asked about how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> some of her number-one singles, including [...] "Hero" [...] (Music Box, 1993), [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (The Emancipation of Mimi, 2005) and [...] "Touch My Body" [...] (E=MC², 2008), the singer revealed [...] "I still love those songs, [...] I love the obscure songs because they're very close to my heart.

Streisand worked closely with Holmes during {{the creation of the}} album. Prior to their collaboration, Holmes was considered to be relatively unknown. After finishing up with Holmes and in order to thank him for the collaborations, Streisand hand-wrote him a note that read, [...] "Dear Rupert, don't be frightened, you're the best, love Barbra". In the official liner notes of Lazy Afternoon, she stated that the track was [...] "a very personal gift [...] mean a great to deal to me"; responding to her comments in a 1988 interview with a Streisand fan, Holmes claimed that the process was simple and that he had only [...] "put in [...] everything that a daughter might want to hear her father say" [...] in the lyrics.|$|E
5000|$|Knesset member Miri Regev {{has stated}} that Daphne Leef [...] "represents the extreme left".

'She {{knew it was}} coming--she <b>felt</b> it, <b>she</b> saw it, and that's {{what makes}} her sick now, that {{at such a time}} she should have {{challenged}} you, when <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> herself <b>about</b> to be associated (in people's minds, of course) with such a vile business.

500|$|As {{they worked}} on the album, Catatonia feared that {{they were about to}} be dropped by their record label, which they summed up in the song [...] "That's All Folks". Further {{references}} to difficulties with Warner Bros were included in [...] "I Am The Mob", but they preferred working with producer TommyD on the production than they had with those on Way Beyond Blue. The first single off the album had intended to be [...] "Mulder and Scully", but the label insisted that [...] "I Am the Mob" [...] was released instead. As with previous works, this was delayed, and Catatonia performed at festivals during the summer of 1997 while they waited for the release. They were booked for the Glastonbury Festival, but upon arriving they were told their spot had been cancelled. Matthews continued to get the band mentioned in the gossip columns of newspapers due to her drunken behaviour. One example followed an incident at a party celebrating the victory of the yes vote in the Welsh devolution referendum, 1997, as when asked how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the result, she responded [...] "What we want to know is who is going to shag Siân Lloyd?" [...] Lloyd subsequently launched legal action, but accepted an apology from Matthews.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} for [...] "Oh Father" [...] was generally positive. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , commented {{that with the}} track, Madonna exposed herself by transforming her personal experience into art, making it clear to anyone how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> her relationship with Tony. Rooksby believed that the [...] "psychobabble" [...] phrases of feeling good about oneself in the song, {{would have made it}} extremely popular in the early Eighties. He added that [...] "Oh Father" [...] was the most compassionate and generous moment in Madonna's musical career and the track might have inspired the exploration of childhood in the music of contemporary artists like Kate Bush and Tori Amos, in particular Bush's song [...] "The Fog" [...] from her 1989 studio album, The Sensual World, and Amos' [...] "Winter" [...] from the 1992 effort, Little Earthquakes. [...] Author Leslie C. Dunn wrote in her book Embodied Voices, that the autobiographical nature of the song brought forth a new side of Madonna. Sharing the same view, Freya Jarman-Ivens, {{one of the authors of}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds, declared [...] "Oh Father" [...] as a powerful statement regarding father-daughter relationships. Allen Metz, author of The Madonna Companion, described the song as a [...] "stark ballad with a serious string arrangement". O'Brien felt that the strings were dramatic and pretentious. She described Madonna's singing as consisting of [...] "Courtney Love-style rasp" [...] and adding that Madonna [...] "attacks the song with personal passion".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me".

Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} and I have to say I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E
