5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause <b>subconjunctival</b> and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis {{has been documented}} to cause <b>subconjunctival</b> hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is pertussis. The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|E
25|$|A soft corneal suction ring {{is applied}} to the eye, holding the eye in place. This step in the {{procedure}} can sometimes cause small blood vessels to burst, resulting in bleeding or <b>subconjunctival</b> hemorrhage into the white (sclera) of the eye, a harmless side effect that resolves within several weeks. Increased suction causes a transient dimming of vision in the treated eye. Once the eye is immobilized, a flap is created by cutting through the corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer. This process is achieved with a mechanical microkeratome using a metal blade, or a femtosecond laser that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea. The process of lifting and folding back the flap can sometimes be uncomfortable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Subconjunctival</b> hemorrhage, {{also known}} as <b>subconjunctival</b> {{haemorrhage}} and hyposphagma, is bleeding underneath the conjunctiva.

50|$|A <b>subconjunctival</b> {{hemorrhage}} {{is typically}} a self-limiting condition that requires no {{treatment in the}} absence of infection or significant trauma. The elective use of aspirin and NSAIDs is typically discouraged. Artificial tears may be applied four to six times a day.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{a bruise}} {{typically}} appears black or blue underneath the skin, a <b>subconjunctival</b> hemorrhage initially appears bright-red underneath the transparent conjunctiva. Later, the hemorrhage may spread and become green or yellow, like a bruise. Usually this disappears within 2 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Small {{encapsulated}} bleb - {{injection of}} <b>subconjunctival</b> MMC and lidocaine can balloon up adjacent conjunctiva followed by needle incision of the bleb side and bleb extension; alternatively or together, {{the use of}} biodegradable spacer or ologen collagen matrix implant may be implemented.|$|E
50|$|Although its {{appearance}} may be alarming, in general a <b>subconjunctival</b> hemorrhage is a painless and harmless condition; however, {{it may be}} associated with high blood pressure, trauma to the eye, or a base of skull fracture if there is no posterior border of the hemorrhage visible.|$|E

50|$|A red eye is an {{eye that}} appears red due to illness or injury. It is usually {{injection}} and prominence of the superficial blood vessels of the conjunctiva, or sclera, {{which may be}} caused by disorders of these or adjacent structures. Conjunctivitis and <b>subconjunctival</b> hemorrhage are two of the less serious but more common causes.|$|E
50|$|The XEN Gel Stent is an implantable transcleral microsurgical {{device that}} allows the aqueous fluid to drain from the {{anterior}} chamber into the <b>subconjunctival</b> space, a pathway utilized by traditional trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage device surgeries.

5000|$|Shade, insect repellent-impregnated ear tags, {{and lower}} {{stocking}} rates {{may help prevent}} IBK. Early identification of the disease also helps prevent spread throughout the herd. Treatment is with early systemic use of a long-acting antibiotic such as tetracycline or florfenicol. <b>Subconjunctival</b> injections with procaine penicillin or other antibiotics are also effective, providing a [...] "bubble" [...] of antibiotic which releases into the eye slowly over several days.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} to the glaucoma drainage devices that use an ab externo procedure, ab interno implants, such as the Xen Gel Stent, are transscleral implants to channel aqueous humor into the non-dissected Tenon's space, creating a <b>subconjunctival</b> drainage area similar to a bleb. The implants are transscleral and different from more other ab interno implants that do not create a transscleral drainage, such as iStent, CyPass, or Hydrus.|$|E
50|$|The 6-millimeter stent {{is placed}} through the trabecular meshwork, with {{one end of}} the stent sitting {{directly}} underneath the conjunctiva, past the outer wall of the sclera. The inner tip of the stent sits in the anterior chamber, allowing a direct connection for aqueous to flow into the <b>subconjunctival</b> space. The stent is made of a non-bioreactive material, which does not promote scarring of the conjunctiva. The XEN Gel Stent was FDA approved on Nov 22, 2016.|$|E
