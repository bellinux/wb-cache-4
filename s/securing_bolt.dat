2500|$|The aftercabin worked {{loose with}} the <b>securing</b> <b>bolts</b> pulled through the planking. [...] Second Officer Weeks {{and the crew}} tried to shove {{blankets}} and ticking into the holes to stop the leaks, but the vessel still kept shipping additional tons of water. [...] The ship continued to gradually come apart under the stress. [...] Her iron hull was not breached but her wooden upper works were being torn away by waves.|$|R
2500|$|For a steamer move upriver {{through the}} rapids on the Snake River, It was {{necessary}} to [...] "line" [...] through the rapids. [...] Lining consisted of running a cable out from a winch on the steamer to a <b>bolt</b> <b>secured</b> in a rock on the shore. [...] Once the cable was <b>secured</b> to the <b>bolt,</b> the winch would then crank in the cable, pulling the steamer upstream through the rapids.|$|R
50|$|The stone-pitched ford crosses Byfield Creek in a north-south {{direction}} at {{a bearing}} of 20?. It has a rectangular frame of timber sleepers fitted together and <b>secured</b> by <b>bolts,</b> presumably iron coach bolts, {{and filled with}} stone pitching to create a causeway across the creek.|$|R

2500|$|At the Louisville plant, Curtiss line {{workers would}} later recall two C-76 {{production}} planes that were kept {{for some time}} in the assembly building, with one plane cannibalized to keep the other in flyable condition. On 10 May 1943, the first YC-76 constructed at the Louisville, Kentucky plant, 42-86918, lost its tail unit at due to lack of forgotten <b>securing</b> <b>bolts</b> during test flight, crashing at Okolona, Kentucky, killing three Curtiss-Wright test crew, pilot Ed Schubinger, co-pilot John L. [...] "Duke" [...] Trowbridge, and engineer Robert G. Scudder. As war priority measures designed to increase aluminum production proved successful, the feared shortage of light alloys never materialized. Moreover, USAAF Training Command had begun to forward widespread complaints of insufficient service life on their wooden-winged Fairchild PT-19 primary trainers when exposed to high heat in training bases located in Texas and Florida.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower link}} {{itself is not}} {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front <b>securing</b> <b>bolts</b> happen to come loose.|$|R

2500|$|During {{production}} of the first batch of 100 Tempest V [...] "Series Is", distinguishable by their serial number prefix JNxxx, several improvements were progressively introduced and were used from the outset on all succeeding Tempest V [...] "Series 2s", with serial number prefixes EJ, NV and SN. The fuselage/empennage joint originally featured 20 external reinforcing [...] "fishplates", similar to those fitted to the Typhoon, {{but it was not}} long before the rear fuselage was strengthened and, with the fishplates no longer being needed, the rear fuselage became detachable. [...] The first series of Tempest Vs used a built-up rear spar pick-up/bulkhead assembly (just behind the cockpit) which was adapted from the Typhoon. Small blisters on the upper rear wing root fairing covered the <b>securing</b> <b>bolts.</b> This was later changed to a new forged, lightweight assembly which connected to new spar booms: the upper wing root blisters were replaced by small [...] "teardrop" [...] fairings under the wings.|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} of which we treat, the new and highly-decorated suite of rooms were, for the first time, illuminated, and that with a brilliancy {{which might have been}} visible half-a-dozen miles off, had not oaken shutters, {{carefully}} <b>secured</b> with <b>bolt</b> and padlock, and mantled with long curtains of silk and of velvet, deeply fringed with gold, prevented the slightest gleam of radiance front being seen without.|$|R
50|$|The Russians {{had built}} a large {{floating}} pontoon bridge across the Genitchi Strait, Sea of Azov, to connect the town of Genitchi to the Arabat Spit, and it served as the main supply route to reinforce their troops at Sevastopol. The destruction of the bridge would force the Russians to travel an extra 192 km to deliver supplies, and it therefore became a strategic objective for British forces. Two attacks to cut the floating bridge's hawsers had proved unsuccessful and alerted the Russian garrison. The British made a third attempt on 3 July 1855 using HMS Beagle's four-oared gig, commanded by Gunner John Hayles, and a small paddle-box steamer with one gun, under Midshipman Martin Tracy. The paddle-box steamer moored where the crew could see Russian soldiers marching about on shore and fired the first round in the breech, which drew the gun's <b>securing</b> <b>bolts</b> and made it useless. That left six men in a four-oared boat (including Joseph Trewavas), one rifle, ten rounds of ammunition, and a cutlass apiece to face two hundred enemy on shore behind heaps of coal.|$|R
2500|$|A yett (from the Old English and Scots {{language}} {{word for}} [...] "gate") is a gate or grille of latticed wrought iron bars used for defensive purposes in castles and tower houses. [...] Unlike a portcullis, which is raised and lowered vertically using mechanical means, yetts are hinged {{in the manner}} of a traditional gate or door, and <b>secured</b> by <b>bolts</b> attached to the yett, or by long bars drawn out from the wall or gateway.|$|R
50|$|Here {{one or two}} bolts {{from the}} saw run through. The clutch cover is put {{on top of the}} bar and it is <b>secured</b> though this/these <b>bolts.</b> It depends {{on the size of the}} saw if one or two bolts are installed.|$|R
50|$|The keyed hook scarf {{is common}} in ship and boat-building, as well as timber framing and wooden bridge construction. In large timbers such as these the scarf is {{virtually}} always <b>secured</b> with through <b>bolts,</b> and is frequently reinforced externally with iron or steel fishplates, and/or strapping.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} into the crash of Flight 411 found that the probable cause of the crash was metal fatigue in the bottom <b>bolt</b> <b>securing</b> the starboard wing number 2 flap unit. The aileron locked when number 2 flap unit became detached from the wing trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The flatrods (Feldgestänge) {{themselves}} {{were used to}} transfer power over greater distances between the main engine and the pump rods. Iron collars (Kunstringe) were fitted onto the wheel axles, connecting pipes (Ansetzröhren) and metal sleeves (Ansteckkielen) as well as {{certain parts of the}} wooden flatrods. The actual rods (Kunststangen) were long squared timbers that transmitted the power horizontally or at an incline. They had articulated iron joints (Kunstschlösser or Stangenschlösser) that were designed such that they could be interleaved into one another and <b>secured</b> with <b>bolts</b> or screws.|$|R
6000|$|... "That also I have considered," [...] said Dwining. [...] "To {{make the}} attempt by {{day in his}} own house were too open and dangerous, for he hath five {{servants}} who work {{with him at the}} stithy, four of them strong knaves, and all loving to their master. By night were scarce less desperate, for he hath his doors strongly <b>secured</b> with <b>bolt</b> of oak and bar of iron, and ere the fastenings of his house could be forced, the neighbourhood would rise to his rescue, especially as they are still alarmed by the practice on St. Valentine's Even." ...|$|R
50|$|Pad-mounted {{transformers}} have <b>secure</b> {{locked and}} <b>bolted</b> grounded metal enclosures to discourage unauthorized access to live internal parts. The enclosure may also include fuses, isolating switches, load-break bushings, and other accessories {{as described in}} technical standards. Pad-mounted transformers for distribution systems typically range from around 100 to 2000 kVA, although some larger units are also used.|$|R
40|$|New method {{allows for}} {{virtually}} any bolt {{to be easily}} converted to "captive" bolt. Method eliminates need for separate design for each application. Cup-shaped washer that is flattened <b>secures</b> tap to <b>bolt.</b> Wire attached to tab holds bolt assembly captive. Flattening washer can also be done during installation of bolt. Wash, tab and spacer are all made of corrosion-resistant steel...|$|R
50|$|Wooden {{tables are}} {{constructed}} using lumber boards. Protection for the wood (stain, paint, or wood protectant that repels water) is necessary {{to protect it from}} cracking, warping, or rotting due to moisture. The table-top and bench-top boards are attached to the trusses or beams using wood screws or nails. The legs can be <b>secured</b> with carriage <b>bolts</b> fastened by nuts and washers.|$|R
50|$|Steel-framework can {{be easily}} {{constructed}} of electrical conduit. One flattens {{the end of a}} strut and drills bolt holes at the needed length. A single <b>bolt</b> <b>secures</b> a vertex of struts. The nuts are usually set with removable locking compound, or if the dome is portable, have a castellated nut with a cotter pin. This is the standard way to construct domes for jungle gyms.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} {{the effect of}} bolt interference fit on the fatigue life of lap joints in double shear was investigated by conducting experimental fatigue tests and also analytically by FE simulation. In the experimental part, fatigue tests were carried out on specimens made from aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 plates joined together as double lap joints and <b>secured</b> using <b>bolts</b> having fits ranging from zero clearance to different levels of interference. The results demonstrate how the failure is affected using different levels of interference fit. In the numerical study, 3 -D FE models were used to simulate the different pin in hole fits considered and {{the results have been}} used to help explain the trends which were observed in the experimentally obtained S-N curve behaviour...|$|R
6000|$|Lee's actual {{treatment}} {{was not so}} harsh as had been represented. He was in close confinement it is true, but three rooms had been fitted up for his reception in the Old City Hall of New York, having nothing of {{the look of a}} prison excepting that they were <b>secured</b> by <b>bolts</b> and bars. Congress, in the meantime, had resorted to their threatened measure of retaliation. On the 20th of February they had resolved that the Board of War be directed immediately to order the five Hessian field-officers and Lieutenant-colonel Campbell into safe and close custody, [...] "it being the unalterable resolution of Congress to retaliate on them the same punishment as may be inflicted on the person of General Lee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{stone is}} of immense weight and strength," [...] Cuthbert replied, [...] "and {{could not be}} loosed from below save with great labor and noise. There are, moreover, several massive doors in the passage, {{all of which are}} <b>secured</b> by heavy <b>bolts</b> within. It is {{therefore}} out of the question that we could enter the castle by that way. But were we once in, we could easily carry off the lady through this passage." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{engineering}} {{details on}} the Tay Bridge were considerably simpler, lighter, and cheaper than on the earlier viaducts. On these the machined base of each column section docked securely into a machined enlarged section {{of the top of}} the section below. The joint was then <b>secured</b> by <b>bolts</b> through matching holes on lugs (Crumlin) or flanges (Belah) on the two sections. This 'spigot and faucet' configuration was used (apparently without machining) on some Tay Bridge pier columns, but on some the bolts were relied upon to ensure correct alignment. (In the event, the joints were made using undersized bolts. [...] This gave greater tolerances when assembling the column, but the less positive alignment of the column joints as initially assembled and after any subsequent 'working' of the joint would have weakened the column).|$|R
25|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded steel tubing fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for steel tubing flaps and ailerons. The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were <b>secured</b> with two <b>bolts</b> each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or skis. The tail wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|R
40|$|A {{licensing}} agreement between Marshall Space Flight Center and M&A Screw and Machineworks {{has brought the}} quick connect nut to the commerical market. Originally designed {{as part of a}} project seeking in-space assembly techniques, the quick connect nut is <b>secured</b> around a <b>bolt</b> merely by pushing it onto the bolt and giving it a single twist. Applications for the nuts include oil drilling platforms, mining industry, and other practices that rely on speedy assembly for success...|$|R

50|$|Some trouble {{has been}} taken to dampen engine vibration. The engine and {{separate}} gearbox are on a subframe. The engine is flexibly held by two sets of enclosed springs at the front end and at the back by semi-circular steel trunnion blocks. These blocks are <b>secured</b> by spring-loaded <b>bolts.</b> This way the engine is held firmly in a fore and aft position but can swing {{to the limits of}} the two sets of enclosed front springs.|$|R
50|$|The C.74 {{was first}} flown in 1922 and seemed likely to sell well. Entered into Le Grand Prix des Avions des Transports (The Great Prize for Transport Aircraft) {{competition}} held in early November 1922, {{it was well}} regarded by the jury. On 14 November, as it took off from Le Bourget, <b>bolts</b> <b>securing</b> one of the propellers failed and the C.74 crashed killing all three crew members, the pilot Alphonse Poiré and mechanics Courcy and Bovillier. No more were built.|$|R
