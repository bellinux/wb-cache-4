25|$|In 1953, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{took over}} the subway from the Board of Transportation. They {{continued}} to issue Hagstrom maps as official maps until 1956, but instituted two changes.

This was done to save money, as the Voorhies map was free, while Hagstrom charged for theirs. To keep the publications valid, the NYCTA periodically sent updated <b>service</b> <b>information</b> to both Hagstrom and Voorhies to be printed in service tables and, where necessary, incorporated into the map. Second: the NYCTA solicited proposals to create an in-house map design to save money and have more control of the map.|$|E
