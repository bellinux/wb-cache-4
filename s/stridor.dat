5|$|Although {{uncommon}} in dogs, bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve disease {{may be the}} cause of wheezing (<b>stridor)</b> when middle-aged dogs inhale.|$|E
5|$|A {{total score}} of ≤2 {{indicates}} mild croup. The characteristic barking cough and hoarseness may be present, {{but there is}} no <b>stridor</b> at rest.|$|E
5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as <b>stridor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice. It {{is the sum of}} points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, <b>stridor,</b> air entry, and retractions. The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and <b>stridor,</b> an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E
25|$|In severe cases, <b>stridor</b> of {{the airway}} occurs, with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and {{decreasing}} oxygen levels. Tracheal intubation {{is required in}} these situations to prevent respiratory arrest and risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Goitre (enlarged thyroid). If {{the thyroid}} grows large enough, it may {{compress}} the recurrent laryngeal nerve, producing vocal cord paralysis, dysphonia, and even respiratory <b>stridor.</b> Compression of the sympathetic chain {{may result in}} Horner's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{approach}} to evaluation begins by {{assessment of the}} airway, breathing, and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination. Signs that represent significant severity include hypotension, hypoxemia, tracheal deviation, altered mental status, unstable dysrhythmia, <b>stridor,</b> intercostal indrawing, cyanosis, tripod positioning, pronounced use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes) and absent breath sounds.|$|E
500|$|Croup is {{characterized}} by a [...] "barking" [...] cough, <b>stridor,</b> hoarseness, and difficulty breathing which usually worsens at night. The [...] "barking" [...] cough is often described as resembling the call of a seal or sea lion. [...] The <b>stridor</b> is worsened by agitation or crying, and if it can be heard at rest, it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways. As croup worsens, <b>stridor</b> may decrease considerably.|$|E
500|$|A {{total score}} of 3–5 is {{classified}} as moderate croup. [...] It presents with easily heard <b>stridor,</b> but with few other signs.|$|E
500|$|A {{total score}} of 6–11 is severe croup. [...] It also {{presents}} with obvious <b>stridor,</b> but also features marked chest wall indrawing.|$|E
500|$|A {{total score}} of ≥12 {{indicates}} impending respiratory failure. [...] The barking cough and <b>stridor</b> {{may no longer}} be prominent at this stage.|$|E
500|$|Croup, {{also known}} as laryngotracheobronchitis, {{is a type of}} {{respiratory}} infection that is usually caused by a virus. The infection leads to swelling inside the trachea, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of [...] "barking" [...] cough, <b>stridor,</b> and a hoarse voice. Fever and runny nose may also be present. These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe. Often it starts or is worse at night. It normally lasts one to two days.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{patients}} {{at risk for}} foreign body ingestion {{may not be able}} to give an accurate medical history of ingestion, either due to age or mental illness. [...] It is important that physicians treating these patients recognize the symptoms of esophageal foreign body impaction requiring urgent intervention. Most frequently, these include drooling and the inability to swallow saliva, neck tenderness, regurgitation of food, <b>stridor</b> and shortness of breath if there is compression of the trachea.|$|E
2500|$|Laryngeal {{diphtheria}} {{can lead}} to a characteristic swollen neck and throat, or [...] "bull neck". The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition, characterized by a brassy or [...] "barking" [...] cough, <b>stridor,</b> hoarseness, and difficulty breathing, and historically referred to variously as [...] "diphtheritic croup", [...] "true croup", or sometimes simply as [...] "croup". Diphtheritic croup is extremely rare in countries where diphtheria vaccination is customary. As a result, the term [...] "croup" [...] nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms.|$|E
60|$|The {{bells of}} Avignon rose into song {{as he was}} gazing; and the high notes and the deep tossed and drowned, boomed {{suddenly}} near or were suddenly swallowed up, in the current of the mistral. Tears sprang in the pale blue eyes; the expression of his face was changed {{to that of a}} more active misery, {{it seemed as if the}} voices of the bells reached, and touched and pained him, in a waste of vacancy where even pain was welcome. Outside in the night they continued to sound on, swelling and fainting; and the listener heard in his memory, as it were their harmonies, joy-bells clashing in a northern city, and the acclamations of a multitude, the cries of battle, the gross voices of cannon, the <b>stridor</b> of an animated life. And then all died away, and he stood face to face with himself in the waste of vacancy, and a horror came upon his mind, and a faintness on his brain, such as seizes men upon the brink of cliffs.|$|E
5000|$|A special type of wheeze is <b>stridor.</b> <b>Stridor</b> — {{the word}} is from the Latin, <b>strīdor</b> — is a harsh, high-pitched, {{vibrating}} sound that is heard in respiratory tract obstruction. <b>Stridor</b> heard solely in the expiratory phase of respiration usually indicates an upper respiratory tract obstruction, [...] "as with aspiration of a foreign body (such as the fabled pediatric peanut)." [...] <b>Stridor</b> in the inspiratory phase is usually heard with obstruction in the upper airways, such as the trachea, epiglottis, or larynx; because a block here means that no air may reach either lung, this condition is a medical emergency. Biphasic <b>stridor</b> (occurring during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases) indicates narrowing {{at the level of}} the glottis or subglottis, the point between the upper and lower airways.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Stridor</b> (Latin for [...] "creaking or grating noise") is {{a high-pitched}} [...] breath sound {{resulting}} from turbulent air {{flow in the}} larynx or lower in the bronchial tree. It is different from a stertor which is a noise originating in the pharynx. <b>Stridor</b> is a physical sign which {{is caused by a}} narrowed or obstructed airway. It can be inspiratory, expiratory or biphasic, although it is usually heard during inspiration. Inspiratory <b>stridor</b> often occurs in children with croup. It may be indicative of serious airway obstruction from severe conditions such as epiglottitis, a foreign body lodged in the airway, or a laryngeal tumor. <b>Stridor</b> should always command attention to establish its cause. Visualization of the airway by medical experts equipped to control the airway may be needed.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} and signs {{that may be}} present include shortness of breath, wheezes, or <b>stridor.</b> The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while <b>stridor</b> is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling. Hoarseness, pain with swallowing, or a cough may also occur.|$|E

50|$|Laryngomalacia {{results in}} partial airway obstruction, most {{commonly}} causing a characteristic high-pitched squeaking noise on inhalation (inspiratory <b>stridor).</b> Some infants have feeding difficulties {{related to this}} problem. Rarely, children will have significant life-threatening airway obstruction. The vast majority, however, will only have <b>stridor</b> without other more serious symptoms such as dyspnea (difficulty breathing).|$|E
