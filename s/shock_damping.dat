50|$|Compression damping {{refers to}} systems that slow {{the rate of}} {{compression}} in a front fork shock or rear <b>shock.</b> Compression <b>damping</b> is usually accomplished by forcing a hydraulic fluid (such as oil) through a valve when the shock becomes loaded. The amount of damping {{is determined by the}} resistance through the valve, a higher amount of damping resulting from greater resistance in the valve. Many <b>shocks</b> have compression <b>damping</b> adjustments which vary the resistance in the valve. Often, lockouts function by allowing no or very little compression.|$|R
50|$|The {{connecting}} rods are of forged aluminum and do provide some <b>shock</b> <b>damping,</b> {{which is why}} aluminum is used in place of titanium, because titanium {{connecting rods}} transmit {{too much of the}} combustion impulse to the big-end rod bearings, endangering the bearings and thus the crankshaft and block. Each con rod has two bolts, shell bearings for the big end while the pin runs directly in the rod.|$|E

50|$|The car's {{handling}} was aided {{with the}} factory-tuning of the car's suspension {{and the addition}} of low-profile 17-inch wheels. A front strut tower brace, extra-firm springs, revised <b>shock</b> <b>damping,</b> firmer front polyurethane bushings, dual-tip muffler, plus front stabilizer bars were also standard. Standard brakes were vented discs for the front brakes and solid discs at the rear, or optional Brembo brakes for the 2004 to 2006 year models. A four-wheel anti-lock braking system was also optional on non-Brembo models, which was packaged with front-seat side-impact air bags.|$|E
30|$|It {{means that}} the wedge and shoes act as <b>shock</b> <b>damper</b> and the applied force is then {{transferred}} to the rubber springs/draft pads. Each rubber spring/draft pad consists of elastomeric material sandwiched between two metal plates. Advantage of using draft gear having such damping effect is that impact energy on the couplers can gradually be absorbed by all the couplers. This results in lower coupler force in leading wagons. The height of a single draft pad prior to assembly is 67.2  mm. In assembled condition the effective height of a single draft pad is 50  mm. The material properties taken are same as those in Sect 2.2. 1. The boundary conditions are taken as: all nodes at the bottom surface of the housing are fixed and the prestress pressure load is applied at outer surface of the wedge.|$|R

5000|$|... 2000: The Rodeo and Amigo {{receive a}} visual refresh with beefier bumpers, new headlights, taillights, and grille designs. On the inside, new seats and seat fabrics are introduced. The Amigo gets {{its own unique}} grille, light gray bumpers with faux bumper guard, {{matching}} light gray fender flares, and black-trimmed headlights. For the five-door Rodeo, adjustable shock absorbers were new this year and 16-inch tires became standard on all models. Cruise control was now standard on V6 Rodeos, and an automatic transmission became standard on the LSE edition. A new Intelligent Suspension Control featuring a dashboard button to adjust <b>shock</b> <b>damping</b> between sport and normal settings became standard on the LSE and optional on LS models. The Honda Passport {{did not get the}} adjustable-shock system. A new Ironman package debuted for the LS, marking Isuzu's sponsorship of the Ironman triathlon competition.

5000|$|... 1965: Canon Pellix (Japan): first (really {{second after}} french Focaflex of 1959) {{pellicle}} reflex mirror SLR. Virtually all SLRs use fast-moving reflex mirrors that swivel {{out of the}} way to take the picture, causing mirror shock vibration, blacking-out the viewfinder and delaying shutter firing. Camera shake can blur the image and the subject (which might have moved) cannot be seen at the instant of exposure. A fixed semi-transparent pellicle reflex mirror, reflecting 30% of the light to the viewfinder and transmitting 70% to the film, prevents camera shake and viewfinder blackout, and reduces shutter lag time at the costs of a dimmer viewfinder image, longer exposure times and possible image quality loss. Modern instant return mirrors are fast enough and have efficient enough <b>shock</b> <b>damping</b> systems that the trade offs are not usually considered worthwhile. Pellicle mirror SLRs are very rare and are usually specialized designs for ultra-high speed (10+ frames per second) sequence shooting.|$|E
40|$|We use high {{resolution}} 3 D SPH simulations {{to study the}} evolution of self-gravitating binary protoplanetary disks. Heating by shocks and cooling are included. We consider different orbital separations and masses of the disks and central stars. Isolated massive disks (M ∼ 0. 1 M_ødot) fragment into protoplanets {{as a result of}} gravitational instability for cooling times comparable to the orbital time. Fragmentation does not occur in binary systems with a separation of about 60 AU. This is because efficient heating owing to strong tidally induced spiral <b>shocks</b> <b>damps</b> any overdensity. The resulting temperatures, above 200 K, would vaporize water ice in the outer disk, posing a problem even for the other model of giant planet formation, core-accretion. Light disks (M ∼ 0. 01 M_) do not fragment but remain cold because their low self-gravity inhibits strong shocks. Core accretion would not be hampered in the latter. At separations of about 120 AU the efficiency of fragmentation by disk instability rises and approaches that in isolated systems. If disk instability is the main formation mechanism for giant planets, on going surveys targeting binary systems should find considerably fewer planets in systems with separations below 100 AU.

50|$|In 2013 the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) {{introduced}} the series production version of PRE-SCAN, {{but with a}} stereo camera instead of laser projectors. The system dubbed Magic Body Control is fitted with a road-sensing system (Road Surface Scan) that pre-loads the shocks for the road surface detected. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 kph mph, and it adjusts the <b>shock</b> <b>damping</b> at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. Initially only available on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car's body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps. The ABC has undergone major modifications for the new S-Class: the wheel damping is now continuously adjustable, the spring strut response has been improved and the pump efficiency has been further enhanced. A digital interface connects the control unit and the sensors, while the fast FlexRay bus connects the control unit and the vehicle electronics. Processing power is more than double that of the previous system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCricket bowling {{requires}} {{high level}} of skills in many ways (e. g. physically and mentally). The ball delivery technique {{is one of these}} important skills which can be optimised with advanced training methods. These training methods hinge on advanced performance parameters. Development of a low cost smart cricket ball will address the shortcomings of the existing systems and discover and explore cricket bowling kinematics and dynamics. In the past cricket bowling kinematics has not been properly studied using instrumented balls due to technical limitations of sensor system and electronics design. The aim of the project was to develop a highly portable instrumented cricket ball for recording the ball's kinematics and calculating dynamic performance parameters from kinematic data. The ball is designed {{in such a way that}} it exactly feels and looks (i. e. mass and material) as a real cricket ball.

40|$|Abstract: This {{theoretical}} {{study is}} based on a nano-technological evaluation of the effect of pressure on the composite bone fine structure. It turned out, that the well known macroscopic mechano-elastic performance of bones in combination with muscles and tendons is just one functional aspect which is critically supported by additional micro- and nano- <b>shock</b> <b>damping</b> technology aimed at minimising local bone material damage within the joints and supporting spongy bone material. The identified mechanisms comprise essentially three phenomena localised within the three–dimensional spongy structure with channels and so called perforated flexible tensulae membranes of different dimensions intersecting and linking them. Kinetic energy of a mechanical shock may be dissipated within the solid-liquid composite bone structure into heat via the generation of quasi-chaotic hydromechanic micro-turbulence. It may generate electro-kinetic energy in terms of electric currents and potentials. And the resulting specific structural and surface electrochemical changes may induce the compressible intra-osseal liquid to build up pressure dependent free chemical energy. Innovative bone joint prostheses will have to consider and to be adapted to the nano-material aspects of shock absorption in the operated bones...|$|E
40|$|We {{revisit the}} idea that density-wave wakes of planets drive {{accretion}} in protostellar disks. The effects of many small planets can be represented as a viscosity if the wakes damp locally, but the viscosity {{is proportional to the}} damping length. Damping occurs mainly by shocks even for earth-mass planets. The excitation of the wake follows from standard linear theory including the torque cutoff. We use this as input to an approximate but quantitative nonlinear theory based on Burger’s equation for the subsequent propagation and shock. <b>Shock</b> <b>damping</b> is indeed local but weakly so. If all metals in a minimum-mass solar nebula are invested in planets of a few earth masses each, dimensionless viscosities [alpha] of order dex(- 4) to dex(- 3) result. We compare this with observational constraints. Such small planets would have escaped detection in radial-velocity surveys and could be ubiquitous. If so, then the similarity of the observed lifetime of T Tauri disks to the theoretical timescale for assembling a rocky planet may be fate rather than coincidence.
