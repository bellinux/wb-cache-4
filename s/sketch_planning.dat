40|$|The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) {{emphasizes}} {{assessment of}} multi-modal alternatives and demand management strategies. This emphasis {{has increased the}} need for planners to provide good comparative information to decision-makers. Benefit-cost analysis is a useful tool to compare the economic worth of alternatives and evaluate trade-offs between eco-nomic benefits and non-monetizable social and environmental impacts. In 1995, the Federal High-way Administration (FHWA) developed a <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> tool called the <b>Sketch</b> <b>Planning</b> Analysis Spreadsheet Model (SPASM) to assist planners in developing the type of economic effi-ciency and other evaluative information needed to compare across modes and demand manage-ment strategies, at a <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> level of analysis for corridor studies. When more detailed analysis is required, however, SPASM cannot be used directly, owing to several simplifying assumptions. (For example, all trips {{are assumed to be}} of an average trip length, made between the two ends of the corridor.) Also, it is difficult to use SPASM for systemwide analysis.

40|$|With the {{objective}} of improving wise deployment and efficient operations of ramp meters, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation project comprising several elements. Already completed components include two evaluations of metering impacts on major corridors in the Milwaukee metropolitan area and on the freeway beltline in Madison. A third component was {{an evaluation of the}} timing and retiming strategy used by WisDOT. The most recently completed component is the Statewide Ramp Metering and Control Plan, which emphasizes applying consistent implementation criteria for potential installations. WisDOT reviewed algorithms and metering practices used throughout the country. Each algorithm was evaluated against its benefits, relative costs, and concerns related to implementation and operation. Discussions were held with selected states, to aid in understanding other states ’ experiences with ramp metering algorithms. This effort has resulted in valuable insight into the widely varied practice of ramp metering nationwide. Tasks currently underway include a revisit of metering benefits for existing deployments and the Statewide Freeway Surveillance and Ramp Control <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> activity, which is one component of the broader <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> project for statewide traffic operations. Preliminary results of a prototype implementation planning tool should be available late 2007. Lastly, with a focus on improving metering operations in Wisconsin, WisDOT is utilizing microsimulation models, as well as simpler techniques, to improve their existing ramp meter algorithm. The initial effort is applied to five metering locations in Milwaukee and Madison to determine whether more optimal plans are achievable for low cost.

Important reasons are inadequate functionality and usability. In this article we question if following a socio-technical method in PSS development could lead to PSS with better functionality and usability than following a traditional systems engineering method, as is sometimes suggested in literature. The former method involves close cooperation with users, whereas the latter does not. This article describes an empirical study of this question. The article describes the development, application and evaluation of two PSS for <b>sketch</b> <b>planning,</b> one developed by following the traditional systems engineering method and the other by following the socio-technical method. The PSS integrate drawing and sketching with basic geographic information system functionality and use an innovative hardware interface called Maptable. The evaluation {{results show that the}} traditionally developed PSS was immediately rejected by planning practitioners due to poor functionality and usability, whereas the PSS developed with a socio-technical approach was much more acceptable. Intense cooperation with users in agreement with the socio-technical method appeared to improve the analysis of planning tasks and user needs, leading to a PSS with a sophisticated and dedicated architecture. This PSS was considered more functional and usable than the traditionally developed PSS. In addition, the socio-technically developed PSS offers some benefits over conventional planning methods. In current state the PSS is suitable for use by professionals, and it is being further developed aiming to make it suitable for supporting collaborative planning with citizen...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} the Dutch LUTI model TIGRIS in the planning process. TIGRIS is a long-term, incremental, time-based interaction and allocation model for land use, mobility, congestion and accessibility. In TIGRIS accessibility is described as a location factor for land-use that generates mobility. This increased mobility leads to congestion and changes in accessibility, and afterwards to new changes in land use. The model is used for regional and national forecasting, and follows a learning-by-doing approach. In this paper four applications of TIGRIS are described with a focus on assessing impacts and the role in the planning process. Because TIGRIS was originally developed as a <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> model with limited detail and the calibration on the basis of empirical data was rather limited, a new version, TIGRIS XL, is currently being developed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>sketch</b> <b>planning,</b> it is {{expected}} that a simplified network (i. e., an abstracted network or subnetwork) model can accurately approximate the travel demand patterns and levelof-service attributes obtained from its full-network counterpart. A data prerequisite in this approximation process is the trip matrix of the simplified network. This paper discusses a maximum entropy method for the subnetwork trip matrix estimation problem, relying only on link flow rates (estimated via full-network traffic assignment or as observed link-level vehicle counts). A linearization algorithm of the Frank-Wolfe type is devised for problem solutions, in which a column generation approach is iteratively used to solve the linearized subproblem without path enumeration. Encouraging results from a numerical example suggest that this method holds much promise for generating trip matrices {{that can be used to}} evaluate traffic flo...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{increasing}} interest in environment-friendly transportation {{strategies such as}} park-and-ride (P+R), evaluating transportation strategies’ emissions impacts is obtaining more attention. This study investigates the emissions impacts of P+R strategy through the case study of Song-Hong Road P+R Lot, the first P+R facility with rail transit connection in mainland China. The emissions impact evaluation approach is formulated using the <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> method. Using the data collected from two P+R lot surveys, the emissions impact of Song-Hong Road P+R Lot was estimated.

40|$|While {{many aspects}} of the {{planning}} profession have changed radically in light of recent technological advances, the practice of sketching plans has remained largely unaffected. There may be good reasons for eschewing computers in the design arena such as that their use may detract from the liberty of the design thinking process. This thesis suggests that this reluctance may be overcome by changing the practice from one of emulation with digital tools to one of "augmentation". In addressing a perceived need to bring computation to the design table a solution called the "digitally augmented <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> environment" (DASPE) has been developed. Making use of video projection, DASPE augments the design space with digital visualization and analysis tools and allows planners to sketch using either conventional media or a pen stylus on a digitizing table. Plans can be sketched in the conventional manner, then "hardened" into three dimensional computer models without the need to leave the design space. by Kenneth Goulding. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|Planning Board (TPB) engaged Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (VHB) {{to review}} the current use of traffic {{simulation}} and Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models among Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in the United States. Traffic simulation models can generally be considered to fall into three categories: microscopic, microscopic with DTA capability, and mesoscopic DTA. A mesoscopic traffic model represents traffic as platoons of vehicles traveling through the network. Mesoscopic models are generally associated with DTA, however, {{there are a number}} of mesoscopic models without DTA capability that are used for <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> purposes where schedule and budget do not allow for detailed microsimulation. By contrast, a microscopic traffic model is the most detailed representation of a vehicle’s movement through a network, often on a second-by-second (or smaller) basis. Because of its high level of detail, traffic simulation models are able to produce an animation of individual vehicles moving through the network.

While a number of MPOs have reported the use of a variety of traffic simulation softwar...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{important}} bottlenecks to the wider adoption of planning support systems {{is a lack of}} evidence about whether they improve planning processes. In addition, existing research does not include field studies with high context validity. This paper fills this gap in the literature by reporting the results from a field study evaluating the performance of a planning support systems used for <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> as part of a land use planning project in metropolitan Austin, Texas, USA. Participants reported high levels of learning and dialog quality, the two chosen planning support systems performance measures. A regression analysis finds both are related to the ability of planning support systems to change participantsâ€™ perceptions. In addition, as suggested by learning theory, the planning support systems performance outcomes are significantly related to participantsâ€™ identity as a planner and meeting attendance, but are not related to gender or educational attainment. Finally, for the planning support systems studied here, participation in the planning support systems creation is less important than other factors in explaining planning support systems performance. The paper contributes to efforts to develop and implement robust measures of planning support systems performance and links concept of planning support systems performance to broader theories of learning.

40|$|The {{selection}} of different congestion management process (CMP) strategies {{for a specific}} corridor by a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) {{is an important step}} in the transportation planning process. The {{selection of}} strategies and prediction of improvements using simple <b>sketch</b> <b>planning</b> methods based on travel time reliability data would be a useful tool. The congestion management strategies (CMS) and travel time reliability data, which are available for many MPOs including the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC), are used to select projects to address congestion problems. A model is needed that can predict travel time reliability indices changes. Two travel time reliability indices that were used in this research are the posted speed reliability index and expected travel time reliability index, which are used by SPC. The goal of this research was to develop a CMS model that can select one or several optimum strategies for a corridor. The results are then used to calculate the changes in predicted travel time reliability indices for a corridor, which can be used to indicate the expected impact of the strategies. The research results provide a combined qualitative and quantitative method which could be used to select CMS projects and predict CMS improvements. This methodology will help MPOs to select CMS strategies and identify projects during transportation planning process. ...|$|E
