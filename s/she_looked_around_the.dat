60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{room and}} drew {{him a little}} closer to her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{room and}} {{recognised}} {{some of her}} friends. For some reason or other she felt remarkably light-hearted.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opened}} slowly. It was the French maid who stood there. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room and beckoned to the dog.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> over <b>the</b> {{magnificent}} {{stretch of}} sky that their high position unfolded. 'Oh, thousands, hundreds of thousands,' she said absently.|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{boy named}} Miguel at the beach finds the action camera and informs his father, Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy {{floating}} close to shore and revives her. Nancy briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> beach, <b>she</b> sees that Steven Seagull has {{made it to the}} shore. One year later, Nancy (now a doctor), and her sister Chloe go surfing in Galveston, Texas, as their father tells Nancy that her mother would have been proud.|$|R
50|$|On the moon's surface {{they find}} no Borg, only the {{wreckage}} of an old Federation ship. It shows signs of Borg invasion and partial assimilation. Seven feels that the ship is familiar to her; very familiar. There {{is a bit of}} Borg machinery still active on board, which is what caused Seven's homing instinct to reactivate. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ship, the memories hit her hard. This is her parents' ship, the Raven. It was taken by the Borg almost twenty years ago, when Seven was a little girl named Annika Hansen. She and her parents were assimilated on this very spot. Suddenly, the B'omar attack though the crew is able to escape and Voyager disables the B'omar ships before fleeing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't buy any carpets or wallpaper, Rosie; I thought you'd {{like to do}} that yourself," [...] John {{explained}} as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} {{he felt that he}} was gaining ground. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. It was still filled, but in their corner they were almost unobserved.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> dingy room buzzing with flies, she {{experienced}} a premonitory pang {{of the pain}} she would suffer in going out of its doors forever.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{turned and}} <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> band of courtiers who stood silently around her throne.|$|R
60|$|Donna Maria {{mechanically}} loosed {{the coil}} of hair rope which {{hung over the}} pommel of her saddle. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> direction of the voice. But she saw only a riderless horse, moving slowly along the Point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{where is}} Mr. Van Teyl?" [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. [...] "I have been ringing {{up for the}} last ten minutes and couldn't get any answer. I did not realise that it was the next suite." ...|$|R
60|$|The Duchess {{finished}} her lobster {{and leaned back}} in her chair. Through her tiny platinum lorgnette <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room for several moments. Then a little abruptly she turned again to him.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} him with a little shiver. From that moment he felt that he was gaining ground. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. It was well filled, but in their corner they were almost unobserved.|$|E
60|$|She was a tall, thin {{woman with}} a long pale face and liquid green eyes. As <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle she had {{the air of a}} cat daintily licking its chops over some titbit.|$|E
60|$|Jeanne {{turned and}} walked toward the door. On the threshold, however, she paused. There were many times, she remembered, when her {{stepmother}} had been kind to her. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> Princess, sitting with her head resting upon her clasped hands.|$|R
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> large, fine new room, {{she thought}} of the little attic in which she had slept so many years. Yes, decidedly there would be {{pleasure}} in furnishing the house, in making her room pretty with delicate drapery and cheerful furniture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every {{one down}} for luncheon!" [...] Jeanne declared. [...] "What energy! Where is Lord Ronald, by the by?" [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. [...] "He {{promised to take}} me out sailing this morning. I wonder if I missed him on the marshes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't--care," [...] said Columbine, unsteadily. And indeed, in {{that first}} glance {{she did not see}} him clearly. A mist blurred her sight and there was a lump in her throat. Then, to recover herself, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cabin.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> hotel sitting-room, {{and tried}} to imagine the desolation of it, {{stripped}} of his presence. Why not? There was reason in what he said. And yet, if she had known it, {{it was not to}} reason she yielded, but to the touch of his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "To dine at half-past seven," [...] the Duchess remarked, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{entresol}} of {{the great}} restaurant through her lorgnettes, [...] "is certainly a little trying for one's temper and for one's digestion, but so long as those men accepted, I certainly {{think they ought to}} have been here. They know that the play begins at a quarter to nine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A thief!" [...] <b>she</b> exclaimed <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. [...] "Just an {{ordinary}} self-convicted thief! That's what I call her, and nothing else. And here we all stood {{like a lot}} of ninnies. Why, if I'd done my duty I'd have locked the door and sent for a policeman." ...|$|R
5000|$|Station {{commander}} Colonel Faraday welcomes Crayford {{home on the}} radio, but {{the signal}} is broken up by the [...] "meteor shower" [...] of pods which slow down {{as they enter the}} atmosphere. The Doctor and Sarah land separately on Earth in their pods, and Sarah finds the TARDIS in <b>the</b> woods. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around,</b> <b>the</b> Doctor taps her on the shoulder. However, this Doctor is an android, and behind it a pod opens to reveal another Sarah replica. The real Sarah runs for it. When Crayford's rocket lands, Harry and Faraday head there, not knowing that Styggron is there with Crayford. The real Doctor enters the Station and meets Benton, who tells him where Harry and Faraday are. The Doctor contacts them by radio and urges them not to enter the rocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's no new discovery," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Cliff, and {{the remark}} {{seemed to her}} so odd that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> rest of the company {{to see how they}} took it; and she was thereupon impressed with the idea that some of them had not thought of this great truth of late, and that its sudden announcement had thrown them into a shocked solemnity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sherikov {{will explain}} {{when he gets}} here," [...] Margaret Duffe's calm voice came. [...] "He's the one who {{discovered}} it." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> chamber at the incredulous Council members. [...] "Everyone stay in his seat. You are all to remain here until Sherikov arrives. It's vital you hear {{what he has to}} say. His news transforms this whole situation." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Calvert {{asked her}} to wait a little, {{and when she was}} seated Nevis sat down again. Alison, however, noticed that he had now moved to another chair which was nearer the table than the one he had {{previously}} occupied, and she wondered whether he could have had any particular motive for changing his place. Then, leaning one elbow on the table, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
60|$|At eight o'clock, {{the hour}} at which Eustacia {{had promised to}} signal Wildeve if ever she signalled at all, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{premises}} to learn if the coast was clear, went to the furze-rick, and pulled thence a long-stemmed bough of that fuel. This she carried {{to the corner of}} the bank, and, glancing behind to see if the shutters were all closed, she struck a light, and kindled the furze. When it was thoroughly ablaze Eustacia took it by the stem and waved it in the air above her head till it had burned itself out.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{alluring}} as she kneaded {{the bread}} at the table. The flex of {{her waist and}} the swing of her skirts affected Rivers powerfully. He watched her in silence. Once <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> and <b>the</b> penetrative glance of his eyes filled her face with a rush of blood, and her eyes misted. A few minutes later he said [...] "good-night" [...] in an absent-minded way and went home.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, in her office, Fabiana {{seems to be}} {{concerned}} about Adam. Similar to Isabel, she also opens a small box. Inside, she finds a key and a photograph showing Adam and herself. She takes the key and prepares to leave. She drives from Udine to Klagenfurt, where Adam lives. When she enters Adam’s apartment, using the key from <b>the</b> box, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> familiar place. <b>She</b> notices the red envelope, reads the note and, obviously alarmed, rushes off. Around this time, Adam, who has just lost another pool game, leaves Ruby’s bar. In his apartment he, too, reads Isabel's message. Realizing that he is already late for the appointment, he quickly heads for the hotel. When he enters the lobby, he does not notice that he is followed by the mysterious man who has stolen his wallet. Inside the dark hotel room 318, Adam finds Fabiana's dead body soaked in blood. Deeply shocked, he hears the entrance door being slammed shut.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> upon <b>the</b> green {{fields and}} the waving grain, and drew in deep breaths of the fresh country air, and was happy for almost {{the first time in}} her little life. By and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep; and the farmer, who did not know she was in his cart, drove on for many miles, until at last he stopped at a small wooden farmhouse, and jumped to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Keswick came to {{the table}} with a smiling face, and wearing a {{close-fitting}} white cap, which looked like a portion of her night gear, tied under her chin with broad, stiff strings. In this she appeared to her host as far more hideous than when wearing her sun-bonnet. Mr Brandon had arranged that two servants should wait upon the table, so that one of them should always be in the room, but in his supposition that the presence of a third person would have any effect upon the expression of Mrs Keswick's fond regard, he was mistaken. The meal had scarcely begun, when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room with wide-open eyes, and exclaimed: [...] "Robert, if we should conclude to remain here, I think we will have this room re-papered with some light-colored paper. I like a light dining-room. This is entirely too dark." ...|$|E
60|$|Betty {{laughed as}} she leaped lightly into the saddle, and {{soon she was}} flying over the old {{familiar}} road, down across the creek bridge, past the old grist-mill, around the fort and then out on the river bluff. The Indian pony was fiery and mettlesome. He pranced and side-stepped, galloped and trotted by turns. He seemed as glad to get out again into the warm sunshine as was Betty herself. He tore down the road a mile at his best speed. Coming back Betty pulled him into a walk. Presently her musings were interrupted by a sharp switch in the face from a twig of a tree. She stopped the pony and broke off the offending branch. As <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> recollection {{of what had happened}} to her in that very spot flashed into her mind. It was here that she had been stopped by the man who had passed almost as swiftly out of her life as he had crossed her path that memorable afternoon. She fell to musing on the old perplexing question. After all could there not have been some mistake? Perhaps she might have misjudged him? And then the old spirit, which resented her thinking of him in that softened mood, rose and fought the old battle over again. But as often happened the mood conquered, and Betty permitted herself to sink for the moment into the sad thoughts which returned like a mournful strain of music once sung by beloved voices, now forever silent.|$|E
6000|$|The barb fell short. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> stilly <b>around</b> her. <b>The</b> solemn beeches {{were like}} mute giants {{overarching}} with their starry, sky-hung boughs the dark, slim figure. What consciousness had they, I wonder, of those odd humans at their roots? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was shot on November 21, 1999 and premiered on MTV on March 6, 2000. Scenes {{of the band}} playing were filmed in the {{basement}} of the Eastminster United Church on Danforth Ave. east of Broadview Ave. in the Riverdale neighborhood of Toronto. It was directed by Giuseppe Capotondi. It stars Katherine Moennig of The L Word fame. It opens with the beginning of the song playing on the radio that wakes her up. Throughout the video, it cuts to the band playing in a crowded room. Walking around her house, she realizes nobody else is home but the tea kettle is whistling. She gets in her car and drives into a city, but the streets are empty and filled with abandoned vehicles. It shows scenes of her eating food in an empty cafe and sleeping on a couch in a furniture store. At the end of the video, she notices a man running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of a building, supposedly it's Raine. She goes to follow him and the video ends as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner.|$|R
60|$|Again {{they laughed}} at the child's pertinacious fancy for a night-ramble. But it {{happened}} that a light cloud passed over the daughter's spirit; <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> gravely into the fire and drew a breath that was almost a sigh. It forced its way, {{in spite of a}} little struggle to repress it. Then, starting and blushing, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> quickly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle, as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom. The stranger asked what she had been thinking of.|$|R
60|$|Having {{satisfied}} her curiosity, the Glass Cat {{began to}} climb down from the tree more slowly. Suddenly she discerned the Wizard's black bag hanging from a limb of the tree. She grasped the black bag in her glass teeth, and although it was rather heavy for so small an animal, managed to get it free and to carry it safely down to <b>the</b> ground. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for <b>the</b> Wizard and seeing him seated upon the stump she hid the black bag among some leaves and then went over to where the Wizard sat.|$|R
