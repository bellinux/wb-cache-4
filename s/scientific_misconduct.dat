He held Health and Scientific Research Subcommittee hearings in March 1977 that led to public revelations of extensive <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct</b> by contract research organizations, including Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. Kennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader Deng Xiaoping and eventually gaining permission {{for a number of}} Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union and Brezhnev and dissidents there again. During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in nuclear disarmament, and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University. He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Swedish parliament, Riksdagen, due to the secrecy issues raised during the trial that granted the two private individuals access to sensitive personal data. This bill did not pass, but in 2004, a new act on ethical review of research involving humans was introduced. Changes were put in place in order to strengthen the protection for human subjects participating in medical research and to expand the scope of the ethical councils, while bringing the Swedish legislation closer to the European Commission directive. The official act governing medical research was further adjusted in 2008: ethical review is now legally required in Sweden, the review committees have official status, and consent can be withdrawn by participants in medical research at any point. However, voices in the medical research community have raised concerns about law revisions' lack of attention to additional safeguards for researchers falsely accused of <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct</b> and are calling for procedures that would ensure that <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct</b> investigations are handled in a correct and legally secure manner.|$|E

40|$|Background: Today, {{with the}} rapid growth of <b>scientific</b> production, {{research}} <b>misconduct</b> has become a worldwide problem. This article is intended to introduce the successful experience on the management of research paper misconducts in the field of health research. Methods: Our aim was to design and develop the strategy for research misconduct policy. Focusing on the national regulatory system, we developed a hierarchical model for paper misconduct policy in all the medical sciences universities and their affiliated research units. Results: Through our regulatory policy for paper misconduct management, specific protocol was followed in the field of health research publications through which the capabilities of covering the four main elements of prevention, investigation, punishment, and correction have come together. Conclusions: Considering the proposed strategy, regarding the strengths and weaknesses, utilization of evaluation tool {{can be one of the}} best strategies to achieving the prospective of health research papers by 2025...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 1996, {{pediatrician}} Leif Elinder criticized Gillberg's {{research and}} {{alleged that the}} numbers reported by Gillberg were made up.

They coordinated their criticism and Kärfve wrote a book, published in 2000, rejecting {{most of the research}} on DAMP, and especially Gillberg's. Other psychiatrists and neuroscientists in Sweden defended the Gillberg group and argued that Elinder and Kärfve had crossed the line from scientific criticism to personal attacks and vilification. The conflict escalated further in 2002, when Kärfve and Elinder wrote separate letters to Gothenburg University, accusing the Gillberg group of <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct.</b> The accusations were investigated by the Ethics Council and dismissed.|$|E

2500|$|Compared {{to other}} forms of <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct,</b> image fraud (manipulation of images to distort their meaning) is of {{particular}} interest since it can frequently be detected by external parties. In 2006, the Journal of Cell Biology gained publicity [...] for instituting tests to detect photo manipulation in papers that were being considered for publication. This was in response to the increased usage of programs such as Adobe Photoshop by scientists, which facilitate photo manipulation. Since then more publishers, including the Nature Publishing Group, have instituted similar tests and require authors to minimize and specify the extent of photo manipulation when a manuscript is submitted for publication. However, there is little evidence to indicate that such tests are applied rigorously. One Nature paper published in 2009 has subsequently been reported to contain around 20 separate instances of image fraud.|$|E

Shortly after voicing her questions, she was summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in Hamer’s lab; who dismissed her could not be determined.

2500|$|Plagiarism is the {{appropriation}} of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.

A subset is citation plagiarism – willful or negligent failure to appropriately credit other or prior discoverers, so as to give an improper impression of priority. This is also known as, [...] "citation amnesia", the [...] "disregard syndrome" [...] and [...] "bibliographic negligence". Arguably, this is {{the most common type of}} <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct.</b> Sometimes it is difficult to guess whether authors intentionally ignored a highly relevant cite or lacked knowledge of the prior work.

2500|$|A {{transgender}} {{woman that}} he {{described in the}} book {{filed a complaint with}} Northwestern University alleging that her many discussions with Bailey about his view of trans women and the book he was writing made her a non-consensual subject of IRB-regulated research by Bailey, and that during this time, she had consensual sex with him. Northwestern found no basis for the complaint. [...] Transgender professors Lynn Conway and Deirdre McCloskey filed a complaint against Bailey with Illinois state regulators, alleging that he practiced psychology without a license by providing brief case evaluation letters suggesting candidacy for sex reassignment surgery; however, the department did not pursue those allegations, as he did not accept remuneration for the services and therefore did not violate the law. [...] At least two women who said they were subjects in his book filed a complaint with Northwestern alleging that Bailey committed <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct</b> by not informing them that they were to be the subjects of research used in the writing of his book. Northwestern did investigate this allegation. [...] Although the findings of that investigation were not released, Northwestern's Vice President for Research, C. Bradley Moore, said, [...] "The allegations of <b>scientific</b> <b>misconduct</b> made against Professor J. Michael Bailey do not fall under the federal definition of scientific misconduct." [...] and that the university [...] "has established a protocol to help ensure that Professor Bailey's research activities involving human subjects are conducted in accordance with the expectations of the University, the regulations and guidelines established by the federal government and with generally accepted research standards." [...] Bailey says that he did nothing wrong and that the attacks on him were motivated by the desire to suppress discussion of the book's ideas about transsexualism, especially autogynephilia. Alice Dreger, a bioethicist, published an account of the controversy in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. According to Dreger, the allegations of misconduct could accurately be described as [...] "harassment", and an [...] "anti-Bailey campaign". Dreger wrote that of the four women who complained to Northwestern, two acknowledged that they were aware they would be included in Bailey's book in their letter to the university. The other two were not described in the book. Dreger also reported that while there was no definitive evidence to refute the allegation of sexual misconduct, datestamps on e-mails between Bailey and his ex-wife indicated that he was at her home looking after their two children at the time the misconduct was said to have occurred. The journal published in the same issue 23 commentaries regarding multiple aspects of the controversy, including criticism of Dreger's analysis.|$|E
