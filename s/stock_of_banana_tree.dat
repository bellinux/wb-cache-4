Two series of filled natural rubber compounds were prepared by changing flier loading from 0 - 50 phr using banana fibre and carbon black as fillers and physical properties were examined. Hardness increased with both banana fibre and carbon black loading. However, tensile strength decreased with banana fibre loading, while they increased with carbon black loading. These results suggested that the banana fibre could not be added as a reinforcing filler to replace carbon black in rubber compounds. However it {{can be added to}} rubber compounds as a diluent filler...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the nutritional composition (raw protein, ether extract, raw fber, FDA, FDN and ash) of the POS 09 / 100 strain of Pleurotus ostreatus grown in three combinations of residues (pseudo-stem, leave and pseudo-stem + leaf) and four <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> cultivars (Thap maeo, Prata anã, Pelipita and Caipira). The basidiomata harvested were submitted to dehydration in a forced ventilation stove with temperature adjusted to 40 °C until reaching constant weight, being then grinded in a knife mill. The method proposed by Kjeldahl (1883) {{was used to determine}} total nitrogen. The Weende method (AOAC, 1997) was employed to determine crude fber, acid-detergent fber (ADF) and neutral detergent fber (NDF). According to the results obtained, crude protein, ash, ADF and NDF contents varied with the kind <b>of</b> residue and <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> cultivar; the substrate prepared with leaves <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> (Prata Anã cultivar) yielded the highest crude protein (35. 4 %) and ash (6. 7 %) contents in the basidiomata of P. ostreatus; the substrate prepared with pseudo-stem <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> (Prata Anã cultivar) provided the highest ADF (31. 6 %) and NDF (41. 9 %) contents in the basidiomata of P. os - treatus.

The Kluai Tani type <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> <b>trees</b> do not belong to the cultivated varieties. Owing to their connection with ghosts, people prefer not to have them growing near their homes and they are not found within village compounds. However, clumps of this tree are found not far from inhabited areas, often at the outskirts of villages or at the edge of cultivated fields by the roadside. They look very much like average <b>banana</b> <b>trees,</b> but their fruits are not edible. Their leaves are commonly used in Thailand to wrap locally produced sweets and the inflorescence for the treatment of ulcers in traditional medicine.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{evaluated}} the alterations {{in the number}} of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and enzymatic activity in soil under cultivation <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> <b>trees</b> in Chapada <b>of</b> Apodi. The hypothesis was tested that the agricultural use causes environmental alterations that they reduce the presence of population of AMF and the microbial activity. An area was selected under cultivation <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> <b>trees</b> (Farm Frutacor) and its control (natural vegetation). Four soil samples were collected in three depths in which analyses were accomplished, the number of spores of AMF by Gerdemann and Nicholson (1964) and enzymatic activity: acid phosphatase, arylsulphatase and b-glucosidase by Tabatabai, (1994). The number of spores of AMF show values decreasing with the rise in depth in area cultivated. The activity of the arylsulphatase and acid phosphatase were stimulated by the competition of the anions H 2 PO 4 - and SO 4 - for the same ranches of adsorption in the colloids of the soil. For b-glucosidase, there was a larger activity in the cultivated area, influenced by the amount and quality of the vegetable residue. The enzymatic activity evidences a difficulty of establishing correlations between the biochemistry and chemistry of the soil in area where the entrance of nutrients is high...|$|R

Maturation is an irreversible phenomenon, highly coordinated, genetically programmed and involving a series of physiological, biochemical and organoleptic changes. Textural softening during ripening leads to adverse effects and spoilage upon storage. This process is influenced by ethylene, carbon dioxide, temperature and oxygen. The major classes of cell wall polysaccharides that undergo modifications during ripening are starch, pectins, cellulose and hemicelluloses. These modifications are allotted to the action of enzymes...|$|R
