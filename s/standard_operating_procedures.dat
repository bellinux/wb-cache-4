Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems.

5|$|While {{many of the}} failings in Australian command {{arrangements}} {{evident from}} {{the initial stages of}} the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures,</b> future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without them. Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry.|$|E

25|$|The PCR {{method is}} {{extremely}} sensitive, requiring {{only a few}} DNA molecules in a single reaction for amplification across several orders of magnitude. Therefore, adequate measures to avoid contamination from any DNA present in the lab environment (bacteria, viruses, or human sources) are required. Because products from previous PCR amplifications are a common source of contamination, many molecular biology labs have implemented procedures that involve dividing the lab into separate areas. One lab area is dedicated to preparation and handling of pre-PCR reagents and the setup of the PCR reaction, and another area to post-PCR processing, such as gel electrophoresis or PCR product purification. For the setup of PCR reactions, many <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> involve using pipettes with filter tips and wearing fresh laboratory gloves, {{and in some cases}} a laminar flow cabinet with UV lamp as a work station (to destroy any extraneomultimer formation). PCR is routinely assessed against a negative control reaction that is set up identically to the experimental PCR, but without template DNA, and performed alongside the experimental PCR.|$|E

25|$|The {{magnitude}} of the fighting and its proximity to Nui Dat shocked the Australians, and later there was speculation Jackson had either suspected a Viet Cong regiment was nearby or that after being presented with SIGINT suggesting its presence he refused to accept it. Yet while several indicators of the coming action were evident after the fact, no one had forecasted it. Despite detecting a transmitter from the 275th Regiment moving west towards Nui Dat, such intercepts were unable to predict Viet Cong intentions with certainty, while patrols through the area also failed to find it. Regardless, Jackson had responded by maintaining patrols at company strength when outside Line Alpha, while ensuring a level of base security. However, Townsend had not been given access to this intelligence and some officers were later critical of the restrictions placed on it. Although {{it would not have}} altered the requirement for a company-sized patrol it might have changed the way the battle was fought, and afterwards both battalion commanders were regularly briefed on such intercepts. The value of patrolling in depth and in sufficient strength to prevent the Viet Cong concentrating their forces had also been reinforced, and while there was no change to the pattern of Australian operations, when a significant engagement was possible patrols would be a minimum of a company and would operate close enough to rapidly support each other to stop them becoming isolated. Lastly, the command relationship between the infantry and APCs had been problematic during the battle and changes to <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> were implemented to provide clearer direction in such circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with other}} {{forensic}} specialists, forensic chemists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses regarding their findings.
