30|$|Our {{findings}} {{confirm the}} deleterious effects of prolonged excessive cell stretch on the alveolar epithelium. Positive pressure ventilation can <b>severely</b> <b>injure</b> the lungs of already compromised ARDS patients, and here, {{we show that}} excessive cell stretch <b>severely</b> <b>injures</b> both bronchial and alveolar cells by activation of NF-κB, a finding which confirms and expands on previously published data [27]. Interestingly, our work also shows that HCA can alleviate this cell injury and inflammation following both short- and long-term stretch injury, an important finding from a clinical perspective, suggesting that permissive/therapeutic hypercapnia could be of benefit to the patient throughout the ventilation period.|$|R
