50|$|Although {{replacement}} of the midsection was the single largest change in the $15,000,000 process, many other important improvements were made during the conversion. A major modification was made to the stern, including a new counterbalanced rudder, new stern casting and struts, and new shorter propeller shafts and stern tubes. The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned span wires and high lines, electric hydraulic winches, cargo elevators, helicopter pickup area, and <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks</b> and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations. New electric pumps, larger cargo piping, and double-hose fueling rigs were also added, {{as well as a}} 4,500-kilowatt auxiliary diesel generator plant, and more enclosed stowage space.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{progress}} through the game, players must collect various items to use. Each player can only hold one item at a time (two in single player). The grappling hook is used to cross large gaps between hooks, though {{can also be used}} to knock back enemies and collect items from long distances. The bell is used to lure the attention of enemies in order to set off puzzles or set them up for an ambush by the other player. Other items include candles to light up dark areas, shovels to dig up soft dirt for items, boards to cover gaps in bridges and keys to unlock certain gates and doors. Certain doors will only be opened under certain conditions, such as <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks</b> into places or defeating all the enemies on screen.|$|E
5000|$|The puzzles {{take the}} form of brain teasers and are only loosely tied to the plot. All puzzles were created for this series by Akira Tago, who is famous for his best-selling Mental Gymnastics series.

The games give the player the {{opportunity}} to bring up a translucent memo screen they can write on using the stylus to work out their answer before submission. If the player is stuck, they may spend one hint coin to receive a hint. Each puzzle has three hints available, and from The Unwound Future onwards, the games feature [...] "super hints" [...] that nearly solve the puzzle for the player but which can only be bought with two hint coins and after the three other hints have been revealed. The puzzles are not timed, though for puzzles such as mazes or <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks,</b> the player may be challenged to complete the puzzle in a limited number of moves.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} positions {{between the}} four <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> {{vary with the}} movement of the table due to the geometric errors of the guide rail. Consequently, the additional load on the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> is increased. A new method of error measurement and identification by using a self-designed stress test plate was presented. BP neural network model was used to establish the mapping between the stress of key measurement points on the test plate and the displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks.</b> By measuring the stress, the relative displacements of <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were obtained, from which the geometric errors of the guide rails were converted. Firstly, the finite element model was built to find the key measurement points of the test plate. Then the BP neural network was trained by using the samples extracted from the finite element model. The stress at the key measurement points were taken as the input and the relative displacements of the <b>slide</b> <b>blocks</b> were taken as the output. Finally, the geometric errors of the two guide rails were obtained according to the measured stress. The results show that the maximum difference between the measured geometric errors and the output of BP neural network was 5 μm. Therefore, the correctness and feasibility of the method were verified...|$|R

40|$|The {{extremes}} of a stationary time series typically occur in clusters. A primary measure for {{this phenomenon is}} the extremal index, representing the reciprocal of the expected cluster size. Both a disjoint and a <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks</b> estimator for the extremal index are analyzed in detail. In contrast to many competitors, the estimators only depend on the choice of one parameter sequence. We derive an asymptotic expansion, prove asymptotic normality and show consistency of an estimator for the asymptotic variance. Explicit calculations in certain models and a finite-sample Monte Carlo simulation study reveal that the <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks</b> estimator is outperforming other blocks estimators, {{and that it is}} competitive to runs- and inter-exceedance estimators in various models. The methods are applied to a variety of financial time series...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of a one-storey {{model of a}} torsionally coupled (asymmetric) building with sliding support to two component random ground motions is obtained. The base of the system consists of <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks</b> resting on sliding foundation raft. The rigid-friction force-deformation behaviour of the <b>sliding</b> <b>blocks</b> is modelled as elasto-plastic with very high initial stiffness. The {{response of}} the system is analyzed under different parametric variations to investigate the effectiveness of the sliding support. The parameter includes: eccentricity of superstructure, uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio, mass ratio and coefficient of friction of sliding support. The effectiveness is studied by obtaining the response with and without consideration of interaction between the two lateral frictional resistances of the sliding support on the criterion of sliding. It was shown that the effect of bi-direction interaction is significant and should be included for the effective design of a torsionally coupled system with sliding support. Copyright (C) 1996...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One new sliding-block {{balancing}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} single-cylinder diesel engine. In the new mechanism, the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> is installed against the engine piston. The reciprocation trajectory of <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> is collinear with the piston trajectory, while <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods. The new mechanism includes the crankshaft, connecting rod ring, the slider and the guide components. Through the bearing, connecting rod is installed in the eccentric journal of the crankshaft. The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the guide groove. Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the guide hole of the slide. The optimized parameters for the <b>sliding</b> <b>block</b> show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of crank radius to connecting rod length. The appropriate results can balance both the centrifugal inertia force and the reciprocating inertia force generated by piston group. Even the complete balance of the first and second-order reciprocating inertia forces can be obtained, which can reduce the vibration and noise of diesel engine...|$|R
