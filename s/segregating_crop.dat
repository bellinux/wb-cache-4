40|$|Since the Europe-wide ‘risk’ {{controversy}} over GM crops {{in the late}} 1990 s, an extra issue has emerged: the prospect that GM material would become inadvertently mixed with non-GM products, which consequently may require a ‘GM’ label under EU law. The stakes for <b>segregating</b> non-GM <b>crops</b> were framed in contending ways. Agbiotech proponents sought to license a biotechnologised nature as an eco-efficiency benefit,while framing admixture risks as an agronomic management problem which needs rules for co-existence. By contrast, biotech critics have foreseen a dangerous disorder of ‘GM contamination’, while framing this prospect as an ever-wider ‘risk’ issue, encompassing threats to human health, the environment and even democratic accountability. These contending frames intensified disputes over the appropriate rules for <b>segregating</b> GM <b>crops</b> from other agricultures. At stake were different visions of the socio-natural order, expressed by different accounts of risk, freedom and desirable futures. Conflicts of accountability {{took the form of}} disputes over market freedom versus coercion and unfair burdens on farmers; these concepts framed expert evidence and thus made it more contentious for any ‘science-based policy’, featuring disputes about whether specific management proposals were based on ‘politics rather than science’. For these reasons, biophysical admixture per se cannot entirely explain why the segregation problem became such a contentious ‘risk’ issue; a comprehensive explanation lies in contending policy frames...|$|R
40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, {{agricultural}} production strived to achieve increased food production {{in order to}} satisfy demands. This led to increased farm sizes and an operational separation of crop and livestock production. Society fears that the trend of increasing industrialization of animal agriculture has resulted in concentration of waste products associated with their production over relatively small geographic regions that are spatially <b>segregated</b> from <b>crop</b> production areas. A county level analysis of manure nutrients relative to crop nutrient capacity was conducted to assess the prevalence of these issues in Iowa. Results indicated that in general all counties had sufficient nutrient utilization capacities to value manure as a resource; however, counties in Northwest Iowa are becoming progressively more manure rich, while counties in Southwestern and Central Iowa are becoming progressively more manure poor. This separation of crop and livestock production is becoming more pronounced, indicating that nutrient (especially phosphorus) recovery systems that can concentrate manure nutrients for transport could become more important in maintaining county nutrient balances...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of genetically modified (GM) crops, the commodity grain system has been under pressure to segregate GM and non-GM crops. Starting {{at the level of}} the grain handler, members of the grain supply chain have successfully used quality assurance and identity preservation programs to <b>segregate</b> non GM <b>crops.</b> Producers delivering high-value, identity-preserved crops have become interested in implementing these quality management systems at the farm level. We conduct a cost-benefit analysis that shows that quality assurance program may be profitable for producers, depending on their farm size and equipment management strategy. risk, cost-benefit analysis, identity preservation, on-farm quality assurance, Crop Production/Industries, Risk and Uncertainty, Q 12, Q 16,...|$|R
40|$|As many growers {{move toward}} specialty/value added crops, some are {{interested}} in segregating grain production by seed varieties, within grain genetics rather by grain types (for example, corn, soybeans, oats). Current interest is in <b>segregating</b> nongenetically enhanced <b>crops</b> from genetically enhanced crops for export sale. Consumers are creating a demand for identity-preserved processed grain products (for example, demand for organic production, processing, and labeling). In the future, consumers or labeling demands may create the desire to segregate seed varieties within quality or genetic level for traits such as protein, oil, fiber, and starch content. Regardless, an important initial question to ask is, What level of undesirable grain will be tolerated in the amount subsequently marketed...|$|R
40|$|A low-altitude {{platform}} utilising a 1. 8 -m diameter tethered helium balloon {{was used}} to position a multispectral sensor, consisting of two digital cameras, above a fertiliser trial plot where wheat (Triticum spp.) was being grown. Located in Cecil Plains, Queensland, Australia, the plot was a long-term fertiliser trial being conducted by a fertiliser company to monitor the response of crops to various levels of nutrition. The different levels of nutrition were achieved by varying nitrogen application rates between 0 and 120 units of N at 40 unit increments. Each plot had received the same application rate for 10 years. Colour and near-infrared images were acquired that captured the whole 2 ha plot. These images were examined and relationships sought between the captured digital information and the crop parameters imaged at anthesis and the at-harvest quality and quantity parameters. The statistical analysis techniques used were correlation analysis, discriminant analysis and partial least squares regression. A high correlation {{was found between the}} image and yield (R 2 = 0. 91) and a moderate correlation between the image and grain protein content (R 2 = 0. 66). The utility of the system could be extended by choosing a more mobile platform. This would increase the potential for the system to be used to diagnose the causes of the variability and allow remediation, and/or to <b>segregate</b> the <b>crop</b> at harvest to meet certain quality parameters...|$|R
40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, {{agricultural}} production strived to achieve increased food production {{in order to}} satisfy both local and export demands. In many cases, this led to increased farm sizes and an operational separation of crop and livestock production. Society fears that the trend of increasing centralization and industrialization of agriculture, specifically animal agriculture, has resulted in concentration of waste products associated with their production (manures, wash-down water, process waters, etc.) over relatively small geographic regions that are spatially <b>segregated</b> from <b>crop</b> production areas. Since the distance that manure can be economically hauled for land application has practical limits, this could lead to over-application, of manures near animal feeding facilities, potentially increasing nutrient losses to ground and surface waters. A statewide analysis of crop and animal production in Iowa suggests that about 25 % of current nitrogen and phosphorus requirements for crop production could be supplied from manures and litters, while around 40 % of the required potassium could be provided. However, neither livestock nor crop production is uniformly distributed across all counties. This unequal distribution suggests that a more disaggregated analysis of crop nutrient requirements and manure nutrient supply is necessary to estimate the risks of excess nutrient loss to the environment. Results indicated that in general all counties had sufficient nutrient utilization capacities to value manure as a resource; however, counties in Northwest Iowa are becoming progressively more manure rich, while counties in Southwestern and Central Iowa are becoming progressively more manure poor. This separation of crop and livestock production is becoming more pronounced, indicating that solids separation and nutrient (especially phosphorus) recovery systems that can concentrate manure nutrients for transport could become more important to help counties maintain nutrient balance and to return manure nutrients to the soil if these trends persist...|$|R
40|$|Field studies {{assessed}} {{the differences in}} temporal distribution and abundance of Frankliniella occidentalis and F. schultzei on French bean, tomato, lettuce and zucchini from one week after planting to senescence or harvest. Ten samples each of three plant parts leaf and stem, flower and growing tip samples were collected at weekly intervals, in eleven field plantings in the Lockyer Valley (south-east Queensland, Australia) {{over a three-year period}} from December 2011 to June 2014. There were significantly more F. schultzei than F. occidentalis in lettuce and tomato, and significantly more F. occidentalis than F. schultzei in French beans. Zucchini supported the highest abundance of both species, with no significant difference in mean abundance. Both species displayed similar preferences for different plant parts, with significantly more in flowers compared to leaf and stem and growing tip samples. There were significantly more thrips in female zucchini flowers compared to male flowers. Thrips were present in small numbers one week after planting in all crops, with peak abundance at flowering. F. occidentalis were temporally <b>segregated</b> by <b>crop</b> age (weeks since planting), with significantly higher levels present in zucchini compared to French bean, lettuce and tomato between weeks three and six, followed by significantly higher levels in French bean between weeks eight and ten. F. schultzei were temporally separated by crop age between zucchini and lettuce, with significantly higher levels present in zucchini between weeks four and six, and in lettuce between weeks eight and ten. Implications for crop monitoring are that sampling should be concentrated at pre-flowering for F. occidentalis in French bean and zucchini and for F. schultzei in tomato and zucchini. For lettuce, the seedling stage is most vulnerable to infestation by both species. Growers {{should be aware of the}} potential for both Frankliniella species to disperse from senescing zucchini flowers from week seven and aim to implement control strategies around this period...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Price {{premiums}} and discounts are currently paid for various classes of wheat in the US marketplace. These {{premiums and}} the known heterogeneity of grain protein across landscapes beg {{the question of}} whether grain could be separated on the farm to maximize revenues. Theoretically, the concavity or convexity of a price function defines if an opportunity to segregate grain exists. Although this is true, prices in the market place are paid in stepped increments, which result in unique revenue maximizing solutions. This study was conducted to determine the economic feasibility of segregating wheat by protein content on the combine harvester during harvest. Both web-based and spreadsheet calculators were built to predict the best point in which to <b>segregate</b> a <b>crop</b> at, as well as define the protein level and quantity of each segregated volume of grain. The costs of segregation vary by operation, but fixed, variable, and opportunity costs are estimated to total $ 0. 1739 bu⁻¹ if segregation is used every year. Revenue gains varied with the price schedule, field mean protein value, and the standard deviation of protein. Revenue gains increased in proportion {{to the size of a}} price step in a price schedule. Soft white winter wheat showed the greatest potential for segregation; however, on average yearly expected premiums are less than $. 05 bu⁻¹, well below total variable costs. Price schedules occur which allow for profits of over $ 1. 00 bu⁻¹ from segregation, although these are not the norm. Historically, on-combine grain segregation would not be economically feasible for the average producer. However, under certain supply and demand conditions, premiums occur that would make on-combine grain segregation profitable. Individuals will have to evaluate the feasibility on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

Historically, {{it has been}} postulated that populations carry genetic variants with deleterious effects as segregating variation. Recent advances in DNA resequencing technology allow a new view on this topic, providing a way to identify segregating molecular sequence variants that alter sites that show constrained evolution. Targeted identification and removal of such segregating variants has been proposed as a novel path for improving agronomic performance in plant breeding programs. In this dissertation, I present {{a brief review of}} deleterious variation, and why it may be important to plant breeding. Then, I present a tool for classifying single nucleotide polymorphisms into functional classes using public sequence databases. Next, I present a survey of potentially deleterious alleles <b>segregating</b> in two <b>crop</b> species, and a software package that implements a likelihood ratio test for sequence constraint and deleterious prediction. Finally, I present an examination of the contribution of potentially deleterious alleles to yield in a barley breeding experimental population. While potentially deleterious alleles themselves do not explain a larger proportion of phenotypic variation than non- deleterious alleles, genomic prediction of phenotypes may be improved by examining informative subsets of sequence variants, rather than with genomewide markers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to describe the}} problems and procedures followed to contract the <b>crop,</b> <b>segregate</b> the seed and products, and evaluate the oil characteristics of low erucic acid rapeseed. In addition to maintaining seed purity during field production, it was also necessary to develop "in plant" procedures for oil extraction and refining. Special techniques were devised for grading the seed with respect to erucic acid levels and green seed content. Collaborative studies with several domestic oil processors were carried through to final product evaluation but market development work with consumers was not initiated. The adverse nutritional data on high erucic acid oils which {{was presented at the}} International Conference at St. Adele in 1970 indicated the need for an immediate reduction of erucic acid levels in food products. The availability of low erucic acid seed in commercial quantities, and the processing and utilization experiences with the seed and oil, permitted an immediate and complete switch-over to low erucic acid varieties in Canada. This gave Canadian plant breeders a lead time of several years over those in other countries to develop high yielding and more adapted varieties of this new genotype. Canada became the first country to offer low erucic acid seed and oil in world markets. It will take years for other countries to develop and convert to low erucic acid varieties and offer competitive quantities in the world trade. In addition, the Canadian experiment gave other countries confidence that their plant breeders could develop similar varieties and only limited legislative action was instituted against the use of high erucic acid oils until local genotypes with the desired nutritional properties were brought into production...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} organic tree fruit {{products}} in Europe and North America, the dominant organic food markets, has spurred increases in organic area and production globally. From 2008 – 2013, {{the area of}} production grew 109 %, 42 %, and 53 % for organic temperate tree fruits, citrus, and tropical/subtropical fruits, respectively, with much lower growth for total area (non-organic plus organic) in these categories. Most organic tree fruits represent approximately 1 – 2 % of total production area for a specific fruit; avocado is the exception, with 8 % of avocado area worldwide under organic management. Mexico, Italy, and China are the top three countries in terms of organic tree fruit area, but not all countries <b>segregate</b> tree fruit <b>crops</b> in the organic statistics they report. Organic standards are not identical among countries, although over 90 % of organic sales are in the USA and EU where standards are harmonized. Published data on the relative yield of organic to conventional tree fruits are scarce and range from 42 % to 126 % of conventional yields. Reported production costs for organic tree fruits were generally higher than conventional, with higher cost for fertilizers a frequent reason. Higher selling prices for organic tree fruits were able to compensate for lower yields and higher costs in most cases, leading to a higher net return under certified organic management. Key technological advances, such as pheromone mating disruption, have been critical {{to the expansion of}} organic tree fruit production, and more innovation will be needed in the future to address new challenges involving invasive pests and climate change, as well as disease-resistance cultivars and new pest control tools to enable production in areas not currently involved in the organic market...|$|R
