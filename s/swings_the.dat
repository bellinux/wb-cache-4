5000|$|In Estonian, kiik means a swing. In a kiiking <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> {{arms are}} made of steel to enable a person to swing 360 degrees going over the [...] of <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> A person is {{fastened}} to <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> base by their feet.

50|$|Standing {{with both}} legs apart at a width roughly {{equal to that}} of the shoulder, Shuai Shou Gong {{involves}} moving both arms in parallel, <b>swinging</b> first to <b>the</b> front of the body until they are the same height as <b>the</b> shoulder, then <b>swinging</b> <b>the</b> arms back with a little effort until both arms are behind the body. On every fifth <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> knee should slightly bend down and spring back quickly - once when <b>the</b> arms are <b>swinging</b> towards <b>the</b> back of body and another on <b>the</b> return <b>swing</b> to <b>the</b> front of body.|$|R
50|$|As {{observed}} from an end-view of <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> bob, <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> bob {{will always}} line up or swing towards one star (just like {{the axis of}} the Earth points at one star for the time periods considered) as <b>the</b> bob <b>swings</b> through <b>the</b> central axis of the pendulum. There can be a slight ellipsoid <b>swing</b> if <b>the</b> initial conditions of angular motion are not cancelled {{but there is no}} longer a force acting on the bob causing it to have an angular velocity after the bob is released. The plane of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> pendulum bob is now independent of the surface of the earth which was imparting a force to the bob before it was released (through the holding point). As noted previously, the bob is still spinning with the Earth (a spot of the bob will spin with the Earth), even though the bob is no longer turning with the Earth. Thus the Earth continues to turn underneath <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> pendulum while <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> pendulum remains in a fixed plane that doesn't rotate (turn).|$|R

The album was released by EMI Records internationally on 12 March 2010, with releases in Moa's home country and Australia following on 5 April and 10 September, respectively.

5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial <b>swings.</b> <b>The</b> LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when he told his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E

50|$|Stiffness is {{much less}} complex {{than the other two}} topics. This is {{directly}} and solely tied to your <b>swing</b> speed. <b>The</b> faster <b>the</b> <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> stiffer the shaft. This is because <b>the</b> faster you <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> more the club will bend; if the club bends too much, it will whip through impact and the face will be square for a very short time. Stiffer shafts don't flex as much and keep the face squarer through contact. The other side is less stiff shafts will produce a higher ball speed off the face. So the goal is to get the most flexible shaft that fits your swing, but stiff enough so it doesn't hurt your control. This is why it is important that you make sure you are <b>swinging</b> <b>the</b> right shafts for you. Possible options are junior, women, senior, regular, stiff, and xstiff.|$|R

25|$|The {{manner in}} which the bolas is swung differ between the three genera. Mastophora holds the bolas {{stationary}} with a front leg until a moth approaches, and then cocks the leg and <b>swings</b> <b>the</b> bolas towards the prey with a rapid pendulum-like stroke. Ordgarius begins to whirl the bolas rapidly when detecting an incoming moth. Cladomelea akermani whirls the bolas immediately after it is prepared for about 15 minutes, even when there is no moth present. Ordgarius sometimes has smaller droplets above the terminal one, whereas the other genera produce only one terminal globule.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} tee-batting skills in relation to ground reaction forces. Eithteen batters tried seven <b>swings</b> on <b>the</b> force platform recording three-dimensional kinetic data. A video camera (60 fps) was used to measure ball velocity and <b>swing</b> velocity. <b>The</b> following results were obtained. 1) A statistically significant correlation was observed between <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity and <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> time. 2 Statistically significant correlations were observed between <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity and <b>the</b> anteroposterior forces during backward <b>swing</b> phase, <b>the</b> mean power calculated from the anteroposterior force during forward swing phase. 3) Statistically significant correlations were obtained between <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity, <b>the</b> ball velocity and the mediolateral distance of the CG of the body from the starting position during backward <b>swing</b> phase. 4) <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> velocity and <b>the</b> ball velocity significantly correlated with the mediolateral distance of the CG of the body between the starting phase and the impact phase. 5) Coefficient of variations (cv) of the vertical forces during backward <b>swing</b> phase and <b>the</b> mean power calculated from the vertical force significantly correlated with cv of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity. CV of the vertical power of the CG of the body significantly correlated with cv of the ball velocity. These findings suggest that the batter should move the body toward the opposite side of the ball and the anterior direction just before the starting phase of <b>the</b> forward <b>swing</b> to obtain <b>the</b> high <b>swing</b> velocity. <b>The</b> result also suggests that the batter should control the vertical movement during backward and forward <b>swing</b> to obtain <b>the</b> high reproducibility of batting.

The game uses the SIXAXIS' motion sensor functionality in interrogations and, to a limited degree, during melee combat. As in the Wii, if the player wishes to lift someone from their knees, they simply pull the controller upwards. Swinging the controller {{from side to side}} <b>swings</b> <b>the</b> enemy likewise. Slamming someone against a wall is accomplished by pushing the controller away from the player. Unlike in the Wii version, however, where shooting and driving were handled using the Wii Remote, in The Don's Edition, shooting and driving are controlled using the analog sticks.|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} <b>swings</b> <b>the</b> arms sideways {{across the}} water surface to the front, with the elbows straight. The arms should be swung forward {{from the end of}} the underwater movement, the extension of the triceps in combination with the butterfly kick will allow the arm to be brought forwards relaxed yet quickly. In contrast to the front crawl recovery, this arm recovery is a ballistic shot. The only other way of lifting the arms and the shoulders out of the water is by dropping one's hip. Therefore, the recovery, at least the acceleration of the arms, is in no way relaxed. It is important not to enter the water too early, because this would generate extra resistance as the arms moved forward in the water against the swimming direction, however, during longer distances, this cannot be avoided, and it is more important to avoid dropping one's hips. A high elbow recovery, as in front crawl, would be disadvantageous because of the natural undulations that are partially caused by the recovery and the relaxed movement caused by the momentum of a triceps extension. Limitations of the shoulder movement in the human body make such a motion unlikely. Hands should enter into the water again at 11 and one with thumbs entering first and pinkie last.|$|E

500|$|In {{the history}} of video games, the seventh {{generation}} includes consoles released since late [...] by Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The eighth generation began in November 2012. [...] For home consoles, the seventh generation began on November 22, 2005 {{with the release of}} Microsoft's Xbox 360 and continued with the release of Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 3 on November 17, 2006, and Nintendo's Wii on November 19, 2006. Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology. The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at high-definition video (HD) resolutions, the PlayStation 3 offered HD movie playback via a built-in 3D Blu-ray Disc player, and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with movement sensors as well as joysticks. Some of the Wii controllers could be moved about to control in-game actions, which enabled players to simulate real-world actions during gameplay (e.g., in the Wii sports tennis game, the user <b>swings</b> <b>the</b> controller to hit the on-screen image of a tennis ball). Video game consoles had become {{an important part of the}} global IT infrastructure.
