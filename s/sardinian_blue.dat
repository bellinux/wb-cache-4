40|$|Background There {{has been}} {{scientific}} {{interest in the}} Sardinia population {{for a number of}} years and for a variety of reasons, including its extreme longevity. This is especially prevalent in the central-eastern region of the island, where a blue zone region has been precisely delineated. Aims The present study examines the influence of leisure activities on psychological well-being and depressive symptoms in elderly individuals living in the blue zone region of inner Sardinia. Methods Eighty-three participants were recruited according to strict inclusion criteria to ensure their cognitive and residency status. Individuals were assigned to either old (70 – 79 years) or very old (≥ 80 years) groups, and were administered a test battery to determine their sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, perceived physical health, and self-perceived well-being and depressive symptoms. Results The primary findings indicate that participation in leisure activities positively influenced both selfperceived well-being and depressive symptoms. There was though, a differential impact on different sub-scales of well-being, and moreover, the overall pattern of results suggested primarily an influence on mood states and/or emotion regulation. Conclusions The emerging psychological pattern of results about elders from the <b>Sardinian</b> <b>blue</b> zone region provides insight for the promotion of successful ageing in late adulthood...|$|E

The {{island of}} Sardinia is {{characterized}} by an extraordinary richness of endemic species, evolved {{as a result of}} its geographic position and geological history. Here, we try to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the endemic <b>Sardinian</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, P. barbagiae de Prins and van der Poorten 1982, using the DNA barcoding region of the COI mitochondrial gene. The species is restricted to a few slopes in the mountainous areas of the island, and has been described as distinct from the continental and Corsican P. baton by characteristics of the male genitalia and wing markings. We analyzed 11 individuals of P. barbagiae and compared them with all Eu- ropean and north African congeneric species: a group of 77 sequences including P. baton (Corsica, Italy, France, Spain), P. vicrama (Romania, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Russia) and P. panoptes (Spain), as well as several BINs containing 20 sequences of P. abencerragus (Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Portugal), 10 sequences of P. bavius (Romania, Russia) and 4 sequences of P. fatma (Morocco). The Bayesan phylogenetic tree showed that the group with P. baton, P. vicrama and P. panoptes forms a well-supported clade, but DNA barcodes do not distinguish these three species. The largest interspecific distance (4. 8...|$|E
40|$|The endemic <b>Sardinian</b> chalk hill <b>blue</b> butterfly, Polyommatus coridon gennargenti, is {{considered}} vulnerable to extinction {{because of its}} low genetic variation and restricted distribution. The species also has a fragmented distribution, which follows the patchy distribution pattern of its larval host-plant. A preliminary investigation of the population structure of P. coridon gennargenti was carried out on a small network of four local populations by means of capture-recapture methods. Estimated population sizes and movement rates among the four adjacent local populations suggest that this taxon has a metapopulation structure composed of loosely connected small local populations. Natural fragmentation, isolation, and traditional land use contribute to the vulnerability of P. coridon gennargenti to extinction. Low effective population sizes and restricted movement between habitat patches lead to inbreeding and an increased vulnerability to extinction of this island population. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.
