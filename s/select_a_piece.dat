500|$|A paid-content {{expansion}} titled [...] "GoatZ" [...] {{was released}} on 7 May 2015 as downloadable content for the game on personal computers and a stand-alone application for mobile devices. It was developed by Coffee Stain's partner studio Gone North Games. The expansion's content spoofs zombie-based survival games, such as DayZ, and includes a new map and gameplay aspects such as fighting off zombies and crafting. The title itself plays off DayZ {{as well as a}} play on the Internet meme goatse.cx. In a cross-promotional [...] "GoatBread" [...] update with Bossa Studios' I am Bread to be offered in late 2015, a free update to Goat Simulator will allow the players to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of bread as their avatar, while I am Bread will add in a [...] "RAMpage" [...] mode based on Goat Simulator. Another add-on, the [...] "Super Secret DLC" [...] package part of a cross-promotion with Overkill Software's Payday 2; the Payday-inspired content for Goat Simulator included additional playable characters including a camel, flamingo, and a dolphin in a wheelchair, while Goat Simulator content will be added to Payday 2. These were released in January 2016. Goat Simulator decorative content will be added to Rocket League in a mid-2016 update. Another expansion, [...] "Waste of Space", was again developed by Gone North Games and released on 26 May 2016. The expansion features a new map based on a space colony, and spoofs much of the recent science fiction media genre.|$|E

We use Austin's procedure {{again with the}} trimmings and partners #4 and #1, to create 4 pieces each of which equals exactly 1/4 for both of them. Since partners #1 and #2 have an irrevocable advantage over whoever partner that took the trimmed piece, we can let #3 {{be the first to}} <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> from the trimming, then #2, then #4 and #1.|$|E

5000|$|The show {{traditionally}} asks its {{guests to}} <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> to perform from a composer of their choice; Deutscher {{opted for the}} German composer Eduard Marxsen, who was the teacher of young Johannes Brahms, and whom Vardi said he'd [...] "never heard of". Deutscher explained that she felt sorry for Marxsen as a long-forgotten composer. After listening to Deutscher perform a sonata by Domenico Scarlatti, Vardi commented that she played Scarlatti's music {{as though she had}} written it.|$|E

50|$|Captured {{pieces are}} {{retained}} in hand, {{and can be}} brought back into play under the capturing player's control. On any turn, instead of moving a piece on the board, a player may <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> in hand and place it—unpromoted side up and facing the opposing side—on any empty square. The piece is then one of that player's active pieces {{on the board and}} can be moved accordingly. This is called dropping the piece, or simply, a drop. A drop counts as a complete move.|$|E
5000|$|The {{piece was}} remembered fondly by some Savoyards. In 1906, as a {{professor}} of singing and stage manager at the Royal College of Music, Richard Temple was asked to direct a work from his earlier career for the first performance of the Cambridge University Operatic Club, at the Scala Theatre. He was asked to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> [...] "from which students would learn the craft of worthwhile light opera." [...] Instead of choosing The Mikado or The Yeomen of the Guard, for instance, he chose Mirette.|$|E
5000|$|Every winter, Art League members donate {{original}} {{works of}} art to be raffled off in the annual Patrons' Show Fundraiser, which sells about 600 tickets each year.

The Patrons' Show was named the [...] "Most Fun Art Fundraiser" [...] in the July 2010 issue of Washingtonian Magazine.|$|R
60|$|As usual, the Soudanese {{troops had}} been {{accompanied}} by {{a considerable number of}} their wives, who were heavily laden with their little household goods, and in many cases babies. They trudged patiently along {{in the rear of the}} columns, and formed an encampment of their own, half a mile away from the men's, generally <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of ground surrounded by thick bush, into which they could escape, should Dervish raiders come down upon them.|$|R
50|$|They {{spent several}} days {{searching for a}} site safe from the sea, then <b>selected</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of land {{on the west side}} of the St. Marks River, about two miles below the old town of Magnolia, Florida. This {{location}} offered high ground, fewer swamps, and beautiful bubbling springs. It was owned by the Apalachicola Land Co. The organization permitted citizens who had suffered from the storm to draw lots at a cost of $25 and up.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{tissue is}} used in the {{conservation}} of books and manuscripts. The tissue comes in varying thicknesses and colors, and is used for a variety of mending tasks, including repairing tears, mending book hinges, and reinforcing the folds of signatures (the groups of pages gathered and folded together at the spine) or for reinforcement of an entire sheet through backing. The mender will <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of Japanese tissue that closely matches the color of the paper being mended, and chooses a thickness (weight) suitable to the job at hand.|$|E
50|$|Captured {{pieces are}} {{retained}} {{in hand and}} can be brought back into play under the capturing player's control.

50|$|Like {{many types}} of European folk dance and country-western line dancing in the U.S., each Israeli folk dance has a fixed choreography (sequence of steps) and is danced to <b>a</b> {{specific}} <b>piece</b> of music. The yotzer, or choreographer, <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of music, usually {{from one of the}} genres of Israeli music, and arranges a set of steps to fit with that music. The formation of the dance might be a circle, couples, trios, or short lines, as well as a group/line formation as in country-western line dancing.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews all the {{published}} {{evidence on the}} theory that the act of <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of food or drink structurally coordinates quantitative information across several sensory modalities. The existing data show that the momentary disposition to consume the item is strengthened or weakened by learnt configurations of stimuli perceived through both exteroceptive and interoceptive senses. The observed configural structure of performance shows that the multimodal stimuli are interacting perceptually, rather than merely combining quantities of information from the senses into the observed response...|$|R
40|$|I curated this {{exhibition}} {{as part of}} a larger initiative, instigated by me, between the digital textile printing research centre at GSA, Stoddard Sekers archive, Warners archive and the National Trust, investigating applications for digital reproduction of archive textiles. I approached nine established textile designers who had not previously engaged with digital production and invited them to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> from an archive and make a response using the medium of digital print. A digital facsimile of the chosen piece, printed onto paper, was exhibited with each output. The exhibits involved a range of substrates including leather, silk, cotton and wool. My own piece was in response to a painted paisley design circa 1850, exploring scale and the contrasts to traditional rendering that digital technology makes possible. The exhibition aimed to explore the issues surrounding craft and its relationship with digital media, the appropriation and misappropriation of ideas, and further to understand how artefact research contributes to the development of contemporary design...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Half of all {{patients}} commencing stroke rehabilitation have marked impairment of the hemiplegic arm, with only 5 % {{of those with}} severe paralysis regaining useful function. Current opinion in motor learning, reinforced by clinical evidence supports the use of repetitive movement practice, feedback and goal orientation to improve rehabilitation. This study aims to motivate people to practise their rehabilitation by extending their activities {{using a combination of}} technology and interactive personal games. The multi-disciplinary team comprises physiotherapists, design engineers and computer scientists. Method Two chronic hemiplegic stroke participants were selected via an interview and screening criteria. Ethical approval and written informed consent were obtained. Participative user centred design techniques were used over three months to assess patients’ rehabilitation aims, movement abilities and interests. Notes, photos and video were recorded. Results Two prototype technologies were designed: i) A device enabling a severely impaired patient to play with her toddler using her hemiplegic arm to guide balls down a shute. ii) A chess game in which the participant uses his hemiplegic hand to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> using a pressure sensitive sensor, whilst the unaffected hand keys in the move. Conclusion A user centred approach enabled technologies to be designed with stroke patients which addressed their rehabilitation aims as well as their real life interests. These technologies will now be deployed in the home for one month with physiotherapy outcome measures being taken before and after the deployment along with a semi structured interview to assess users’ perceptions of comfort, usability and acceptability...|$|E
6000|$|When this {{preparatory measure}} was taken, Dr. Todd <b>selected</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of the shirt with great care, and handing to Mr. Jones, without moving a muscle, said: “Here, Squire Jones, you are {{well acquainted with}} these things; will you please to scrape the lint? It should be fine and soft, you know, my dear sir; and be {{cautious}} that no cotton gets in, or it may p’izen the wound. The shirt has been made with cotton thread, but you can easily pick it out.” ...|$|R
60|$|When he had {{finished}} he <b>selected</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of meat weighing a hundred pounds, and started to drag {{it down to the}} tent. But the snow was soft, and it was too much for him. He exchanged it for <b>a</b> twenty-pound <b>piece,</b> and, with many pauses to rest, succeeded in getting it to the tent. He fried some of the meat, but ate sparingly. Then, and automatically, he went out to his crouching place on the bank. There were sled-tracks in the fresh snow on the trail. The sled-load of life had passed by while he had been cutting up the moose.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} wavelet-based {{algorithm}} to cut an object {{out of an}} image in a semi-automatic manner. The user of the algorithm <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of <b>a</b> boundary that separates an object from the background. In contrast to other well-known segmentation algorithms, this sample boundary {{does not have to}} be a sharp edge, but might also be a smooth transition between two shades or a texture. Based on a multi-scale wavelet analysis of the sample area our algorithm seeks a path around the object by analyzing characteristic frequencies...|$|R
5000|$|Dio Chrysostom, in {{a speech}} on ideal kingship {{addressed}} to Trajan, refers {{to the story of}} how Timotheus' music inspired martial thoughts in Alexander. For Chrysostom, Timotheus's skill was in [...] "adapting his playing to the king's character by <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> that was not languishing or slow nor of the kind that would cause relaxation or listlessness, but rather, I fancy, the ringing strain which bears Athena's name and none other." [...] Other rulers, such as Sardanapalus who was of languid temperament, would not have responded to such music, but being of a highly volatile nature, Alexander did.|$|R
5000|$|The {{need of the}} North Carolina Railroad in the 1850s {{to locate}} land where they could build, repair and do {{maintenance}} on its track was the genesis of Burlington, North Carolina. The company <b>selected</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of land slightly west of present-day Graham. On January 29, 1856, the last spikes were driven into the final tie of the North Carolina Railroad project, uniting the cities of Goldsboro and Charlotte by rail. The next day, the first locomotive passed along the new route. When the iron horse arrived in Alamance County, locals {{referred to it as}} [...] "the eighth wonder of the world".|$|R

Captain Sellers shook his head; then he glanced round uneasily as Trimblett, with an exclamation of satisfaction, found an inch in his waistcoat-pocket and began to write. He nodded sternly at the paper when he had finished, and handed it to Captain Sellers.|$|R
