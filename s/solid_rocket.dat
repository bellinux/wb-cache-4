He joined Thiokol's board after he served on the Rogers Commission; the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol-manufactured <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters. He retired as chairman of the board of EDO Corporation in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, {{engineers}} {{determined that}} there was no additional work needed to verify the <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached to boosters that had flown earlier that year. Close inspections of the STS-74 stack determined that no such cracks were present on the boosters to be used for the mission.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These had been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E

5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> motors.|$|E
5|$|Some {{concerns}} were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield {{would not have}} been able to protect it during the higher speed ballistic reentry associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E

5|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} Mir orbited {{there is a}} variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small needles, and many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed {{a threat to the}} station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of the}} station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 2008, NASA {{announced}} that Atlantis would {{be removed from}} its <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters and external tank stack and {{sent back to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to await a targeted launch time at 1:11pm EDT on 12 May 2009. The stack was turned over to be used on the STS-119 mission instead. On 23 March, Atlantis was mated to its new stack in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and rolled out to Launch Pad 39A on 31 March. On 24 April 2009, NASA managers issued a request to move the STS-125 launch up one day to 11 May at 2:01pm EDT. The change was made official at the flight readiness review on 30 April.|$|E
5|$|The MOL {{program was}} {{cancelled}} on 10 June 1969, {{in favour of}} unmanned reconnaissance satellites. Some systems developed for the program were later used on unmanned missions, while the space suits which were under development were transferred to NASA. The Titan IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other Titan rockets â€” the stretched first and second stages became the Titan 34, which {{was used as the}} core of some later Titan IIIB flights, and on the Titan 34D. The seven-segment <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters were later introduced on the Titan IVA.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E
5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, {{tripropellant}} vehicles {{start off}} burning with dense fuel and transition to hydrogen. (In a sense the Space Shuttle does this with its combination of <b>solid</b> <b>rockets</b> and main engines, but tripropellant vehicles usually carry their engines to orbit.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Fewer {{handling}} and storage issues - Ingredients in <b>solid</b> <b>rockets</b> are often incompatible chemically and thermally. Repeated changes in temperature can cause {{distortion of the}} grain. Antioxidants and coatings are used to keep the grain from breaking down or decomposing.|$|R
5000|$|Three small <b>solid</b> <b>rockets</b> called TIRS (mounted so {{that they}} aim {{horizontally}} out {{the sides of the}} backshell) that provide a small horizontal kick to the backshell to help orient the backshell more vertically during the main RAD rocket burn.|$|R
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using <b>solid</b> <b>rocket</b> fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at Tâˆ’6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle <b>Solid</b> <b>Rocket</b> Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle <b>Solid</b> <b>Rocket</b> Booster (SRB). Compared with the <b>Solid</b> <b>Rocket</b> Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the <b>Solid</b> <b>Rocket</b> Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the <b>Solid</b> <b>Rocket</b> Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E
50|$|All rockets {{used some}} form of solid or {{powdered}} propellant up until the 20th century, when liquid-propellant rockets offered more efficient and controllable alternatives. <b>Solid</b> <b>rockets</b> are still used today in model rockets and on larger applications for their simplicity and reliability.|$|R
