40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} verification of a novel sensorless control scheme for a super synchronous slip ring induction machine (SRIM). The novel scheme overcomes {{the limitations of the}} encoder-based system, with a reduced cost.;This research re-utilised a LUED slip power facility, previously funded by SERC in the 80 s.;The SRIM uses a conventional current source inverter (CSI) connected between the supply and the rotor windings. Two techniques of slip power recovery, the Kramer and the <b>Scherbius</b> <b>system,</b> are discussed. The Kramer system recovers slip power to the supply. The <b>Scherbius</b> <b>system</b> is capable of four-quadrant operation, with the main advantage of twice the rated shaft output power when operating at twice the rated speed.;The CSI is investigated and its commutation problems studied. For stable operation the commutation sequence in the CSI is synchronised electrically with the varying rotor e. m. f. 's. When motoring sub-synchronously, or generating super-synchronously, the rotor e. m. f. 's are in the direction to aid the commutation process. However, when motoring super-synchronously or generating sub-synchronously, the rotor e. m. f. 's oppose commutation. These limit the performance of the CSI.;Provided the rotor terminal voltages are isolated from the mains, the rotor speed and phase information can be derived from the measured and filtered rotor terminal voltages. The derived signals can synchronise the CSI to the secondary e. m. f., thereby eliminating the need of an encoder. This novel scheme is different to the techniques known for cage type machines, and is not affected by the inherent machine parameter variations.;The SRIM harmonics are analysed. From which, a novel adaptive filter was developed to remove the rotor speed dependent harmonics and to track the varying e. m. f. with negligible phase delay. The filter and the scheme were verified using an analogue method, although a DSP system may provide better flexibility...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{two different}} techniques for efficient control of slip energy in a slip-ring induction machine. The static Kramer system merely recovers slip power and returns {{it to the}} a. c. supply. As a result only sub-synchronous motoring or super-synchronous generating is possible. In the static <b>Scherbius</b> <b>system,</b> however, the slip power can be controlled both {{into and out of}} the secondary circuit. This allows the machine to operate as a motor and generator at both sub- and super-synchronous speeds. For wide speed range operation a current source inverter was used as this can inherently provide reversal of power flow. The operating requirements for the current source inverter operating in the secondary circuit of an induction machine have been determined. These considerations show that the current source inverter control signal must be synchronised to the secondary e. m. f. of the machine. The machine can then operate in a stable manner over a very wide speed range. The conventional analysis of the current source inverter has been developed to include the effect of the secondary slip e. m. f. which is shown to have a major effect on the commutation behaviour of the inverter. The action of the commutation circuit is affected by the phase angle between the secondary current and the slip e. m. f. This angle can be controlled electronically and the effect of this has been predicted and observed. A detailed study of the Kramer system has included analysis of the d. c. link current waveform including Fourier harmonic prediction in terms of the circuit parameters and the operating slip. The operation of the Kramer and Scherbius systems has been studied for both motoring and generating modes of the induction machine and their relative merits have been compared. In particular the novel idea of using the <b>Scherbius</b> <b>system</b> for variable speed wind energy recovery has been considered and reported in a published paper. Finally suggestions have been made for further work particularly for application to wind energy recovery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{the speed and}} power control a slip energy recovery drive using voltage-source PWM converter with current-controlled technique. The slip energy occurred in the rotor circuit is transferred back to ac mains supply through a reactor and a step up transformer. The objective of the current-controlled technique is to increase power factor {{of the system and}} to reduce low order harmonics of the input line current. The drive system is designed and implemented using a voltage source inverter in conjunction with a boost chopper for DC link voltage, instead of a conventional drive using a 6 pulse converter or a <b>Scherbius</b> <b>system.</b> The slip power is recovered by the help of a voltage source inverter (VSI) based on a current-controlled technique. In order to keep the speed of the wound rotor induction motor constant over a certain range of operating conditions, the servo state feedback controller designed by a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is also introduced and the PI controller designed by pole placement method is also introduced in control the slip power this paper. The overall control system is implemented on DSP, oller board. A 1 kW wound motor is employed for testing. It is found that the motor speed can be controlled to be constant in the operating range of 600 - 1200 rpm at no load and full load. It is also found that the harmonics of the input ac line current is reduced while the ac line input power factor is increased...|$|E
