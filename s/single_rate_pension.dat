40|$|The Harmer-Henry {{pension and}} tax review {{resulted}} {{in an increase in}} the common value of the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> of Age <b>Pension</b> and Disability Support Pension from 25 per cent to 28 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. It also recommended a Resource Super Profits Tax that would have initially taxed mining 'rents' at 36 per cent, on top of the pre-existing 30 per cent federal tax on profits. These recommendations represent {{two sides of the same}} coin: higher federal spending alongside higher federal taxes. The pension rise is likely to reduce participation in the labour force. The proposed tax rise would discourage mining activity as miners considered their options to delay or abandon projects. There is a lot to like at the level of detail in the Harmer-Henry package, but future efforts to reform our tax-transfer system should focus on promoting saving and investment, including investment in human capital. 18 page(s...|$|R

This paper uses microdata and NATSEM 2 ̆ 7 s microsimulation models {{to examine the}} spatial distribution of poverty among older single people and to test the likely impact upon national and small area poverty rates of an increase in the <b>single</b> age <b>pension</b> <b>rate.</b> The paper provides an illustration of the usefulness of microsimulation models to policy makers. Changes in a country 2 ̆ 7 s tax and transfer systems can have a large effect on incomes, and can be targeted towards increasing incomes for the poor, thus reducing poverty rates. However, governments need an estimate {{of the extent to which}} a proposed policy change is likely to affect poverty rates, in order to be able to compare different proposals. Microsimulation models allow this comparison of proposed policies and can provide governments with an appreciation of how much a new policy is likely to cost; how many and what types of low income people will benefit; and the extent of any consequent reduction in the poverty rate. Until recently, microsimulation models have been able to estimate the effects of such changes only at a national or very broad regional level. NATSEM has now linked its tax/transfer microsimulation model (STINMOD) to spatially disaggregated census data, producing a spatial microsimulation model which can be used to identify the neighbourhood effects of policy changes for small areas...|$|R

It also examines the complementarities between reforms extending the averaging period and those increasing the retirement age under alternative tax policies. The analysis {{is based on a}} model in the Auerbach-Kotlikoff tradition applied to the Spanish economy. Without reforms, the simulations suggest that aging-related spending as a share of output will increase 16 percentage points by 2050, which are twice as much as in European Commission (2006) projections due to general equilibrium effects. Also, reforms extending the averaging period to the entire work life limit expenditure pressures {{at the peak of the}} demographic shock as much as increasing the retirement age in line with life expectancy (4 percentage points of GDP). These reforms and prefunding the demographic shock mitigate the adverse macroeconomic effects of aging and improve welfare.

40|$|The <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> codon {{model of}} non-synonymous {{substitution}} is ubiquitous in phylogenetic modeling. Indeed, {{the use of}} a non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio parameter has facilitated the interpretation of selection pressure on genomes. Although the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model has achieved wide acceptance, we argue that the assumption of a <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> of non-synonymous substitution is biologically unreasonable, given observed differences in substitution rates evident from empirical amino acid models. Some have attempted to incorporate amino acid substitution biases into models of codon evolution and have shown improved model performance versus the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model.

We argue that, since the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model is so easy to improve upon, new codon models should not be validated entirely on the basis of improved model fit over this model. Rather, we should strive to both improve on the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model and to approximate the general time-reversible model of codon substitution, with as few parameters as possible, so as to reduce model over-fitting.

40|$|Abstract — A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} deployment of multicast services is the daunting technical complexity of developing, testing and validating congestion control protocols fit for wide-area deployment. Protocols such as pgmcc and TFMCC have recently made considerable {{progress on the}} <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> case, i. e. where one dynamic reception rate is maintained for all receivers in the session. However, these protocols have limited applicability, since scaling to session sizes beyond tens of participants necessitates {{the use of multiple}} rate protocols. Unfortunately, while existing multiple rate protocols exhibit better scalability, they are both less mature than <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> protocols and suffer from high complexity. We propose a new approach to multiple rate congestion control that leverages proven <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> congestion control methods by orchestrating an ensemble of independently controlled <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> sessions.

40|$|Korea is on {{the verge}} of an {{unprecedented}} demographic shift. In coming decades, rapid aging will transform it from one of the youngest populations in the OECD to among the oldest in record time. In turn, this shift will put tremendous pressure on the pension system and health and long-term care expenditures. This paper evaluates the impact of population aging on the long-term fiscal position in Korea, and assesses potential policy responses using the IMF''s Global Fiscal Model. The paper finds that the key to maintaining a sound long-run fiscal position is to act early and with a range of policy tools, including pension reform, tax base broadening (and, if necessary, rate hikes), improved tax administration and some expenditure reallocation.
