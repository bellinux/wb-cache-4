5|$|While {{most major}} U.S. <b>sports</b> <b>have</b> evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, {{some of which}} have become popular in other countries.

5|$|Daily fantasy <b>sports</b> <b>have</b> faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} {{disputes over}} whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
5|$|However, {{independent}} reviews {{have called}} into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies. The event's supposed drawing power outside {{of a handful of}} rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from Australasia, South Africa, the British Isles and France.

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Sky Sports and the BBC's Grandstand {{programme}} {{covered the}} British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly. However, in 2001 the Superleague sold its broadcasting rights to 'Premium TV Ltd' {{who planned to}} set up a new sports channel, which never materialised. British ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network. This situation continued through the final seasons of the Superleague and into the first seasons of the Elite League. In 2005, Elite League officials concluded an agreement with the North American Sports Network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme. These usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length. In September 2007 the Elite League announced a deal with Sky Sports for a weekly show of Elite League highlights. In 2010 Sky Sports showed the playoff final between the Belfast Giants and Cardiff Devils live, {{this was the first time}} Sky had shown a live game for several years. Sky <b>Sports</b> <b>have</b> recently announced plans to show 8 live games along with a weekly highlight show during the 2010–11 season. In season 2013–14 Premier Sports acquired the rights to film and broadcast 23 games from the Elite League with a live game shown every Saturday night from 23 November onwards.|$|E
5|$|The Federated States of Micronesia is a {{collection}} of some 6,000 islands in the South Pacific ocean that includes approximately 100,000 people. The nation is composed of several states that each embody a prominent ethnic group amongst the island group, and lies approximately three-quarters of the way between Hawaii and Indonesia. After World War II, the Micronesian island chain became a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States. The Federated States of Micronesia became an independent country on 1986, but freely associates with the United States, which handles matters of defense. The Federated States of Micronesia sent its first delegation to participate in the Olympics approximately 14 years after it became a sovereign entity, sending three men and two women to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Between then and Beijing in 2008, three male and two female Micronesian athletes participating across three <b>sports</b> <b>have</b> appeared at the Olympics at every instance. Prior to Beijing, there had been no medalists from the Federated States of Micronesia; no medals were won by Micronesian athletes at the Beijing games either.
