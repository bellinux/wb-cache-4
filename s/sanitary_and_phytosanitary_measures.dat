40|$|Quality measures, effecting {{external}} or internal markets; {{large or}} small, {{has an impact}} on trade. The <b>Sanitary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>measure</b> was introduced to avert the impact on trade and provide a harmonised system of quality standards. However, disease, health and safety impacts, which lead to the destruction or harm of raw material, play a part in the cost of high quality protection of trade. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to capture the material, economic welfare costs that stem from the altered path of consumption resulting from the implementation of high quality standards in food trade. The empirical simulation draws upon results by compounding welfare loss from consuming in an economy with low or no health and safety standards. The assessment is based on how much would an individual be willing to pay to have higher assurance of quality food, hence a safe and healthy food commodities market? The pure economic welfare losses from low standard levels are quite considerable. The results in this paper provide on average, individuals would permanently give up to approximately 8 percent of their current level of consumption to have produce that has a higher health and safety assurance. Such potential welfare gains from increased standards utility levels contradict existing policies...|$|R

The paper estimates the cost of certification regularly borne by a typical Philippine food exporter to be less than three percent of sales, a relatively inconsequential ratio. However, increased cost from NTMs can adversely affect the small-scale companies that lack resources to adapt their production processes to foreign standards. The paper also traces the Philippine export products affected by nontariff measures imposed by the European Union. In all, NTMs of the EU affect a total of US$ 34 million of Philippine agriculture and fish exports to these markets, representing almost seven percent of agriculture exports to the twenty-five countries. market access, nontariff measures, Philippine agricultural exports, European Union, <b>sanitary</b> <b>and</b> <b>phytosanitary</b> (SPS) <b>measures...</b>|$|R

Buthe argues that, to explain this case of international delegation, principal-agent theory must be complemented by an analysis of cost-benefit calculations of the relevant domestic interest groups. Given these domestic interests, governments decided to institutionalize international cooperation on SPS measures outside of the WTO because they believed that such delegation would minimize the political costs of the loss of policymaking autonomy. Buthe notes, however, that in retrospect it appears that the widespread positive association of international standards with multilateralism and international consensus led many countries to underestimate those autonomy losses.

Relative to developing countries, developed countries tend to adopt more stringent food safety standards and regulations with a broader scope and to rely increasingly on certification and traceability. The additional costs of compliance for meeting international SPS requirements are higher for firms operating in developing countries because they must take additional steps to meet international food safety regulations and standards. Therefore, their comparative advantage, achieved through lower production costs, will tend to be reduced because of high incremental compliance costs.
