25|$|On {{the day of}} {{his death}} he asked for the score to be brought to his bedside. 'Did I not <b>say</b> <b>before,</b> that I was writing this Requiem for myself?' After saying this, he looked yet again with tears in his eyes through the whole work.|$|E
500|$|The jury retired at 6:15pm on {{the fifth}} day and {{returned}} at 7:30pm to give its verdict of guilty for each of the five defendants. When asked if they had anything to <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentence was passed, several of the convicted men made a closing speech. Allen stated his innocence, and that he regretted the death of Sergeant Brett, but that he was prepared to [...] "die proudly and triumphantly in defence of republican principles and the liberty of an oppressed and enslaved people".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{a violent}} {{criminal}} named John Mosley (Michael Kelly) is also {{searching for the}} Beacon. After killing one of Olivia's mentors, Mosley kidnaps and tortures Peter {{to find out the}} location. After he recovers the beacon from the grave of Robert Bishop, John Mosley is taken down by Olivia. The beacon escapes into the earth, and The Observer reports that its departure was [...] "on schedule." [...] Peter confronts The Observer about the beacon, only to have a gibberish conversation that implies that the Observer knows what Peter is going to <b>say</b> <b>before</b> he says it, or, as Peter puts it, [...] "he knew me [...] he was inside my head." [...] The Observer then knocks Peter out with an advanced sort of stun gun.|$|E
500|$|France stated {{his vision}} of the film was {{different}} from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his [...] "amiable, nerdy genius" [...] incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced Brian Banner, Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father. However, he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The [...] "Don't make me angry..." [...] line from the TV series was made into dialogue that Banner's father would <b>say</b> <b>before</b> beating his son. Elements such as the [...] "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the black ops made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.|$|E
500|$|When {{the monsters}} battle {{each other at}} the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs about each of the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element {{throughout}} actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, [...] "I really like Robert Smith", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, [...] "Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, [...] "From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!", but Parker said Bergman misread some of the words so the on-air translation was imperfect. Before Leonard Maltin transforms, he screams in Japanese, [...] "Listen, listen, here's a tulip", which Parker said is a phrase Japanese children <b>say</b> <b>before</b> passing gas.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked by}} the judge whether he had {{anything}} to <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentence was imposed, Cherry motioned to the prosecutors and stated: [...] "This whole bunch lied {{all the way through}} this thing [...] I told the truth.

2500|$|The jury deliberated {{for just}} {{two and a}} half hours before {{returning}} with a verdict finding Thomas Edwin Blanton guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. When asked by the judge whether he had anything to <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentence was imposed, Blanton simply said: [...] "I guess the Lord will settle it on Judgment Day." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{trial in}} the Victorian Supreme Court lasting twelve sitting days Ryan was convicted {{of the murder of}} Hodson and sentenced to death by Justice John Starke, the {{mandatory}} sentence at that time. Asked if he had anything to <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentencing Ryan stated [...] "I still maintain my innocence. I will consult with my counsel with a view to appeal. That is all I have to say!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although (as {{noted in}} the {{following}} sub-section) {{the greater part of}} the print-run of the first edition was said to have been lost in a shipwreck, the Monarquía indiana was known in Mexico as early as 1624 when it was first cited in a book published there in that year. [...] Between then and 1714 (that is to <b>say,</b> <b>before</b> the second edition) it was cited, even copiously on occasion, by at least eleven authors in works published for the most part in Mexico, but also in Madrid and Guatemala.|$|E
2500|$|Few {{were the}} raids of nomadic tribes {{of the desert}} against the cities of the {{province}} {{for at least the}} first two centuries. We know {{that at the time of}} Emperor Domitian, the Nasamones (a Libyan tribe living south of Leptis Magna) rebelled, bringing destruction and defeating the Legatus legionis of Augusta III Cneo Suelli Flacco, who had gone to meet them. But when he later returned with reinforcements, he crushed them all, so that Domitian could <b>say</b> <b>before</b> the Roman Senate the famous: [...] "I prevented Nasamoni to exist".|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{noticeable}} conflict between what intelligent design backers tell the public {{through the media}} and what they <b>say</b> <b>before</b> conservative Christian audiences. This is studied and deliberate as advocated by wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson. When speaking to a mainstream audience and to the media, ID proponents cast ID as a secular, scientific theory. But when speaking to what the Wedge Document calls their [...] "natural constituency, namely (conservative) Christians," [...] ID proponents express themselves in unambiguously religious language. This {{in the belief that}} they cannot afford to alienate their constituency and major funding sources, virtually all of which are conservative religious organizations and individuals such as Howard Ahmanson.|$|E

5000|$|Joseph Fouché {{recalled}} Napoleon <b>saying</b> <b>before</b> the Peninsular War, [...] "Reflect {{that the}} sun never sets in the immense inheritance of Charles V, and that I shall have the empire of both worlds." [...] This was cited in Walter Scott's Life of Napoleon.|$|R
2500|$|Four verses in Deuteronomy (26:5-8) {{are then}} expounded, with an elaborate, {{traditional}} commentary. ("5. And thou shalt speak and <b>say</b> <b>before</b> the Lord thy God: 'A wandering Aramean was my parent, {{and they went}} down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 6. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our parents, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. 8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian, MI-13, and S.H.I.E.L.D. began {{investigating}} a suspected return of Mys-Tech {{but he was}} swiftly beaten down and captured by Death's Head II. This was actually a ruse by Death's Head II to plant a tracking device and find out why the Psycho-Wraiths wanted the captain (he didn't bother to tell Brian). The Prime Wraith wanted the hero {{to be part of}} six living batteries for a monotrace core, opening a portal to Hell for Mephisto's armies (led by the brainwashed hero Killpower) to ravage the Earth. Captain Britain was freed and fought to hold back the demons, and tried to find a solution other than killing Killpower. [...] "We're heroes, we don't --" [...] was all he could <b>say</b> <b>before</b> Killpower was gunned down by the anti-heroes Major Hauer, Death's Head, and Colonel Liger. Afterwards, on a whim Captain Britain placed a union flag on top of a damaged Big Ben, deciding that surviving the battle gave them [...] "the right to celebrate a little" ...|$|E
2500|$|The reunion {{between the}} Doctor and Rose in the 2008 episode [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] is stated by {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Confidential to be {{a parody of}} romantic film conventions, because the heightened emotional content is abruptly interrupted by the Doctor being shot by a Dalek. In the next episode, [...] "Journey's End", Rose challenges the Doctor {{to say what he}} didn't get to <b>say</b> <b>before,</b> to which he replies, [...] "Does it need saying?" [...] His half-human duplicate, however, does whisper it into Rose's ear, {{and the two of them}} kiss; Rose gets an emphatically romantic resolution to her romance storyline, as the duplicate-Doctor and Rose continue to live together on a parallel Earth. Gardner commented in Confidential that although the audience cannot hear, it is obvious that he is saying [...] "I love you". David Tennant stated that Rose was the Doctor's girlfriend, though it was never explicitly stated on screen.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to popular}} Czech <b>saying,</b> <b>before</b> he {{committed}} himself to combat in battle already lost, he said: [...] "God forbid the Bohemian king ever flees from battle". The saying tacitly assumes, the sentence was pronounced in Czech: [...] "Toho bohdá nebude, aby český král z boje utíkal".|$|R
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later went on to <b>say</b> <b>before</b> the 2017 UK general election {{that she would be}} willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, {{during the}} first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was {{revealed}} in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of Time in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated to no one in particular [...] "His wife sent him...She works at the CIA." [...] Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court [...] "I didn't want to give [...] immunity. I did so reluctantly." [...] Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court [...] "I'm not sure we're getting the full story here." [...] According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, [...] "Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will <b>say</b> <b>before</b> agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [...] he never got one from Fleischer." ...|$|E
