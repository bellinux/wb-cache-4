40|$|Trunk shakers {{are among}} the most {{widespread}} machines for mechanical harvesting in intensive olive orchards (300 – 500  trees ha− 1). Harvesting effectiveness is an important issue for this sort of machine because, due to the heterogeneity of the tree canopy structure, vibration transmission is uneven and some branches vibrate poorly. The aim of the present work was to determine if the removal of internal suckers before harvesting could improve vibration transmission and harvesting effectiveness. ‘Leccino’ and ‘Frantoio’ trees trained to free vase and planted in an intensive olive orchard (400  trees ha− 1) were used in experiments carried out in 2012 and 2013 in two different orchards. Triaxial accelerometers, placed on tree trunk and on the main branches, were used to measure vibration transmitted to the canopy by two custom-built orbital and multidirectional trunk shakers. On average, harvesting effectiveness increased significantly from 83. 4 % to 95. 6 % as a consequence of <b>sucker</b> <b>removal.</b> Maximum acceleration transmitted to the trunk and branches increased by 33. 1 % and 46. 6 % respectively after internal <b>sucker</b> <b>removal.</b> These results suggest that internal suckers reduce vibration transmission through the canopy, affecting harvesting effectiveness. Furthermore, the larger the fruit retention force per fruit mass was, the larger was the effect of <b>sucker</b> <b>removal</b> on harvesting effectiveness. These results suggests that <b>sucker</b> <b>removal</b> prior to harvesting is advisable to improve harvesting effectiveness in open vase trees harvested by trunk shakers, in particular when mechanical harvesting is carried out at an early stage of fruit ripening...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fertilization, late weeding, and <b>sucker</b> <b>removal</b> on taro pest populations and yield were {{compared}} at two sites with different soils. The first experiment {{was in an}} area with shall calcareous soil. Fertilizer increased plant size and yield in this soil. However, in the plots with the lowest levels of iron in the soil, iron deficiency stopped growth of the taro even when fertilizer was applied. All plots showed some symptoms of iron deficiency. Taro planthoppers were more abundant on fertilized plants, but aphids and taro hornworm eggs were not affected by any treatment. The second experiment was planted in a deep clay soil with a more neutral Ph. Fertilizer applications showed no effect on yield in this experiment, {{in part because of}} leaching caused by heavy rainfall early in the season. Yield was higher in weeded plots. Pigs consumed signifIcantly more taro in weeded plots than unweeded ones. Insect populations were not affected by the treatments. In both experiments, there was a significant positive association between the number of aphids and taro planthoppers per sample {{and the size of the}} plant sampled. The higher numbers of planthoppers on fertilized plants observed in the first experiment was probably due to size differences of plants in fertilized and unfertilized plots...|$|E
40|$|A contact lens may {{be removed}} from the eye either {{manually}} or by using a small rubber <b>sucker.</b> The <b>removal</b> of lenses by the rubber sucker technique is difficult at times, especi-ally when the lens is fenestrated, as the vacuum cannot be maintained. Assistance in the removal of the lens may be obtained by modifying existing rubber suckers. The bulb is cut off with a sharp blade and into the lumen so exposed is inserted a glass pipette removed from a drop-bottle. The other end of the pipette is attached to a rubber tube of convenient length. A second glass pipette which has been lightly packed with cotton wool to act as a barrier to saliva and to prevent condensation in the tube is fitted into {{the other end of the}} rubber tube. The device is then assembled and suction is provided by the mouth and the vacuum controlled by the tongue as in using a volumetric pipette. This method should prove most useful in the removal of soft lenses. The surface tension between cornea and fenestrated lens is readily reduced and the lens may be removed more easily by gently blowing down the pipette with the bell of the applicator apposed to the fenestration or fenestrations. A haptic type sucker may be used for large hard lenses and for soft lenses. Received for publication September 2. 197...|$|R
