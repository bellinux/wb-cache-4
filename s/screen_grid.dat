25|$|Clamp tube (<b>screen</b> <b>grid)</b> modulation: The screen-grid bias may be {{controlled}} through a “clamp tube”, which reduces voltage {{according to the}} modulation signal. It is difficult to approach 100-percent modulation while maintaining low distortion with this system.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the tetrode vacuum tube containing a <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> led to a multi-element tube in which the mixer and oscillator functions could be combined, first used in the so-called autodyne mixer. This was rapidly followed {{by the introduction of}} tubes specifically designed for superheterodyne operation, most notably the pentagrid converter. By reducing the tube count, this further reduced the advantage of preceding receiver designs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{control and}} <b>screen</b> <b>grids</b> were wound {{so that the}} pitches were the same and the wires were in {{alignment}} (the pentode used different pitches).|$|R
5000|$|It {{had higher}} {{inherent}} intermodulation distortion than the pentode. It {{could be reduced}} by adopting an ultra-linear design in a push-pull circuit. This connection links the <b>screen</b> <b>grids</b> to taps on the output transformer. Negative feedback also reduced harmonic and intermodulation distortion.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{the five}} grids {{operated}} thus. Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid {{in conjunction with}} grid 2 which acted as its anode. Grid 4 accepted the incoming signal with the remaining two grids, 3 and 5 connected together (usually internally) which acted as <b>screen</b> <b>grids</b> to <b>screen</b> the anode, <b>grid</b> 4 and grid 2 from each other. Because grid 2 was a 'leaky' anode in that it allowed part of the modulated electron stream through, the oscillator was coupled into the mixing section of the valve. In fact, in some designs, grid 2 consisted of just the support rods, the actual grid wire itself being omitted.|$|R
2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> and the main anode, called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the <b>screen</b> <b>grid).</b> This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{was that}} in spite of the presence of the <b>screen</b> <b>grids,</b> the electron beam, modulated by the oscillator electrodes, still had to pass through the signal grid, and coupling of the oscillator into the signal circuit was inevitable. The American Federal Communication Commission (FCC) started requiring radio manufacturers to certify that their products avoided this interference under Part 15 of their rules. In the UK, the Postmaster General (who was responsible for radio licensing), laid down a set of stringent rules concerning radio interference.|$|R
2500|$|The dual-gate MOSFET has a tetrode configuration, {{where both}} gates control the current in the device. It is {{commonly}} used for small-signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain-side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by Miller effect, replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration. Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing (frequency conversion). The [...] "tetrode" [...] description, though accurate, does not replicate the vacuum-tube tetrode. Vacuum-tube tetrodes, using a <b>screen</b> <b>grid,</b> exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes. These improvements are commonly {{an order of magnitude}} (10 times) or considerably more. Tetrode transistors (whether bipolar junction or field-effect) do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree.|$|E
2500|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{require a}} local oscillator and mixer, combined in {{the function of}} a single pentagrid converter tube. Various alternatives such as {{using a combination of}} a triode with a hexode and even an octode have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both control grids (at a low potential) and screen grids (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers including the miniature tube version of the [...] "All American Five". Octodes such as the 7A8 were rarely used in the US, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.|$|E
2500|$|To {{combat the}} {{stability}} problems and limited voltage gain {{due to the}} Miller effect, the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the tetrode tube in 1919. He showed that {{the addition of a}} second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the <b>screen</b> <b>grid,</b> could solve these problems. ("Screen" [...] in this case refers to electrical [...] "screening" [...] or shielding, not physical construction: all [...] "grid" [...] electrodes in between the cathode and plate are [...] "screens" [...] of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the control grid, essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a tetrode, meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.|$|E
50|$|The hexode (six-electrode) was {{actually}} developed after the heptode or pentagrid. It {{was developed in}} Germany as a mixer but was designed from the start {{to be used with}} a separate triode oscillator. Thus the grid configuration was grid 1, signal input; grids 2 and 4 <b>screen</b> <b>grids</b> (connected together - again, usually internally) and grid 3 was the oscillator input. The device had no suppressor grid. A major advantage was that by using grid 1 as the signal input grid, the device was more sensitive to weak signals.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{suppressor}} grid voltage {{and not the}} <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> voltage controls the screen current, if the suppressor and <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> are coupled together with a capacitor (C2) {{so there is a}} constant potential difference between them, increasing the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> voltage will increase the suppressor voltage, resulting in a decrease in screen current. This means the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> has negative differential resistance with respect to the cathode, and can be used to create oscillations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> {{may also}} {{generate}} considerable heat. Limits to <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> dissipation, {{in addition to}} plate dissipation, are listed for power devices. If these are exceeded then tube failure is likely.|$|E
50|$|As {{the second}} grid (<b>screen</b> <b>grid)</b> in a tetrode is {{maintained}} {{at a constant}} potential the equation for the tetrode can be reduced back {{to that of the}} triode as long as the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> is kept at the same potential.|$|E
50|$|In America, the {{configuration}} was different. Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid as before, {{but in this}} case, grids 2 and 4 were connected together (again usually internally). Grid 2 functioned as both a screen and the oscillator anode; {{in this case the}} grid wire had to be present to provide the <b>screening.</b> <b>Grid</b> 3 accepted the incoming signal. <b>Grid</b> 4 <b>screened</b> this from the anode, and grid 5 was a suppressor grid to suppress secondary emission. This configuration limited the oscillator design to one where the oscillator 'anode' was operated from the HT+ (B+) rail. This was often accomplished by using a Hartley Oscillator circuit and taking the cathode to the tap on the coil.|$|R

5000|$|The tube was {{originally}} designed for mobile operations, so it's filament draws only 0.705 A of current, while anode power dissipation allowed {{is up to}} 40w, quite big for such low filament power. It determines the need for high anode voltage, 800V typically. The <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> is quite dense, so it's voltage when working in pentode mode is limited by 300V, otherwise power dissipated by the grid when anode voltage goes below <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> voltage would damage it. That's why the tube can't be efficiently used in so called [...] "Ultra - Linear" [...] regime when anode and <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> have the same voltage at idle.
