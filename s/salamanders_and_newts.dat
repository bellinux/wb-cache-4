5|$|There is {{a direct}} {{competition}} between males to win {{the attention of the}} females in <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts,</b> with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with. Some species store sperm through long breeding seasons, as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.|$|E
25|$|The hydra and the planarian flatworm {{have long}} served as model organisms for their highly {{adaptive}} regenerative capabilities. Once wounded, their cells become activated {{and start to}} remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state. The Caudata ("urodeles"; <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts),</b> an order of tailed amphibians, is possibly the most adept vertebrate group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes {{and a variety of}} internal structures. The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among metazoan creatures. In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce asexually through fragmentation, budding, or fission. A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two clones of the original.|$|E
25|$|Sperm {{storage is}} a method by which females can control the sperm that fertilizes their eggs. Female <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts,</b> most notably Triturus vulgaris, possess sperm-storage glands called spermathecae in the walls of their cloacae. Sperm storage has evolved {{independently}} to control reproduction {{in response to the}} environment. Females have the ability to store multiple spermatophores until they are needed for fertilization. Sperm storage leads to the post-copulatory sexual selection process of cryptic female choice, which occurs when a female removes the deposited sperm or favors one set of spermatophore over another, during or after copulation. Spermatophores are composed of a cap containing the spermatozoa and a gelatinous support arrangement which fastens the spermatophore to a substrate. Spermatophores are very central to reproductive success; therefore, they are handled carefully. Mating success has a direct correlation to favorable phenotypic traits such as tail loss, adult body size, and age.|$|E
50|$|Some {{vertebrates}} also reproduce via spermatophores. Males of most <b>salamander</b> <b>and</b> <b>newt</b> species create spermatophores, {{which the}} females {{may choose to}} take up or not, depending {{on the success of}} the male's mating display.|$|R
5000|$|Via spermatophore, a sperm-containing cap {{placed by}} the male in the female's cloaca. Usually, the sperm {{is stored in}} spermathecae {{on the roof of}} the cloaca until it is needed at the time of oviposition. It is used by some <b>salamander</b> <b>and</b> <b>newt</b> species, by the arachnida, some insects and some mollusks.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the nucleotide sequences of cDNA fragments coding calcitonin from ultimobranchial glands in 2 species of urodelans (1 <b>salamander</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>newt)</b> <b>and</b> 4 species of anurans (1 toad and 3 frogs) by the reverse transcription {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) method and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) -PCR method. The <b>salamander</b> <b>and</b> <b>newt</b> calcitonins were each 97 % and 94 % similar to the lungfish and caiman calcitonins that we have already reported, in the amino acid sequences. However, anuran calcitonins were not only dissimilar (63 - 81 %) to the lungfish and caiman calcitonins but also diversified (59 - 91 %) even among anurans. The sequence identity of toad calcitonin was always low (59 - 66 %) among anurans...|$|R
500|$|The {{incidence}} of albinism in frogs <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts</b> is relatively higher than other taxa. [...] It {{has been estimated}} that one in four hundred of these animals is albino. [...] When albino tadpoles hatch, they are almost transparent. [...] This may help camouflage them initially, however, after two weeks, when their hind legs begin to emerge, they become milky white. [...] A survey in 2001 found hundreds of tiny albino plains leopard frogs, but when the researcher returned a few months later, not a single albino adult could be found.|$|E
500|$|Larvae hatch {{after two}} to five weeks, {{depending}} largely on temperature. In the first days after hatching, they live on their remaining embryonic yolk supply and {{are not able to}} swim, but attach to plants or the egg capsule with two balancers, adhesive organs on their head. After this period, they begin to ingest small invertebrates, and actively forage about ten days after hatching. As in all <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts,</b> forelimbs—already present as stumps at hatching—develop first, followed later by the backlegs. Unlike smaller newts, Triturus larvae are mostly nektonic, swimming freely in the water column. Just before the transition to land, the larvae [...] their external gills; they can at this stage reach a size of [...] in the larger species. Metamorphosis takes place two to four months after hatching, but the duration of all stages of larval development varies with temperature. Survival of larvae from hatching to metamorphosis has been estimated at a mean of roughly 4% for the northern crested newt, which is comparable to other newts. In unfavourable conditions, larvae may delay their development and overwinter in water, although this seems to be less common than in the small-bodied newts. Paedomophic adults, retaining their gills and staying aquatic, have occasionally been observed in several crested newt species.|$|E
2500|$|Limb {{regeneration}} in the axolotl and newt {{has been}} extensively studied and researched. Urodele amphibians, such as <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts,</b> display the highest regenerative ability among tetrapods. As such, they can fully regenerate their limbs, tail, jaws, and retina via epimorphic regeneration leading to functional replacement with new tissue. [...] Salamander limb regeneration occurs in two main steps. First, the local cells dedifferentiate at the wound site into progenitor to form a blastema Second, the blastemal cells will undergo proliferation, patterning, differentiation and growth using similar genetic mechanisms that deployed during embryonic development. Ultimately, blastemal cells will generate all the cells for the new structure.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{selection}} in amphibians involves sexual selection processes in amphibians, including frogs, <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts.</b> Prolonged breeders, {{the majority of}} frog species, have breeding seasons at regular intervals where male-male competition occurs with males arriving at the waters edge first in large number and producing {{a wide range of}} vocalizations, with variations in depth of calls the speed of calls and other complex behaviours to attract mates. The fittest males will have the deepest croaks and the best territories, with females known to make their mate choices at least partly based on the males depth of croaking. This has led to sexual dimorphism, with females being larger than males in 90% of species, males in 10% and males fighting for groups of females[...]|$|E
2500|$|While {{the length}} of the egg stage depends on the species and {{environmental}} conditions, aquatic eggs generally hatch within one week. Unlike <b>salamanders</b> <b>and</b> <b>newts,</b> frogs and toads never become sexually mature while still in their larval stage. The hatched eggs continue life as tadpoles, which typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free living larvae are fully aquatic. They lack [...] eyelids and have a cartilaginous skeleton, a lateral line system, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later) and tails with dorsal and ventral folds of skin for swimming. They quickly develop a gill pouch that covers the gills and the front legs; the lungs are also developed at an early stage as an accessory breathing organ. Some species which go through the metamorphosis inside the egg and hatch to small frogs never develop gills; instead there are specialised areas of skin that take care of respiration. Tadpoles also lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species usually have two elongate, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts in the upper jaw while the lower jaw has three rows of keradonts, surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can be lower (sometimes zero), or much higher. Tadpoles feed on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. Cannibalism has been observed among tadpoles. Early developers who gain legs may be eaten by the others, so the late bloomers survive longer.|$|E
