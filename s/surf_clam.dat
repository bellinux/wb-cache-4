5000|$|Machas la parmesana or “Parmesan machas” is a dish {{made with}} the macha. This is a {{saltwater}} clam, a bivalve that is native to Chile. This bivalve is known scientifically as Mesodesma donacium and in English is called either the pink clam, or the <b>surf</b> <b>clam.</b> The dish also includes Parmesan cheese.|$|E
5000|$|In culinary use, {{within the}} eastern {{coast of the}} United States, the term [...] "clam" [...] most often refers to the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria. It may also refer to a few other common edible species, such as the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria and the ocean quahog, Arctica islandica. Another species commercially {{exploited}} on the Atlantic Coast of the United States is the <b>surf</b> <b>clam</b> Spisula solidissima. Scallops are also used for food.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial clamming for quahog clams, and {{the larger}} <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> (soup clams) is {{primarily}} done offshore, via mechanical dredging. To harvest cultivated clam beds, aquaculturalists often use a much smaller version (hand pulled) from the offshore dredge. Another form of commercial clamming is done from a flat-decked boat using a clamrake with a telescopic handle. The head of these rakes have long tines attached to a [...] "basket-like" [...] cage in which the clams are collected.|$|R

50|$|Hundreds of oiled {{birds and}} {{large numbers of}} dead lobsters, <b>surf</b> <b>clams,</b> and sea stars were {{recovered}} in the weeks following the spill. US federal and Rhode Island state governments undertook considerable work {{to clean up the}} spill and restore lost fishery stocks and coastal marine habitat. The North Cape oil spill is considered a significant legal precedent in that it was the first major oil spill in the continental U.S. after the passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, resulting from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska on March 24, 1989.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{year long}} closed area that {{prevents}} groundfish fishing. Fishing vessels that are using exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed. Vessels using a midwater trawl are allowed and may fish with a LOA from a Regional Administrator. Because {{of the success of}} the scalloping industry, scallop fishing is allowed, as well as vessels using <b>surf</b> <b>clam</b> or quahog dredging gear. Charter and recreational vessels are also allowed and may fish with a LOA from a Regional Administrator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} Tensoba is {{developed}} in mid-Edo-period, which story said that tensoba is begun to eat hot broth soba with kakiage, using adductor muscle of <b>surf</b> <b>clam.</b> In that period, shrimp-tempura soba {{is more expensive}} than other ingredients. So, shrimp-tempura-soba is also called 'Jo-tempura soba' (lit. upper class tempura-soba) or 'Ebiten-soba'. And just like Tendon, tensoba uses many kind of vegetable or seafood tempura, or kakiage (lit. scratch tempura, using plural ingredients mixture of vegetable bits and/or seafood bits).|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Tongoy's residents work seasonally, during the heavy tourist trade period occurring annually between January and February. Another large source of local employment {{is in the}} seafood factories which package and export a variety of fish and shellfish products, chiefly using sole, turbot, eastern oyster and macha (Mesodesma donacium a <b>surf</b> <b>clam</b> peculiar to Chile). The agro-industrial sector is concentrated in the Hacienda el Tangue area of Tongoy (250 inhabitants), next {{to the village of}} Puerto Aldea (50 inhabitants).|$|E
50|$|The {{waters of}} the bay contain several species of annelids and 29 species of diatoms. The {{dominant}} mollusks are dwarf <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> and Capitella capitata. The serpulid worm reefs are inhabited by crustaceans, polychaetes and mollusks. Invertebrates are represented by the endemic fiddler crab species Uca subcylindrica, which reside on dry soil, more than 20 meters from bay waters. The bay is a popular destination for recreational angling and {{is famous for its}} trophy spotted seatrout. Other species include cowfish, threadfin shad (in low salinity periods), pompano, black drum and burrowing goby, etc.|$|R
50|$|Hunt {{regularly}} spent summers {{working at}} the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, which was popular with scientists for its advanced summer courses, and in particular, with those interested {{in the study of}} mitosis. The location provided a ready supply of <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> and sea urchins amongst the reefs and fishing docks, and it was these invertebrates that were particularly useful {{for the study of the}} synthesis of proteins in embryogenesis, as the embryos were simply generated with the application of filtered sea water, and the transparency of the embryo cells was well suited to microscopic study.|$|R
40|$|Both {{calcined}} shell calcium, {{which was}} recently {{reported to have}} bactericidal effects on Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococ-cus aureus, and calcium oxide, which is the main com-ponent in calcined shell calcium, were examined as a bactericide against Legionella species. A calcined shell calcium solution of 0. 025 % or above reduced L. pneumophila counts from the original 7. 0 × 106 CFU/ ml to less than 300 CFU/ml after an incubation period of 1 hr. In water samples taken from the cooling tower of a prefabricated house, a calcined shell calcium so-lution of 0. 05 % or above reduced L. pneumophila counts to less than 10 CFU/ml after an incubation pe-riod of 1 hr. There {{was no difference between}} the bac-tericidal effects of the calcined shell calcium manufac-tured from the shells of <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> and that manufac-tured from oysters; <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> and oysters are equally effective. Calcium oxide also showed similar bacteri-cidal effects against L. pneumophila, and thus we be-lieve that the effect is not specific to calcined shell cal-cium, but rather to effects caused by the alkalinity of calcium oxide. The use of calcium oxide or calcined shell calcium as a bactericidal agent against Legionella species in the cooling tower water of hotels or other buildings is therefore expected.

50|$|Ovalipes ocellatus is {{a species}} of crab from eastern North America. It is most {{commonly}} known as the Lady Crab. Other names for it include the Leopard Crab or Atlantic Leopard Crab due to the leopard-like rosette patterns on its shell, the Calico Crab (not to be confused with Hepatus epheliticus), or Ocellated Crab. It has a shell 3 in long and only slightly wider, which is covered in clusters of purple spots. It occurs from Canada to Georgia, and lives mainly on molluscs, such as the Atlantic <b>surf</b> <b>clam.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Research in 2006 {{indicated}} that centrosomes from <b>surf</b> <b>clam</b> eggs contain RNA sequences. The sequences identified {{were found in}} [...] "few to no" [...] {{other places in the}} cell, and do not appear in existing genome databases. One identified RNA sequence contains a putative RNA polymerase, leading to the hypothesis of an RNA based genome within the centrosome. However, subsequent research has shown that centrosome do not contain their own DNA-based genomes. While it was confirmed that RNA molecules associate with centrosomes, the sequences have still been found within the nucleus. Furthermore, centrosomes can form de novo after having been removed (e.g. by laser irradiation) from normal cells.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater {{shellfish}} were {{a staple}} in the diet of the people inhabiting Mount Taylor sites in the St. Johns River valley. Up to 99% {{of the volume of}} many Mount Taylor period middens consists of snail shells (including river snails and apple snails). Freshwater mussels were also consumed, and mussel shells are the primary component of some Mount Taylor middens. The snail shells deposited in individual Mount Taylor middens decreased in size over time, indicating that consumption outpaced natural increase. The communities probably relocated to new sites when the size of harvested snails dropped too low. Coastal sites related to the Mount Taylor period have middens consisting primarily of oyster and coquina shells, with some dwarf <b>surf</b> <b>clam</b> shells.|$|E
50|$|Within {{ten years}} of its {{founding}} in 1976, Clearwater had grown {{into one of the}} largest international food fish businesses by specializing in high return products including scallops, lobster, clams, coldwater shrimp and crab, which it air-freights around the world. It is the largest holder of rights in Canada for each of these shellfish species and by 2008, it owned the rights to all offshore lobster fished in offshore Atlantic Canadian waters and all Arctic <b>surf</b> <b>clams.</b> By 2008, the fleet included ten factory freezers (the largest such fleet in Canada) and the entire international fleet totalled 21 vessels. Its Argentinian fleet fishes Antarctic scallop.|$|R
5000|$|Shell {{rings in}} the United States may form a {{complete}} ring, or be open, C-shaped, or U- or horseshoe-shaped. They may form a nearly perfect circle, or an oval. In almost all cases, the central area or [...] "plaza" [...] contains {{little or no}} shell or occupational debris. Most shell rings in the United States consist primarily of oyster shells, but may include periwinkles, razor clams, whelks, ribbed mussels, hard-shelled clams (quahogs), and blue and stone crab claws and shell bits. The Common orient clam {{is the most common}} component in shell mounds in Japan. Other shells found in Japanese mounds include those of sea snails, <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> (Mactra veneriformes), and Japanese littleneck clams (Tapes japonica).|$|R
40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of two sympatric <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> Donax marincovichi Coan, 1983 and Donax obesulus Reeve, 1854, inhabiting the coastal Humboldt Current Upwelling System is revisited. Because both species are exploited by artisanal fisheries, {{it is essential}} to verify that they are indeed distinct species that have to be managed separately. In this study, both taxa were sampled across their shared distributional area and specimens were indentified according to their respective morphological characteristics. Although width/height and height/length ratios revealed significant differences within sampling areas, the two morphotypes were frequently incongruent for taxonomically important morphometric parameters. In addition, they showed no significant mitochondrial genetic differentiation within or among populations and exhibited indistinguishable sperm ultrastructure. We conclude that the two morphotypes do not represent distinct species and should be included together under D. obesulus...|$|R
50|$|Dosinia anus, {{common names}} the ringed dosinia, coarse dosinia, coarse biscuit shell, and Tuangi-haruru in the Māori language, is {{a species of}} {{saltwater}} clam, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Veneridae, the venus clams. This species is common to both of the main islands of New Zealand, where {{it is the largest}} and heaviest species in the genus, occasionally exceeding 80mm in diameter. It buries itself in clean fine sandy substrata, sub-tidally down to 15m deep.An investigation into a potential <b>surf</b> <b>clam</b> fishery found this species to be the most abundant 'surf clam' (an informal grouping based on habitat) in the North Island, being replaced by members of the Mactridae in more southerly latitudes.|$|E
50|$|Seafood in the United States {{originated}} with the Native Americans, who often ate cod, lemon sole, flounder, herring, halibut, sturgeon, smelt, drum on the East Coast, and olachen and salmon on the West Coast. Whale was hunted by Native Americans off the Northwest coast, especially by the Makah, {{and used for}} their meat and oil. Seal and walrus were also eaten, in addition to eel from New York's Finger Lakes region. Catfish was also popular among native peoples, including the Modocs. Crustacean included shrimp, lobster, crayfish, and dungeness crabs in the Northwest and blue crabs in the East. Other shellfish include abalone and geoduck on the West Coast, while on the East Coast the <b>surf</b> <b>clam,</b> quahog, and the soft-shell clam. Oysters were eaten on both shores, as were mussels and periwinkles.|$|E
50|$|The {{animals that}} often are found {{living in the}} surf zone are crabs, clams, and snails. Surf clams and mole crabs are two species that stand out as {{inhabitants}} of the surf zone. Both of these animals are very fast burrowers. The <b>surf</b> <b>clam,</b> {{also known as the}} variable coquina, is a filter feeder that uses its gills to filter microalgae, tiny zooplankton, and small particulates out of seawater. The mole crab is a suspension feeder that eats by capturing zooplankton with its antennae. All of these creatures burrow down into the sand to escape from being pulled into the ocean from the tides and waves. They also burrow themselves in the sand to protect themselves from predators. The surf zone is full of nutrients, oxygen, and sunlight which leaves the zone very productive with animal life.|$|E
50|$|Bones {{recovered}} in the excavation included 74 {{species of fish}} and shellfish, but only eight species of land animals. Oysters were the most common food consumed. Other shellfish included quahogs, <b>surf</b> <b>clams,</b> scallops, whelks and conchs. The large number of fish bones recovered allowed for a detailed analysis. Almost all of the fish were small and of the same size. The archaeologists theorize that the fish were caught in nets with a mesh size of about 1/4 inch. As the nets {{would have had to}} be pulled by hand, bigger fish {{would have been able to}} escape by leaping over the net or swimming away before the net was closed. Carbonized plant seeds were found in hearths and living areas. These included the tiny seeds of a panicoid grass, and sea grape, cocoplum, prickly pear and wild grape.|$|R
50|$|Shell {{sculpture}} {{tends to}} be primarily concentric, but radial and divaricating ornamentation (see Gafrarium), and rarely spines (Pitar lupanaria for example) occur on some. One small subfamily, the Samarangiinae, is created for a unique and rare clam found in coral reefs with an outer covering of cemented sand or mud that texturally camouflages it while enhancing {{the thickness of the}} shell. Several venerid clams have overall shell shapes adapted to their environments. Tivela species, for example, have the triangular outline of the <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> in other bivalve families, and occur often in surf zones. Some Dosinia species are almost disc-like in shape and reminiscent of lucinid bivalves; both types of circular bivalves tend to burrow relatively deeply into the sediment. Further reclassification is to be expected as the results of current research in molecular systematics on the group appear in the literature.|$|R
40|$|Growth of the Atlantic surfclam, Spisula solidissima solidissima, was {{compared}} with that of the southern Atlantic surfclam, Spisula solidissima similis. All experimental animals were reared in upweller units at 20 °C and fed cultured algae on a daily basis. Over the 14 wk of the study, the Atlantic <b>surf</b> <b>clams</b> grew markedly better (8. 9 -mm increase in shell length and a 1, 103 % increase in biomass) than the southern Atlantic surfclams (6. 6 -mm increase in shell length and 573 % mcrease in biomass). Mortality for both groups was negligible. The mean shell lengths attained for the Atlantic surfclams (15. 3 mm) and the southern Atlantic surfclams (13 mm) {{at the conclusion of the}} study were large enough to ensure good growth and survival on relocation to a field growout environment. The growth patterns obtained under similm growth conditions further highlight some basic life history differences between these subspecies, which were apparent from other studies.
