40|$|A {{persistent}} {{feature of}} the Southern Hemisphere upper-level time-mean flow {{is the presence of}} a split jet across the South Pacific east of Australia during the austral winter. The split jet is composed of the subtropical jet (STJ) on its equatorward branch and the polar front jet (PFJ) on its poleward branch. The NCEP-NCAR reanalysis is used to investigate the structure and evolution of the split jet. Results show that the presence/absence of the PFJ determines the degree of split flow, given that the STJ is a quasi-steady feature. A <b>split-flow</b> index (SFI) is developed to quantify the variability of the split jet, in which negative values represent strong split flow and positive values nonsplit flow. Correlations with teleconnection indices are investigated, with the SFI positively correlated to the Southern Oscillation index and negatively correlated to the Antarctic oscillation. The SFI is used to construct composites of heights, temperature, and wind for <b>split-flow</b> and non-split-flow days. The composites reveal that relatively cold conditions occur in the South Pacific in association with non-split-flow regimes, and <b>split-flow</b> regimes occur when relatively warm conditions prevail. In the latter situation cold air bottled up over Antarctica helps to augment the background tropospheric thickness gradient between Antarctica and the lower latitudes with a resulting increase in the thermal wind and the PFJ. It is surmised that frequent cold surges out of Antarctica moving into the South Pacific are associated with non-split-flow regimes. In this context, the variability of the split jet responds to large-scale baroclinic processes and is further modulated by synoptic-scale disturbances...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{metastability}} of the Southern Hemisphere 500 -hPa circulation {{are examined}} using both cluster analysis techniques and <b>split-flow</b> blocking indices. The cluster methodology is a purely data-driven approach for parameterization whereby a multiscale approximation to nonstationary dynamical processes is achieved through optimal sequences of locally stationary fast vector autoregressive factor (VARX) processes and some slow (or persistent) hidden process switching between them. Comparison {{is made with}} blocking indices commonly used in weather forecasting and climate analysis to identify dynamically relevant metastable regimes in the 500 -hPa circulation in both reanalysis and Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) datasets. The analysis characterizes the metastable regime in both reanalysis and model datasets prior to 1978 as positive and negative phases of a hemispheric midlatitude blocking state with the southern annular mode (SAM) associated with a transition state. Post- 1978, the SAM emerges as a true metastable state replacing the negative phase of the hemispheric blocking pattern. The hidden state frequency of occurrences exhibits strong trends. The blocking pattern dominates in the early 1980 s, and then gradually decreases. There is a corresponding increase in the SAM frequency of occurrence. This trend is largely evident in the reanalysis summer and spring but was not evident in the AMIP dataset. Further comparison with the <b>split-flow</b> blocking indices reveals a superficial correspondence between the cluster hidden state frequency of occurrences and <b>split-flow</b> indices. Examination of composite states shows that the blocking indices capture splitting of the zonal flow whereas the cluster composites reflect coherent block formation.

40|$|Abstract. The leading mode of wintertime {{variability}} in Northern Hemisphere sea level pressure (SLP) is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). It is usually obtained using linear principal component analysis, which produces the optimal, although somewhat restrictive, linear approximation to the SLP data. Here {{we use a}} recently introduced nonlinear principal com-ponent analysis to nd the optimal nonlinear approxima-tion to SLP data produced by a 1001 year integration of the CCCma coupled general circulation model (CGCM 1). This approximation’s associated time series is strongly bimodal and partitions the data into two distinct regimes. The rst and more persistent regime describes a standing oscillation whose signature in the mid-troposphere is alternating am-pli cation and attenuation of the climatological ridge over Northern Europe, with associated decreasing and increasing daily variance over Northern Eurasia. The second and more episodic regime describes a <b>split-flow</b> south of Greenland with much enhanced daily variance in the Arctic. In a 500 year integration with atmospheric CO 2 stabilized at concen-trations projected for year 2100, the occupation statistics of these preferred modes of variability change, such that the episodic <b>split-flow</b> regime occurs less frequently while the standing oscillation regime occurs more frequently. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{high heat}} {{transfer}} coefficients in microchannels are attractive for direct cooling of computer chips requiring high heat-flux removal. However, the high heat removal capability of microchannels {{is associated with}} a severe pressure drop penalty. Channel size optimization therefore becomes necessary in selecting an appropriate channel geometry configuration. As the heat flux increases beyond about 2 MW/m 2, the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of the plain channels dictate the use of turbulent flow through the channels, which suffers from an excessive pressure drop penalty. It therefore becomes essential to incorporate enhancement features in the microchannels and multiple passes with shorter flow lengths to provide the desired solution. Results obtained from a theoretical analysis are presented as parametric plots for the heat transfer and pressure drop performance of a 10 × 10 - 3 m × 10 × 10 - 3 m (10 mm x 10 mm) silicon chip incorporating plain microchannels. The enhanced microchannels with offset strip fins in single-pass and <b>split-flow</b> arrangements are also investigated.

Chem. 79 (2007) 2266], and a dual-oven GC×GC instrument. The column combination employed consisted of a polar 30 m× 0. 25 mm ID column connected, by means of a T union, to a detector-linked high-resolution 1. 1 m× 0. 05 mm ID apolar analytical column and to a 0. 33 m× 0. 05 mm ID retention gap; the latterwas connected to a manually operated split valve.

40|$|Recovery of {{elemental}} sulfur {{from industrial}} waste gases {{is an important}} problem both from environmental and economic perspectives. The most widely used process is the Claus process, where one-third of the acid gas is oxidized to SO 2 in a reaction furnace using air. This combustion generates {{a large amount of}} heat. Further, the combustion products undergo Claus reaction between H 2 S and SO 2. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a simple-to-use predictive tool suitable for combustion engineers, which is easier than existing approaches less complicated with fewer computations for predicting the theoretical flame temperature for both straight-through operation and for a <b>split-flow</b> operation with two-thirds of the acid gas bypassing the combustion section.

The proposed method is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly for various cases. This proposed simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for engineers and scientists to have a quick check on theoretical flame temperature for both straight-through operations as well as for a <b>split-flow</b> operation for a wide range of operating conditions without the necessity of any pilot plant set up and experimental trials.

By comparing with combined sewer overflows (CSOs), the paper thinks that urban rainwater runoff pollution control is necessary. Four months road runoff and Combined Sewer Overflows quality monitoring was carried in Luoyang, where indices included suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand(cr COD), dissolved chemical oxygen demand, Ammonia nitrogen (NNH − 3) and total phosphorus(TP).

Concentrations of pollutants in initial flush were very high, but they descended gradually and approached to the stabilization after a period of flushing.

Recently, the quadrupole magnetic flow sorter (QMS) has been reported in the literature as another family of SPLITT fractionation device.

Possible causes such as hydrodynamic lift force, high particle concentration and imperfect geometries have been extensively examined. However, the effects of flow development regions and fringing magnetic force field at the separation channel inlet and outlet, which are ignored by the theory, have not been investigated. The error introduced by ignoring these effects need to be rigorously studied so that the theory can be used to optimise operation flow rates with confidence.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} {{atmosphere}} is increasing rapidly which leads to serious climate damage if nothing is done to address this situation. This thesis evaluates the application of carbon capture to process industries to reduce emissions and decrease the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The main focus is on partial carbon capture where waste heat or heat surplus is used to run the capture process leading to a lower capture rate but simultaneously the costs are reduced since no additional heat supply is needed. The carbon capture processes are simulated using Aspen Plus where a standard set-up is first compared to an advanced <b>split-flow</b> configuration regarding the energy consumption. For both process designs a sensitivity analysis is conducted focusing on different parameters to optimize the carbon capture process. For comparison two different solvents, MEA and piperazine, are used for the sensitivity analysis of these two process configuration. The optimized process design of the <b>split-flow</b> configuration using MEA as a solvent is used to investigate different partial capture cases. These investigated cases are applied to an existing industrial case, a pulp mill. Two stacks of the pulp mill can be used to capture CO 2 from, the recovery boiler and the lime kiln. In the recovery boiler steam is produced which is primary used to satisfy the need of the pulping process, but there is a heat surplus which can be used to produce electricity or to run the capture process. First it is investigated how much CO 2 can be captured from the two stacks by using this heat surplus instead of producing electricity. The electricity loss per unit of CO 2 captured was determined for different cases. The electricity loss is investigated for the case where CO 2 is only captured from one of the two stacks and a case where CO 2 is captured from both stacks always using only the steam available.. In cooperation with an external partner, cost estimations for different partial capture cases, applied to the pulp mill, are conducted. First full scale capture, where the capture rate is 90 %, was applied to both stacks. For the second case, the capture rate is decreased to 75 % having partial capture and the third case uses partial capture where the flue gas flow is decreased to 75 %.

The conditions used for GC analyses were the following: (1) initial temperature of 40  °C for 5  min; (2) to 250  °C at a 3  °C/min rate; 3. isothermal for 20  min. The total GC run time was 95  min. Helium was the carrier gas at 1.5  mL/min with a <b>split-flow</b> of 30  mL/min. The inlet-line temperature of the GC–MS system was set at 280  °C, while that of the MS source at 180  °C. A solvent delay time of 5  min was applied before acquisition of the mass spectra to prevent filament injuries. Low and high m/z limits of mass spectrometer were set at 50 and 400 amu, respectively. A NIST mass spectral library version 1.7 was used for peak identification. Each GC–MS analysis was done in duplicate and quantitative results obtained by GC–MS were weight-averaged to provide experimental error. The relative standard deviation never exceeded 4  %.|$|E
40|$|This study {{establishes}} {{a set of}} magnetics-based tools that have been integrated with microfluidic systems. The overall impact of the work begins to enable the rapid and efficient manipulation and detection of magnetic entities such as particles, picoliter-sized droplets, or bacterial cells. Details of design, fabrication, and theoretical and experimental assessments are presented. The manipulation strategy has been demonstrated in the format of a particle diverter, whereby micron-sized particles are actively directed into desired flow channels at a <b>split-flow</b> junction by means of integrated microelectromagnets. Magnetic detection has been realized by deploying Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors [...] microfabricated structures originally developed for use as readout elements in computer hard-drives. We successfully transferred the GMR technology to the lab-on-a-chip arena, and demonstrated the versatility of the concept in several important areas: real-time, integrated monitoring of the properties of multiphase droplet flows; rapid quantitative determination of the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles in droplets of ferrofluids; and high-speed detection of individual magnetic microparticles and magnetotactic bacteria. The study also includes novel schemes for hydrodynamic flow focusing that work in conjunction with GMR-based detection to ensure precise navigation of the sample stream through the GMR detection volume, therefore effectively establishing a novel concept of a microfabricated magnetic flow cytometer...|$|E
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{model for}} a radial inflow turbine has been developed for super-critical carbon dioxide (S-CO{sub 2 }) Brayton cycle applications. The model accounts for the main phenomena present in the volute, nozzle, and impeller of a single-stage turbine. These phenomena include internal losses due to friction, blade loading, and angle of incidence and parasitic losses due to windage and blade-housing leakage. The model has been added as a component to the G-PASS plant systems code. The model was developed to support the analysis of S-CO{sub 2 } cycles in conjunction with small-scale loop experiments. Such loops operate at less than a MWt thermal input. Their size permits components to be reconfigured in new arrangements relatively easily and economically. However, the small thermal input combined with the properties of carbon dioxide lead to turbomachines with impeller diameters of only one to two inches. At these sizes the dominant phenomena differ from those in larger more typical machines. There is almost no treatment {{in the literature of}} turbomachines at these sizes. The present work therefore is aimed at developing turbomachine models that support the task of S-CO{sub 2 } cycle analysis using small-scale tests. Model predictions were compared against data from an experiment performed for Sandia National Laboratories in the <b>split-flow</b> Brayton cycle loop currently located at Barber-Nichols Inc. The <b>split-flow</b> loop incorporates two turbo-alternator-compressor (TAC) units each incorporating a radial inflow turbine and a radial flow compressor on a common shaft. The predicted thermodynamic conditions at the outlet of the turbine on the main compressor shaft were compared with measured values at different shaft speeds. Two modifications to the original model were needed to better match the experiment data. First, a representation of the heat loss from the volute downstream of the sensed inlet temperature was added. Second, an empirical multiplicative factor was applied to the Euler head and another to the head loss to bring the predicted outlet pressure into better agreement with the experiment. These changes also brought the overall efficiency of the turbine into agreement with values cited by Barber Nichols for small turbines. More generally, the quality of measurement set data can in the future be improved by additional steps taken in the design and operation of the experimental apparatus. First, a thermocouple mounted at the nozzle inlet would provide a better indication of temperature at this key point. Second, heat losses from the turbine should be measured directly. Allowing the impeller to free wheel at inlet conditions and measuring the temperature drop between inlet and outlet would provide a more accurate measure of heat loss. Finally, the enthalpy change during operation is more accurately obtained by measuring the torque on the stator using strain gauges rather than by measuring pressure and temperature at inlet and outlet to infer thermodynamic states...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of flow {{characteristics}} of microchannel heat sink (MCHS) {{is a prerequisite}} for its design. Performance optimization via accurate design of manifold zone and subsequent reduction of the flow maldistribution (MLD) remains challenging. This communication critically evaluates the effects of manifold zone related geometrical parameters including inlet-outlet flow arrangement, design and shape on the hydrothermal performance of MCHS in terms of flow mal-distribution. It is demonstrated that <b>split-flow</b> strategy has {{a significant impact on the}} hydrothermal performance enhancement. I-type flow feed with vertical inlet and outlet reveals improved flow distribution than horizontal supply. Furthermore, the reverse flow arrangement of C-type performs better than parallel flow arrangement of Z-type. It is affirmed that for reduced flow MLD the channel area must be smaller than manifold region. Meanwhile, the enlargement of combining manifold region is discerned to improve the flow uniformity. For I-type manifolds with vertical feeding, the rectangular configuration produces better normal flow distribution. Conversely, for axial feeding, the manifold shape alteration is essential to reduce the incoming jet flow. For Z-type manifolds, symmetrical triangular geometry generates superior flow distribution. In the case of a C-type manifold, both dividing triangular shape as well as combining trapezoidal configuration creates better flow distribution. This informative review article is hoped to serve as taxonomy for navigating and understanding the research advancements towards the manifold zone parameters dependent hydrothermal performance of MCHS...|$|E
