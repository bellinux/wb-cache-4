Acetic and <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydrides,</b> neutralizing or converting ammonium groups into negatively charged groups, respectively, had little influence on the water contact angle of the Streptococcus salivarius HB, but acetic anhydride modification reduced the water contact angle of the slightly more hydrophobic Streptococcus oralis 34 from 74 to 58 degrees. This reduction in water contact angle was accompanied by a more negatively charged cell surface, as inferred from particulate microelectrophoresis and a decrease in the amount of nitrogen-rich surface groups, detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Carbodiimide followed by ethanolamine or ethylenediamine, compensating negatively charged carboxylate groups, slightly increased the water contact angles on the hydrophobic S. oralis 34, but strongly increased the water contact angle on S. salivarius HB by 32 degrees on average. Simultaneously, both strains became positively charged over the pH range from 2 to 9 and more nitrogen-rich groups were detected on the cell surfaces at the expense of oxygen-rich groups. Adhesion to hexadecane of the streptococcal strains was hardly affected by anhydride modifications, but both strains adhered better to hexadecane after ethanolamine or ethylenediamine modifications, especially at elevated pH values due to electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged hexadecane and the positively charged cell surfaces. This study shows that physico-chemical cell surface properties of streptococci can be chemically modified to stimulate their adhesion to surfaces. (C) 2001 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|Alkyl ketene dimers (AKD) are {{effective}} and highly hydrophobic sizing agents for the internal sizing of alkaline papers, {{but in some}} cases they may form deposits on paper machines and copiers. In addition, alkenyl <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> (ASA) - based sizing agents are highly reactive, producing on-machine sizing, but under uncontrolled wet end conditions the hydrolysis of ASA may cause problems. This thesis aims at developing an improved ketene dimer based sizing agent that would have a lower deposit formation tendency on paper machines and copiers than a traditional type of AKD. The aim is also to improve the ink jet printability of a AKD sized paper. The sizing characteristics ofketene dimers have been compared to those of ASA. A lower tendency of ketene dimer deposit formation was shown in paper machine trials and in printability tests when branched fatty acids were used in the manufacture of a ketene dimer basedsizing agent. Fitting the melting and solidification temperature of a ketene dimer size to the process temperature of a paper machine or a copier contributes to machine cleanliness. A lower hydrophobicity of the paper sized with branched ketene dimer compared to the paper sized with traditional AKD was discovered. However, the ink jet print quality could be improved by the use of a branched ketene dimer. The branched ketene dimer helps in balancing the paper hydrophobicity for both black and color printing. The use of a high amount of protective colloidin the emulsification was considered to be useful for the sizing performance ofthe liquid type of sizing agents. Similar findings were indicated for both the branched ketene dimer and ASA...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersion}} of nanostructured materials into liquid and solid matrices {{is an old}} challenge {{in the field of}} material sciences. In order to exploit the properties of nanoparticles or nanotubular structures they must be homogeneously distributed into the final material. The present thesis is part of a significant work devoted to the preparation of new surfactants and functional polymers for the dispersion in different media of carbon-based and metal-based functional and nanostructured materials. More specifically, chemical modification of species able to stabilize nanostructures is carried out for the realization of nanocomposites with smart features. To this aim, different organic low and high molecular weight surfactants are investigated. The first part of this work aims to investigate the use of a functionalized ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) as a polymeric dispersant for pristine or chemically-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The soft covalent approach allows higher compatibility with the polymer matrix and superior properties in terms of electric conductance. Spectroscopic, thermo-mechanical and morphological studies are carried out to evaluate the nanocomposite properties and their final applications as innovative stress-strain sensors. The second part of this work investigates the synthesis of low molecular weight surfactants for MWCNTs dispersion. In particular, two different perylene bisimides derivatives are synthetized and their dispersions with MWCNTs in different solvents investigated by Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis in order to explore the ability of π-π stacking interactions and effective electrostatic repulsion to promote nanotubes exfoliation and stabilization in different media. Solid mixtures are eventually studied as nanostructured and cost-effective temperature sensors.

Amphiphilic polymers are macromolecules that simultaneously contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. These molecules not only attract much attention in academic research but also are important materials in industry. Application areas include detergency, oil field, paints, agriculture, food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutics. This dissertation highlights my efforts since the November of 2007 on three separate systems of amphiphilic polymers, which addresses both the fundamental self-assembly behavior in solution and applications in pharmaceutical formulation. Chapter 2 describes the self-assembled micelles in water that contain semicrystalline polyethylene (PE) as the core-forming material. Poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) -polyethylene (AE) diblock copolymers were {{chosen as the}} model system. An AE diblock copolymer with relatively low PE composition resulted in micelles with oblate ellipsoidal cores in water, in which crystalline PE existed as flat disks at the center and rubbery PE resided on both sides. In contrast, a control sample with a rubbery polyolefin as the hydrophobic component resulted in micelles with spherical cores in water. The morphology transition was ascribed to the crystallization of PE. The heat-assisted direct dissolution for sample preparation {{was identified as a}} stepwise "micellization-crystallization" procedure. In addition, the morphology of the aggregates exhibited much dependence on the composition of AE copolymers, and wormlike micelles and bilayered vesicles were obtained from samples with relatively high PE compositions. Chapter 3 demonstrates the precise synthesis of glucose-containing diblock terpolymers from a combination of anionic and reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerizations. The resulting micelles exhibited excellent stability in several biologically-relevant media under in vitro conditions, including 100 % fetal bovine serum. These particles may find applications as serum-stable nanocarriers of hydrophobic drugs for intravenous administration.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{molecular}} characterization of maleic anhydride melt-functionalized polypropylene (PP-g-MA). The functionalization mechanism, the nature, the concentration, {{and the location of}} grafted anhydride species onto the polypropylene chain are discussed. The polypropylene functionalization was performed using a pre-heated Brabender Plastograph (190 degrees C, 4 min of mixing time). Several concentrations of maleic anhydride and organic peroxide were used for this study. In those experimental conditions, the organic peroxide undergoes an homolytic rupture and carries out a polypropylene tertiary hydrogen abstraction. The resulting macroradical undergoes a beta-scission leading to a radical chain end which reacts with maleic anhydride. When a termination reaction occurs at this first step a <b>succinic</b> type <b>anhydride</b> chain end is obtained. However, oligomerization of maleic anhydride is found to occur more frequently leading to poly(maleic anhydride) chain end.
