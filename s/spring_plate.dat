40|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} for low-frequency vibration monitoring, {{a new type of}} FBG (fiber Bragg grating) accelerometer with a bended <b>spring</b> <b>plate</b> is proposed. Two symmetrical bended spring plates are used as elastic elements, which drive the FBG to produce axial strains equal in magnitude but opposite in direction when exciting vibrations exist, leading to doubling the wavelength shift of the FBG. The mechanics model and a numerical method are presented in this paper, with which the influence of the structural parameters on the sensitivity and the eigenfrequency are discussed. The test results show that the sensitivity of the accelerometer is more than 1000 pm/g when the frequency is within the 0. 7 – 20 Hz range...|$|E

This thesis explores the {{possibilities}} of using spring and plate reverb, and if they enhance or detract from the experience compared to a realistic natural reverb. Under evaluation, a quantitative study with a secondary qualitative discussion was carried out where participants played a gameplay prototype that switched between using spring reverb, plate reverb and a realistic natural reverb. A survey was answered relating to the gameplay sequence, which {{was used to evaluate}} how players perceived the differences in the different reverbs. The conclusion shows that although spring and plate reverb have different associations and are perceived in a different way compared to a natural realistic reverb, a majority still preferred a natural reverb and felt that <b>spring</b> <b>plate</b> were overall more distracting to the game experience...|$|E

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} (SHM) is challenged by massive data storage pressure and structural fault location. In {{response to these}} issues, a bio-inspired memory model that is embedded with a causality reasoning function is proposed for fault location. First, the SHM data for processing are divided into three temporal memory areas to control data volume reasonably. Second, the inherent potential of the causal relationships in structural state monitoring is mined. Causality and dependence indices are also proposed to establish the mechanism of quantitative description of the reason and result events. Third, a mechanism of causality reasoning is developed for the reason and result events to locate faults in a SHM system. Finally, a deformation experiment conducted on a steel <b>spring</b> <b>plate</b> demonstrates that the proposed model {{can be applied to}} real-time acquisition, compact data storage, and system fault location in a SHM system. Moreover, the model is compared with some typical methods based on an experimental benchmark dataset...|$|E

In this study, 2 model were constructed which included; 1) the vertical metering plate with triangular grooves and 2) the bucket type garlic planter. The uniformity of metering system test for the 2 models, the bucket type garlic planter presented the most impressive results. The percentage of broken was very low, about 0. 23 %. The new prototype garlic planter had 12 rows and was attached to 5 HP power tiller. The garlic planter was tested under actual field conditions at Maetang district, Chiengmai province. The result indicated that the optimum width of garlic planter was 0. 8 meter or 8 rows. The suitable soil condition was dry soil. Farmer should apply water after planting. The maximum forward speed was 2. 63 km/hr and wheel skid was high about 23. 32 %. The average depth and width of planting was 2. 62 cm. and 4. 66 cm. Time for turning at head land was 37 seconds.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPosterior labral tear is {{frequently}} encountered in acetabular fractures with posterior wall component (AFPWC). However, {{there has been}} very little information {{in the literature on}} the type and management of traumatic labral tears in AFPWC. HypothesisTraumatic labral tear is a constant intracapsular injury in AFPWC and can be repaired using adequate methods according to its type and size. Materials and methodsA retrospective study of 14 patients (mean age 38 years [16 – 58]) who underwent open surgery for AFPWC was conducted using prospectively collected data. The types of posterior labral tear were investigated at intraoperative examination through the ruptured joint capsule or its extension, and were concomitantly managed. Surgical outcomes were clinically assessed using Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) score and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and radiologically evaluated at final follow-up. ResultsPosterior labral tears were present in all 14 patients. The types of labral tear were osseous avulsion and posterior root avulsion tear (n= 9), longitudinal peripheral tear and posterior root avulsion tear (n= 2), longitudinal peripheral tear (n= 2), and osseous avulsion tear (n= 1). All unstable labra in 12 patients (86 %) were repaired. All avulsion tears of the posterior root were repaired using a suture anchor, longitudinal peripheral tears using suture fixation or/and suture anchors, and osseous avulsion tears using a <b>spring</b> <b>plate.</b> The mean PMA score and VAS were 16. 4 (14 – 18) and 1. 7 (0 – 3) at final follow-up, respectively. The radiologic grades at last follow-up were good or excellent in all patients. DiscussionAll AFPWC in this study consistently revealed posterior labral tear. Posterior root avulsion tears accompanied with osseous avulsion was the most common type. Torn labra should be repaired as much as possible if unstable, considering the important functions of a normal labrum; fixation using a suture anchor may be useful for an avulsion tear of the posterior root.

50|$|Hydraulic damping is provided, as {{the leaf}} springs are {{immersed}} in oil. Any {{movement of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>plates</b> must squeeze oil through the narrow gaps around them between the plates and the casing. As the springs have a high surface area, yet {{there is only a}} small gap between them and their housing, the damping factor can be high. Damping can be adjusted completely independent from the coupling's torsional stiffness. The oil used for damping is usually supplied by the engine lubrication system, through a drilling in the crankshaft. If this is unavailable, an oil-filled coupling can be used. This oil filling also aids lubrication and encourages a long service life.|$|R

The new combination of localized laser-induced softening {{of the plate}} material in the shearing zone and the shearing process significantly reduces both process forces and process-related noise emissions. Laser-assisted shearing of stainless steel plates (1. 4301, material thickness, 3 mm) and titanium plates (TiAl 6 V 4; material thickness, 3 mm) leads to clear-cut surface ratios of 90 %.

40|$|The {{stability}} of oscillatory flows over compliant surfaces is studied analytically and numerically. The types of compliant surfaces studied are the spring backed wall model, which permits tangential {{motion of the}} surface, and the incompressible viscoelastic gel model. The stability is determined using the Floquet analysis, where amplitude of perturbations at time intervals separated by one time period is examined to determine whether perturbations grow or decay. The oscillatory flows past both the spring backed wall model and the viscoelastic gel model exhibit an instability {{in the limit of}} zero Reynolds number, and the transition amplitude of the oscillatory velocity increases with the frequency of oscillations. The transition amplitude has a minimum at zero wave number for the <b>spring</b> backed <b>plate</b> model, whereas the minimum occurs at finite wavenumber for the viscoelastic gel model. For the <b>spring</b> backed <b>plate</b> model, it is shown that the instability due to steady mean flow and the purely oscillatory instability reinforce each other, and the regions of instability are mapped in the (Λ-A) plane, where Λ is the steady strain rate and A is the oscillatory strain rate. For the viscoelastic gel model, the instability is found to depend strongly on the gel viscosity η_g, and the effect of oscillations on the continuation of viscous modes at intermediate Reynolds number shows a complicated dependence on the oscillation frequency.
