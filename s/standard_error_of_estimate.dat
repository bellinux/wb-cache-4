40|$|A fast-response {{temperature}} sensor for measuring atmospheric temperature was constructed and is described. The sensor {{was based on}} the thermocouple principle, connected to a thermocouple conditioner (AD 595) : the cold junction was compensated via an electrical reference and the signal amplified. This reference compensation was built into the sensor itself. The time constant of the thermocouple was decreased by rolling out a circular wire.

40|$|A new {{mathematical}} method for estimating velocity vectors from color Doppler datasets is proposed to image blood flow dynamics; this method {{has been called}} echodynamography or vector flow mapping (VFM).

VFM captured the gross features of flow structures and produced comparable images of the distribution of vorticity, which correlated significantly with the original field (for velocity magnitudes, <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimate</b> = 0. 003 to 0. 007 m/s; for vorticity, <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimate</b> = 0. 35 to 2. 01 /s).

This model concept is implemented in an extended version of the SWATRE model and tested with data from three lowland raised mires (Engbertdijksvenen, Fochteloerveen (The Netherlands) and Leegmoor (Germany)). The model runs are evaluated by comparing measured and calculated groundwater levels.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{capability}} of the 3 dNX accelerometer to predict energy expenditure in two separate, free-living cohorts. Twenty-three adolescents and 14 young adults took a single dose of doubly labelled water and wore a 3 dNX activity monitor during waking hours for a 10 -day period while carrying out their normal routines. Multiple linear regression with backward elimination was used to establish the strength of the associations between various indices of energy expenditure, physical activity counts, and anthropometric variables. 3 dNX output accounted for 27 % and 35 % of the variance in the total energy expenditure of the adolescent and young adult cohort, respectively.

The 3 dNX accelerometer can be used to predict free-living daily energy expenditure with a <b>standard</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimate</b> of 1. 65 MJ in adolescents and 1. 52 MJ in young adults.
