If the fans saw {{that kind of behavior}} in a football coach, they'd be repelled by it.

It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> takes a certain amount of mental toughness to keep control of your emotions.

60|$|EMILY--[Spitefully.] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it's</b> {{much more}} for Martha's sake, we're urging you than for our own. After all, the town can't say {{anything}} against us.|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't {{say when}} Leeson will be back," [...] put in Darry. [...] "But it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is {{our duty to}} stay here until he returns; don't you think so, Joe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{certainly}} {{up to something}} out of the ordinary," [...] thought Sam. [...] "I wonder if he is fishing? If he is, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is a queer way to go at it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's only {{a little}} of the powder left," [...] {{announced}} Tip, looking within the box." [...] And it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is more important to bring the legs of the sofas to life than the head." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "I was watching Saxton, and {{he kind of}} woke up when Brooke let out about Devine. Now, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> wasn't without a reason he put him on to that survey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} grandmother; [...] "that is a round-about way. But {{it was very}} rough and stony. Presently, Samuel stopped and said, 'Father, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is pretty stony; haven't {{we got out of}} the path?' ...|$|E

6000|$|Madame Merle {{smiled with}} her usual grace. [...] "It's a weighty question--let me think. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> would please your father {{to see a}} careful little {{daughter}} making his tea.
