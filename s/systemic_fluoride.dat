Fluoride supplements may be under-prescribed for children residing in areas where drinking water is derived from wells, {{because of a lack of}} knowledge of dental providers or the effort required to test wells for fluoride before prescribing supplements. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible factors associated with fluoride content of well water in a specific county in Maryland, and to determine whether there is a relationship between the amount of naturally occurring fluoride in the well water and the child's fluoride supplementation use. Methods. This study analyzed the fluoride prescribing behavior and the fluoride content of wells from a sample of 197 Carroll County, Md residents. Those individuals that answered a questionnaire about well depth and use of fluoride supplements subsequently were mailed a water testing kit. Water samples were tested for fluoride using a fluoride specific ion electrode. Derivations of well water supplies (aquifers) were obtained from a county geologist.

40|$|Introduction: Root {{resorption}} {{resulting from}} orthodontic treatment is an unpredictable adverse effect. Literature examining the potential protective influence of tooth cementum minerals against orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption has been sparse. Fluorine {{could have a}} role in minimizing the extent and severity of resorptive lesions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the elemental content of tooth cementum in orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption lesions and the effect of <b>systemic</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Methods: Twenty 7 -week-old Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups of 10 and exposed to <b>systemic</b> <b>fluoride</b> (100 ppm) or nonfluoridated drinking water for 2 weeks. Orthodontic tooth movement was implemented with a nickel-titanitum closing coil with a force of 100 g. The molars were then extracted, dissected, and prepared for cross-sectioning through the largest mesial midroot crater. The samples were mounted and scanned by using the Commo nwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Research Council's National Key for Geochemical Evolution and Metallogeny of Continents Nuclear Microprobe (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical comparison of the elements and to determine the effect of fluoride, and unaffected tooth structure compared with root resorption craters. The Student t test was used to compare root crater lengths and depths of the fluoride vs no-fluoride groups. Results: Root resorption lesions of the group exposed to fluoride were significantly reduced in length and depth (P < 0. 01). The mineral content of the root resorption craters of the fluoride group had higher concentrations of fluorine and zinc (P < 0. 01). There was less calcium in the craters of the no-fluoride group compared with the fluoride group (P < 0. 05).

40|$|School and {{community}} water fluoridation, salt fluoridation, {{and use of}} dietary fluoride supplements have abundant scientific support as effectivecaries-preventive methods.

For countries with most of the population living in cities with communal water supplies, community fluoridation is the most logical approach from the standpoints of cost-effectiveness and total caries-preventive impact.

50|$|All {{fluoridation}} methods, including water fluoridation, create {{low levels}} of fluoride ions in saliva and plaque fluid, thus exerting a topical or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg/L several times during a day. Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls {{the rate at which}} they develop. When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5, a fluorapatite-like remineralized veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be. The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after tooth eruption. Although some <b>systemic</b> (whole-body) <b>fluoride</b> returns to the saliva via blood plasma, and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid, there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms. Also, although fluoride affects the physiology of dental bacteria, its effect on bacterial growth {{does not seem to be}} relevant to cavity prevention.|$|R

However, insufficient information {{is available on the}} effects of fluoride on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which is a novel in vitro humanized model for analyzing the embryotoxicities of chemical compounds. Therefore, we investigated the effects of sodium fluoride (NaF) on the proliferation, differentiation and viability of H 9 hESCs. For the first time, we showed that 1 mM NaF did not significantly affect the proliferation of hESCs but did disturb the gene expression patterns of hESCs during embryoid body (EB) differentiation. Higher doses of NaF (2 mM and above) markedly decreased the viability and proliferation of hESCs. The mode and underlying mechanism of high-dose NaF-induced cell death were further investigated by assessing the sub-cellular morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase activities, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). High-dose NaF caused the death of hESCs via apoptosis in a caspase-mediated but ROS-independent pathway, coupled with an increase in the phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) levels. Pretreatment with a p-JNK-specific inhibitor (SP 600125) could effectively protect hESCs from NaF-induced cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that NaF might interfere with early human embryogenesis by disturbing the specification of the three germ layers as well as osteogenic lineage commitment and that high-dose NaF could cause apoptosis through a JNK-dependent pathway in hESCs...|$|R
40|$|Fluoride was {{introduced}} into dentistry over 70 years ago, {{and it is}} now recognized as the main factor responsible for the dramatic decline in caries prevalence that has been observed worldwide. However, excessive fluoride intake during the period of tooth development can cause dental fluorosis. In order that the maximum benefits of fluoride for caries control can be achieved with the minimum risk of side effects, it is necessary to have a profound understanding of the mechanisms by which fluoride promotes caries control. In the 1980 s, it was established that fluoride controls caries mainly through its topical effect. Fluoride present in low, sustained concentrations (sub-ppm range) in the oral fluids during an acidic challenge is able to absorb {{to the surface of the}} apatite crystals, inhibiting demineralization. When the pH is re-established, traces of fluoride in solution will make it highly supersaturated with respect to fluorhydroxyapatite, which will speed up the process of remineralization. The mineral formed under the nucleating action of the partially dissolved minerals will then preferentially include fluoride and exclude carbonate, rendering the enamel more resistant to future acidic challenges. Topical fluoride can also provide antimicrobial action. Fluoride concentrations as found in dental plaque have biological activity on critical virulence factors of S. mutans in vitro, such as acid production and glucan synthesis, but the in vivo implications of this are still not clear. Evidence also supports <b>fluoride’s</b> <b>systemic</b> mechanism of caries inhibition in pit and fissure surfaces of permanent first molars when it is incorporated into these teeth pre-eruptively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dental caries {{remain a}} public health problem for many {{developing}} countries and for underprivileged populations in developed countries. This paper outlines {{the historical development of}} public health approaches to the use of fluoride and comments on their effectiveness.

In {{the latter half of the}} 20 th century, the focus of research was on fluoride toothpastes and mouth rinses. More recently, systematic reviews summarizing these extensive databases have indicated that water fluoridation and fluoride toothpastes both substantially reduce the prevalence and incidence of dental caries.

40|$|Objectives: Enamel {{formation}} is a vulnerable developmental process, susceptible to environmental influences such as excessive <b>systemic</b> <b>fluoride</b> (F) exposure and infant/childhood disease. This study determined prevalence {{and extent of}} developmental enamel defects (DDE) and dental fluorosis in 8 -year-old Nigerians and explored associations with key predictors. Methods: A sample of 322 healthy 8 -year-olds (155 males, 167 females) from primary schools in lower and higher water F areas of; i) rural and ii) urban parts of Oyo State in south-west Nigeria (n= 4 areas) (in which the mean (SD) F concentration of community water supplies ranged from 0. 07 (0. 02) – 2. 13 (0. 64) mg F/L), were dentally examined using modified DDE (mDDE) and Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) indices. Drinking waters, cooking waters and toothpaste samples were analysed for F concentration using a F-Ion Selective Electrode (F-ISE). Information on infant/childhood diseases, infant feeding and tooth cleaning practices was obtained from parents/legal guardians. Data were analysed using ANOVA, Chi Square tests, Spearman correlation and binary logistic regression as appropriate. Results: Mean (SD) F concentration of actual drinking and actual cooking waters consumed by participants were 0. 25 (0. 20) and 0. 24 (0. 14) mg F/L respectively in the urban higher F area; 1. 11 (1. 00) and 1. 16 (1. 02) mg F/L respectively in the rural higher F area (p< 0. 05). Overall, mouth prevalence of DDE in the permanent dentition was 61. 2...|$|E

Fluorine is the world’s 13 thmost abundant element and constitutes 0. 08 % of the Earth crust. It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, themanufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides {{for the prevention of}} dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1 ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment. Public health approaches for global dental caries reduction that do not involve <b>systemic</b> ingestion of <b>fluoride</b> are urgently needed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Excessive <b>systemic</b> {{exposure}} to <b>fluoride</b> (F) {{can lead to}} disturbances in bone homeostasis and dental enamel development. We have previously shown strain-specific responses to F {{in the development of}} dental fluorosis (DF) and in bone formation/mineralization. The current study was undertaken to further investigate F responsive variations in bone metabolism and to determine possible relationships with DF susceptibility. Seven-week-old male mice from FVB/NJ, C 57 BL/ 6 J, C 3 H/HeJ, A/J, 129 S 1 /SvImJ, AKR/J, DBA/ 2 J, and BALB/cByJ inbred strains were exposed to NaF (0 or 50 ppm as F–) in drinking water for 60 days. Sera were collected for F, Ca, Mg, PO 4, iPTH, sRANKL, and ALP levels. Bone marrow cells were subjected to ex vivo cell culture for osteoclast potential and CFU colony assays (CFU-fibroblast, CFU-osteoblast, CFU-erythrocyte/granulocyte/macrophage/megakaryocyte, CFU-granulocyte/macrophage, CFU-macrophage, and CFU-granulocyte). Femurs and vertebrae were subjected to micro-CT analyses, biomechanical testing, and F, Mg, and Ca content assays. DF was evaluated using quantitative fluorescence and clinical criteria. Strain-specific responses to F were observed for DF, serum studies, ex vivo cell culture studies, and bone quality. Among the strains, there were no patterns or significant correlations between DF severity and the actions of F on bone homeostasis (serum studies, ex vivo assays, or bone quality parameters). The genetic background continues {{to play a role in}} the actions of F on tooth enamel development and bone homeostasis. F exposure led to variable phenotypic responses between strains involving dental enamel development and bone metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : In {{this era}} of {{preventive}} dentistry, many techniques are available for prevention of caries, such as plaque control, use of <b>systemic</b> and local <b>fluorides</b> and pit and fissure sealants. The rationale of pit and fissure sealants is that, when they are applied into the caries prone fissures, they penetrate and seal them from the oral environment. This study aims to correlate {{the relationship between the}} viscosity of the sealant, resin tag length and microleakage. Materials and Methods : 30 third molars were selected for study. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group E: Embrace wetbond, H: Helioseal, G: Guardian seal. Teeth were cleaned with pumice prophylaxis and pretreated with acid etching and bonding agent. The respective pit and fissure sealants were applied. Teeth were placed in 1 % methylene blue dye and sectioned mesio-distally into two halves. These were used to assess the microleakage using stereomicroscope and resin tag length using SEM. Viscosity was assessed using Brooke′s field viscometer. Results : Viscosity was lowest for Embrace wetbond and highest for Guardian seal. Microleakage scores were highest with Guardian seal and lowest with Embrace wetbond. Resin tag lengths were longer with Embrace wetbond as compared to other groups. There is a definite negative correlation between viscosity, resin tag length and microleakage. Lower the viscosity, the longer were the resin tags and the microleakage decreased. Embrace wetbond pit and fissure sealant had lowest viscosity, longest resin tag length and lowest microleakage scores. Conclusion : Embrace wetbond appears to be compatible with residual moisture and ideal for use in children, where isolation is a problem...|$|R
