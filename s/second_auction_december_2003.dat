40|$|This paper models {{sequential}} auctioning of two perfect substitutes by {{a strategic}} seller, who learns about demand from the first-auction price. The seller holds the <b>second</b> <b>auction</b> {{only when the}} remaining demand {{is strong enough to}} cover her opportunity cost. Bidding in anticipation of such a contingent future auction is characterized, including a sufficient condition for existence of an invertible (increasing symmetric pure-strategy) bidding equilibrium that facilitates the seller’s learning. A unique invertible bidding equilibrium exists for the Dutch auction format, but only when the <b>second</b> <b>auction</b> is sufficiently discounted by the bidders. In the equilibrium, high-valuation bidders shade their bids down as if the <b>second</b> <b>auction</b> were guaranteed. To counter such strategic bidding, the seller would value ex-ante commitment to hold the <b>second</b> <b>auction</b> less often. Three forms of such commitment are analyzed: commitment to list future auctions in advance, commitment to not hold the <b>second</b> <b>auction</b> unless the first price exceeds a publicly announced threshold, and commitment to a reserve-price in the <b>second</b> <b>auction...</b>|$|R

The winning bid in the first auction would be the reserve price for the <b>second</b> <b>auction.</b> This auction design gives incentives to ``predatory bidding. " We show how a strategic firm will bid too high in the first auction hence, no other firms can pay the reserve price in the <b>second</b> <b>auction.</b> The winning firm will {{make up for the}} high-bid in terms of more profit due to less competition in the market.
