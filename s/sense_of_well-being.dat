5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b>|$|E

25|$|Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, {{relational}} intervention used {{by trained}} psychotherapists to aid s in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>well-being</b> and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ {{a range of}} techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and {{that are designed to}} improve the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, art, drama, narrative story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} {{researchers}} from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine led by Griffiths {{conducted a study}} to assess the immediate and long-term psychological effects of the psilocybin experience, using {{a modified version of}} the mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double-blind procedure. When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary's, Griffiths explained the difference: [...] "We are conducting rigorous, systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions, a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s." [...] The National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate (Ritalin) in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood; 61% of subjects reported a [...] "complete mystical experience" [...] after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b> About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme [...] "experience of fear" [...] or dysphoria (i.e., a [...] "bad trip") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>well-being.</b>|$|E

Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy {{as one of the few}} Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he [...] "must have seen the picture thirty or forty times.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Counseling Psychology, 2010 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} between enculturation, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence, and psychological well-being in American Indians. Thirty-six participants completed anonymous, pencil-and-paper questionnaires assessing each of the three variables under study. Three hypotheses were predicted and tested using Pearson???s product moment correlations: 1) enculturation and well-being would be positively correlated; 2) enculturation and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence would be positively correlated, and 3) a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence and <b>well-being</b> would be positively correlated. A fourth hypothesis was proposed stating that if the first three hypotheses were supported a regression analysis would be conducted to determine if a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence mediated the relationship between enculturation and well-being. The correlational analyses did not support hypotheses one and two but did support hypothesis three. <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence and psychological well-being had a strong, significant, positive correlation. The regression analysis was not conducted to test hypothesis four because of the nonsignificant results found for hypotheses one and two. It was concluded that enculturation may not be an important construct in determining a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> in American Indians but that a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence may be, and that future research is needed...|$|R

40|$|Since 1997 and the {{accession}} of New Labour to Government, area-based regeneration programmes {{have been}} undertaken to alleviate multiple deprivation within inner-city areas. Improvements and positive change {{was to be}} achieved through the implementation of Urban Regeneration Companies, who were responsible for establishing a regeneration framework for the area and overseeing its implementation. This thesis undertook a multi-methods approach to understanding how regeneration practice has impacted upon <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>well-being</b> amongst local residents living within an area of regeneration in the North-West of England. The research incorporated both a pragmatic and participatory approach to the research, drawing upon visual methods to capture the experiences of local residents, alongside more traditional research approaches, including participant observations {{in the community and}} semi-structured interviews with residents and regeneration professionals. Fieldwork was conducted over an 18 - month period between 2006 and 2008, during which I undertook a 12 -month placement at an Urban Regeneration Company in the North-West of England. The findings from the study identified a disconnect between how local residents experienced notions <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>well-being</b> and that articulated by the professional community through regeneration practice. Local residents discussed a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place-well-being dynamic, identifying the importance of third places within the community and reflecting upon their deep rooted attachment to home. Physical transformation brought about by regeneration professionals had the potential to undermine this <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place-well-being dynamic, challenging local residents' claims to space and resulting in the alienation of local residents in the place- making process. A stakeholder event was facilitated {{at the end of the}} research to engage the professional and resident community in a process of active dialogue and shared visioning. The outcome was a series of recommendations for changes to regeneration practice and policy that need to be implemented if regeneration is to situate notions <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and <b>well-being</b> within the change process and to ensure that local residents are involved in the place-making agenda. In capturing and bringing together the perspectives of both the resident and professional community within a single regeneration programme, the research makes a unique contribution to the field <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place, <b>well-being</b> and urban regeneration practice.

40|$|Background: Research has not {{adequately}} {{focused on the}} issue of burnout in Psychiatric nurses, {{despite the fact that they}} suffer considerable stress in their work. Till date no study has been conducted on burnout among psychiatric nurses in India. Further, there is a particular lack of research in internal variables predicting burnout in them. Aims: To determine whether there are any internal psychological factors relevant to burnout in psychiatric nurses in India. Materials and Methods: We recruited 101 psychiatric nurses scoring less than two in General Health Questionnaire, version 12 (GHQ- 12) from two psychiatric hospitals after obtaining informed consent. All subjects filled up a sociodemographic data sheet along with global adjustment scale, emotional maturity scale, PGI general <b>well-being</b> scale, locus <b>of</b> control scale, and Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI). Correlations between burnout and sociodemographic/clinical variables were done by Pearson′s r or Spearman′s rho. Signi ficant variables were entered in a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis with total burnout score as dependent variable. Results: Age, duration of total period of nursing, prior military training, locus <b>of</b> control, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> general <b>well-being,</b> adjustment capabilities, and emotional maturity had significant relation with burnout. Of them, emotional maturity was the most significant protective factors against burnout along with adjustment capabilities, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>well-being,</b> and military training in decreasing significance. Together they explained 41 % variation in total burnout score which is significant at < 0. 001 level. An internal locus of control was inversely correlated with burnout, but failed to predict it in regression analysis. Conclusion: Emotional maturity, adjustability, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> general physical <b>well-being</b> as well as prior military training significantly predicted lower burnout. Of them, emotional maturity was the most important predictor. Internal locus of control was also correlated with lower burnout...|$|R
