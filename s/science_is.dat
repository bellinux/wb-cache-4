5|$|According to Kuhn, <b>science</b> <b>is</b> an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, <b>science</b> <b>is</b> socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and <b>science</b> <b>is</b> weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

5|$|Before and After <b>Science</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} studio album by British {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, {{it was originally}} released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany helped with the album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and jagged to more languid and pastoral.|$|E
5|$|Christian <b>Science</b> <b>is</b> a set {{of beliefs}} and {{practices}} belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who argued in her book Science and Health (1875) that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.|$|E

5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic <b>science)</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|From 1988 to 1994, Marburger chaired Universities Research Association, the {{organization}} that operated Fermilab and oversaw construction of the ill-fated Superconducting Super Collider, an experience that is credited with convincing him of the influence government had in how <b>science</b> <b>is</b> carried out. During this time he {{also served as a}} trustee of Princeton University. He stepped down as President of Stony Brook University in 1994, and began doing research again {{as a member of the}} faculty.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of <b>science</b> <b>is,</b> there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability <b>science</b> <b>is</b> the study of sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E
