5|$|Aspirin, {{especially}} {{as a component}} of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of <b>sumatriptan.</b> It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.|$|E
25|$|Abortive {{therapy for}} cluster {{headaches}} includes subcutaneous <b>sumatriptan</b> (injected under the skin) and triptan nasal sprays. High flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief.|$|E
25|$|A single {{randomized}} controlled trial found that <b>sumatriptan</b> {{may help prevent}} altitude sickness. Despite their popularity, antioxidant treatments have not {{been found to be}} effective medications for prevention of AMS. Interest in phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen the headache of mountain sickness. A promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects {{reported}} {{by at least}} 2% of patients in controlled trials of <b>sumatriptan</b> (25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets) for migraine are atypical sensations (paresthesias and warm/cold sensations) reported by 4% {{in the placebo group}} and 5-6% in the <b>sumatriptan</b> groups, pain and other pressure sensations (including chest pain) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 6-8% in the <b>sumatriptan</b> groups, neurological events (vertigo) reported by less than 1% in the placebo group and less than 1% to 2% in the <b>sumatriptan</b> groups. Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2-3% of the <b>sumatriptan</b> groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the <b>sumatriptan</b> group.|$|E
5000|$|All marketed triptans are {{available}} in oral form; some in form of sublingual tablets. <b>Sumatriptan</b> and zolmitriptan are also available as nasal sprays. For <b>sumatriptan,</b> {{a number of other}} application forms are marketed: suppositories, a subcutaneous injection, a iontophoretic transdermal patch, which uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of <b>sumatriptan</b> through the skin within 30 minutes; a drug-device combination containing <b>sumatriptan</b> powder that is [...] "breath powered" [...] allowing the user to blow <b>sumatriptan</b> powder in to their nostrils; as well as a needle-free injection system that works with air pressure.|$|E
50|$|The other {{primarily}} recommended {{treatment of}} acute attacks is subcutaneous or intranasal <b>sumatriptan.</b> <b>Sumatriptan</b> and zolmitriptan {{have both been}} shown to improve symptoms during an attack with <b>sumatriptan</b> being superior. Because of the vasoconstrictive side-effect of triptans, they may be contraindicated in people with ischemic heart disease.|$|E
50|$|These {{drugs have}} been {{available}} only by prescription (US, Canada and UK), but <b>sumatriptan</b> became available over-the-counter in the UK in June 2006. The brand name of the OTC product in the UK is Imigran Recovery. The patent on Imitrex STATDose expired in December 2006, and injectable <b>sumatriptan</b> became available as a generic formula in August 2008. Sumavel Dosepro is a needle-free delivery of injectable <b>sumatriptan</b> that was approved in the US by the FDA in July 2009. <b>Sumatriptan</b> became available as a generic in the US in late 2009. It used to be sold over-the-counter in Romania under the Imigran brand; however, as of August 2014 prescription is required. Zecuity, a <b>sumatriptan</b> transdermal patch, {{was approved by the}} US FDA in January 2013. The <b>sumatriptan</b> nasal powder approved by the FDA in January 2016 and became available in the U.S. May 2016.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> is {{effective}} for ending or relieving {{the intensity of}} migraine and cluster headaches. It is most effective taken early {{after the start of}} the pain. Injected <b>sumatriptan</b> is more effective than other formulations.|$|E
50|$|Large {{doses of}} <b>sumatriptan</b> can cause sulfhemoglobinemia, a rare {{condition}} in which the blood changes from red to greenish-black, due to the integration of sulfur into the hemoglobin molecule. If <b>sumatriptan</b> is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> is also {{available}} in the United States as an inexpensive generic prescription medicine, while naproxen is also inexpensive and over the counter. Many doctors and pharmacists saw {{the addition of a}} simple over the counter pain reliever to <b>sumatriptan,</b> and the subsequent marketing of Treximet as a [...] "new" [...] product, with a price of over $200 for 9 tablets, as a cynical ploy by GlaxoSmithKline to continue making brand-name profits when its patent for <b>sumatriptan</b> expired.|$|E
50|$|In July 2009, the US FDA {{approved}} a single-use jet injector formulation of <b>sumatriptan.</b> The device delivers a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg <b>sumatriptan,</b> {{without the use}} of a needle. Autoinjectors with needles have been previously available in Europe and North America for several years.|$|E
5000|$|All triptans, {{like the}} older drug {{dihydroergotamine}}, have agonistic {{effects on the}} 5-HT1D receptor. Comparison of <b>sumatriptan</b> and dihydroergotamine showed that dihydroergotamine has high affinity and <b>sumatriptan</b> has medium affinity for 5-HT1D. [...] Triptans have at least three modes of action. These antimigraine mechanisms are: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} serotonin (5-HT), {{and is a}} 5-HT receptor (types 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B) agonist. The specific receptor subtypes it activates are present on the cranial arteries and veins. Acting as an agonist at these receptors, <b>sumatriptan</b> reduces the vascular inflammation associated with migraines.|$|E
50|$|On November 6, 2008, Par Pharmaceutical {{announced}} that it would begin shipping generic versions of <b>sumatriptan</b> injection (<b>sumatriptan</b> succinate injection) 4- and 6-mg starter kits and 4- and 6-mg filled syringe cartridges to the trade immediately. In addition, Par anticipates launching the 6-mg vials early in 2009.|$|E

50|$|There is no simple, direct {{relationship}} between <b>sumatriptan</b> concentration (pharmacokinetics) per se in the blood and its anti-migraine effect (pharmacodynamics). This paradox has, to some extent, been resolved by comparing the rates of absorption of the various <b>sumatriptan</b> formulations, rather than the absolute amounts of drug that they deliver.|$|E
50|$|During {{clinical}} trials Treximet performed better than placebo {{and better than}} the single ingredients by themselves. Treximet provided lasting relief in some cases for 24 hours. Treximet was also effective in reducing symptoms of migraines, such as nausea and sensitivity to light or sound. Clinical trials compared Treximet, which {{is a combination of}} 85 mg <b>Sumatriptan</b> and 500 mg Naproxen Sodium, to the individual components alone and to placebo. 85 mg of <b>Sumatriptan</b> is not an existing dose. <b>Sumatriptan</b> tablets comes in 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg dosages.|$|E

5000|$|They {{continued}} {{developing and}} working on a desirable action on 5-HT by 5-HT1 receptor activation for an anti-migraine drug. Continued work {{led to the development}} of <b>sumatriptan,</b> now known as the first 5-HT1 agonist, selective for the 5-HT1D/B receptors and also the 5-HT1F receptor with less affinity. By 1991 <b>sumatriptan</b> became available in clinical use in the Netherlands and in the US in 1993. However, there was always a debate about its mechanism of action, and it still remains unclear today. Later, Mike Moskowitz proposed a theory about [...] "neuronal extravasation", and this was the first clue that <b>sumatriptan</b> might have a direct neuronal effect in migraine attacks.|$|E
50|$|The active {{ingredient}} of Migraleve Ultra is 50 mg <b>sumatriptan,</b> similar to Imigran recovery.|$|E
50|$|Mylan Laboratories Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Sandoz (a {{subsidiary}} of Novartis), Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, {{and other companies}} have received FDA approval for generic versions of <b>sumatriptan</b> tablets in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg doses since 2009. The drug is generically available in U.S. and European markets, since Glaxo's patent protections have expired in those jurisdictions. Nasal spray <b>sumatriptan</b> is also generically available.|$|E
50|$|A single {{randomized}} controlled trial found that <b>sumatriptan</b> {{may be able}} to prevent altitude sickness.|$|E
50|$|This can {{be caused}} by taking {{medications}} that contain sulfonamides under certain conditions (i.e., overdosing of <b>sumatriptan).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> {{became a}} {{prototype}} for other triptans {{that have been}} developed for improved selectivity for the 5-HT1D/B receptors.|$|E
50|$|Zolmitriptan is {{different}} from the other triptans because it is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite which has higher affinity for the 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors; both substances have a biological half-life of 2 to 3 hours. In studies, newer triptans are mostly compared to <b>sumatriptan.</b> They are better than <b>sumatriptan</b> for their longer half-life in plasma and higher oral bioavailability, but have a higher potential for central nervous side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> is {{administered}} in several forms: tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as a succinate) suffers from poor bioavailability, {{partly due to}} presystemic metabolism—some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A new rapid-release tablet formulation has the same bioavailability, but the maximum concentration is achieved on average 10-15 minutes earlier. When injected, <b>sumatriptan</b> is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. <b>Sumatriptan</b> is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into an indole acetic acid analogue, part of which is further conjugated with glucuronic acid. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> was {{the first}} {{clinically}} available triptan (in 1991). In the United States, it is available only by medical prescription (and is frequently limited, without prior authorization, to a quantity of nine in a 30-day period). This requirement for a medical prescription also exists in Australia. However, it can be bought over the counter in the UK and Sweden. Several dosage forms for <b>sumatriptan</b> have been approved, including tablets, solution for injection, and nasal inhalers.|$|E

50|$|All triptans are {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with cardiovascular diseases (coronary spasms, symptomatic coronary artery disease, {{after a heart attack}} or stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, Raynaud's disease, peripheral artery disease). Most triptans are also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding and for patients younger than 18; but <b>sumatriptan</b> and zolmitriptan nasal sprays are also approved for youths over 12. Combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated for <b>sumatriptan,</b> zolmitriptan and rizatriptan, and combination with ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine for all substances.|$|E
50|$|Abortive {{therapy for}} cluster {{headaches}} includes subcutaneous <b>sumatriptan</b> (injected under the skin) and triptan nasal sprays. High flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief.|$|E
50|$|Triptans such as <b>sumatriptan,</b> rizatriptan, and {{naratriptan}} are 5-HT1B receptor agonists {{that are}} used to abort migraine and cluster headache attacks. Ergotamine also acts on this receptor.|$|E
50|$|On April 15, 2008, the US FDA {{approved}} Treximet, {{a combination}} of <b>sumatriptan</b> and naproxen, an NSAID. This combination has shown a benefit over either medicine used separately.|$|E
50|$|This drug has {{a unique}} RT {{formulation}} that allows for the rapid disintegration of the <b>sumatriptan,</b> {{but it does not}} affect the disintegration of the naproxen sodium component.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sumatriptan</b> is {{produced}} and marketed by various drug manufacturers with many different trade {{names such as}} Imitrex, Imigran, Sumatran, Sumatriptanum, and Sumax, also as Treximet as a combination product with naproxen.|$|E
