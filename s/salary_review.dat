Ministers may be {{designated by the}} Prime Minister {{to be in charge}} of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Singapore's ministers are among the best paid in the world. Prior to a <b>salary</b> <b>review</b> in 2011, the Prime Minister's annual salary was S$3.07 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers ranged between S$1.58 million and S$2.37 million. On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to review the salaries of the Prime Minister as well as the President, political appointment holders, and Members of Parliament. Following the recommended wage reductions by the committee which were then debated and subsequently accepted in Parliament, the Prime Minister's salary was reduced by 36% (includes the removal of his pension) to S$2.2 million (then about US$1.7 million). Nonetheless, the Prime Minister remains the highest-paid political leader in the world.|$|E

50|$|The Werner-Schaus {{government}} enacted several laws {{extending the}} social security system. In 1960, a pension fund for commercial and industrial businesses, and a National Solidarity Fund, were created.

In 1963, civil servants received a <b>salary</b> <b>review</b> which increased their allowance considerably. Finally, they enacted a large-scale pensions reform. The law of 13 May 1964 unified the principles of funding the contribution systems for old-age pensions, and regulated the adaptation of pensions to pay rises.|$|E

5000|$|In January 2012, Gerard {{took charge}} of the Ministerial <b>Salary</b> <b>Review</b> Committee which was in charge of {{reviewing}} Singapore ministers' salary. The need for the committee arose because of popular discontent towards ministers being paid too handsome a salary which was particularly notable during the 2011 General Elections as a sensitive topic that was raised on several occasions. Upon Gerard's chairmanship of the committee, pay cuts of up to 53 per cent were recommended for the ministers. Other significant suggested changes include the removal of the pension scheme for all political appointment holders and the cut in the President's salary by 51 per cent, which is, {{for the first time in}} history, lower than that of the Prime Minister's.|$|E

The commission also recommended the establishment of an Ombudsman in the country. The commission's report was portrayed in subsequent years as a <b>salary</b> <b>review</b> commission though the original intent was to study and make sweeping recommendations on the public service including the recommendation of an objective or goal oriented management style.

5000|$|In 1969, Kofi Abrefa Busia came {{to power}} {{replacing}} the military government. He expressed {{his support for the}} [...] "existence of a free and independent labour movement" [...] and promised the TUC he would help it in gaining power. Following heavy inflation, the TUC called on the Busia administration to raise salaries. Although it created a <b>Salary</b> <b>Review</b> Commission, the government did not implement the union's proposal. Moreover, it introduced the development levy, a new tax on all workers. These moves angered the country's workers and the TUC. Heavy criticism of the administration by the unions led it to amend the 1958 Industrial Relations Act in September 1971: the Industrial Relations Act of 1971 dissolved the TUC and froze all of its assets. The dissolution did not, however, last long. Following a coup led by Ignatius Kutu Acheampong, the National Redemption Council military government repealed the 1971 act and restored the TUC in February 1972.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 65) This {{study is}} concerned with the training of newly graduated engineers. Two surveys were developed and used to gather information from engineers and managers at three large aerospace companies. The results indicate that mentoring, early involvement in a successful project and managerial direction and feedback are all important issues in training. Mentoring accelerates the learning curve. Managerial direction and tactful feedback foster self-esteem. Early project involvement gives the trainee confidence and enthusiasm. Job related happiness, competence and turnover are influenced by these three factors. The results also indicate that manager involvement is largely ignored in the three subject companies. This may be because training is not an independent criterion in the first level engineering manager's annual <b>salary</b> <b>review.</b> Recommendations are made, based on the findings of this study, for the improvement of training programs for newly graduated engineers...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of New York City 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal crisis in 1975, both the New York state {{legislature}} and Congress passed laws aimed at helping the city recover.

This article examines the changes in collective bargaining laws and practices that occurred as a result of the crisis, including productivity bargaining and gain-sharing, coalition bargaining, the use of <b>salary</b> <b>review</b> panels, and the emergence of the city 2 ̆ 7 s ability to pay as a major factor in public sector bargaining. The impact of the crisis on both labor and management is also examined.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relation between management control systems, learning processes and motivation. In particular, adopting a behavioural approach to managerial control (involving variables such as conflict, motivation, learning) we desire to discuss the role that the multi- criteria approach can play in rising commitment and motivation of human resources in organizations and in orienting their behaviours through corporate goals. The empirical analysis is conducted in a multinational company which operates in the transport sector and helps in discussing the theme proposed verifying, in an experimental way, the effects of using multi-criteria methodology as part of the <b>Salary</b> <b>Review</b> process. In order to support our analysis, we propose a multi-criteria approach: the AHP approach (T. L. Saaty, 1980). The reason relies on the capability of this model to describe situations in which is fundamental to take decisions in the presence of multiple and usually conflicting criteria (both quantitative and qualitative). The entire frame previously drawn has been used to investigate the pitfalls in the SR process in Ansaldo STS. All the information collected have been obtained through a strict collaboration with HR managers and heads from April to June 2016, allowing us to extract hidden and sensitive criteria involved in the management of SR process and useful for the modelling-problem phase and for the development of our simulation, using Expert Choice...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2004 The fraud {{prevention}} measures in Unemployment Insurance Fund, North West Province, were evaluated in this study. The manual on {{fraud prevention}} measures was formulated and started implementation in 2000, and since !hen, no review was made. Different literature was reviewed {{to find out}} what other researchers say about the related problem. In reviewing literature, it was found out that fraud had an adverse effect in any business, {{and the best way to}} combat or prevent it, was to formulate and implement some preventative measures, monitor and review them at least annually. Data gathering was conducted by distributing questionnaires to different staff of Unemployment Insurance Fund throughout the North West province. The questionnaires were aimed at identifying the most vulnerable areas to fraud, evaluating the effectiveness of fraud prevention measures, identifying different types and causes of fraud and finding out whether contributors and their employers are well informed about the Unemployment Insurance Fund. The study found that the existing fraud prevention measures were not quite effective in the sense that they are reactive than preventive according to the respondents. Claims, accounts and registry sections were identified as the most vulnerable sections. The most prevalent types of frau din the UJF were found to he cheque, cash, and identity frauds, The study again found the main causes of fraud in UIF are ineffective internal controls, lack of strict supervision, income disparities and low salaries of lower level employees. It also came to light on the study that there has not been any significant change in fraud since the year 2000 after the formulation and implementation of fraud prevention measures among the ways to reduce fraud as suggested by the employees are <b>salary</b> <b>review,</b> constant supervision, intensive investigations and awareness campaigns what is essential to effectively reduce the level of fraud in the UIF is effective implementation of the preventive oriented internal controls coupled with strict supervision.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} factors which motivate teachers in Zimbabwean public schools amid the economic challenges ravaging the country. A survey design {{was used to}} gather data on biography, motivators, demotivators, need fulfilment, need deprivation and possible motivators {{by means of a}} questionnaire consisting of seven open-ended questions. The qualitative data amassed was screened and categorised in themes. The responses of thirty-seven teachers indicated that participants were motivated by financial gains, job security and the availability of adequate resources, contrarily to the major findings of Maslow and Herzberg. The absence of these in their workplaces equally demotivates them. Interesting though was that, a few teachers claimed that autonomy, recognition and developmental supervisory strategies were appropriate ingredients needed for self-actualisation. They further suggested that all stakeholders should be mobilised in a collaborated manner to provide adequate resources and infrastructure in schools to minimise demotivating conditions.
