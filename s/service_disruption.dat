5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 2016, 2 SMRT {{maintenance}} trainees {{were run}} over {{and killed by}} an oncoming C151 train (trainset 073/074) reportedly travelling at 60km/h, 150 metres from Pasir Ris MRT Station, at approximately 11.10 am. The maintenance staff were a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault on the tracks near the Pasir Ris MRT Station. This incident had led to a 2.5 hour train <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> and at least 10,000 commuters were affected.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 2013, ‘Exercise Greyhound 2013’ {{was carried}} out by the Land Transport Authority with SBS Transit to {{validate}} the procedures of SBST’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) and the workability of its contingency plans for bus bridging, free bus service and deployment of Goodwill Ambassadors (GAs) during a simulated prolonged train <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> About 300 personnel including representatives from LTA, SBST, SMRT, the Singapore Police Force’s Transport Command (TransCom), Traffic Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2012, the Land Transport Authority {{carried out}} a ground {{deployment}} exercise with SMRT to test their incident management plans {{in the event of}} a train <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> In total, about 135 personnel including representatives from the Singapore Police Force's Transport Command (TransCom) and SBS Transit participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise. Codenamed 'Exercise Greyhound', the exercise went through the scenario of a broken rail on the East West Line at Buona Vista. SMRT had also activated their Rail Incident Management Plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its own {{identity}} {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track {{was taken out of}} use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E

25|$|On 15 December 2011, {{services}} between Bishan and Marina Bay {{stations were}} suspended due to damage sustained on 40 metres of power rail between City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut stations. Trains along the stretch stalled, causing a 5-hour <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> Train service resumed fully at 11.40pm on that day.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheme was}} not {{considered}} a great success. In fact, during periods of severe <b>service</b> <b>disruption,</b> {{it was not unusual}} to see several trains buffer-to-buffer along the line, though this occurred when the line was much busier than now. Concern was expressed that similar coloured aspects had different interpretations depending on where on the signal they appeared.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 2012, {{more than}} 117,000 commuters were {{affected}} during a peak hour train breakdown between Dhoby Ghaut and HarbourFront, caused by faulty overhead power cables at the tunnel of the Outram Park that had snapped. A second problem was discovered relating to electricity insulation, delaying the service further. Train services resumed at 4.35pm after nearly 10 hours of disruption {{making it the}} third breakdown in 4 months. Subsequently, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) intends to impose financial penalties amounting to S$400,000 on SBS Transit for the train <b>service</b> <b>disruption</b> along the North East Line on 15 March 2012.|$|E

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>disruptions</b> {{can have}} a {{considerable}} impact on business operations of IT support organizations, thus calling {{for the implementation of}} efficient incident management and service restoration processes. The evaluation and improvement of incident management strategies currently in place, in order to minimize the business-impact of major <b>service</b> <b>disruptions,</b> is a very arduous task which goes beyond the optimization with respect to IT-level metrics. This paper presents HANNIBAL, a decision support tool for the business impact analysis and improvement of the incident management process. HANNIBAL evaluates possible strategies for an IT support organization to deal with major <b>service</b> <b>disruptions.</b> HANNIBAL then selects the strategy with the best alignment to the business objectives. Experimental results collected from the HANNIBAL application to a realistic case study show that business impact-driven optimization outperforms traditional performance-driven optimization...|$|R
25|$|On 7 October 2017, train {{services}} between Ang Mo Kio and Marina South Pier {{stations were}} suspended {{in both directions}} for several hours due to flooding in the tunnels between Braddell and Bishan. A trackside fire between Raffles Place and Marina Bay stations further exacerbated the disruption. Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton were restored at about 9.20pm on the same day. Train services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio were fully resumed at around 2pm the following day. This incident caused a 20-hour <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> Investigations revealed that the disruption started during a torrential downpour. A malfunction in the tunnel's water pumping and drainage system caused rainwater to flood the tunnels rapidly.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April 2004, {{the unusually}} large rate of {{increase}} in atmospheric pressure led to an airlock and failure of hydraulic pressure on eight of the Class 357 trains which caused their computer's software to lower their pantographs and so be unable to collect power from the overhead lines, causing <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> However, after their teething problems were sorted out, they have since been the most reliable fleet of EMUs in the United Kingdom, winning Best Modern Era EMU at the Golden Spanners Awards from 2005 to 2007, for an average annual miles per casualty (MPC) figure of 43,180 in 2005, 37,391 in 2006, and 45,459 in 2007 (defined {{as the number of}} miles a train runs before a defect develops causing 5 minutes or longer delay).|$|E
500|$|Heavy rains {{from the}} remnant of Bertha caused {{widespread}} flooding across the United Kingdom.

In London, a water main burst and inundated surrounding streets. Thirty shops were affected and nearby stations of the London Underground were swamped. The Prudential RideLondon race was shortened by [...] due to the storm. The River Dee rose to its highest level since 1990 and flooded surrounding areas. Footbridges and paths along its banks were washed away, though no structures were affected. Lossiemouth, Scotland, received a month's worth of rain in roughly 12hours. Flooding in Elgin prompted the evacuation of 200homes. Numerous roads were washed out across Scotland and First ScotRail reported widespread <b>service</b> <b>disruption.</b> High winds and flooding also damaged crops across the region, namely in Scotland. A Gold Duke of Edinburgh expedition team from 1st Raffrey Boys' Brigade were forced to airlift a crew member to safety after sustaining injuries caused by severe weather conditions in the Mournes. The team of five, {{part of a larger}} group of thirty, required the assistance of a helicopter from Dublin to save the fallen traveller and winched him to safety.

In particular, the New York Post described the closure with the headline, [...] "2019 is the year Williamsburg dies." [...] This option was selected after a poll revealed that 77 percent of L train riders preferred the 18-month closure option. As part of the closure, the segment between Bedford and Eighth Avenues would be closed. There would be more ferry and bus service, and increased subway service on other routes. The MTA would institute two out-of-system subway transfers, free if paid via MetroCard: one between Broadway on the IND Crosstown Line and Lorimer Street on the BMT Jamaica Line, and one between Livonia Avenue on the Canarsie Line and Junius Street on the IRT New Lots Line.|$|E
