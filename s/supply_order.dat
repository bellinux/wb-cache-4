SCOR is a method of assessing supply chain performance created by Supply Chain Council from two perspectives those are internal business process and customer facing. The using of AHP and Cause-Effect-Diagram is to find problem of performance and give alternative recommendation from the 3 worst measured performances. Framework has been made includes 9 performances to measure. The 3 worst score of performances will be processed by AHP to decide the rank of problem based on XYZ perspective. Finally it is gained weight-score product cycle time (0. 255), <b>supply</b> <b>order</b> fulfilment (0. 35) and supplier lead time (0. 391). The alternative recommendation is given to XYZ by using Cause and effect Diagram such as the on-time order by consumer, on-time cycle time and standardized chicken from supplier...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to explore the cost of {{unserved}} energy due to power outages in Pakistan that started in 2007. The study is based on a survey conducted for four major industrial cities of Punjab—Gujrat, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Sialkot. In addition to quantification of output losses, the effect on employment, cost of production, and delay in <b>supply</b> <b>orders</b> are also examined. The output loss is quantified using two-dimensional analyses, controlling for variations in the duration of outages and in the shift hours. The survey data reveal that employment has not suffered any significant drop due to alternative energy arrangements. These arrangements, nevertheless, have increased the production cost of the firms. Delays in the delivery of <b>supply</b> <b>orders</b> are also due to energy shortage. The study reports that the total industrial output loss varies between 12 percent and 37 percent, with Punjab as the major affected province. Energy Crises, Output Loss, Pakistan...|$|R
