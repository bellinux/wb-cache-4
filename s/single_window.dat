5|$|The Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation (UPFC) was {{established}} in the year 1954 under the SFCs Act of 1951 mainly to develop small- and medium-scale industries in the state. UPFC provides financial assistance to new and existing units undergoing diversification, modernisation, expansion, or acquisition of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. The UPFC also provides working capital to existing units with a sound track record and to new units under a <b>single</b> <b>window</b> scheme. As of July 2012, due to financial constraints and directions from the state government, lending activities have been suspended except for State Government Schemes. The state has reported total private investment worth over Rs. 25,081 crores during the years of 2012 and 2016. According to a recent report of World Bank on Ease of Doing Business in India, Uttar Pradesh was ranked among the top 10 states and first among Northern states.|$|E

25|$|On Riddell's {{death at}} the age of only 39, the Hermitage was allowed to quietly decay; by 1803 it was being used by stray stock and in 1810 it was {{reported}} by Cromek as being derelict and he expressed his shock that the site was not being maintained under Captain Smith's ownership of the estate, for the floor was covered in straw, cattle had broken down the trees and the pane of glass had gone. It measured 10.5 feet by eight and had a <b>single</b> <b>window</b> and fireplace. In around 1870 William Douglas recorded that {{the only part of the}} building still standing was part of the east gable. Over the lintel was cut the name 'BURNS' in bold letters.|$|E

The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a <b>single</b> <b>window</b> {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, large Romanesque towers are square with corner buttresses of low profile, rising without {{diminishing}} {{through the various}} stages. Towers are usually marked into clearly defined stages by horizontal courses. As the towers rise, the number and size of openings increases {{as can be seen}} on the right tower of the transept of Tournai Cathedral where two narrow slits in the fourth level from the top becomes a <b>single</b> <b>window,</b> then two windows, then three windows at the uppermost level. This sort of arrangement is particularly noticeable on the towers of Italian churches, which are usually built of brick and may have no other ornament. Two fine examples occur at Lucca, at the church of San Frediano and at the Duomo. It is also seen in Spain.|$|E

After his second tenure as the vice chancellor, he was appointed as the vice chairman of the Tamil Nadu State Council for Higher Education (TANSCHE) and also held the post of the Advisor to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on matters related to Information Technology and E-Governance.

25|$|The first {{versions}} of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were actually just programs run from MS-DOS which then {{took over the}} screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many staple features that remain in current {{versions of}} Windows today, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial Windows Desktop Update, which aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, {{such as the ability}} to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and <b>single</b> <b>window</b> navigation in Windows Explorer, all of which still exist in Windows today. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an infamous anti-trust case. Windows 98 also included plug and play, which allowed devices to simply work when plugged in instead of requiring a system reboot, and USB support out of the box, which was previously only available in specially updated versions of Windows 95 which were only shipped to OEMs and not available to the general public. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced the Help and Support Center, System Restore, and updated user-friendly versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the optimization of glazed surfaces and the assessment of possible solar gains in industrial buildings. Existing window rating methods for <b>single</b> <b>windows</b> were evaluated and a new method for a simple analysis of energy gains and losses by <b>single</b> <b>windows</b> was introduced. Furthermore extensive transient building simulations were carried out to appraise the performance of low cost polycarbonate multi-cell sheets in interaction with typical buildings for industrial applications. Mainly energy saving potential was determined by optimizing the orientation and area of such glazing systems in dependency on their thermal qualities. Moreover the impact on critical aspects such as summer overheating and daylight illumination was considered to ensure the user comfort and avoid additional energy demand for lighting or cooling. Hereby the simulated heating demand could be reduced by up to 1 / 3 compared to traditional architecture of industrial halls using mainly skylights...|$|R

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Forest Service in 1928, Marshall worked to {{complete}} his studies for a PhD in plant physiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The following year {{he made his first}} trip to Alaska, visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the central Brooks Range, and preparing for an extended stay for study. [...] The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern timberline near the Arctic Divide. For his 15-month sojourn {{in the small town of}} Wiseman, Alaska, Marshall rented a one-room cabin next to the only roadhouse in the village.
