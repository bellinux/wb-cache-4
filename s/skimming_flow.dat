40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} two decades, {{research}} onto the hydraulics of <b>skimming</b> <b>flows</b> down stepped chutes was driven by needs for better design guidelines. <b>Skimming</b> <b>flows</b> are characterised by significant momentum transfer from the main stream to the recirculation zones. Investigations are difficult because of the complex nature of the flow, the strong flow aeration and the interactions between entrained air and turbulence. This study provides a comprehensive database on main stream/cavity <b>flow</b> interactions in <b>skimming</b> <b>flows</b> down a stepped chute. Measurements were conducted on a large facility (α = 15. 9 º, h = 0. 05 & 0. 1 m, W = 1 m) with precise instrumentation based upon a Froude similitude. Air-water velocity and turbulence measurements demonstrated a well-defined mixing layer developing downstream of each step edge in which the velocity profiles had the same shape as classical monophase flow results. A comparative analysis of air-water flow properties for Froude similar flow conditions showed good agreement between the two step heights in terms of dimensionless distributions of air content, velocity and turbulence intensity, but dimensionless bubble count rates, turbulence levels and bubble chord sizes were improperly scaled...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Air {{entrainment}} {{plays an}} important role in the reduction of cavitations risk potential in chutes and spillways. The advantages of stepped spillways over conventional smooth spillways, the air entrainment phenomenon, and the flow regimes occurring on stepped chutes have been reviewed. Then the numerical analysis of <b>skimming</b> <b>flow</b> using shallow water equations in inclined coordinate system is described. The numerical computations of air entrainment in the <b>skimming</b> <b>flow</b> over stepped spillways are performed in two stages. In the first stage, the water flow equations are converted to discrete form using the overlapping cell vertex finite volume method on triangular unstructured mesh, and then, in the second stage, the flow field solution results are used for computing air concentration profiles by a separate post-processor. This postprocessor uses experimental relations for computing the inception point characteristics and air concentration distribution profiles along the stepped chute. The computed results of air entrainment into the supercritical <b>skimming</b> <b>flow</b> on stepped spillways have been compared with laboratory experimental measurements...|$|E

The flow characteristics in three different vegetation types (Spartina maritima, Sp. anglica and Salicornia sp. /Suaeda maritima) were measured on three salt-marshes in Portugal and England. These in situ measurements differ from laboratory flume experiments with 'clean' vegetation by the complexity of natural canopies. <b>Skimming</b> <b>flow</b> develops above the Spartina canopy when the vegetation is fully submerged. In this situation, a low turbulence zone with nearly constant velocity in the denser canopy is separated from the <b>skimming</b> <b>flow</b> above by an interface characterized by high Reynolds stresses. In the low turbulence zone, a positive relationship exists between turbulence intensity and shoot density, which is due to wake turbulence generated locally in the canopy. The rate of particle settling should be increased in that zone. The lower limit of <b>skimming</b> <b>flow</b> is best predicted by the height within the canopy that includes 85 % of the biomass. For emergent Spartina canopies and the short Salicornia/Suaeda marsh, the maximal velocity-gradient is shifted upwards compared to a standard boundary layer over bare sediment and the turbulence is attenuated near the bed, but to a lesser extent than for fully submerged Spartina canopies.

Further, the spatial variations of mean velocity profiles, turbulence intensities, in-plane turbulent kinetic energy, and Reynolds shear stress were also elucidated in detail.
