25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. <b>Silage</b> <b>liquor</b> (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, <b>silage</b> <b>liquor</b> can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

50|$|Fresh or wilted {{grass or}} other green crops {{can be made}} into a semi-fermented product called silage which can be stored and used as winter forage for cattle and sheep. The {{production}} of silage often involves the use of an acid conditioner such as sulfuric acid or formic acid. The process of silage making frequently produces a yellow-brown strongly smelling liquid which is very rich in simple sugars, alcohol, short-chain organic acids and silage conditioner.

40|$|Some farm wastes {{have been}} {{analysed}} for their fluorescence properties using fluorescence excitation–matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. Farm wastes investigated were <b>silage</b> <b>liquor,</b> pig and cattle slurry, and sheep barn waste. All farm wastes exhibited high intensities of fluorescence {{that can be}} attributed to the protein tryptophan. <b>Silage</b> <b>liquor</b> was characterised by a very high fluorescence intensity and an initial tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratio of> 20. Cattle and pig slurries exhibited a lower tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratio (B 2 – 5) and lower tryptophan fluorescence intensity, and tyrosine fluorescence was also observed. Sheep barn wastes had the lowest tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratios (B 0. 5 – 4. 0). Farm waste samples were reanalysed under controlled temperature conditions over a period of 50 days after sampling, to investigate the stability of their fluorescence properties. For <b>silage</b> <b>liquor,</b> tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratios were observed to decrease with time, and were associated with a decrease in tryptophan fluorescence intensity, suggestive of clostridia breakdown of protein. For slurry samples, tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity exhibited a more variable time-evolution, and tryptophan fluorescence intensity increased through time; the more complex fluorescence signal is due to the relatively heterogeneous nature of the slurry. Sheep barn waste samples exhibited more stable tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratio and tryptophan intensities, suggesting these samples were more stable due to their greater age and decomposition. The ratios of tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity observed from the farm wastes investigate...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the chemical composition, fermentation patterns and aerobic stability of sugarcane silages with addition of amino acid production (monosodium glutamate) by-product (APB) and microbial inoculants. Mature sugarcane was chopped and ensiled in laboratory silos (n = 4 /treatment) without additives (control) and with APB (10 g/kg), Pioneer 1174 ® (PIO, 1. 0 mg/kg, Lactobacillus plantarum + Streptoccoccus faecium, Pioneer), Lalsil Cana (2. 0 mg/kg, Lactobacillus buchineri, Lallemand) or Mercosil Maís 11 C 33 ® (1. 0 mg/kg, Lactobacillus buchineri + Lactobacillus plantarum + Streptoccoccus faecium, Timac Agro). Fresh silage and <b>silage</b> <b>liquor</b> samples were obtained to assess pH, chemical composition and organic acid concentrations. Silage temperature was recorded throughout seven days to evaluate aerobic stability. The addition of APB decreased lactic acid levels, increased pH and N-NH 3 and did not alter ethanol, acetic and butyric acids concentrations or dry matter (DM) losses. Microbial inoculants enhanced acetic acid levels, although only Pioneer 1174 ® and Mercosil Maís 11 C 33 ® lowered ethanol, butyric acid and DM losses. The addition of APB increased CP content and did not modify DM, soluble carbohydrates contents or in vitro dry matter digestibility. Additives did not alter silage maximum temperature or temperature increasing rate; however, Pioneer 1174 ® and Mercosil Maís 11 C 33 ® increased the time elapsed to reach maximum temperature. Monosodium glutamate production by-product does not alter fermentation patterns or aerobic stability of sugarcane silages, whereas homofermentative bacteria can provide silages of good quality. 201...|$|E
40|$|International audienceindustry {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{resources}} of a country's economic development. Different types of industries have different system of production. For production purpose these industries use a huge amount of chemicals and raw materials which rapidly polluted surface water of our country in the form of effluent. The aim of this study was to assess the water quality status of Turag river due to industrial effluent. This study was in Tongi heavy industrial area and investigation was done by collecting effluent from four industries and three stationery point on turag river which was selected by purposive sampling technique. The values of DO of the analyzed industrial samples are within the range of 2. 32 - 6. 28. In chemical industries DO value is lower than the standard. But in other conditions DO value is higher. DO value of the river is also lower than the Bangladesh standard. Dissolve oxygen (DO) values are found in the range from 1. 85 to 4. 20 mg/L. The highest value 29 6 mg/L for DO was found in 2006 decreased to 1. 85 to 4. 2 mg/L in the present study. Higher BOD values were found in Confluence Point of Turag river. The values BOD ranging from 13 to 73 mg/L. The permissible limit for BOD for drinking water is 0. 2 mg/L, for recreation 3 mg/L, for fish 6 mg/L and 10 mg/L for irrigation. (Bangladesh standard) (DoE, Department of Environment, 1991, 1997). The biological oxygen demand (BOD) was high because most of the industries are situated near the bank of the river. They discharge organic material, e. g. from sewage treatment works, storm overflows, domestic waste water (human waste and food waste) and industrial waste water (from tannery, textile and food processing industries), agricultural slurry, <b>silage</b> <b>liquor.</b> Turag river is polluted by industrial effluent, untreated sewage, wastewater, oil dumping, silt, encroachment etc. Pollutants entering the water body are both in solid and liquid forms. Concerning all measured parameters (especially DO, BOD), it could be concluded that pollution of Turag water reached critical point with increasing tendency day by day. This study has revealed that the industries are involved in serious environmental hazard. Adequate preventive measures should be taken in industrial activities with a view to ensuring a healthy environment...|$|E
