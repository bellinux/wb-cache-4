5000|$|Since {{the turn}} of the Millennium Russia issues the Individual Food Rations (Individual'nyi Ratsion Pitaniya (IRP) (Индивидуальный рацион питания/ИРП), a new {{self-contained}} ration, containing the whole daily food intake for an individual soldier in the field. However, in its most frequent form it isn't dietary complete, and is intended only as a stop-gap measure to be issued until the normal supply lines (with their field kitchens) are established and the hot food delivery started, to be issued for no more than six days straight. Russian Ministry of defence doesn't strictly prescribe the contents of the ration, only some basic packaging and inventory requirements, so every producer issues their own version. Most commonly it is packaged into a sturdy plastic blister box (nicknamed [...] "The Frog" [...] in the field for its olive-green color), or plastic-sealed cardboard box that contains five to six entrees in laminated foil cans or retort pouches, four to six pack of crackers or preserved bread, two to three dessert items in form of a spread or fruit bar, four beverage concentrate pouches, some seasonings (salt, pepper, sugar, ketchup), and various sundry items like sanitizing wipes/paper towels, spoons, can opener, four hexamine fuel tablets, folding heater, matches and water purifier tablets. The types of entrees vary with the producer and the issued menu (of which there are usually 7 to 12), but the common set is based on a traditional Russian outdoorsmen fare, is largely formed out of the commercially available canned food, and usually includes 1 portion of stewed beef or pork, two meat-with-vegetables dishes, like various porridges, stews or canned fish, and one or two spreads, such as liver pate, <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffing</b> or processed cheese. Desserts may include fruit jams, chocolate and/or walnut spreads, chocolate bars, sweetened condensed milk, etc., but baked goods are usually avoided out of concerns about their shelf life. Other variants may add canned speck and/or dried fish or exchange the hexamine tablets for the flameless heater.|$|E

The Greek poet Homer mentioned a kind of blood sausage in the Odyssey, Epicharmus wrote a comedy titled The Sausage, and Aristophanes' play The Knights is about a sausage vendor who is elected leader.

5000|$|When {{the sausage}} is {{served in a}} {{traditional}} hot dog bun, it is called a [...] "hot dog". It is commonly served with Danish remoulade, ketchup, mustard, onion (both raw and toasted, i.e. ristede) and thinly sliced pickles on top. The ristede løg fried onions are similar in taste to French-fried onion rings. The pickled condiment varies from region to region, and includes red cabbage in some places, but cucumber relish is the most widespread. Another variety is the French hot dog (Fransk hotdog) which is a <b>sausage</b> <b>stuffed</b> into a special long baguette-like bread roll. The roll has a hole in one end, and after the requested condiment has been squirted in (ketchup, mustard, different kinds of dressing), a sausage is slipped through. The simplest sausage wagons are portable and very temporary. They are typically a metal wagon with an open window to the street, and a counter where customers can stand and eat their sausages. More advanced wagons includes limited seating, usually both inside and outside. Through the years the number of sausage wagons has dropped as competition from convenience stores, gas stations, kebab and pizza-places has increased.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine microbial contamination sources during sausage processing. The samples were taken at 6 different stages of the sausage processing line in a local plant. Minced meat, <b>sausage</b> batter, <b>stuffed</b> <b>sausage,</b> cooked sausage, peeled sausage, and pasteurized sausage samples were examined microbiologically. Moreover, spices and ice water used in production, personnel hands, and equipment were examined. Counts of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, yeasts, and molds in minced meat were found to be 7. 02, 3. 83, 4. 42, and 1. 62 log cfu/g, respectively. E. coli and yeast-mold counts in sausage batter reached 3. 99 and 1. 72 log cfu/g, respectively. Heating for cooking was effective in reducing microbial counts. Total plate (3. 93 log cfu/g) and S. aureus (1. 08 log cfu/g) counts in cooked sausages decreased; E. coli and yeast-mold were not detected. According to the results, raw material and spices were found as primary contamination sources. Personnel hands and equipments were found as secondary contamination sources. Microbial counts in personnel hands showed significant correlations with the counts of the samples taken from all processing stages. Microorganism counts determined in overall processing were not at harmful levels for human health and the microbial load of the final product was within critical limits...|$|R

5000|$|Åkerlund & Rausing {{produced}} {{all sorts}} of paper packaging for dry staple groceries, but Rausing was determined {{to find a way}} to pre-package liquids like milk and cream, and spent large sums on developing a viable package. The goal was to provide optimal food safety, hygiene and distribution efficiency using a minimum amount of material, according to the subsequently famous credo that a package should [...] "save more than it costs". The new package had to be sufficiently cheap to be able to compete with loose milk, meaning that a minimum of material waste and a maximum of production efficiency needed to be obtained.In 1943, the Åkerlund & Rausing lab started to work on developing the milk carton, and, in 1944, came up with the idea of constructing a tetrahedron-shaped package out of a tube of paper. The idea was simple but efficient, making optimal use of the material involved. After some initial hesitation, Rausing understood the potential of the package and filed for a patent on 27 March 1944. The rest of the 1940s were spent developing viable packaging materials and solving the technical problems of filling, sealing, and distribution. It was reportedly Rausing’s wife Elisabeth who came up with the idea of continuously sealing the packages through the milk while filling the tube in the manner of <b>stuffing</b> <b>sausages,</b> to prevent oxygen from entering the package. In 1946, a model for a packaging machine was presented by engineer Harry Järund, and in collaboration with Swedish paper mills and foreign chemical companies a viable paper for packaging was finally produced when coating carton paper with polyethylene, which made the paper waterproof and allowing for heat-sealing during filling.|$|R
