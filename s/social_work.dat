STOLETÍ PARISH SOCIAL WORKS IN THE CZECHOSLOVAK CHURCH FROM 1920 - 1955 Autor: Františka Tichá In this work, I {{pursued the}} parish <b>social</b> <b>works</b> in the Czechoslovak church from its rise to 1950 's. I {{partially}} captured an {{origin of the}} roots of the Christian church's <b>social</b> <b>works</b> in chapter two. Chapter three describes the rise of the Czechoslovak church and its <b>social</b> <b>works</b> development. The views of some of the Czechoslovak church's theologians on social concerns are captured in chapter four. Chapter five analyzes the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> in three selected parishes. In chapter six, I explained how the Czechoslovak church's teachings were implemented in parishes. Chapter seven discusses the downfall of the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> within the Czechoslovak church after February 1948. In conclusion, I have arrived at an opinion that the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> unions laid out an admirable effort in this field. It is unfortunate that due to the political changes in 1948 the <b>social</b> <b>works</b> unions had to undergo a liquidation...|$|R
