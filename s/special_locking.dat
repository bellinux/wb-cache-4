Since the City Bikes programme was free to the user, there is no return on the capital invested by the municipality, and a considerable amount of public funds was constantly used to keep the system in service, to enforce regulations, and to replace missing bikes. In 2013 a new version was expected to be introduced but the municipality of Copenhagen temporarily withdrew its support and there were no free bicycles for most of 2013.

50|$|Files in OS 2200 {{are simply}} {{containers}} {{that may be}} addressed either by word offset in the file or by sector (28-word unit) offset in the file. The 28 words is a historical unit from an early mass storage device (the FASTRAND drum) that could hold 64 such units per physical track. Nonetheless, it is a fortunate historical accident. Four such 28-word units or 112 words occupy 504 bytes. With today’s mass storage devices all using 512-byte physical records, OS 2200 clients have almost all adopted some multiple of 112 words as their physical record size and database page size. I/O processors automatically adjust for the 504<->512 byte mapping adding 8 bytes of zeros on writes and stripping them off on reads of each physical record. OS 2200 handles applications that use sizes other than multiples of 112 words by indivisibly reading the containing physical records and writing back out the unchanged and changed portions with data chaining. <b>Special</b> <b>locking</b> functions guarantee indivisibility even when there are device errors and across multiple systems in a cluster.|$|E

A series of push-out tests are conducted to assess the behavior of the connector and quantify the effect of important parameters. The experimental results show shear resistance, stiffness, and slip capacity significantly higher than those of welded shear studs along with superior stiffness and strength against slab uplift.

The SPI-tree {{was designed and}} implemented for a prototype large scale platform allowing location based services between moving clients.

We propose SPI-Tree that combines a PR-Quadtree with the Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) provided from an XML-matching system like YFilter. It is a quad tree, it indexes the two dimensional space by recursively partitioning it in rectangles, however, the leaf nodes of the SPI-Tree do not contain pointers or buckets of pointers to the moving users but consist of a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton.

40|$|Abstract—The {{maintenance}} of materialized aggregate join views is a well-studied problem. However, {{to date the}} published literature has largely ignored the issue of concurrency control. Clearly, immediate materialized view maintenance with transactional consistency, if enforced by generic concurrency control mechanisms, can result in low levels of concurrency and high rates of deadlock. While this problem is superficially amenable to well-known techniques, such as fine-granularity <b>locking</b> and <b>special</b> <b>lock</b> modes for updates that are associative and commutative, we show that these previous high concurrency locking techniques do not fully solve the problem, but {{a combination of a}} “value-based ” latch pool and these previous high concurrency locking techniques can solve the problem.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{increasing}} clinical problems with metaphyseal fractures, most experimental studies investigate {{the healing of}} diaphyseal fractures. Although the mouse would be the preferable species to study the molecular and genetic aspects of metaphyseal fracture healing, a murine model does not exist yet. Using a <b>special</b> <b>locking</b> plate system, we herein introduce a new model, which allows the analysis of metaphyseal bone healing in mice. Methods: In 24 CD- 1 mice the distal metaphysis of the femur was osteotomized. After stabilization with the locking plate, bone repair was analyzed radiologically, biomechanically, and histologically after 2 (n = 12) and 5 wk (n = 12). Additionally, the stiffness of the bone-implant construct was tested biomechanically ex vivo. Results: The torsional stiffness of the bone-implant construct was low compared with nonfractured control femora (0. 23 ± 0. 1 Nmm/°versus 1. 78 ± 0. 15 Nmm/°, P < 0. 05). The cause of failure was a pullout of the distal screw. At 2 wk after stabilization, radiological analysis showed that most bones were partly bridged. At 5 wk, all bones showed radiological union. Accordingly, biomechanical analyses revealed a significantly higher torsional stiffness after 5 wk compared with that after 2 wk. Successful healing was indicated by a torsional stiffness of 90 % of the contralateral control femora. Histological analyses showed new woven bone bridging the osteotomy without external callus formation and in absence of any cartilaginous tissue, indicating intramembranous healing. Conclusion: With the model introduced herein we report, for the first time, successful metaphyseal bone repair in mice. The model {{may be used to}} obtain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of metaphyseal fracture healing. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

It has various combination of holes, the system provides more options for clinicians to use either locking screw or non-locking screws. This thesis investigates and determines the best construct with <b>special</b> <b>locking</b> and non-locking screws under both axial and torsion loading. Twenty femur constructs were assembled with 2 cm osteotomy gap between femur shaft and condyle, bridged with 4. 5 mm - 10 holes condyle plates. Femurs were divided in to 4 groups according to screw types and where they were placed. All screws were tightened to 4 Nm torque with a torque meter. Axial loads of - 50 N to - 700 N and ± 5 degree rotation were applied for 50, 000 cycles. Loosening torques of screws, stiffness and displacement of constructs were measured. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on locking plate and screws based on computed tomography images and Solidworks models. Analytical simulations were run under static and limited dynamic conditions were investigated with the experimental results. Axial load was applied and stresses induced were measured on the simulated models. Locking screw increased the torsional resistance of adjacent non-locking screw. Deformation and torsional stiffness in constructs with two locking screws were higher compared to one locking screw after 50, 000 cycles. Locking screws increased flexibility of the constructs allowing reduction in osteotomy gap. FEA results show plate with locking screws induced lower von Mises stress compared to plate with non locking screws. This study concluded that among hybrid locked plated constructs, constructs with two locking screws provided more stability, flexibility and durability under various loading. A locking screw near the fracture gap increases axial and torsional strength of locking plated system and increased torsional strength {{of all the other}} screws...|$|E
