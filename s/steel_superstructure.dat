Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

50|$|Alkett is {{the company}} that Major Alfred Becker worked with, {{initially}} in early 1942 to help create self-propelled artillery pieces by use of captured French Lorraine Schlepper ammunition carriers. Becker converted these vehicles to carry the 150 mm sFH 18. Becker's later work converting captured French vehicles to carry German weapons was assisted by Alkett, which produced the <b>steel</b> <b>superstructures</b> for the vehicles Becker was modifying in France.|$|R
25|$|The entire <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> and all {{above-ground}} concrete pouring was complete in January 2015.

50|$|In 1951, {{the line}} was to be {{dismantled}} to obtain track materials for repairs elsewhere, but this did not take place. Passenger traffic continued until 21 May 1966, when it {{was taken over by}} buses, and freight traffic until the decommissioning of the line on 26 September 1969. On 12 June 1970 {{the line was}} ordered to be dismantled, and the tracks as well as the <b>steel</b> <b>superstructures</b> of the bridges were lifted subsequently.|$|R
50|$|As a {{long-term}} {{replacement for the}} bridge destroyed in 1945, a new bridge was built south of the 1938 site {{at the end of}} the war. It was built on four electric pylons, which were supported by a large number of steel pipes which had been driven into the ground. <b>Steel</b> <b>superstructures</b> built on trusses carried a railway track and the roadway. After the construction of the new road bridge of 1966, the deck of the roadway was dismantled and only the deck of the railway remained until 1991.|$|R
25|$|The Apex Building was {{the last}} to be {{constructed}} and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed {{to make way for the}} Federal Reserve Board Building. The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building. Testing for the foundation began in September 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter. With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936. Using the George Washington trowel, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the building on July 12, 1937. The building's $3.665 million cost was paid for out of Public Works Administration funds, and officials estimated it would be ready for occupation by January 1, 1938. Demolition of the old foundation for the unbuilt Washington Memorial occurred in July 1937, and much of the Apex Building's <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> was rising by then as well. The great depth of the building's foundation meant that the crane operator lifting the steel beams into place was out of sight in the basement, and a series of telephone links from observers on the street relayed instructions to him. By December 1937, the building was two months ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, the Commerce {{building}} {{opened and}} construction began on three additional buildings at Federal Triangle. The Department of Commerce building opened on January 4, 1932. The finished building had 1,605,066 square feet (148,271.1 square metres) {{of office space}} (more than 60 percent larger than originally planned), and its foundation was more than three feet thick in places in order to withstand the hydraulic pressure put on it by the submerged Tiber Creek. Water from the Tiber was utilized as an air conditioning system, to cool the building. July saw the construction contract for the $7.67 million Justice Department building signed. Although some funds for Federal Triangle projects had not been appropriated yet, work still went ahead using funds from other projects which were behind schedule. On September 26, 1932, the 143rd anniversary {{of the founding of}} the U.S. Postal Service, President Hoover laid the cornerstone of the Post Office Department building (although the foundation had already been laid, and the <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> of the building was already three stories high). Once again, Hoover used the trowel which George Washington had used to lay the Capitol's cornerstone. Congress had appropriated $10.3 million for the new structure, which was designed to accommodate more than 3,000 workers. Its eight stories would be laid on a granite foundation and the sides clad in limestone. On December 1, 1932, the contract for construction of the limestone National Archives building (whose estimated construction cost was $5.284 million) was awarded to the George A. Fuller Company (which had constructed the New York Times Building and the Flatiron Building). Hoover laid two cornerstones on December 15 for the Labor/ICC building, the third building to begin construction that year. Workers who were Freemasons assisted the President in laying the cornerstones. Hoover personally oversaw the dedication of the cornerstone at the Labor end of the building. His words were broadcast over loudspeaker to the workers at the ICC end of the structure, who placed the ICC cornerstone simultaneously at the President's instruction (becoming the first time in Washington history that a single person dedicated two cornerstones at the same time). William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, attended the laying of the cornerstone for the Labor building. Once more, Hoover used the trowel used by Washington to lay the cornerstone of the Capitol. Two weeks later, on December 30, the concrete foundation of the Archives building was poured.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to inform about the <b>steel</b> <b>superstructures</b> of a bridge located on a highway D 1, section Jabloňov – Studenec, 1, 650 th km. It is the longest bridge (length approx. 670 m) among the seven bridges on this highway section. The bridge is {{situated}} in an area of many significant historical listed objects such as Levoča city, Spiš castle and Spiš canonry. This fact was considered whilst designing the architectural appearance of the bridge in the very first phase of the whole design – in this phase the bridge was being solved as disposing of an upper bridge deck supported by arches reminding gothic structures of this region. The structural solution of this bridge, the used materials and the realization procedure are described in this paper...|$|R
500|$|Work on Binnie's design began, but was {{beset by}} problems. Leading architects {{condemned}} the design, with Arthur Beresford Pite describing it as [...] "a would-be Gothic architectural form of great vulgarity and stupid want of meaning", and T G Jackson describing the bridge designs {{as a sign}} of [...] "the utter apparent indifference of those in authority to the matter of art". Plans to build large stone abutments had to be suspended when {{it was found that the}} southern abutment would block the River Effra, which by this time had been diverted underground to serve as a storm relief sewer and which flowed into the Thames at this point. The Effra had to be rerouted to join the Thames to the north of the bridge. After the construction of the foundations and piers it was then discovered that the clay of the riverbed at this point would not be able to support the weight of a concrete bridge. With the granite piers already in place, it was decided to build a <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> onto the existing piers, and a superstructure [...] long and [...] wide was designed by Binnie and Maurice Fitzmaurice and built by LCC engineers at a cost of £437,000 (about £ in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{contracts}} {{were awarded}} to {{a consortium of}} Tidewater Construction Corporation and [...] Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation. The <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> for the high-level bridges near {{the north end of}} the crossing were fabricated by the American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation. Construction of the bridge–tunnel began in October 1960 after a six-month process of assembling necessary equipment from worldwide sources.|$|E
2500|$|David B. Steinman was {{appointed}} as the design engineer in January 1953 {{and by the}} end of 1953, estimates and contracts had been negotiated.

2500|$|On August 23, 1934, Governor Herbert Lehman {{signed a}} bill authorizing {{construction}} of a southern extension of the elevated highway from Canal Street to the Battery. However, this segment was opposed by the communities along the route since it might [...] "result in a waste of tax funds". Construction on {{the first section of}} this, from Duane Street to Canal Street, was begun on January 24, 1938. Unlike previous sections of highway, which used granite blocks as a surface, concrete was used on the new section. The road was opened to traffic on February 4, 1939. A <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> consisting of an arched bridge was built at Canal Street because the Holland Tunnel below ground restricted locations of bridge supports.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1910s it {{had become}} common in the United States to build jumps with a {{scaffold}} superstructure for the in-run, and this had been described as an abomination in the Norwegian press. Prior to the 1914 season, a [...] tall <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> was built. This resulted in massive negative reactions in the press, {{and it was the}} public's opinion that ski jumping was to be done in natural hills. The same year, two other major Norwegian hills received similar structures, Nydalsbakken and Solbergbakken. The first trials were made on 15 January, giving jumps 34meters. This was regarded as the furthest anyone would jump. The hill was subsequently expanded slightly a few times afterwards, including blasting it steeper, chopping it wider, and covering the landing slope with earth and sowing grass to improve the profile.|$|E
2500|$|According to Corsi, [...] "A {{video clip}} widely {{circulated}} on the Internet shows {{a test that}} pulverized an F-4 fighter on impact with a hardened target, providing evidence to answer 9/11 skeptics who question why so little identifiable airplane debris remained after the hijacked American Airlines Boeing 757 hit the Pentagon." [...] Audio and a YouTube video were circulated, especially among those questioning Corsi's credibility, of Corsi's January 29, 2008 interview on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's radio show. In the interview Corsi discusses [...] "the findings of Steven Jones, physicist and hero of the '9/11 Truth' movement {{who claims to have}} evidence that the World Trade Center towers collapsed due to explosives inside the building, not just the planes hitting them, during the attacks". Corsi cites Jones's findings of microscopic forensic evidence which seemingly negates the US government hypothesis that the aircraft's jet fuel-fed heat alone was sufficiently hot to collapse the <b>steel</b> <b>superstructure</b> of the buildings.|$|E
