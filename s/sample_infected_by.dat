40|$|Background: [br/] Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a {{zoonotic}} and obligate intracellular bacterium {{transmitted by}} ticks. In domestic ruminants, {{it is the}} causative agent of tick-borne fever, which causes significant economic losses in Europe.

The present study aims to isolate and identified different bacterial isolates collected from semen samples of infertile men attending to infertility clinic and evaluation {{of the effects of}} bacteriospermia on semen quality. Five medicinal plants extracts were used as an alternative therapeutic agent targeting these isolates. Seventy seven infertile men were evaluated by standard bacterial culture methods. Among total cases, 22 cases (28. 6 %) showed at least one pathogen: 10 (45. 5 %) Escherichia coli, 9 (40. 9 %) Staphylococcus aureus, and 3 (13. 6 %) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results showed that <b>samples</b> <b>infected</b> with Pseudomonas aeruginosa recorded the highest ratio of abnormalities (96. 5 %). On the other hand <b>samples</b> <b>infected</b> with Escherichia coli recorded the second highest ratio of abnormalities (93. 75 %), while the <b>samples</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> Staphylococcus aureus showed the least ratio of abnormalities (92. 88 %).

Method : One-hundred eighteen isolates of P. vivax were prepared within 2007 - 2008 to determine dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) gene. The isolates were determined in the study of genetic diversity of dihy­dropteroate synthetase gene (dhps) of P. vivax. The study was performed via PCR test and nucleotide sequencing. Results : Of 118 blood <b>samples</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> P. vivax, 46 and 72 samples be­longed to Minab and Jask, respectively. No mutation was detected at 5 target codons.

The nature of the viruses present was determined by using the PCR with primers specific for the coat protein (CP) genes of African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic virus (CACMV). All <b>samples</b> were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> ACMV and eight of the 50 <b>samples</b> were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> both ACMV and an EACM-like virus. The complete nucleotide sequences of DNA-A and -B of representative ACMV and EACMV-like viruses were determined. The DNA-A component of the EACMV-like virus contained evidence of recombination in the AC 2 -AC 3 region and DNA-B also contained evidence of recombination in BC 1. However, both components retained gene arrangements typical of bipartite begomoviruses. When #Nicotiana benthamiana$ plants were doubly inoculated with these Cameroon isolates of ACMV and EACMV (ACM/CM, EACMV/CM) by using sap from cassava plants or infectious clones, the symptoms were more severe than for plants inoculated with either virus alone. Southern blot analysis of viral DNAs from infected plants showed that there were {{significantly higher levels of}} accumulation of both ACMV/CM components and, to a lesser extent, of EACMV/CM components in mixed-infected plants than in singly infected plants.

Rabbit PAb was used as the capture antibody. It was found the strip had no cross-reactivity with non-E. tarda bacterial microbes and the limit of detection (LOD) was 1 [*]×[*] 105 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml.

Methods: The S and C genes of HBV from 60 serum <b>samples,</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> HBV of genotypes B or C were amplified by PCR. The products were recombined with vector pEGFP-C 1, which is an internal reference for transfection, to construct the eukaryotic expression recombinant plasmids, followed by cloning and subcloning.

Using DNA extracted from the head/thorax of wild mosquitoes collected from Bagamoyo Coastal Tanzania, <b>samples</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> Plasmodium falciparum (N 89, in 2002 and N 249 in 2004) were screened by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay for mutations at Pfcrt 76 and Pfmdr 1 - 86 associated with chloroquine (CQ) resistance. The majority of isolates were of single infection (71 %), and the prevalence of mutant alleles of Pfcrt 76 decreased from 64. 5 % in 2002 to 16 % in 2004; likewise, mutant Pfmdr 1 - 86 alleles decreased from 46. 6 % to 2. 7 %. Overall, there was a decline of mutant isolates {{by a factor of}} 17 and 4 for Pfmdr 1 and Pfcrt, respectively. In contrast, isolates with wild-type alleles increased significantly from < 20 % in 2002 to 67. 6 % for Pfcrt 76 and 83. 5 % for Pfmdr 1 - 86 in 2004. This observation suggest a biologic trend of decrease of CQ mutants and a subsequent increase of CQ susceptible parasites in circulation after the discontinued use of CQ in 2001 as a first-line drug in Tanzania. High prevalence of susceptible P. falciparum found in circulation not only supports other reports of a decline of mutant parasites after a reduction of drug selection pressure but suggests that the fitness cost is high in mutan...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} nutritional {{ecology of the}} black-shanked douc (Pygathrix nigripes), an endangered colobine, in Cat Tien National Park, Vietnam. Because {{a lack of knowledge}} about the ecological needs and behavioral patterns of this colobine may well affect long-termed conservation planning, this study undertook a multi-year investigation of ranging behaviors and feeding choices in an effort to better understand the chemical make up of foods either selected or rejected by this species. In order to assess how selective the animals were in feeding, phenological transects were established to measure forest productivity throughout the year. These transects showed that Cat Tien NP is a highly seasonal environment with a marked wet season and dry season. This seasonality is a driving factor in where the doucs are ranging in order to track seasonal leaf resources. This study also showed selection for leaf material that was higher in protein, as well as higher in fiber, an interesting outcome in light of many arguments that lower fiber leaves will always be selected. Other important nutrients included higher levels of potassium, sodium, and iron. In addition to the feeding of these animals, an investigation into the parasites these animals harbor was undertaken to better understand the requirements and challenges they face. Parasite species recorded include Strongyloides sp., Trichuris sp., and Physalopterra sp., as well an unidentified tapeworm and pinworm.

40|$|Potato {{fields in}} the two main {{production}} areas of Lebanon, the Bekaa and Akkar plains, were surveyed in two growing seasons for viruses and other pathogens of significance for a potato seed certification program. ELISA tests showed that Potato virus Y (PVY) was the predominant virus, followed by Potato virus A (PVA), Potato virus X (PVX), Potato virus M (PVM), Potato virus S (PVS) and Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV). Of 789 samples tested by ELISA during the two growing seasons, 372 <b>samples</b> were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> one or more viruses. Single, double and multiple infections represented 75. 3, 21. 2 and 3. 5 % of all <b>infected</b> <b>samples,</b> respectively. Incidence of viruses was higher on crops from locally produced uncertified seed-potatoes than on crops from imported certified seed-potatoes. In nucleic acid spot hybridization assays, all 109 samples tested for {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} were negative. Other important pathogens of quarantine interest, including Clavibacter michiganensis, Ralstonia solanacearum and Synchytrium endobioticum, were not detected...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{clinical}} and epidemiological reasons, {{it is interesting}} to diagnose non-falciparum malaria to the species level. This retrospective study assessed the performance of the SD BIOLINE Malaria Antigen Pv test (FK 70), a two-band immunochromatographic test detecting Plasmodium vivax-specific lactate dehydrogenase, on samples of international travellers in a non-endemic setting. METHODS: Stored blood samples from international travellers suspected of malaria were used, with microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference method. <b>Samples</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> Plasmodium vivax (n = 100), Plasmodium falciparum (n = 75), Plasmodium ovale (n = 75) and Plasmodium malariae (n = 25) were included, as well as 100 malaria-negative samples. End points were sensitivity, specificity, inter-reader reliability and reproducibility. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the FK 70 for the diagnosis of P. vivax was 88. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 83. 6 % - 90. 3 %). For parasite densities > 500 /microl, a sensitivity of 97. 2 % (CI: 92. 6 % - 99. 1 %) was obtained. Specificity was 98. 5 %, with 4 out of 75 P. falciparum samples testing positive. None of the P. ovale samples tested positive. Nearly two-thirds (57 / 88, 64. 7 %) of positive P. vivax samples showed faint or weak line intensities, with stronger line intensities at higher parasite densities. The test showed excellent reproducibility and reliability for test results and line intensities (kappa values exceeding 0. 98 and 0. 87 respectively). CONCLUSION: The FK 70 test performed well in diagnosing P. vivax infections in a non-endemic reference setting. It can be of added value to microscopy in species differentiation of malaria infections, especially at parasite densities > 500 /microl...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey on}} postharvest {{handling}} and technology processing of coffee beans at farmer, trader and exporter levels {{was conducted in}} West Lampung a nd Tanggamus regencies of Lampung province during harvest time (July 1998). Interviews and sampling of coffee beans were carried out during the survey. The number of respondents at farmer, trader and exporter levels was 22, 20 and 4, respectively, {{while the number of}} samples collected from each level was 20. All samples were analyzed for moisture content, physical quality, insect and fungal infestation, reducing sugar content, and coffee cupping. The results of the interviews indicated that posth arvest handling and technol ogy processing became better from farmers to exporters. Moisture contents of coffee beans collected from farmers and traders were higher than the tolerable limit recommended by SNI (13 %). Physical quality of coffee beans collected from exporters was higher than that collected from farmers and traders. Insects were found on coffee beans collected from farmers, traders and exporters, but the number of species and the percentage of samples infested by insects from each level were relatively low. The predominant species was Liposcelis entomophila. The number of fungal species on coffee beans collected from farmers was higher than that collected from traders and exporters. The predominant species at the three levels was Aspergillus niger, but the lowest percentage of beans <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> this fungus was found on coffee beans collected from expo rters. The lowest percentage of <b>samples</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> all fungi was also found on coffee beans collected from exporters. Reducing sugar content of coffee beans collected from exporters was lower than that from farmers and traders. Aroma and flavor values tended to increase from farmers through traders to exporters, while the body decreased. Some off-flavors (i. e. earthy, mouldy, fermented and woody) were encountered in a few coffee samples from farmers as well as from traders. Ther e was no off-flavor encountered in the coffee samples from exporters...|$|R
40|$|The {{phytosanitary}} status of pome fruit trees was examined in Tunisia, in surveys conducted in spring 2009 and 2010, {{in the main}} Tunisian mother blocks. A total of 248 samples were collected (111 from apple, 106 from pear and 31 from quince), and tested {{for the presence of}} Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) and Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) using ELISA and RT-PCR, and for Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV) using RT-PCR. 37 % of the <b>samples</b> were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> at least one virus. ACLSV was the most widespread virus (34 % of samples), followed by ApMV (4 %). Furthermore, molecular analysis showed that 69 % of the <b>sampled</b> trees were <b>infected</b> and apple was the most infected species (80 %), followed by pear (75 %) and quince (10 %). ASPV was the most prevalent virus (46 %), followed by ACLSV (39 %) and ApMV (10). Mixed infections occurred in several trees, and the most common combination was ASPV+ACLSV (23 %).

40|$|A {{previously}} cloned 1. 8 kb PCR Polymyxa betae DNA fragment {{has been}} fully sequenced {{and used to}} design PCR primers for the specific detection of P. betae in sugar beet seedling roots. The primers did not amplify sequences from fungi closely related to P. betae, or from sugar beet or other microorganisms commonly associated wit h sugar beet roots. Protocols which combine PCR with Southern/dot blot analysis of products were developed to detect P. betae in sugar beet roots. A nested PCR protocol was also developed and shown to provide levels of sensitivity that allow more rapid screening for P. betae infection. Subsequently, PCR was used to detect P. betae {{in a survey of}} infection incidence in 65 sugar beet Fields, Seventy one percent of fields and 33 % of plants <b>sampled</b> were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> late June, with a lower incidence on peat as compared to mineral soil...|$|R
40|$|The fig mosaic disease (FMD) is a wide-spread {{disease in}} fig growing countries. This disease can be {{transmitted}} by vegetative propagation material and eriophyd mite, Aceria ficus Cotte.

40|$|Abstract Background The SD FK 80 P. f/P. v Malaria Antigen Rapid Test (Standard Diagnostics, Korea) (FK 80) is a three-band malaria rapid {{diagnostic}} test detecting Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein- 2 (HRP- 2) and Plasmodium vivax -specific lactate dehydrogenase (Pv-pLDH). The present study assessed its {{performance in a}} non-endemic setting. Methods Stored blood samples (n = 416) from international travellers suspected of malaria were used, with microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference method. <b>Samples</b> <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> Plasmodium falciparum (n = 178), Plasmodium vivax (n = 99), Plasmodium ovale (n = 75) and Plasmodium malariae (n = 24) were included, as well as 40 malaria negative samples. Results Overall sensitivities for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax were 91. 6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 86. 2 % - 95. 0 %) and 75. 8 % (65. 9 % - 83. 6 %). For P. falciparum, sensitivity at parasite densities ≥ 100 /μl was 94. 6 % (88. 8 % - 97. 6 %); for P. vivax, sensitivity at parasite densities ≥ 500 /μl was 86. 8 % (75. 4 % - 93. 4 %). Four P. falciparum samples showed a Pv-pLDH line, {{three of them had}} parasite densities exceeding 50. 000 /μl. Two P. vivax samples, one P. ovale and one P. malariae sample showed a HRP- 2 line. For the HRP- 2 and Pv-pLDH lines, respectively 81. 4 % (136 / 167) and 55. 8 % (43 / 77) of the true positive results were read as medium or strong line intensities. The FK 80 showed good reproducibility and reliability for test results and line intensities (kappa values for both exceeding 0. 80). Conclusion The FK 80 test performed satisfactorily in diagnosing P. falciparum and P. vivax infections in a non-endemic setting. </p...|$|R
