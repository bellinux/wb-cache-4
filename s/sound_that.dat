5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket continues the pop punk <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E
5|$|A funk {{and dance}} album, Rhythm Killers has a dense <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> {{incorporates}} contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs {{are characterized by}} electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album has been noted by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's densely layered production.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
50|$|In Yatzachi Zapotec, it {{is easier}} to think of consonants as having a {{distinction}} between fortis and lenis rather than voiced and voiceless. Fortis describes <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> require a greater effort to articulate, while lenis describes <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> require lesser effort. Voiced sounds are lenis, and <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> are either voiceless or aspirated are considered fortis.|$|R
50|$|The {{innovation}} of lossy {{audio compression}} {{was to use}} psychoacoustics to recognize that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human auditory system. Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant <b>sounds,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> occur {{at the same time}} as louder sounds. Those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all.|$|R
50|$|In North America, {{languages}} from {{a number}} of families have <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> labialized (and vowels <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> rounded) without participation of the lips. See Tillamook language for an example.|$|R
5|$|Following the Velvet Revolution, an {{amendment}} act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean criminal record, {{physically and mentally}} <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection. Newly, denial of license could be challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Once the P. rebeli larvae {{infiltrate}} the host’s brood, they ascend {{to the highest}} social ranks of the host's hierarchy by using acoustics to achieve social acceptance from worker M. schencki ants. P. rebeli larvae and pupa accomplish this by mimicking the <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> {{the queen of the}} ant colony makes, both while as a larva and as a pupa in the colony.|$|E

5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|Rooted in the 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene, Butthole Surfers {{quickly became}} {{known for their}} chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, {{as well as their}} use of sound manipulation and tape editing.|$|E
5|$|Taborn prefers earlier {{models of}} Fender Rhodes, for their raunchier sound. He also {{attempts}} to retain {{control over the}} <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is presented to an audience when playing electronic instruments: he links his instruments to his own amplifier, and then has the venue take its feed from that amplifier.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{music was}} {{performed}} by the then-unknown group Earth, Wind & Fire, who {{were living in a}} single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created a <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{names of}} the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters. Letters which are not directly derived from these alphabets, such as , may {{have a variety of}} names, sometimes based on the appearance of the symbol or on the <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> it represents. In Unicode, some of the letters of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the letters from the Greek section.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{tour with}} Elliot Minor, {{the writing process}} for the new album began. Although all the music's writing was {{credited}} to the entire band, vocalist Josh Franceschi and guitarist Max Helyer were usually the biggest creative forces among the group, being responsible for the ideas behind the songs. The band's work resulted in the album having a <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> most critics associated with pop punk, though this result was unintended. The album was recorded in two weeks at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire with producers Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Sinhala {{alphabet}} {{differs from}} other Indo-Aryan alphabets {{in that it}} contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it.

5|$|For Myst III: Exile and Myst IV: Revelation, {{composer}} Jack Wall {{created the}} music, developing {{a more active}} musical style different from Miller's ambient themes. Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games {{as an opportunity to}} give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score, and tried to create a distinctive <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> was still recognizable as Myst music. In Revelation, Wall adapted the themes for the recurring characters of Myst, and collaborated with Peter Gabriel, who provided a song to the game as well as voicework.|$|E
5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E
50|$|According to McKenzie {{the movie}} ran {{for three weeks}} in a Melbourne cinema, got reviews and didn't make any money: I've got mixed {{feelings}} about that film. I think probably my biggest disappointment with {{it is that we}} never had any money to do a soundtrack properly. That particular film should live on the soundtrack. It's all about the <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> you hear, the <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> you replay, the various <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> represent the different parties in the flats and how they impinge on the lead character's life. It never worked particularly well. We never really had the time or the resources to do it.|$|R

5|$|Levesque {{is a fan}} of {{the band}} Motörhead (which has {{performed}} three different entrance themes for Triple H over his career), and was good friends with lead singer Lemmy. To pay homage to both Lemmy and the band, Levesque wore Lemmy-inspired facial hair during a large portion of his career. After Lemmy died on December 28, 2015, Levesque attended his funeral on January 9, 2016, where he spoke about the gift of <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> Lemmy and Motörhead have given to him and the friendship they had over the years.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the album}} was {{conducted}} in a generally informal manner and took place at Electric Lady Studios simultaneously with recording for Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun (2000) and Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000). This led to impromptu collaborations and a distinctive <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is featured on the three albums. Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, and Mos Def. Voodoos sessions also had visitors not associated with the project, including record producer Rick Rubin, comedian Chris Rock, and rock musician Eric Clapton. D'Angelo previewed songs for them, which they found impressive.|$|E
