We consider a typical CCTV scenario in Liverpool Street Underground Station in the City of London as an application example and we evaluate the system performance on more than 1800 events to demonstrate its practicality and reliability. ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{generally}} thought that aposematic coloration {{is most effective}} in deterring predators when insects group together. Indeed, the most common mode of active defense among social caterpillars is aposematic display, often combined with synchronous body rearing, flicking, and “en masse” regurgitation of toxic or unpalatable chemicals. Studies indicate that [...] the spread of alarm through colonies of social caterpillars is mediated largely by tactile and, possibly, visual cues. Caterpillars can detect the airborne sounds generated by the beating wings of flying wasps and flies and respond with rapidly jerking movements. Vibrational signals {{set up by the}} agitated caterpillars and propagated by the communal web would appear the most likely <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>alerting</b> the colony to danger.|$|R

Previous studies of this relationship have treated the level of environmental regulation as exogenous, and found a negligible correlation between environmental regulation and trade flows.
