This paper highlights why alignment gaps exist between business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> IT <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> suggests methods to minimize those strategy alignment gaps. Senior management of Fortune 50 financial services company were interviewed to examine alignment gaps between business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> IT <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> the results suggest that improving the business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> vision, and communication of the business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> vision has the greatest potential for improving the alignment of business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> IT <b>strategy.</b> The degree of alignment between various business areas was found to {{have a major impact on}} the alignment of business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> IT <b>strategy.</b> From a longitudinal case study of various corporate in the past, the results show an unaligned strategic information system (with an implemented IT strategy that varies from the intended IT strategy) impedes the development of IT. Following effective methods of aligning IT <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> business <b>strategy</b> can be applied: (i) developing a robust, business architecture, and, (ii) establishing a separate, centralized IT department, (iii) Deploying effectively the applications of IT, TQM and ITIL Framework, (iv) Making best use of IT Services and state-of-art architectures, and many more...|$|R

5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool <b>strategies</b> <b>and</b> demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|During {{the period}} January 2010 to December 2012, Surface Investments (Pvt) Ltd {{performed}} inconsistently {{and failed to}} achieve set targets. The companyâ€™s set goals and objectives were to attain a target of 600 metric tonnes of crushed seed per day. The studyâ€™s overall objective {{was to investigate the}} existence of fit between HR <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> the business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> the implications for performance at the company. The study proposed that there was no fit between HR <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> the business <b>strategy</b> at Surface Investments (Pvt) Ltd in the period covered by the study and that this contributed to the firmâ€™s failure to achieve set production targets of crushed seed. Literature review was undertaken to identify key concepts that underpin SHRM. This study adopted both qualitative and quantitative approaches but was more qualitative. The research used random sampling to choose 50 participants who consisted of 5 managers, 25 middle managers and 20 professionals. Primary data was collected using both interviews and self â€“ administered questionnaires. The following were the major findings of the study; in the year 2010, there was no optimal fit between HR <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> business <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> this was caused by a weak recruitment <b>and</b> selection <b>strategy,</b> weak learning <b>and</b> development <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> a weak industrial relations strategy. However, from mid 2011 to December 2012, because effective human resource planning, succession planning, reward management, performance management, recruitment and selection, training management and implementation of a sound industrial relations management system were now in place, there was an improvement in performance. The researcher recommended that the company improves on its recruitment <b>and</b> selection <b>strategy,</b> learning <b>and</b> development <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> industrial relations <b>strategy,</b> to ensure that optimal fit between HR <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> business <b>strategy</b> is achieved.

40|$|Abstract – IT <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> E-business {{has come}} to stay as {{important}} issues in many organisations.

These requirements for support and enablement of the IT <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> E-business are increasingly present in many organisations. IT <b>strategy</b> <b>and</b> E-business are breaking old barriers and building new interconnections in what is referred to by many specialists as the emerging Global Village. IT is bringing business communities and the world at large, closer, and making the global village smaller.
