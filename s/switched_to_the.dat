5|$|Although {{initially}} the infantry battalions of the 6th Division adopted the Australian battalion structure of two rifle companies, a support company, a {{light machine gun}} platoon and an administrative headquarters, they soon <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British structure with four rifle companies– each consisting of three platoons with three sections– and a headquarters company consisting of signals, carrier, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortar platoons.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, two {{publishers}} {{started a}} legal battle {{for the right to}} the names of the newspapers and magazines. Vandersteen, caught in the middle, worked a while for both, but eventually <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new owners of De Standaard. He continued to work for Ons Volkske, which was now renamed 't Kapoentje for a few more months. The publishers of De Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske, which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947. By 1947, seven albums were available, and the first ones were already reprinted. The first albums of De Familie Snoek had also appeared by then. Supported by large publicity campaigns, they sold very well: the first Snoek album was in its third impression by 1948. The popularity of Vandersteen, and the impact comics had in Flanders, is attested by the 25,000 readers who <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Standaard {{at the same time as}} Vandersteen did.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of {{transition}} to war, the V Bomber squadrons were to deploy four aircraft at short notice to each of 26 pre-prepared dispersal airfields around the United Kingdom.

Each call entering an ingress crossbar switch can be routed through any of the available middle stage crossbar <b>switches,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relevant egress crossbar switch. A middle stage crossbar is available for a particular new call if both the link connecting <b>the</b> ingress <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle stage <b>switch,</b> and the link connecting <b>the</b> middle stage <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> egress <b>switch,</b> are free.|$|R

5|$|A {{turning point}} for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650yd {{freestyle}} behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.

5|$|After 1952, Willamette Law {{received}} a large Lady Justice statue when the Marion County Courthouse was demolished {{to make way}} for a new one. In 1959, the school started a law review, while enrollment increased to 185 by the mid-1960s. Because of the increased enrollment, the College of Law Foundation was created by the university's trustees in 1959 to explore the construction of a new facility. Willamette <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> awarding of the Juris Doctor from the bachelor of laws, phased in beginning in 1965.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes.

Local households gradually <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E
