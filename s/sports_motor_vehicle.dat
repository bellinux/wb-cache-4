Although these are but a common few events, there {{is one of two}} mechanisms of injury that remain constant during the point of injury.

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{pretest and}} posttest comparative design {{was used to evaluate}} the outcome of implementing Think First for Kids (TFFK), an injury prevention program for children grades 1, 2, and 3, among intervention and controls schools. The study showed that children often lack basic knowledge regarding safety and do not recognize behaviors considered high risk for injury. By using multivariate analysis, the intervention children had a significantly greater increase in knowledge about the brain and spinal cord and safe behaviors to prevent traumatic injury, and a decrease in self-reported, high-risk behaviors (p,. 001) when compared with control subjects, adjusting for the covariates gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. African American and Hispanic children, although displaying the lowest test scores at baseline, had the largest absolute improvement in posttest scores.

30|$|The {{existing}} literature reports {{two sets of}} incidence of these fractures: The first is the largest and is associated with young active population (<b>sports,</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> accidents), whereas the second is associated with elderly individuals (osteoporotic fractures with simple falls) [4]. A direct blow to the shoulder {{is the most common}} mechanism of injury that produces a mid-shaft fracture of the clavicle. As the shoulder is subjected to a high compression force from lateral side, the clavicle and its articulations are the main areas to get affected as they resist these forces. Most (85 %) clavicle fractures occur in the mid-shaft as the bone is narrowest and enveloping soft tissue structures (which may help dissipate injury force) are most scarce [17]. In our study, the age group was 20 – 50  years. The mean age was 35.2  years in group 1 and 32.4  years in group 2. The dominant side was affected in 25 cases (41.66 %) out of 60 subjects, whereas remaining 35 cases (58.34 %) had fracture on the non-dominant side which similar to the incidence reported in the literature [18, 19]. Functional impairment of the shoulder and the upper limb can be extremely variable. A careful clinico-radiologic assessment is absolutely necessary to exclude associated chest injuries, such as pneumothorax or haemothorax, which are reported in the literature to occur at rates of up to 3 % [8]. In the present study, 14 patients (23.3 %) had associated injuries. However, none of these patients had pneumothorax or haemothorax or neurovascular injury.|$|E

40|$|Scrotal trauma {{accounts}} {{for less than}} 1 % of all trauma-related injuries, because of the anatomic location and mobility of the scrotum (Cass and Luxenberg 1991). The peak occurrence of scrotal trauma is in the age range of 10 – 30 years (Wessells and Long 2006). Typically it results from direct injury due to <b>sport</b> injury, <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> collision, or altercation (Deurdulian et al. 2007). Penetrating trauma is also possible, due to gunshot wounds, animal attacks, and self-mutilation.

The severity of nerve injuries may vary from a mild stretch to the nerve root tearing away from the spinal cord (avulsion). [...] "The brachial plexus may be injured by falls from a height on {{to the side of}} the head and shoulder, whereby the nerves of the plexus are violently stretched… The brachial plexus may also be injured by direct violence or gunshot wounds, by violent traction on the arm, or by efforts at reducing a dislocation of the shoulder joint".|$|R
30|$|Our {{results show}} that skiing, <b>sports</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{accidents}} are increasingly common modes of injury, {{in addition to the}} commonly described fall off of a bicycle. Most studies advocate non-operative management for type I Meyer’s and McKeever’s fractures and reduction and internal fixation for type II and III fractures. Better long-term results have been reported with arthroscopic surgery compared to open surgery. There is no consensus as to which type of fixation is best suited for tibial eminence fractures; methods available include excision of the bony fragment, K-wire, screw and, absorbable suture fixation, and more recently, suture anchor and meniscal arrow. The main complications reported include arthrofibrosis, non-union, mal-union, pain and severe laxity. Early post-operative range of motion exercises have been shown to reduce the incidence of arthrofibrosis.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are important stabilizers of the knee. These ligaments are commonly injured in <b>sports</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> accidents. An accurate diagnosis of cruciate ligament injuries is vital in patient care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can diagnose cruciate ligament injuries with high accuracy. The imaging diagnosis {{should be based on}} primary signs, although the secondary signs are sometimes useful, particularly in chronic cases. The detection of associated injuries of other structures of the knee, including menisci, collateral ligaments, cartilage, and bone, are also important. Accurate interpretation of the MRI examination requires a meticulous MRI technique, knowledge of the imaging anatomy, and understanding of the lesion appearance. This pictorial essay reviews the MRI appearance of normal and injured cruciate ligaments. Mechanisms of injury, primary and secondary MRI signs, and associated abnormalities are discussed...|$|R
