30|$|Delays in <b>structural</b> <b>formwork,</b> {{which account}} for a large {{percentage}} of the critical path (CP) of the <b>structural</b> <b>formwork,</b> have a significant adverse impact on the overall <b>structural</b> <b>formwork,</b> including subsequent processing. Therefore, it is essential to identify and manage the delay factors that can occur in the formwork in advance. However, according to result of survey, it understood that the free-form plane formwork. This delay factor is due to the increased amount of nonstandard formwork, which increases the formwork installation and dismantling time, and also increases the time and cost of making nonstandard formwork. To solve this problem, it is necessary to find ways to reduce the amount of nonstandard formwork when planning the form layout. However, if the number of nonstandard forms is large, one solution might be to shorten the working time by increasing the number of workers. In addition, it is necessary to anticipate the changing quantity of the mold and the time taken for the required amount and to consider these factors beforehand when planning the T/C.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce on-site {{building}} time, the construction industry shows an increasing interest in stay-in-place formwork with a reinforcement function after concrete hardening, such as CFRP formwork confinement for columns. The current combined systems however do not answer the demand of the building industry for a material system that is both lightweight and fire safe. High performance textile reinforced cement (TRC) composites can address this need. They can be particularly interesting for the shear reinforcement of concrete beams. This paper describes a preliminary analysis and feasibility study on <b>structural</b> stay-in-place <b>formwork</b> made of TRC. Comparative bending experiments demonstrate that a fully steel reinforced beam and an equivalent beam with shear reinforcement in TRC formwork show similar yielding behaviour, indicating that the TRC shear reinforcement system actually works. Moreover, the cracking moment of the concrete {{was more or less}} doubled, resulting in a much lower deflection in serviceability limit state than calculated. Digital image correlation measurements show that the latter is due to the crack bridging capacity of the external TRC shear reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} stay-in-place (SIP) <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> has the {{potential}} to simplify and accelerate the construction process to a great extent. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) SIP <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> offers further potential benefits over existing formwork systems in terms of ease and speed of construction, improved site safety and reduced long-term maintenance in corrosive environments. However, it is not without its limitations, including primarily the possibility of a lack of ductility, which is a key concern regarding the use of FRP <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> in practice. This thesis presents the findings of an experimental and analytical investigation into a novel FRP SIP <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> system for a concrete slab with a particular emphasis on its ability to achieve a ductile behaviour. The proposed composite system consists of a moulded glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to square pultruded GFRP box sections. The grating is subsequently filled with concrete to form a concrete-FRP composite floor slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the box sections allow concrete studs to form at the grating/box-section interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further mechanically connect the grating and box sections. An initial experimental investigation into using GFRP grating as confinement for concrete showed that a significant increase in ultimate strength and strain capacity could be achieved compared to unconfined concrete. This enhanced strain capacity in compression allows greater use of the FRP capacity in tension when used in a floor slab system. Further experimental investigation into developing ductility at the grating/box-section interface showed that the proposed shear connection exhibited elastic-‘plastic’ behaviour. This indicated the feasibility of achieving ductility through progressive and controlled longitudinal shear failure. Following these component tests on the concrete-filled grating and the shear connectors, a total of six (300 x 150 x 3000) mm slab specimens were designed and tested under five-point bending. It was found that the behaviour of all specimens was ductile in nature, demonstrating that the proposed progressive longitudinal shear failure was effective. A three-stage analytical model was developed to predict the load at which the onset of longitudinal shear failure occurred, the stiffness achieved during the post elastic behaviour and, finally, the deflection at which ultimate failure occurred. Close agreement was found between experimental results and the theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

No slip was observed between the concrete and GFRP box sections until the longitudinal shear failure occurred at the initial peak. The load capacity carried on increasing at a reduced stiffness in a progressive manner, with significant residual strength and slip observed. All specimens failed by the separation of the webs and flange at the upper corners of the box sections due to the large curvature induced. Full-scale experimental results demonstrated that the controlled longitudinal shear failure provided deformability to the overall system and a robust interaction between the concrete and FRP formwork was achieved...|$|E

The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to rectangular pultruded GFRP box sections as <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the box sections at a variable spacing allow concrete 'studs' to form at the grating/box interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and box sections. Following preliminary component tests on two concrete blocks, experimental {{results show that the}} concrete filled grating provides a 100 % increase in strain capacity when compared to a plain concrete block. It is therefore feasible to provide ductility to the complete system through the concrete in compression. Four push-out GFRP grating-box section specimens were then tested in double shear to assess the shear behaviour of the proposed GFRP dowel shear connector in both partially concrete-filled and fully concrete-filled box sections. From the resulting load-slip curves, a progressive longitudinal shear failure was seen to be provided by such a connection. The experimental results indicate that this type of shear connection can provide robustness and reasonable ductility to the system.

40|$|Effect of test {{parameters}} on flexural strength of circular fiber-reinforced polymer-confined concrete beams Hamdy M Mohamed 1, 2 and Radhouane Masmoudi 1 This paper presents experimental {{results of a}} study conducted to investigate the use of filament-wound fiber-reinforced polymer tubes as a stay-in-place <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> for concrete beams. The experimental study was carried out on a total of seven concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams of 213 mm diameter and 2000 mm long. Five concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams and two control specimens without tube were tested under four-point bending. One control specimen was reinforced with spiral steel while the other had no transverse reinforcement. The {{test parameters}} used in this investigation include the type of internal reinforcement (steel or glass fiber-reinforced polymer bars), the type of transverse reinforcement (spiral-steel or fiber-reinforced polymer tube), fiber-reinforced polymer tube thickness and the concrete compressive strength. The fiber orientations of the tubes were mainly in the hoop direction. The test result indicated that the two control specimens failed in shear; however, using glass fiber-reinforced polymer tubes instead of transverse spiral-steel changed the mode of failure of the five concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams to flexural failure. The experimental cracking moments of the steel and fiber-reinforced polymer-concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube beams were compared to theoretical predictions provided by North American codes, design guidelines and the available equations in the literature. The test {{results indicate that the}} fiber-reinforced polymer tube enhances the crack and ultimate moment capacities of the test specimens, whereas it provides a longitudinal reinforcement in the tension side. In addition, improvement to the crack moment equation is suggested to account for the effect of confinement...|$|E
40|$|Stay-in-place (SIP) {{formwork}} {{has been}} used {{as an alternative to the}} conventional formwork system. The systems are mainly assembled on site, hence simplifying the construction process and reducing the construction time as the removal procedure has been eliminated. SIP formwork systems can be divided into two main categories; structural and non-structural formwork, based on their contribution to resist applied loads. The <b>structural</b> <b>formwork</b> provides the same advantages as the non-structural formwork, in addition to its contribution to resist the applied loads. As a result, the cross section and the reinforcement of the structural member can be reduced. Recently, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) {{has been used}} as a stay-in-place formwork because of its lower cost compared to other materials, durability, and ease to assemble. The PVC SIP formwork consists of interconnected elements; panels and connectors that serve as permanent formwork for the concrete walls. In this study, the behaviour of the PVC encased reinforced concrete walls under eccentric compression loading was investigated. The variables in this study were the type of the specimen (PVC encased or control), the longitudinal reinforcement (4 - 10 M or 4 - 15 M rebars) and the eccentricity of the applied compression load (33. 87 mm, 67. 73 mm and 101. 6 mm). Generally, the control walls (without PVC encasement) failed by yielding of the steel followed by crushing of the concrete, or by crushing of the concrete without yielding of the steel. For the PVC encased walls, buckling of the PVC occurred after the concrete crushed. The PVC encased specimens showed a higher peak load than their peer control walls. The effect of the PVC on increasing the ultimate capacity at a given eccentricity was more significant for the walls reinforced with 4 - 10 M than the walls reinforced with 4 - 15 M. For the lowest reinforcement ratio (4 - 10 M), the PVC encased specimens showed an increase in peak load by 37. 2 % and 17. 1 % at an eccentricity of 67. 73 mm and 101. 6 mm, respectively. When the reinforcement was increased to 4 - 15 M, the increase in the peak load dropped at all eccentricities to 10 %. For the vertical and the mid-span deflection, the PVC encased specimens and the control specimens showed the same values. Also, the test results showed an increase in the energy absorption capacity for the PVC encased specimens compared to the controls specimens, where the effect for the walls reinforced with 4 - 10 M was higher than the walls reinforced with 4 - 15 M at a given eccentricity. An analytical model was developed to predict the ultimate load capacity of the specimens taking into consideration the effect of the PVC on the load carrying capacity of the walls. The provision was derived based on the moment magnification factor method in which the effect of secondary stresses associated with the column deformations was taken into consideration. The calculated capacities of the PVC encased specimens showed a conservative error of 5. 9 % on average...|$|E
