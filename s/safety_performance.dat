40|$|Safety surveys {{normally}} {{focus on}} the influence of formal safety management (bureaucracy) on <b>safety</b> <b>performances,</b> while neglecting the impact of informal coping strategies (craftsman-ship) that are the main topic of ethnographic safety studies. Based on a survey in a Dutch en-ergy company (N= 265) we show this negligence is problematic. First, the effect of formal safety management on self-reported incidents and accidents depends on informal coping strategies. It is shown that informal coping strategies facilitate formal safety management. Second, informal coping strategies influence <b>safety</b> <b>performances</b> independent of formal safety management. The perceived utilisation of tacit knowledge improves safety records (i. e. self-reported incidents and accidents) because it reduces unsafe behaviour, while perceived presence of professional discretion worsens it because it enhances unsafe behaviour. Our find-ings show that the findings of ethnographic safety studies can be incorporated fruitfully in safety surveys...|$|R

30|$|However, {{practitioners}} who should design safety-based interventions on existing roads, including {{the processes of}} detecting safety issues, selecting and design countermeasures, assess their impact on <b>safety</b> <b>performances,</b> should address two concurrent matters. On one hand, they should abide to local regulations for the road design process and the road safety management, if relevant. On the other hand, they may need to rely on international (or anyway not local) tools for the crucial aim of quantifying <b>safety</b> <b>performances.</b> However, the path tending to the equilibrium and convergence between these two objectives may encounter several practical problems. Thus, the {{detailed analysis of the}} design process of road safety-based interventions in a local context may be useful, by considering the most relevant methodological problems, and trying to address them from a research-driven perspective. In fact, while research is broadly developed in several road safety aspects related to the inquired process, applied research on the development/application of overall design methods itself to local conditions, is scarce. The ANRAM procedure, based on the HSM methodology and applied to local conditions, is an example in this sense.|$|R

40|$|Although {{reengineering}} is strategically advantageous for organisations {{in order}} to keep functional and sustainable, safety must remain a priority and respective efforts need to be maintained. This paper suggests the combination of soft system methodology (SSM) and Pareto analysis on the scope of <b>safety</b> management <b>performance</b> evaluation, and presents the results of a survey, which was conducted {{in order to}} assess the effectiveness, efficacy and ethicality of the individual components of an organisation's safety program. The research employed quantitative and qualitative data and ensured a broad representation of functional managers and safety professionals, who collectively hold the responsibility for planning, implementing and monitoring safety practices. The results showed that SSM can support the assessment of <b>safety</b> management <b>performance</b> by revealing weaknesses of safety initiatives, and Pareto analysis can underwrite the prioritisation of the remedies required. The specific methodology might be adapted by any organisation that requires a deep evaluation of its <b>safety</b> management <b>performance,</b> seeks to uncover the mechanisms that affect such performance, and, under limited resources, needs to focus on the most influential deficiencies. <b>safety</b> management; <b>performance</b> evaluation; soft system methodology; SSM; Pareto analysis; performance measurement; aviation industry; aviation safety...|$|R
