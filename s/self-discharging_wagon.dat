50|$|Since 1958, the <b>Self-discharging</b> <b>wagon</b> with swing-roof {{has been}} {{employed}} {{in large numbers}} in Europe. In the transport of hygroscopic bulk commodities, they have fully replaced both the {{wagon with opening roof}} and level floor (see above) as well as the standard covered wagon.|$|E
50|$|They {{were loaded}} {{from above and}} unloaded, like covered wagons, through the side doors. Because {{unloading}} involved a lot of manual work, alternatives were already being sought by the 1920s. In the 1950s the <b>self-discharging</b> <b>wagon</b> with roof (see below) completely ousted the lidded wagon from its original field of operations. The last large batch of lidded wagons was procured by the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Open wagons {{of special}} design (UIC Class F) - {{especially}} <b>self-discharging</b> <b>wagons</b> (see photo) of type Fcs092.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{rationalize}} the {{loading and unloading}} of bulk goods, the Deutsche Reichsbahn, before the Second World War, had <b>Self-discharging</b> <b>wagons</b> with lids (Selbstentladewagen mit Klappdeckeln) built. They were designed as saddle wagons which enabled rapid gravity discharge.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} funnel-shaped <b>self-discharging</b> <b>wagons</b> is also classed as special wagons. Their {{external}} shape resembles the open hoppers, {{but they have}} an enclosed roof with loading hatches or {{in some other way}} do not fulfil the criteria for a wagon with opening roof.|$|R
50|$|G wagons {{were also}} {{frequently}} filled with bulk materials that were {{vulnerable to the}} weather. Special wall attachments were developed, especially for the transportation of grain, with which the side doors could be closed. Today there are <b>self-discharging</b> <b>wagons</b> with opening roofs available {{for this type of}} freight that are quicker to load and unload.|$|R
50|$|Hopper wagons {{can only}} be {{unloaded}} by gravity with no external assistance and are therefore also classed as <b>self-discharging</b> <b>wagons.</b> The majority may be filled, when at rail or road level, by high-level discharge chutes (whose ends are more than 70 cm above {{the top of the}} rails) or conveyor belts. Because a controlled amount of the load can be discharged at any place the wagons may be sent anywhere and are even used individually. Railway companies also use hoppers as departmental wagons in maintenance of way trains for ballasting the track.|$|R
50|$|Several {{locomotive}} builders produced fireless engines {{throughout the}} 20th century. Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works was still building {{them in the}} 1980s. Some fireless locomotives are in daily use even in 2016. One example is the large coal-fired power station in Mannheim where coal is delivered by rail in long trains of <b>self-discharging</b> hopper <b>wagons.</b> Three fireless engines are used to shunt the hoppers on the premises of the power station.|$|R
