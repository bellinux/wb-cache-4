500|$|Steam's {{customer}} {{service has been}} highly criticized, with users citing poor response times or lack of response in regards to issues such as being locked out of one's library or having a non-working game redemption key. In March 2015, Valve {{had been given a}} failing [...] "F" [...] grade from the Better Business Bureau due to a large number of complaints in Valve's handling of Steam, leading Valve's Erik Johnson to state that [...] "we don't feel like our {{customer service}} support is where it needs to be right now". Johnson stated the company plans to better integrate customer support features into the Steam client and be more responsive to such issues. In May 2017, in addition to hiring more staff for customer <b>service,</b> <b>Valve</b> publicized pages that show the number and type of customer service requests it was handling over the last 90 days, with an average of 75,000 entered each day. Of those, requests for refunds were the largest segment, and which Valve could resolve within hours, followed by account security and recovery requests. Valve stated at this time that 98% of all service requests were processed within 24 hours of filing.|$|E
500|$|Without {{more direct}} {{interaction}} on the curation process, allowing hundreds more {{games on the}} <b>service,</b> <b>Valve</b> had looked to find methods to allow players to find games {{they would be more}} likely to buy based on previous purchase patterns. [...] The September 2014 [...] "Discovery Update" [...] added tools that would allow existing Steam users to be curators for game recommendations, and sorting functions that presented more popular titles and recommended titles specific to the user, as to allow more games to be introduced on Steam without the need of Steam Greenlight, while providing some means to highlight user-recommended games. This Discovery update was considered successful by Valve, as they reported in March 2015 in seeing increased use of the Steam Storefront and an increase in 18% of sales by revenue from just prior to the update. A second Discovery update was released November 2016, giving users more control over what titles they want to see or ignore within the Steam Store, alongside tools for developers and publishers to better customize and present their game within these new users preferences. By February 2017, Valve reported that with the second Discovery update, the number of games shown to users via the store's front page increased by 42%, with more conversions into sales from that viewership. In 2016, more games are meeting a rough metric of success defined by Valve as selling more than $200,000 in revenues in its first 90 days of release.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina.

Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the <b>service</b> <b>valve</b> hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>service</b> <b>valve</b> is a valve used to {{separate}} {{one piece of}} equipment from another in any system where liquids or gases circulate. Two types of service valves are marketed: the Schrader-type valve and the stem-type <b>service</b> <b>valve.</b> Specialized versions are made for specific purposes, such as the Rotolock valve (a stem-type valve also called a Rotalock valve [...] ), which is a special refrigeration valve with a teflon ring seated against a machined surface enclosed by a threaded fitting; this valve allows the technician to remove all refrigerant from the compressor without requiring removal of the system charge.|$|E

50|$|The liquid outlet {{is usually}} used to supply {{fuel to the}} engine, and is usually {{referred}} to as the <b>service</b> <b>valve.</b> Modern service valves incorporate an electric shut-off solenoid.

5000|$|The game {{struggled}} with Valve Corporation's Steam <b>service.</b> <b>Valve</b> initially {{refused to allow}} it on its Greenlight system while the developer was in talks with another publisher, and later pulled it from Steam after its lead developer, Mike Maulbeck, threatened Valve's CEO, Gabe Newell, on social media.

50|$|When gases are {{supplied}} in gas cylinders, {{the cylinders}} have a stop angle valve {{at the end}} on top. Often, gas cylinders are somewhat long and narrow and may stand upright on a flattened bottom at one end with the valve at the top.

5000|$|One {{technical}} challenge that faces console-based cross-platform play is the network communication between platforms, managing the different protocols used by each service. Though these {{technical challenge}}s can be overcome, the primarily limiting factor for cross-platform play {{has been the}} terms of service and acceptable use policy that developers and players must abide by when using the consoles' online services. Sony's Shuhei Yoshida, in discussing the possibility of cross-platform play between PlayStation and Xbox platforms, noted that [...] "the technical aspect could be the easiest" [...] to overcome compared to policy and business-related issues. [...] Some online services have restrictions on age-related content which prevent certain games from using cross-platform play or to disable certain features to allow it; Dave Hagewood, a lead developer for Rocket League, noted {{that they had to}} launch their game, which supports cross-platform play between Windows and the PlayStation 4 versions, without the ability for players to communicate across systems due to content regulations Sony has in place; they were able to later patch in filters to allow for this communications under Sony's <b>service.</b> <b>Valve</b> had to drop PlayStation 3 and PC cross-platform play from its 2012 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive just before launch as they wanted the ability to patch the game on a frequent basis, which would be limited by Sony's certification process on the PlayStation system; they had similarly tried to bring Steamworks to the Xbox 360 for this game, but also found Microsoft's certification policies to be too restrictive for frequent updates.|$|E

Source equipment systems are monitored by central/source alarm systems, at the point of supply with multiplexed repeater alarms throughout the facility and for monitoring high and low gas pressure in particular areas such as general ward, operating theatres, ICU/ITU/CCU/NICU, recovery, major treatment rooms, etc. Equipment is connected to the medical gas supply system via station outlets.

40|$|Control valves {{affect the}} {{performance}} of power plant in terms of output, heat rate, reliability and availability {{because they are the}} final control elements in the operation. Therefore, critical evaluation of control valves must to {{be an integral part of}} any plant betterment program because the ultimate goal of such efforts is to improve the efficiency and reduce costs. Even control valves in the few severe service applications, which affect efficiency more than the rest of the valve population, have traditionally not been included in such efforts. Recent studies indicate that eliminating control valve problems alone can improve the heat rate of power plants in the range of 2 % to 5 %. The elements that are critical in realizing the potential benefits are: analyzing the whole system and quantifying the losses, identifying the root causes of the problems causing these losses and then, finally, eliminating the root causes of those problems. Methods to estimate loss due to control valve non-performance have to be judiciously applied, and sometimes developed, on a case-by-case basis, as shown by examples in this paper. The commonly observed causes of valve problems are discussed, followed by practical strategies for implementing solutions to the valve problems. Besides the potential for heat rate and efficiency improvement, solving severe <b>service</b> <b>valve</b> problems also removes a major obstacle for the plants to operate for longer intervals between outages, reduce scope of outage maintenance and provides opportunity to upgrade systems to modern practices...|$|E
