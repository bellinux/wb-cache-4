5000|$|Although earlier {{experimental}} <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> {{were constructed}} using {{a mixture of}} active and passive solar techniques, {{some of the first}} European engineered passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> of the modern era were built in Germany after World War I, when the Allies occupied the Ruhr area, including most of Germany's coal mines. [...] Architect George F. Keck was a pioneering designer of passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> in the 1930s and 40s. He designed the all-glass [...] "House of Tomorrow" [...] for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago and noted that it was warm inside on sunny winter days prior to the installation of the furnace. Following this he gradually started incorporating more south-facing windows into his designs for other clients, and in 1940 designed a passive solar home for real estate developer Howard Sloan in Glenview, Illinois. The Sloan House was called a [...] "solar house" [...] by the Chicago Tribune, the first modern use of that term. Sloan then built a number of passive <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> and his publicity efforts contributed to a significant [...] "solar house" [...] movement in the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|A {{demonstration}} project with 22 <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> {{funded by the}} German Ministry of Research and Technology {{was carried out in}} order to study the contribution of solar energy use to the room heating under the climate conditions of the Federal Republic of Germany. Measurements of energy flows over three years and interivews with the inhabitants have shown that an excellent heat insulation is the most effective measure. Solar components such as large south-faced glazings can contribute a small part to the energy savings if they are adequately designed and used. The most important benefit of <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> is that they cause a high quality of living. Heating behaviour and ventilation has a large influence on energy consumption. The handling of <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> must not be very difficult. With the help of "intelligent" heating and controlling systems many functions can be performed automatically...|$|R

40|$|In the Landstuhl {{project the}} energy {{consumption}} of 22 lived-in <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> in the Federal Republic of Germany was measured {{and interviews with}} the inhabitants on living behaviour and living quality were carried out. The results show that energy conservation was mainly caused by a high insulation standard and only to a small extent by passive solar energy use. Living behaviour has a strong influence on energy consumption, above all room temperatures and ventilation habits. The most important benefit of <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> is that they cause a high quality of living. All inhabitants appreciated the brightness, the direct solar radiation and the close contact to nature caused by the large south-faced glazings and greenhouses...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{housing design}} and {{construction}} in low-income communities may be affordable initially, {{but it may not}} be cost-effective or environmentally benign in the long run. Passive <b>solar</b> <b>housing</b> offers alternative {{design and construction}} features and practices designed to reduce energy consumption and consequently energy expenses. However, the lack of quantitative analysis on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these features and practices has resulted in a common perception that they are unaffordable for low-income communities due to their extra initial costs. The energy efficiency of a passive solar straw bale low-income housing development (Tierra Madre) was assessed and compared against an adjacent community in southern New Mexico (Sunland Park). Two years worth of utility data for consumption and cost of electricity and heating 2 ̆ 6 cooking gas were analyzed statistically and economically to determine the effectiveness of the Tierra Madre energy efficiency features and practices. The analysis revealed that, on average, passive <b>solar</b> <b>housing</b> reduces electricity consumption by about 30 percent and heating and cooking LP gas consumption by about 18 percent, representing a total reduction in energy consumption of about 25 percent. In addition, the null hypotheses that the true mean values of per-capita consumption and cost for Sunland Park are at most equal to those for Tierra Madre has been rejected for all months for electricity, and for cold season months for heating and cooking gas. The return on investment (or payback) period for the differential 2 ̆ 2 extra 2 ̆ 2 cost of passive <b>solar</b> <b>housing</b> compared to conventional housing is estimated to be 10 - 13 years. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn rural China, {{reducing}} low-quality {{fuel consumption}} and adopting solar technologies can mitigate pollution problems and improve farmers' living conditions. Before advising farmers to convert traditional <b>houses</b> to <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> {{it is necessary}} to understand their willingness to do so. Based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), this study examined nine factors related to farmers' willingness (FW). A survey was conducted in Chongqing with 465 participants. Nine hypotheses were proposed based on literature studies. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to test the data with the SPSS software package. Three of the nine factors had positive and significant impacts on FW, which were quality of life, government commitments and neighbours'/friends' assessments; two factors had negative and significant impacts, which were additional monthly out-of-pocket expenses and switching cost; and the remaining four factors had no significant impacts, which were durability, popularity, timing and local solar market maturity. Based on the findings, suggestions are made to properly introduce <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> to Chinese farmers and to quickly stimulate market activities...|$|R
