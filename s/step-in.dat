40|$|We {{propose a}} "layered-step" {{interior}} point (LIP) algorithm for linear programming. This algorithm follows the central path, either with short steps {{or with a}} new type of step called a "layered least squares" (LLS) step. The algorithm returns the exact global minimum after a finite number of <b>steps-in</b> particular, after $O(n^{ 3. 5 }c(A)) $ iterations, where $c(A) $ {{is a function of the}} coefficient matrix. The LLS steps can be thought of as accelerating a path-following interior point method whenever near-degeneracies occur. One consequence of the new method is a new characterization of the central path: we show that it composed of at most $n^ 2 $ alternating straight and curved segments. If the LIP algorithm is applied to integer data, we get as another corollary a new proof of a well-known theorem by Tardos that linear programming can be solved in strongly polynomial time provided that $A$ contains small-integer entries...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a modest attempt to study legal {{pluralism}} in rural China using rural legal {{services as a}} case study. The paper examines three factors that are driving and constraining the development of rural legal services delivery in China: geographic limitation, professional interest and political intervention. First of all, geography matters and rurality creates natural barriers for rural residents in limiting the access to legal services. There is an inherent spatial inequality for rural population {{when it comes to}} the distribution of legal service and the geographic isolation and remoteness nurture a particular type of legal culture among rural residents. Second, professionalism matters. There are strong ideological and economic forces which pull the rural legal service providers away from their grass-roots. The calling of an emerging legal professionalism (and the related financial incentives) demands a certain degree of legal knowledge and qualification, rules of procedures, code of conduct and regularity in legal practice. In order to survive in an increasingly competitive legal market, rural legal service providers have to run legal practices as a business, considering the “bottom line” and following the logic of a legal market. Finally, politics matters. To overcome geographic barriers and correct market failure, the government would need to <b>steps-in</b> to provide or supplement legal service in rural areas by introducing a public dimension of legal services. Politics may ameliorate where the legal service market fails. postprin...|$|R
25|$|Williams {{sought the}} {{services}} of Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who had replaced Zanardi at Chip Ganassi Racing in 1999, to <b>step-in</b> but Montoya was under contract to Ganassi for one more season. Britain's Jenson Button was called upon and made his debut instead. BMW Williams's first season did not see a single victory during the season. They managed {{to get on the}} podium three times, with Ralf Schumacher responsible for all three. Williams finished third in the Constructors' Championship, with 36 points, one more than the prior year. Ralf Schumacher finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, while Button, in his debut season, finished in eighth. Button made scrappy mistakes in early races (Monaco, Europe), but overall made an impressive debut in Melbourne, and continued to impress, notably at Silverstone, Spa and Suzuka.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{proprietary}} systems {{that seek to}} combine the convenience of <b>step-in</b> systems with the control levels attainable with strap-ins. An example is the Flow binding system, {{which is similar to}} a strap-in binding, except that the foot enters the binding through the back. [...] The back flips down and allows the boot to slide in; it's then flipped up and locked into place with a clamp, eliminating the need to loosen and then re-tighten straps every time the rider frees and then re-secures their rear foot. The rider's boot is held down by an adjustable webbing that covers most of the foot. Newer Flow models have connected straps in place of the webbing found on older models; these straps are also micro adjustable. In 2004, K2 released the Cinch series, a similar rear-entry binding; riders slip their foot in as they would a Flow binding, however rather than webbing, the foot is held down by straps.|$|E
2500|$|Although the D'Oliveira affair {{had drawn}} {{international}} condemnation, cricket administrators in England and Australia {{were reluctant to}} sever their playing links with South Africa. [...] Other international sports had already cut their ties with the country, exclusion from the 1964 and 1968 Olympics were followed by expulsion from the Olympic Movement in 1970. [...] Later {{in the same year}} South African athletes were suspended from international competition by the International Amateur Athletics Federation. [...] The invitation for the South African men's tour of England was initially maintained, but threats of physical disruption to matches from anti-apartheid militants saw the British government <b>step-in</b> to cancel the tour. [...] In May 1970, the Cricket Council made the decision {{that there should be no}} further tours to and from South Africa until cricket within the country was played on a multi-racial basis, and the national team was selected purely on merit. [...] In 1976, three different organisations; the South Africa Cricket Association (SACA), South African Board of Cricket Control (SACBOC) and the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) agreed to establish one single board to govern South African cricket, and that all future cricket in the country would be played on an integrated basis regardless of race or colour. [...] The new governing body; the South African Cricket Union formally took over the running of cricket in the republic in September 1977. [...] However, a group within the SACBOC did not recognise this body, and set up a rival organisation, the South African Cricket Board, led by Hassan Howa, who claimed that there could be [...] "no normal sport in an abnormal society". [...] The International Cricket Conference (ICC) imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970. [...] Despite the official boycott, cricket tours of South Africa did continue. [...] Derrick Robins took teams in 1973, 1974 and 1975, while an 'International Wanderers' side also toured in 1976.|$|E

50|$|Look's Nevada, {{released}} in 1950, {{was the first}} recognizably modern alpine ski binding.

50|$|In 1972, Marker {{replaced}} the Rotamat with its first <b>step-in</b> design, the M4 toe and M44 heel. The M4 re-introduced a two-finger design, allowing the fingers to rotate outward.

This was replaced in 1979 with the M4-15 Rotamat S heel, {{which was an}} improved version of the original Rotamat that was simpler to reset after release. Like the Look designs, it included a turntable under the instep that allowed the boot to rotate to the sides.|$|E

50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the spring {{assembly}} was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. <b>Step-in</b> action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the spring assembly was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true <b>step-in,</b> step-out behaviour.|$|E
50|$|The Grand Prix offered <b>step-in</b> convenience; to put {{the binding}} on, the skier {{inserted}} their toe under the Nevada II, then stepped down at the heel. The sole of their boot would catch a small plate or rod extending {{from the bottom of}} the binding, rotating it until it flipped up to lie vertically behind the skier's leg. During this motion the roller would catch the sole of the boot and lock it into position. Like the Nevada toe, a strong force rotating the boot, this time forward, would cause the binding to release.|$|E
