40|$|Background: [18 F]UCB-H was {{developed}} as a novel radiotracer with a high affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2 A, the binding site for the antiepileptic levetiracetam. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the radiation dosimetry of [18 F]UCB-H in a preclinical trial and to determine the maximum <b>injectable</b> <b>dose</b> according to guidelines for human biomedical research. The radiation dosimetry was derived by organ harvesting and dynamic micro positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in mice, and the results of both methods were compared. Methods: Twenty-four male C 57 BL- 6 mice were injected with 6. 96 ± 0. 81 MBq of [18 F]UCB-H, and the biodistribution was determined by organ harvesting at 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min (n = 4 for each time point). Dynamic microPET imaging was performed on five male C 57 BL- 6 mice after the injection of 9. 19 ± 3. 40 MBq of [18 F]UCB-H. A theoretical dynamic bladder model was applied to simulate urinary excretion. Human radiation dose estimates were derived from animal data using the International Commission on Radiological Protection 103 tissue weighting factors. Results: Based on organ harvesting, the urinary bladder wall, liver and brain received the highest radiation dose with a resulting effective dose of 1. 88 E- 02 mSv/MBq. Based on dynamic imaging an effective dose of 1. 86 E- 02 mSv/MBq was calculated, with the urinary bladder wall and liver (brain was not in the imaging field of view) receiving the highest radiation. Conclusions: This first preclinical dosimetry study of [18 F]UCB-H showed that the tracer meets the standard criteria for radiation exposure in clinical studies.

One of the major public health needs for gonorrhea control is appropriate, effective treatment. However, treatment options for gonorrhea are diminishing as Neisseria gonorrhoeae have developed resistance to several antimicrobial drugs such as sulfonamides, penicillin, tetracyclines and quinolones. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance of N. gonorrhoeae helps establish and maintain the efficacy of standard treatment regimens.

30|$|The {{dose limits}} {{described}} by the US Food and Drug Administration (expressed in equivalent dose, equal to absorbed dose in this case, radiation weighting factor equal to 1) state that 30 mSv per scan should not be exceeded, or an annual dose of 50 mSv for whole body, blood forming organs, lens of the eye and gonads. The limits for all other organs are 50 mSv (single scan) and 150 mSv (annual) [22]. Therefore, for research in the USA, the maximum single injected dose of [18 F]UCB-H allowed (assuming a bladder fraction of 0.5 and ICRP 103 factors) is 325 MBq, while the maximum annual dose is 974 MBq, with the urinary bladder being the critical organ for both (values derived from TD; dynamic imaging yields very similar values of 321 and 962 MBq). When decreasing the bladder fraction to 0.3, the critical organ remains the urinary bladder, but the single and annual doses increase to 517 MBq for single injection and 1, 551 MBq for annual injection (508 MBq/ 1, 523 MBq dynamic imaging). European regulations propose that the effective dose should not exceed 10 mSv per scan [21]. Based on this more stringent criterion, the maximum <b>injectable</b> <b>dose</b> per scan derived by organ harvesting would be 532 MBq per subject (543 MBq dynamic single). If the bladder fraction is only 0.3, the maximum <b>injectable</b> <b>dose</b> is 601 MBq (614 MBq dynamic single). However, the presently derived injection limits represent a worst case scenario due to assumptions made, such as physical decay only after the last measured time point or the relatively high fraction of injected activity cleared via urinary pathways.

There is a wide gap in supplementation based studies for increasing the cognition levels of the geriatric population, especially in developing countries like India which are at extreme risk of developing neurological disorders. And recently Vitamin B 12 has drawn considerable attention due to its ability to improve the cognitive status. Current literature has linked the possibility of alleviating neurological disorders in the elderly with effective vitamin B 12 management.

30|$|A {{prerequisite}} {{to the use}} of a novel radiotracer in human clinical trials and good clinical practice is a preclinical dosimetry study in animals. This enables the prediction of dose limits in humans that will keep radiation doses below harmful limits while still producing diagnostically beneficial images. Radiation estimates for humans derived from small animals are traditionally obtained by ex vivo tissue distribution (TD) studies, where organs are harvested post-injection at several time points to establish the biodistribution. However, dynamic imaging approaches in small animals using microPET are a promising alternative, because the complete biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical can be obtained within a single in vivo scan with a much higher time resolution. The aims of this study were to predict the radiation dose given to humans based on the distribution of [18 F]UCB-H in mice and to determine the maximum <b>injectable</b> <b>dose</b> according to radiation guidelines in biomedical research.

Using a polylactide homopolymer and the solvent extraction/evaporation method, three microsphere formulations (Formulations A, B, and C) were prepared at various drug loadings (11. 85 – 15. 79 %). The microspheres were characterized for particle size by laser diffractometry, surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and bulk density by tapping, as well as long-term in vitro drug release, mass loss and hydration at 37 °C, and short-term in vitro drug release at elevated temperatures (51 – 59 °C). Experiments at 37 °C revealed that drug release was triphasic and occurred due to slow degradation of the polylactide polymer. Short-term in vitro release results indicated that drug release was diffusional. Application of the Higuchi equation to short-term release confirmed the temperature dependency of the diffusional rate constant. Using the rate constant and the Arrhenius equation, an Ea value of 45 [*]kcal/mol (Formulation A) and approximately 25 [*]kcal/mol (Formulations B and C) was obtained for diffusional release.

Microfluidic represents an innovative approach, owing to its potential to increase radiochemical productivity in terms of yields, time reduction, precursor consumption and flexible experimental planning. Methods We focused on fluorine- 18 labeling and used a microfluidic platform to perform sequential reactions, by using the same batch of 18 F-labeling solution on one or more substrates, during the same experimental session. A solid-phase extraction (SPE) workup procedure was also implemented in the system to provide a repeatable purification step. Results We were able to quickly optimize the conditions for labeling of ethyl and propyl ditosylate and of a new cannabinoid type 2 (CB 2) receptor agonist, CB 41. In all substrates, we obtained good incorporation yields (60 % to 85 %) in short (< 90 s) reaction times. Single dosages of the CB 2 ligand were sequentially prepared, upon request, in satisfactory quantities and purity for small animal PET scanning. Conclusion This work demonstrates the usefulness of a microfluidic-based system for a rapid optimization of temperature, flow rate of reactants and their relative ratio in the labeling of different precursors by using the same 18 F-fluoride batch.

Oral bisphosphonates, first-line therapy for most patients with osteoporosis, are associated with suboptimal adherence to therapy due to factors that include a complex dosing regimen and gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients. Intravenous bisphosphonates address these limitations through infrequent <b>injectable</b> <b>dosing</b> that assures 100 % bioavailability. Intravenous zoledronic acid is the newest bisphosphonate to be approved {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis. Aims: This review assesses the evidence for the therapeutic effects of intravenous zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporosis. Evidence review: Zoledronic acid 5 mg administered as an annual 15 -min intravenous infusion has been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and other fractures in a three-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in women and men with a recent surgical repair of low-trauma hip fracture, it reduced the risk of new clinical fractures and improved survival. In both studies, zoledronic acid was associated with a good safety profile and was generally well tolerated. Zoledronic acid has the potential to improve clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of fracture in patients with osteoporosis.

METHODS: The preferences, experiences and general comments of patients in the PrefHer study were collected via specific semi-structured interview schedules. Exploratory analyses of data were conducted using standard methodology. The final question invited patients to make further comments, which were divided into 9 thematic categories - future delivery, compliments, time/convenience, practical considerations, pain/discomfort, study design, side-effects, psychological impact, and perceived efficacy. RESULTS: 267 / 467 (57 %) patients made 396 additional comments, 7 were neutral, 305 positive and 86 negative.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the associations between hematological parameters at weaning and post-weaning weight gain in piglets. Five well-managed conventional herds of average herd size of 1000 sows were selected. All herds provided a <b>single</b> <b>injectable</b> iron (either i. m. or s. c, 200 mg) supplementation from different commerical products at 3 – 4 days of life. Within each herd, litters belonging to a weekly farrowing batch close to weaning were identified and among them 20 litters were chosen randomly after exclusion of nursing sows. Within each litter, a random piglet was selected. EDTA and non-stabilized blood sample was taken from the anterior Vena cava of each piglet 1 – 3 days before weaning (average weaning age of 25. 7 days) and analyzed by complete hematology including serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). The associations between each measured hematological parameter and the average daily gain (ADG) of piglets in a three-week period were tested using PROC MIXED procedure in SAS. A total of 99 piglets were included in the study but 3 were lost during follow up. The average hemoglobin concentration of piglets was 121. 5 ± 15 gl− 1 and the ADG was 202. 9 ± 78. 4 g day− 1. A positive association between hemoglobin and ADG in the three-week period (p= 0. 0003) was observed. Also, red blood cells (p< 0. 0001) and hematocrit (p= 0. 0005) had positive association with ADG while red blood cell distribution width (p= 0. 05), hemoglobin distribution width (p= 0. 04), and reticulocyte red cell distribution width (p= 0. 01) had a negative association with ADG. Hence the results indicate that improved hematological status at weaning is positively correlated to weight gain post-weaning. An increase in 10 g hemoglobin/l blood corresponded to a weight gain improvement of 17. 2 g daily weight gain in the 3 weeks post-weaning period. The strategies for improving the hematological values of piglets at weaning need to be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of the}} macrolide antimicrobial tilmicosin in {{the horse}} was assessed by initially reviewing bacterial isolates from equine infections. This demonstrated that respiratory disease due to Gram positive organisms {{was the most common}} bacterial infection documented at WCVM. Furthermore, 45 % of Streptococcus zooepidemicus isolates were resistant to the commonly used potentiated sulphonamides. It was necessary to first develop and validate a robust HPLC analytical technique to detect tilmicosin in a variety of equine tissues. The methodology was fully validated in plasma and lung with LODs of 13 ng/mL and 181 ng/g respectively. In a preliminary trial, we administered tilmicosin to recently weaned foals at a dose of 4 mg/kg PO sid or 10 mg/kg SC q 72 hrs. The oral dose did not result in detectable tissue concentrations of tilmicosin. The pharmacokinetics of the <b>injectable</b> <b>dose</b> were similar to previous reports in other species. The injectable preparation resulted in severe swelling at the site of injection associated with edema and tissue necrosis. Otherwise, tilmicosin was well tolerated by the foals and no foals developed severe colitis. However, a semi-quantitative fecal bacteriological technique demonstrated marked changes in the normal fecal flora, with profound overgrowth of the Enterbacteriacae and almost complete removal of the normal â-hemolytic streptococci population. No known pathogens were isolated from the feces. In a subsequent study, we investigated the administration of higher doses of oral tilmicosin to unweaned foals to simulate treatment of R. equi. A dose of 40 mg/kg PO sid resulted in detectable plasma concentrations of tilmicosin. Foals were treated at this dose regimen for 2 weeks and sequentially euthanized. Tissue analysis demonstrated concentrations of tilmicosin in tissues similar to those seen with the 10 mg/kg sc dose with a Cmax of 4 µg/g in lung and a MRT which was shorter at 8. 8 hrs. The MIC 50 of R. equi to tilmicosin was 4 µg/g. Based on pharmacodynamic studies it appears that oral tilmicosin {{has the potential to be}} of use in the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in foals. No adverse clinical effects were noted in the foals; however, the fecal flora was again changed by tilmicosin administration. The fecal flora of the unweaned foals was different from that of the older animals with almost no â-haemolytic streptococci and a predominantly Gram negative flora. Disruption of the fecal flora did result in overgrowth of Cl. perfringens which was not associated with disease. In a final study, we compared the effects of tilmicosin and ceftiofur on the fecal flora of adult horses. The fecal flora of the horses receiving tilmicosin was severely disrupted in the same manner as the weaned foals with the added effect of overgrowth of Cl. perfringens. Ceftiofur which is widely regarded as being associated with antimicrobial associated diarrhea had very little effect on the fecal flora. It is concluded that oral tilmicosin shows potential for the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in young foals. However, care should be taken due to possibility of developing colitis.

25|$|Use of {{ondansetron}} {{has been}} associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any patient with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug, and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in patients taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of <b>injectable</b> ondansetron should not exceed 16mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24-mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. Patients are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron.|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{studies suggest}} that the {{injectable}} contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) increases susceptibility to infections such as HIV- 1, unlike the injectable contraceptive norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN). We investigated the differential effects, molecular mechanism of action and steroid receptor involvement in gene expression by MPA as compared to NET and progesterone (P 4) in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 cell line model for the endocervical epithelium, a key point of entry for pathogens in the female genital mucosa. MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P 4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IκBα genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL- 6, IL- 8 and RANTES genes, and IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR knockdown experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P 4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone. This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein synthesis. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ∼ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ∼ 4 - 20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at <b>injectable</b> contraceptive <b>doses</b> of MPA. These findings suggest that {{in the context of the}} genital mucosa, these GR-mediated glucocorticoid-like effects of MPA in cervical epithelial cells are likely to play a critical role in discriminating between the effects on inflammation caused by different progestins and P 4 and hence susceptibility to genital infections, given the predominant expression of the GR in primary endocervical epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{success of}} current control tools in combatting malaria vectors is well established. However, {{sustained}} residual transmission of Plasmodium parasites persists. Mass drug administration (MDA) to humans of the endectocide ivermectin for vector control is receiving increasing attention. However, vectors feeding upon animals escape this promising approach. Zoophagy of mosquitoes sustains both the vector population and endemic population of vector-borne pathogens. Therefore, only {{a strategy that}} will combine ivermectin MDAs targeted at humans and their peridomestic animals could be successful at controlling residual malaria transmission. Methods: Burkinabe cattle have been treated with <b>injectable</b> therapeutic <b>dose</b> of ivermectin (0. 2 mg/kg of body weight) to render blood meals toxic to field representative populations of Anopheles coluzzii carrying the kdr mutation. Direct skin-feeding assays were performed from 2 to 28 days after injection (DAI) and mosquitoes were followed for their survival, ability to become gravid and fecundity. Membrane feeding assays were further performed to test if an ivermectin blood meal taken at 28 DAI impacts gametocyte establishment and development in females fed with infectious blood. Results: The mosquitocidal effect of ivermectin is complete for 2 weeks after injection, whether 12 days cumulative mortalities were of 75 and 45 % {{the third and fourth}} weeks, respectively. The third week, a second ivermectin blood meal at sub-lethal concentrations further increased mortality to 100 %. Sub-lethal concentrations of ivermectin also significantly decreased egg production by surviving females, increasing further the detrimental effect of the drug on vector densities. Although females fitness was impaired by sub-lethal ivermectin blood meals, these did not diminish nor increase their susceptibility to infection. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of integrated MDA of ivermectin to both human and peridomestic cattle to target vector reservoirs of residual malaria transmission. Such integration lies in 'One-Health' efforts being implemented around the globe, and would be especially relevant in rural communities in Africa where humans are also at risk of common zoonotic diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between progestin-only injectable contraception {{and risk of}} HIV- 1 acquisition is controversial. Most clinical data suggests that the injectable contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), unlike norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), increases susceptibility to infections such as HIV- 1. The {{first part of this}} thesis investigated the differential effects, molecular mechanisms of action and steroid receptor involvement in gene expression by MPA as compared to NET and progesterone (P 4) in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 and HeLa cell line models for the endocervical epithelium, a key point of entry for pathogens in the lower female genital tract (FGT). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P 4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IÎºBÎ± genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL- 6, IL- 8 and RANTES genes, and IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the cervical cell lines and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR siRNA experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P 4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX). This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein vi synthesis. This is the first study to show direct proof for a GR-mediated mechanism of action in anti-inflammatory effects of MPA. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ~ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ~ 4 - 20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at <b>injectable</b> contraceptive <b>doses</b> of MPA. These findings suggest that MPA effects on genital mucosal immune function and susceptibility to infections are likely to be very different to those of NET and P 4, when mediated by the GR The second part of this thesis investigated the effects of the virion associated HIV- 1 protein, Vpr, on GR-regulated inflammatory genes {{in the presence of the}} ligands...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gambling is a {{legal form}} of {{entertainment}} in 48 states and is enjoyed by many. In Approximately 1 % of the population, casual gaming can turn into pathological gambling (PG) resulting in devastating consequences. There are currently no guidelines or regulations for clinical providers regarding the most effective treatments of PG. Previous research has shown opioid antagonist {{to be effective in}} treating similar addictions such as alcoholism and heroin. How effective are opioid antagonist in the treatment of pathological gambling? Methods: An exhaustive search of Medline-OVID, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews Multifile, and Web of science using keywords: gambling, drug therapy, and narcotic antagonist. Limitations included studies in the English language and on humans. Articles pertaining to the area of interest were evaluated using GRADE. Results: Three studies met inclusion criteria which are discussed in this systematic review. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 112 participants showed statistically significant reduction in gambling behaviors and urges with 18 weeks of treatment with naltrexone. Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 233 participants failed to show significant decrease in gambling behaviors and urges with 18 weeks of treatment with nalmefene compared. Finally, a case study showed complete cessation of gambling behavior and urges with intramuscular monthly injections of naltrexone. Conclusion: Opioid antagonist drug naltrexone may be an effective option for treating pathological gambling whereas a similar drug nalmefene seems to be ineffective. Due to the low quality of evidence, effective <b>injectable</b> naltrexone effective <b>dosing</b> is undetermined...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to evaluate effects on prolactin (PRL) concentration and mammary milk secretion of an injectable cabergoline formulation administered to five lactating Beagle bitches during early postpartum (PP). Bitches were bled twice daily (from PP day 3 to PP day 12) and then daily (from PP day 13 to PP day 16) to assay serum PRL. On PP day 6, a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 0. 1 ml/kg of placebo was administered. On PP day 9, a SC 0. 1 ml/kg <b>dose</b> of <b>injectable</b> cabergoline was administered. All bitches were checked for milk production, using a clinical scoring in order to quantify milk expression from each teat. A circadian variation of serum PRL was evident during the 6 days of pretreatment monitoring. The day after cabergoline injection, an 80 % decrease of PRL serum concentration was observed (p < 0. 05). The circadian oscillatory pattern of PRL secretion disappeared after administration of cabergoline, and PRL values remained significantly lower than in the previous days for the first 60 h following treatment (p < 0. 001). Milk production was drastically reduced when comparing pretreatment to post-treatment scores (p < 0. 001). A <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of <b>injectable</b> cabergoline caused a significant reduction in serum PRL concentration and a significant reduction in milk flow.

40|$|Aim:To compare four {{gutta-percha}} filling {{techniques in}} simulated C-shaped canals based on filling quality at three cross-sectional levels, filling {{time and the}} apical extrusion of gutta-percha. Methodology:Forty resin simulated C-shaped canals were constructed and filled using one of four techniques: cold lateral compaction (LC), ultrasonic compaction (UC), <b>single</b> cone with <b>injectable</b> gutta-percha (Obtura II) (IT) and core-carrier (Thermafil((R))) (CC). Cross sections were made at 1 (L 1), 3 (L 3) and 6 (L 6) mm from the canal terminus. Areas of gutta-percha, sealer and voids in each cross section were measured using an image analysis system. Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model and post hoc test (Dunnett's T 3). Data on time taken to fill canals was evaluated using the Bonferroni post hoc test. Results: CC had more gutta-percha and less sealer compared with IT at L 1 (P< 0. 05). LC had marginally significantly less gutta-percha than CC at this level (P= 0. 049). At level 3 mm, significantly more gutta-percha and less sealer were present in IT compared with LC (P< 0. 05). The techniques showed no difference in quality at L 6. The time for LC (20. 72 min) was three times longer than for both IT (6. 11 min) and CC (6. 67 min), whereas for UC (26. 92 min), it was four times longer (P< 0. 001). Finally, the four techniques were not different in the occurrence of apical extrusion of gutta-percha. Conclusions:The core-carrier technique was the most effective technique when assessed by gutta-percha area in this simulated C-shaped canal...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Androgenic-anabolic-steroids (AAS) -induced {{hepatotoxicity}} typically {{occurs with}} C- 17 alkylated oral agents abused by exercising individuals at clinically recommended <b>doses.</b> <b>Injectable</b> compounds {{appear to have}} the same risk for hepatotoxicity, but are applied in doses three to six times higher than clinically recommended. AAS users occasionally try to avoid the well-known hepatotoxic effects associated with the abuse of a multitude of AAS agents, by using the pharmaceutical agent compound N a phospholipid/vitamin preparation. Primary Objective. The investigation of the actual hepatoprotective effect of compound N against AAS-induced toxicity. Methodology. This was an observational cohort study of 320 athletes; 160 were AAS users and the other 160 were not abusing any substances. Of the 160 users, 44 were using AAS and compound N (group A), and 116 were using solely AAS (group B). The 160 athletes abstaining from substances abuse acted as controls (group Q. All athletes were tested for alterations in serum levels of hepatic enzymes. Enzyme levels before the study's onset and {{after the end of the}} 8 -week AAS regimes were compared among the three groups, in order to delineate the hepatoprotective effect of compound N. Results. Prior to our research all groups showed normal values in all enzymes except creatine kinase (CK). After the 8 -week period, CK levels were slightly lower in group A, but without variation in Groups B and C; gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (gamma GT) levels remained normal. Groups A and C had no elevations in any of the enzymes, except CK, while in group B all enzymes' values were elevated above the normal range. The only factor differentiating AAS users in group A from those in group B was the use of compound N, thus the results being suggestive of the compound's detoxification effect. The severity of AAS abuse was positively associated with the degree of changes (Delta values) in all measured enzymes except gamma GT and CK. Conclusions. Previous suggestions that serum hepatic enzyme elevations in exercising AAS abusers are connected to muscle fiber damage rather than the abuse itself, are contradicted by our results. Since all AAS abusing athletes were prone to exhibit elevations in enzymes' values, the mean values of group A were to be similar to those observed in group B, exceeding normal values. The group hepatic enzyme values of group B were significantly higher than the group C (control). Notably, group A did not have any statistically significant difference in the hepatic enzyme values compared to group C. The effect of exercise on these enzymes' elevations was ruled out by the comparability of training regimens and AAS toxicity was correlated to the severity of AAS abuse...|$|R
