Farmers {{and service}} personnel occasionally need to enter these pits to conduct repair and maintenance tasks. One intervention {{to reduce the}} toxic and asphyxiating gas exposure risk to farm workers when entering <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> is <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> ventilation. This article describes an online computational fluid dynamics based design aid for evaluating the effectiveness of <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> ventilation systems to reduce the concentrations of toxic and asphyxiating gases in the <b>manure</b> <b>pits.</b> This design aid, developed {{by a team of}} agricultural engineering and agricultural safety specialists at Pennsylvania State University, represents the culmination of {{more than a decade of}} research and technology development effort. The article includes a summary of the research efforts leading to the online design aid development and describes protocols for using the online design aid, including procedures for data input and for accessing design aid results. Design aid results include gas concentration decay and oxygen replenishment curves inside the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> and inside the barns above the <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> as well as animated motion pictures of individual gas concentration decay and oxygen replenishment in selected horizontal and vertical cut plots in the <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> and barns. These results allow the user to assess: (1) how long one needs to ventilate the pits to remove toxic and asphyxiating gases from the pit and barn, (2) from which portions of the barn and pit these gases are most and least readily evacuated, and (3) whether or not animals and personnel need to be removed from portions of the barn above the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> being ventilated...|$|R

Trials were conducted over two consecutive periods in which manure was stored mainly in winter and spring. Increasing the proportions of concentrate in the diet reduced the GHG (CH 4 +N 2 O) emissions from the barns from 8. 5 ± 1. 6 to 1. 9 ± 0. 4 kgCO 2 eq/kg live-weight gain, but had not significant influence on the emissions from the stored <b>solid</b> <b>manure.</b> Seasonal variation in gas emissions was observed, with lower emissions from stored <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> in winter than in spring (159 ± 25 and 314 ± 49 mg CO 2, 0. 14 ± 0. 02 and 2. 47 ± 0. 78 mg CH 4, and < 0. 01 and 0. 24 ± 0. 09 mgN 2 O/kg of fresh manure stored/d of storage, respectively), indicating that manure storage in the warmer season should be avoided. The GHG (CH 4 +N 2 O) emissions from stored <b>solid</b> <b>manure,</b> however, were less than 11 % of the total emissions (barns+manure storage).

An experiment was conducted with growing pigs (n = 18) in a randomized complete block design, with 3 treatments in 6 blocks. Treatment groups were (1) a 15 %-CP basal diet with 3 times the requirement of sulfur-containing AA (14. 2 g/kg of diet, as-fed basis); (2) the basal diet with 2 times the requirement of Trp and Phe+Tyr (2. 9 and 20. 4 g/kg of diet, respectively, as-fed basis); and (3) the basal diet with AA supplementation to levels sufficient for maximum protein gain. Pigs with an initial BW of 41. 2 ± 0. 8 kg were individually penned in partly slatted floor pens and offered a daily feed allowance of 2. 8 times the maintenance requirement for NE (293 kJ/kg of BW 0. 75). Feed was mixed with water at 1 : 2. 5 (wt/wt). Feces and urine of each pig was allowed to accumulate in separate <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> under the slatted floor. After an adaptation period of 2 wk, and after cleaning the <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> <b>manure</b> was subsequently collected. In wk 5 of the collection period, separate samples were collected directly from each <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> for odor, ammonia, and manure composition analyses.

40|$|The Canadian {{livestock}} industry generates 150 million tonnes of manure annually {{and the majority}} of this manure is land applied. This practice allows the manure nutrients to be recycled to the soil crop system while improving soil fertility. However, land application of manure has the potential to negatively impact soil, water, and air quality if not managed properly. Microbial processes transform the manure nutrients into forms that are susceptible to leaching or volatilization. Balancing the nutrient loss dynamics from fertilized soil is very difficult because the nutrient transformations are affected by the soil environment such as air and water content, pH, and labile carbon content. All of these soil environmental factors can be influenced by manure application practices such as application rate, timing, and manure placement. Knowledge of how these management practices affect the soil environment can help producers make management decisions that reduce the likelihood of soil, water, and air contamination from manure application. Very few data exist on how manure application practices affect odour emissions after spreading. Therefore, the efficiency of subsurface application in reducing odours from manure spreading for both <b>solid</b> and liquid <b>manure</b> was assessed. Flux chambers and dynamic dilution olfactometry were used to measure odour emissions from five livestock manure species applied at three application rates using surface and subsurface application methods. The results indicated that odour concentrations from injected plots were up to 66 % (37 % on average) lower than concentrations from broadcast applications. Injection seemed to have a larger impact on reducing odours from <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> than liquid manure, mainly due to efficient <b>manure</b> coverage from <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> injection. Odours measured immediately after <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> applications were also 37 % lower than from liquid manure applications. In general, odours from both manure types increased with higher application rates, but there was little difference in the odours among low, mid, and high application rates. The specific odour rate (odour emission rate per kg N applied) decreased with application rate due to the reduced surface area available for volatilization of compounds with higher application rates. Based on these results, injection of manure is an effective way to reduce the odour emissions immediately after spreading, particularly for <b>solid</b> <b>manure.</b> However, other factors associated with manure injection, such as the increased power requirement and soil disturbance must be considered when evaluating the overall impact of manure injection versus surface application. The odour data collected in this study described how management practices affected odours immediately after spreading. Knowledge of how these practices affect the emission rate trend over time is required to apply dispersion models to optimize the minimum separation distances for manure spreading activities. The model parameters for an existing volatilization model were determined from field and literature data and the resulting model allowed the effects of application mode (surface vs. subsurface) and manure type (liquid vs. solid) on odour emissions for 48 hours after application to be simulated. The effects of injection depth and a coverage factor on emissions were also simulated. The modeled peak fluxes from liquid manure applications were higher than those for <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> applications, but the extended duration of odour emissions from <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> resulted in higher cumulative losses from <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> applications. While the application rate had no effect on the initial odour flux, higher application rates resulted in higher peak fluxes, higher overall emissions, and longer odour durations for both manure types and application methods. Modest injection depths were shown to reduce odours from both liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> applications compared to surface spreading. The percent reductions in cumulative odours due to injection were estimated assuming typical coverage factors. The general predictions of the model developed in this study agree reasonably well with odour emission rate trends reported in literature. Future work should focus on better estimation of the model parameters and the variation of effective diffusivity with time and soil conditions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural activities such as land application of livestock manure cannot be ignored when assessing overall emissions from anthropogenic sources. Like odour emissions, the magnitude of the GHG emissions will be influenced by management practices such as manure placement during land application. The GHG fluxes resulting from the surface and subsurface application of liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> were also compared within 24 hours of application using a static chamber and gas chromatography. The results showed that carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e) fluxes were approximately three times higher from the injected plots than the surface plots for both <b>solid</b> and liquid <b>manure.</b> The elevated CO 2 -e fluxes were mainly due to a pronounced increase in N 2 O fluxes which was likely caused by increased denitrification rates. The CO 2 -e fluxes from the liquid manure applications were also approximately three times higher than the CO 2 -e fluxes from the <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> applications, probably due to higher levels of ammonium available for nitrification and subsequent denitrification. The CH 4 fluxes were generally low and the treatments had no effect. The measured specific fluxes (total flux per kg N applied) remained relatively constant with application rate, indicating that, in this study, GHG emissions from manure applications were approximately proportional to the amount of land applied manure. While the data from this study showed that manure type and placement influenced short-term nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, manure management practices (particularly slurry injection or <b>solid</b> <b>manure</b> incorporation) have the potential to influence long-term emissions by changing the magnitude and pattern of the nitrogen cycle in the soil-plant system. Management practices also impact the magnitude of other nitrogen losses (ammonia volatilization, nitrate leaching) which affect indirect N 2 O emissions. A model that simulates the environmental conditions and nutrient transformations after manure application may allow a more reliable prediction of the effect of management practices on total GHG emissions. Numerous process-based models have been used to estimate N 2 O emissions as influenced by agricultural practices in Canada. However, these models do not account for enhanced denitrification that potentially exists after slurry injection or manure incorporation, resulting in an underestimation of N 2 O emissions. A simple mass balance of nitrogen after application to land showed that enhanced denitrification can increase total N 2 O-N emissions by a factor of 5. By accounting for the increased microbial activity, slower oxygen diffusion and higher water filled pore space that exists after manure injection, models may better estimate N 2 O emissions from manure application practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{mosquito}} species Anopheles plumbeus is {{an aggressive}} biter {{and a potential}} vector of malaria parasites and West Nile virus. It occurs naturally at low population densities, as its larval development is adapted to the specific water qualities found in tree holes. However, probably owing to environmental changes, it has recently been observed in several European countries to use increasingly often artificial breeding habitats {{that may lead to}} mass development and severe annoyance to humans living close by. The perception of mosquito nuisance, however, is very subjective, and breeding habitats are not always known, thus impeding targeted surveillance and control. To relate nuisance by An. plumbeus to specific environmental conditions, a questionnaire survey was carried out addressing persons who had submitted specimens of this particular mosquito species to the German citizen science project “Mueckenatlas”, an instrument of passive mosquito surveillance. The questionnaire was intended to find out whether a nuisance situation linked to An. plumbeus had existed, whether mosquito breeding habitats could be identified and whether control measures had been conducted. Despite some efforts, the participants who claimed to suffer from an An. plumbeus nuisance problem had rarely identified the source of the mosquitoes. Once control measures had been performed on abandoned <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> however, the nuisance problem disappeared or mosquito abundance was at least significantly reduced. Nevertheless, no significant effect of abandoned <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> on the probability of an An. plumbeus nuisance could be demonstrated in a multivariate logistic regression model testing various variables. Instead, a significant positive effect of a disused farm nearby was found. The reason is probably that <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> as the most frequent source of An. plumbeus mass development are often located on disused farms, without most people’s knowledge about their existence. Disused farms are therefore appropriate candidates to consider when it comes to public health issues connected to An. plumbeus such as surveillance of mass development and implementation of control measures...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella {{has been}} {{detected}} in the feces of many wildlife species, including raccoons (Procyon lotor), but {{little is known about}} the epidemiology of Salmonella in wildlife living in different habitat types. Our objective was to investigate demographic, temporal, and climatic factors associated with the carriage of Salmonella in raccoons and their environment on swine farms and conservation areas. Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected fecal samples from raccoons and environmental samples (soil, <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> dumpsters) on 5 swine farms and 5 conservation areas in Ontario, Canada once every five weeks from May to November, 2011 - 2013. Salmonella was detected in 26 % (279 / 1093; 95 % CI 22. 9 - 28. 2) of raccoon fecal samples, 6 % (88 / 1609; 95 % CI 4. 5 - 6. 8) of soil samples, 30 % (21 / 69; 95 % CI 20. 0 - 42. 7) of <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> samples, and 23 % (7 / 31; 95 % CI 9. 6 - 41. 0) of dumpster samples. Of samples testing positive for Salmonella, antimicrobial resistance was detected in 5 % (14 / 279; 95 % CI 2. 8 - 8. 3) of raccoon fecal, 8 % (7 / 89; 95 % CI 3. 2 - 15. 5) of soil, 10 % (2 / 21; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 30. 4) of <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> and 0 / 7 dumpster samples. Using multi-level multivariable logistic regression analyses, we found location type (swine farm or conservation area) was not a significant explanatory variable for Salmonella occurrence in raccoon feces or soil (p > 0. 05). However, detection of Salmonella in raccoon feces was associated with rainfall, season, and sex with various interaction effects among these variables. We detected a variety of Salmonella serovars that infect humans and livestock in the feces of raccoons indicating that raccoons living near humans, regardless of location type, may play a role in the epidemiology of salmonellosis in livestock and humans in southwestern Ontario...|$|R
