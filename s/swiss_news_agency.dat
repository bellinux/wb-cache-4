40|$|A general {{inhomogenity}} of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> markes {{the discrepancy}} between definions of a <b>news</b> <b>agency,</b> the function of <b>news</b> <b>agencies,</b> and the closeness of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> to other <b>news</b> outlets among the mass media. Different cases give evidence that these differences exist in internationally operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> We argue with two claims accessing the contemporary situation: a) we rely on the perspective of classic analysis of the sender and receiver(s) of a message in a communication model and b) special interest groups as connected segments of subnetworks {{in the mass media}} industry. We will examine several worldwide operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> with internet presence regarding their self-description, their role in mass media communication, and classic definitions of <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> After examining several cases, we will show the general common roles of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> in the mass media network. The variety of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> results in differentiated forms of these distributors. While major <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> work as contributors of information for other mass media and thus technically fulfill the role of a <b>news</b> <b>agency,</b> smaller agencies have the declared aim to cover ‘special interest’ serving as a conterpoint to mainstream <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> News agencies participate in linear and circular distribution forms we classify here as ‘frames of the news’ and ‘spirals of silence’. Our examination shows that <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> as producing and delivering organizations for the mass media work with high self-reference and reference to other mass media...|$|R
