40|$|The {{pulmonary}} function impairment is {{the most}} common respiratory problem in industrial plants and their vicinity. Therefore, the purpose was to study the effects of furnace <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>flue</b> and its duration of exposure on lung function. This was a matched cross-sectional study of Spirometry in 100 bangle workers with age range 20 – 60 years, who worked without the benefit of smoke control ventilation or respiratory protective devices. Pulmonary function test was performed by using Digital Spirometer (Spiro-excel). Significant reduction was observed in the mean values of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1), Forced Expiratory Ratio (FEV 1 /FVC), Forced Expiratory Flow (25 %- 75 %) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) in bangle workers relative to their matched controls. This impairment was increased with the duration of exposure to fumes in bangle industries. It is concluded that lung function in bangle workers is impaired and stratification of results shows a dose-response effect of years of <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>flue</b> exposure on lung function.  </p...|$|E

5000|$|Darbazi (დარბაზი; from darvāze, [...] "gate") is a {{term used}} in Georgia to {{describe}} a chamber with a distinctive [...] "swallow dome"-type roof structure found in the traditional domestic architecture of Asia Minor and the South Caucasus. The central feature is a pyramidal vault (gvirgvini), supported on pillars and constructed of a stepped series of hewn logs and beams, with a central opening at the top {{which serves as a}} window <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>flue.</b> The Roman authority Vitruvius (1st century BC) includes in his De architectura a description of a Colchian dwelling, the ancient prototype of a darbazi.

50|$|These {{projects}} {{are in many}} senses an evolution of amateur radio, and more specifically packet radio, {{as well as an}} outgrowth of the free software community (which in itself substantially overlaps with amateur radio). The key to using standard wireless networking devices designed for short-range use for multi-kilometre Long Range Wi-Fi linkups is the use of high-gain directional antennas. Rather than purchasing commercially available units, such groups sometimes advocate homebuilt antenna construction. Examples include the cantenna, which is typically constructed from a Pringles potato chip can, and RONJA, an optical link that can be made from a <b>smoke</b> <b>flue</b> <b>and</b> LEDs, with circuitry and instructions released under the GFDL. As with other wireless mesh networks, three distinct generations of mesh networks are used in wireless community networks. In particular, in the 2004 timeframe, some mesh projects suffered poor performance when scaled up.|$|R
50|$|A smokebox {{is one of}} {{the major}} basic parts of a steam {{locomotive}} exhaust system. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> hot gases pass from the firebox through tubes where they pass heat to the surrounding water in the boiler. The smoke then enters the smokebox, and is exhausted to the atmosphere through the chimney (or funnel). Early locomotives had no smokebox and relied on a long chimney to provide natural draught for the fire but smokeboxes were soon included in the design for two main reasons. Firstly and most importantly, the blast of exhaust steam from the cylinders, when directed upwards through an airtight smokebox with an appropriate design of exhaust nozzle, effectively draws hot gases through the boiler tubes <b>and</b> <b>flues</b> <b>and,</b> consequently, fresh combustion air into the firebox. Secondly, the smokebox provides a convenient collection point for ash and cinders ("char") drawn through the boiler tubes, which can be easily cleaned out at the end of a working day. Without a smokebox, all char must pass up the chimney or will collect in the tubes <b>and</b> <b>flues</b> themselves, gradually blocking them.|$|R

All of the gases tested recovered {{the same amount of}} oil over two cycles of gas injection. Nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>flue</b> gas recovered oil more rapidly than methane because {{a large portion of the}} methane slug dissolved in the oil phase and less free gas was available for oil displacement.

40|$|Study of Local West Sumatera Stove {{performances}} to boil gambir in Pesisir Selatan district {{showed the}} results that heat transfer efficiency is 11. 6 %, very simple in operation but short service life, indoor pollution due to <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> burnt risk are high because of no chimney <b>and</b> hot <b>flue</b> gas temperature is still higher than 200 0 C, very cheap in construction, and environmentally causes impact on local deforestation. This paper attempted to design, construct, and run a set of combustion test to NWS Stove for boiling gambir using mixture of biomass fuel of fire-wood, palm fiber and shell. It was made of river stones and consists of two main parts, namely combustion chamber with grate for biomass fuel bed and its pot <b>and</b> <b>flue</b> gas heat utilization. Water Boiling Test was conducted with the height of grate of 25 to 45 cm from the floor, natural or forced convection air underneath the grate, damper between combustion chamber <b>and</b> <b>flue</b> gas channel to the chimney was 10 to 20 cm height opened, and kinds and mixtures of biomass with any quantitative proportion. The result shows that the stove is green and saves the fire-wood fuel 70 % or more. It also shows performances as follow: higher heat transfer efficiency, namely up to 18. 78 %; very simple in operation and long service life; gives more benefits in health and safety; needs higher capital investment but low operational cost. Additionally, temperature profiles show that adjustable grate with distance to cooking pot not more than 25 cm probably {{plays an important role}} i...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol use {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} increased lung infections and exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. Whereas the effects of cigarette smoke are well recognized, the interplay of <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol in modulating lung diseases is not clear. Because innate lung defense is mechanically maintained by airway cilia action and protein kinase C (PKC) -activating agents slow ciliary beat frequency (CBF), we hypothesized {{that the combination of}} <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol would decrease CBF in a PKC-dependent manner. Primary ciliated bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 5 % cigarette smoke extract plus 100 mmol/L ethanol for up to 24 hours and assayed for CBF <b>and</b> PKCε. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol co-exposure activated PKCε by 1 hour and decreased both CBF and total number of beating cilia by 6 hours. A specific activator of PKCε, DCP-LA, slowed CBF after maximal PKCε activation. Interestingly, activation of PKCε by <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol was only observed in ciliated cells, not basal bronchial epithelium. In precision-cut mouse lung slices treated with <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, PKCε activation preceded CBF slowing. Correspondingly, increased PKCε activity and cilia slowing were only observed in mice co-exposed to <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, regardless of the sequence of the combination exposure. No decreases in CBF were observed in PKCε knockout mice co-exposed to <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol.
