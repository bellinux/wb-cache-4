5|$|Following the competition, Allward {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of 1921 and the spring of 1922 preparing for his move to Europe. After <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> home and studio, Allward finally departed for Belgium on 6 June 1922 and spent several months seeking a suitable studio in Belgium and then Paris, though he eventually set up a studio in London.|$|E

5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E

25|$|A free worker cannot <b>sell</b> <b>his</b> {{human capital}} in one go; {{it is far}} from being a liquid asset, even more {{illiquid}} than shares and land. He does not <b>sell</b> <b>his</b> skills, but contracts to utilize those skills, {{in the same way that}} an industrialist <b>sells</b> <b>his</b> produce, not his machinery. The exception here are slaves, whose human capital can be sold, though the slave does not earn an income himself.|$|R

5|$|Among {{those who}} met with Jinnah to seek his return was Liaquat Ali Khan, who {{would be a major}} {{political}} associate of Jinnah {{in the years to come}} and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah. In early 1934, Jinnah relocated to the subcontinent, though he shuttled between London and India on business for the next few years, <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> house in Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{an attempt}} to force Stroud to {{discontinue}} his business {{and get rid of}} his birds failed after Stroud and one of his mail correspondents, a bird researcher from Indiana named Della Mae Jones, made his story known to newspapers and magazines. A massive letter campaign and a 50,000-signature petition sent to President Herbert Hoover resulted in Stroud being permitted to keep his birds, and despite prison overcrowding, he was even given a second cell to house them. However, his letter-writing privileges were greatly curtailed. Jones and Stroud grew so close that she moved to Kansas in 1931, and started a business with him, <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> avian medicines.|$|E

5|$|McLachlan, who was {{inspired}} by both his father's photography and his own appreciation for the films Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Walkabout to choose his career path, {{would go on to}} find recognition as the chief cinematographer for the television series Millennium, for which he was scouted specifically. McLachlan's style on this series led to several industry awards and briefly became popular in the medium, as well as leading him directly to future work on Game of Thrones. He founded the documentary production company Omni Film Productions in the 1970s, later <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> share of the company.|$|E
5|$|Patty is {{the lead}} {{attorney}} in a high-profile litigation, representing the bankrupted workers of a large company run by Frobisher, who allegedly advised his employees {{to invest in the}} company while <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> own stock. Patty insists on taking the case to trial rather than accepting a settlement, but on Ellen's first day it is revealed that the prosecution cannot yet link Frobisher to his stockbroker—though both were in Palm Beach, Florida over the same weekend—and thus cannot disprove that the selling of his stock was not pre-arranged. When Ellen returns home, her boyfriend David Connor (Noah Bean) proposes to her and she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} funerals, he {{travelled}} to Amsterdam with Mugford and a friend, where {{he bought a}} large quantity of cannabis; the travel agent who sold the tickets said the group had been in high spirits. Bamber also began <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> family's belongings; Mugford's mother was offered June's car and an ad {{was placed in a}} local newspaper asking ₤900 for Nevill's. Just after his first arrest and release in September, Bamber tried to sell 20 nude photographs of Sheila for ₤20,000 to The Sun, and went on another overseas trip with a friend, Brent, this time to Saint-Tropez.|$|E

5|$|The film saw mixed reviews. Christopher Lee's {{performance}} as Scaramanga, {{intended to be}} a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond, was praised, but reviewers criticized the film as a whole, particularly the comedic approach, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. Although the film was profitable, it is the fourth lowest grossing Bond film in the series. It was also the last film to be co-produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, with Saltzman <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> 50% stake in Danjaq, LLC, the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E
5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting Formula One {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to support {{at least one}} car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.|$|E

5|$|An {{emigrant}} {{from his}} native Belgium, he arrived in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in Central America in 1906 or 1907. He began <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and New Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and {{he lived in a}} mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{career as}} a Republican newspaperman led {{naturally}} to involvement in Republican party politics. In 1856, he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention. From the party’s early days, Blaine identified with the conservative wing, supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont, the eventual nominee. The following year, Blaine was offered the editorship of the Portland Daily Advertiser, which he accepted, <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> interest in the Journal soon thereafter. He still maintained his home in Augusta, however, with his growing family. Although Blaine’s first son, Stanwood, died in infancy, he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward: Walker, in 1855, and Emmons, in 1857. They would have four more children in years to come: Alice, James, Margaret, and Harriet. It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife's new denomination, becoming {{a member of the}} South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, after <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> {{share of}} the law practice, Malone {{returned}} to Stratford. He started his own law firm in partnership with another practitioner. With a reduced work load, he began focus on his other interests, which included the military. Malone participated in New Zealand's militia, the Volunteer Force. In 1900, he helped raise the Stratford Rifle Volunteers, one of many units formed in the enthusiasm for the military during the Second Boer War, with himself as its captain. When he moved to New Plymouth in 1903, he relinquished his command. As {{a result of a}} request by his Volunteer Force battalion commander, Malone was made adjutant of the 4th Battalion of the Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle Volunteers. In 1905 he was second-in-command and by 1910, and now a lieutenant-colonel, he was the commander of the battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Dey {{retired after}} <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> {{ownership}} interest to Gorman and new investor Frank Ahearn. Ahearn and Gorman had an uneasy partnership {{and at one}} point Gorman was going to buy out Ahearn. By January 1925, the deal was nearly finalized when Gorman backed out of the deal. Instead, Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and a share of the Connaught Park Racetrack and Gorman moved on to New York to manage the New York Americans. In 1929, Ahearn sold the club to the Ottawa Auditorium corporation for $150,000, financed by a share issue. William Foran, the Stanley Cup trustee, became president of the Club. As the Auditorium did not meet its payments, Ahearn resumed a share of the club in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the roasted chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before <b>selling</b> <b>his</b> interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E
