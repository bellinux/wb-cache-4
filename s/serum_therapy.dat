25|$|As of 2015, 106 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine {{have been}} awarded to 198 men and 12 women. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to the German {{physiologist}} Emil von Behring, {{for his work}} on <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> {{and the development of a}} vaccine against diphtheria. The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Gerty Cori, received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose, important in many aspects of medicine, including treatment of diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine {{was awarded}} in 1901 to the German {{physiologist}} Emil Adolf von Behring. Behring's discovery of <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> in the [...] {{development of the}} diphtheria and tetanus vaccines put [...] "in {{the hands of the}} physician a victorious weapon against illness and deaths". In 1902, the award went to Ronald Ross for his work on malaria, [...] "by which he has shown how it enters the organism and thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it". He identified the mosquito as the transmitter of malaria, and worked tirelessly on measures to prevent malaria worldwide. The 1903 prize was awarded to Niels Ryberg Finsen, the first Danish laureate, [...] "in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially lupus vulgaris, with concentrated light radiation, whereby he has opened a new avenue for medical science". He died within a year after receiving the prize at the age of 43.|$|E
2500|$|The {{birth of}} active {{immunotherapy}} {{may have begun}} with Mithridates VI of Pontus. To induce active immunity for snake venom, he recommended using a method similar to modern toxoid <b>serum</b> <b>therapy,</b> by drinking the blood of animals which fed on venomous snakes. According to Jean de Maleissye, Mithridates assumed that animals feeding on venomous snakes acquired some detoxifying property in their bodies, and their blood must contain attenuated or transformed components of the snake venom. The action of those components might be strengthening the body to resist against the venom instead of exerting toxic effect. Mithridates reasoned that, by drinking the blood of these animals, he could acquire the similar resistance to the snake venom as the animals feeding on the snakes. [...] Similarly, he sought to harden himself against poison, and took daily sub-lethal doses to build tolerance. Mithridates is also said to have fashioned a 'universal antidote' {{to protect him from}} all earthly poisons. [...] For nearly 2000 years, poisons were thought to be the proximate cause of disease, and a complicated mixture of ingredients, called Mithridate, was used to cure poisoning during the Renaissance. An updated version of this cure, Theriacum Andromachi, was used well into the 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|Behring was the {{discoverer}} of diphtheria antitoxin in 1890 and {{attained a}} great reputation by that means {{and by his}} contributions {{to the study of}} immunity. He won the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 for the development of <b>serum</b> <b>therapies</b> against diphtheria (which Kitasato Shibasaburo and Emile Roux also contributed to) and tetanus. The former had been a scourge of the population, especially children, whereas the other was a leading cause of death in wars, killing the wounded. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1902. At the International Tuberculosis Congress in 1905 he announced that he had discovered [...] "a substance proceeding from the virus of tuberculosis." [...] This substance, which he designated [...] "T C", plays the important part in the immunizing action of Professor Behring's [...] "bovivaccine", which prevents bovine tuberculosis. He tried unsuccessfully to obtain a protective and therapeutic agent for humans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment is}} chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) replacement <b>therapy.</b> <b>Serum</b> cholesterol levels are also followed. If hypercholesterolemia is not controlled with CDCA, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ("statins" [...] such as simvastatin) {{can also be}} used.|$|R
50|$|Due to his {{outstanding}} work, {{the government}} of São Paulo founded a new <b>Serum</b> <b>Therapy</b> Institute in 1901 and gave its directorship to Vital Brazil.

50|$|Review of {{treatments}} of leprosy, especially on chaulmoogra oil. He made a special lecture on this title at the 13th Congress of the JapaneseAssociation of Leprosy in 1939 at Sendai. His review included treatments of leprosy with gold, silver, cupper, arsenics, iodine, timol, pigments, nonspecific immune therapies, sulfon drugs, vitamine, bacterial toxins, <b>serum</b> <b>therapies,</b> nutritional therapies; especially chaulmoogra oil. On sulphon-amids, he tested Therapol (paraamino-benzolsulfon amid) {{and found it}} was effective in 55.6% (10 cases) out of 18 cases. However, he concluded that with Therapol only, the sulphon-amids could not be expected as treatment of leprosy. On chaulmoogra oil, he reported it was effective in 30% in the Kyushu Sanatorium (he studied it between 1919 and 1930) and in 56.6% in Formosa (data between 1930 and 1939), while Hayashi Y. reported that it was effective in 50-80% of cases in the Zenshoen Hospital, Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium. He concluded that chaulmoogra oil was the only hopeful treatment for patients whose leprosy was not severe, and the mechanism was the activation {{of the immune system}} by stimulating the reticulo-endothlial system or lymphatic system. This was also the conclusion of his reports for Ph.D. in 1930.|$|R

50|$|In 1888 Behring {{was sent}} to Berlin for a brief service at the Academy for Military Medicine. In 1889, he joined the Institute for Hygiene of the University of Berlin, then presided over by Robert Koch. Between 1889 and 1895 Behring {{developed}} his pioneering ideas on <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> and his theory of antitoxins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Serum</b> <b>therapy</b> for {{infectious}} diseases was displaced by antibiotics in the 1940s, but identification of specific serotypes remained {{important as the}} understanding of the epidemiology of pneumococcal infections still required their identification to determine where different serotypes spread, as well as the variable invasiveness of different serotypes. Understanding the prevalence of various serotypes was also critical to the development of pneumococcal vaccines to prevent invasive infections.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 he {{was awarded}} the Emil von Behring prize, which is awarded every two years by the University of Marburg for {{outstanding}} achievements in immunology, <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> and chemotherapy. Uhlenhuth had multiple articles published in peer reviewed journals and was an active researcher in various areas of bacteriology and immunology including research into chemotherapy and syphilis. Paul Ehrlich, winner of the 1908 Nobel Prize in Medicine, was an associate of Uhlenhuth.|$|E

On returning to Japan, he was appointed as Professor of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Imperial University in 1913, before becoming Director of the Kyoundo Hospital in Tokyo in 1916. In addition, he became Director at the Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research in 1935.|$|E
50|$|In 1898 Albert Neisser {{published}} {{clinical trials}} on <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> {{in patients with}} syphilis. He injected cell free serum from patients with syphilis into patients who were admitted for other medical conditions. Most of these patients were prostitutes, who were neither informed about the experiment nor asked for their consent. When some of them contracted syphilis Neisser argued that the women did not contract syphilis {{as a result of}} his serum injections but contracted the disease because they worked as prostitutes.|$|E
50|$|He studied under Dr. Robert Koch in the University of Berlin from 1885 to 1891. In 1889, {{he became}} the first person to grow the Tetanus {{bacillus}} in pure culture, and in 1890 cooperated with Emil von Behring in developing a <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> for tetanus using this pure culture. He also worked on antitoxins for diphtheria and anthrax. Kitasato and Behring demonstrated the value of antitoxin in preventing disease by causing passive immunity to tetanus in an animal that received graded injections of blood serum from another animal infected with the disease.|$|E

5000|$|In 1905 Weichardt was habilitated for {{hygiene and}} {{experimental}} therapy at the University of Erlangen, where he {{later became a}} {{professor and director of}} the Bayerische Bakteriologische Untersuchungsanstalt. He made contributions in his research of anaphylaxis, metabolism and fatigue. Weickardt postulated that there was a specific [...] "toxin of fatigue", and {{in the early part of}} the 20th century he performed numerous experiments with chemical antitoxins in an effort to battle fatigue. With hygienist Adolf Dieudonné (1864-1944), he was co-author of Immunität, Schutzimpfung und Serumtherapie (Immunity, vaccination and <b>serum</b> <b>therapy).</b>|$|E
50|$|On May 25, 1900, the Federal <b>Serum</b> <b>Therapy</b> Institute {{destined to}} the {{production}} of sera and vaccines against the bubonic plague was created with Baron Pedro Afonso as director general and the young bacteriologist Oswaldo Cruz as technical director. The new institute was established in the old farm of Manguinhos at the western shores of Guanabara Bay. In 1902, Cruz accepted the office of director general of the institute and soon expanded the scope of its activities, now no longer restricted {{to the production}} of sera but also dedicated to basic and applied research and to the building of human resources. In the following year, Cruz was appointed director general of Public Health, a position corresponding to today's Brazilian Minister of Health.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} on snakebites was undertaken to evaluate the various recommended and practised methods of treatment used over the years, and to choose {{the most effective and}} least mutilating therapy for snakebite victims.

40|$|A patient without prostatic {{carcinoma}} {{had a high}} concentra-tion of prostatic {{acid phosphatase}} (PAP; EC 3. 1. 3. 2) in his serum. This PAP was bound to I 9 G (“macro-PAP”), and I 9 G autoantibodies against PAP were demonstrated in serum. The patient’s IgG prolonged the biological half-life of radiola-beled PAP in rats, suggesting that the formation of IgG-PAP complexes was responsible for decreased PAP catabolism. Furthermore, macro-PAP was inactivated in serum more slowly than PAP. These factors accounted for the increases in the enzymatic activity and antigenic concentration of PAP measured in the patient’s <b>serum.</b> Inappropriate <b>therapy</b> was prescribed {{on the basis of}} this laboratory result.

50|$|Using the Federal <b>Serum</b> <b>Therapy</b> Institute as technical-scientific base, he {{embarked}} {{in quick}} succession of important sanitation campaigns. His first challenge {{was a series of}} yellow fever endemics, which had earned Rio de Janeiro the sinister reputation of 'Foreigners' Grave'. Between 1897 and 1906, 4,000 European immigrants had died there from the disease. Cruz pursued the new technique of eradicating mosquitoes and their breeding grounds, fumigating houses, and isolation of the ill. There was opposition to the campaign by many, including physicians, the military, and the poor, but the campaign was successful. Cruz was initially successful in the sanitary campaign against the bubonic plague, to which end he used obligatory notification of cases, isolation of sick people, treatment with the sera produced at Manguinhos and extermination of the rats populating the city.|$|E
50|$|The pneumococcal Quellung {{reaction}} was first described in 1902 by the scientist Fred Neufeld, and {{applied only to}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, both as microscopic capsular swelling and macroscopic agglutination (clumping visible with the naked eye). It was initially an intellectual curiosity more than anything else, and could distinguish only the three pneumococcal serotypes known at that time. However, it acquired an important practical use {{with the advent of}} <b>serum</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat certain types of pneumococcal pneumonia in the 1920s because selection of the proper antiserum to treat an individual patient required correct identification of the infecting pneumococcal serotype, and the Quellung {{reaction was}} the only method available to do this. Dr. Albert Sabin made modifications to Neufeld's technique so that it could be done more rapidly, and other scientists expanded the technique to identify 29 additional serotypes.|$|E
5000|$|Before the Institute of Experimental Therapy {{had moved}} to Frankfurt, Ehrlich had already resumed work on {{methylene}} blue. After the death of Georg Speyer, his widow Franziska Speyer endowed the Georg-Speyer House in his memory which was erected next door to Ehrlich’s institute. As director of the Georg-Speyer House, Ehrlich transferred his chemotherapeutic research there. He was looking for an agent which was as effective as methylene blue, but without its side effects. His model was {{on the one hand}} the impact of quinine on malaria, and on the other hand, in analogy to <b>serum</b> <b>therapy,</b> he thought there must also be chemical pharmaceuticals which would have just as specific an effect on individual diseases. His goal was to find a [...] "Therapia sterilisans magna," [...] in other words a treatment that could kill all disease pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine can be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or <b>serum</b> to monitor <b>therapy</b> in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually {{in the range of}} 2–10mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.|$|R
40|$|Human serum {{contains}} a physiological plethora of bioactive elements naturally released by activated platelets {{which might have}} a significant effect on the regeneration of corneal layers by stimulating the cell growth. This mechanism supported the use of human serum eye drops in some ocular diseases associated with dystrophic changes and alterations of the tear film, such as persistent corneal epithelial defects and dry eye syndrome. We focused our effort on potential benefits and limitations of the use of human serum eye drops when conventional therapies failed. We reviewed the recent literature by reporting published studies from 2010 to 2014. Despite the limited evaluated study populations, most of the clinical studies have confirmed that <b>serum</b> eye drop <b>therapy</b> is effective in corneal healing by reducing ocular symptom, particularly during the short-term follow-up. In addition, three recent published studies have shown the efficacy of the <b>serum</b> eye drop <b>therapy</b> in comparison to traditional ones in intractable patients. Besides, reported ongoing clinical studies confirmed the open debate regarding the use of biologic tools for cornea regeneration. Results from these studies might open novel challenges and perspectives in the therapy of such refractory patients...|$|R
