40|$|Successful {{pancreatic}} islet transplantation {{depends on the}} number of islets transplanted, islet viability and extent of early islet loss due to ischaemia reperfusion injury. Novel pancreas preservation techniques which can improve these variables can increase the utilisation of non-heart-beating-donor pancreases for islet transplantation. A non-heart-beating-donor rat pancreas preservation model was developed. Pancreases preserved by either <b>static</b> cold <b>storage,</b> hypothermic machine perfusion or portal venous oxygen persufflation underwent islet isolation and purification. The yield, viability and in vitro function of isolated islets were compared. Portal venous oxygen persufflation improved the islet yield, viability and morphology as compared to <b>static</b> cold <b>storage.</b> The percentage of pancreases with functional islets (stimulation index greater than 1. 0) was also higher after oxygen persufflation as compared to <b>static</b> cold <b>storage.</b> Severity of reperfusion injury in pancreases preserved by <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> or portal venous oxygen persufflation was compared after in vitro warm reperfusion. Amylase, lipase and glycerol levels in the portal effluent were measured. Lipid peroxidation and apoptosis in reperfused pancreas were measured using thio-barbituric acid reactive substances assay and caspase 3 assay respectively. Expression of genes relevant to ischaemia reperfusion was compared using RNA microarrays. Severity of ischaemia reperfusion injury was similar in both groups. Microarray analysis revealed increased expression of genes related to apoptosis in the portal venous oxygen persufflation group. This group also showed up-regulation of pro-survival cellular pathways and over-expression of genes related to cellular repair as compared to <b>static</b> cold <b>storage.</b> This project has for the first time evaluated oxygen persufflation as a method of pancreas preservation and investigated changes in global gene expression after this form of preservation. Overall, the project suggests that portal venous oxygen persufflation improves the recovery of non-heart-beating-donor rat pancreas. Further investigation to examine its role in the preservation of large animal pancreases is needed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adequate {{preservation}} of renal allografts for transplantation {{is important for}} maintaining and improving transplant outcomes. There are two prevalent methods: hypothermic machine perfusion and <b>static</b> cold <b>storage.</b> The preferred method of storage, however, remains controversial. The objective was to review systematically the evidence comparing outcomes from these two modalities. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Transplant Library and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The final date for searches was 30 November 2012. Studies were assessed for methodological quality. Summary effects were calculated as relative risk (RR) with 95 per cent confidence interval (c. i.). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were included, but evaluated separately. Results from RCTs alone were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including seven RCTs (1475 kidneys) and 11 non-RCTs (728 kidneys). The overall risk of delayed graft function was lower with hypothermic machine perfusion than <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> (RR 0 · 81, 95 per cent c. i. 0 · 71 to 0 · 92; P = 0 · 002). There {{was no difference in}} the rate of primary non-function (RR 1 · 15, 0 · 46 to 2 · 90; P = 0 · 767). There was a faster initial fall in the level of serum creatinine with hypothermic machine perfusion in two RCTs, but not in another. There was no relationship between rates of acute rejection or patient survival and the method of preservation. CONCLUSION: Data from the included studies suggest that hypothermic machine perfusion reduces delayed graft function compared with <b>static</b> cold <b>storage.</b> There was no difference in primary non-function, acute rejection, long-term renal function or patient survival.

40|$|Introduction: Increasing {{the usage}} of hearts from {{marginal}} donors and from donors after circulatory death (DCD) {{has the potential to}} expand the donor pool. Such hearts may be resuscitated when subjected to ex vivo perfusion. In addition, this may provide an opportunity for viability testing prior to transplant. We describe a novel ex vivo perfusion system designed to reanimate porcine DCD hearts. The same system was subsequently tested using a human heart from a marginal brainstem-dead donor. Method: In {{the first phase of the}} study 23 porcine hearts were procured following circulatory death. All hearts were subjected to a period of primary warm ischemia followed by 120 minutes of hypothermic preservation. The period of hypothermic preservation was initially <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> (SCS); then oxygenated machine perfusion and finally a combination of <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> and oxygen persufflation via the coronary sinus. Ex vivo perfusion of the hearts was performed with a normothermic, oxygenated blood-based solution in our Langendorff system.

40|$|Background: Lack {{of oxygen}} and biomechanical {{stimulation}} during <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> (SCS) of donor livers compromises endothelial cell function. We investigated {{the effect of}} end-ischemic oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) on endothelial cell function of extended criteria donor (ECD) livers. Methods: Eighteen livers, declined for transplantation, were transported to our center using <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> (SCS). After SCS, 6 livers underwent two hours of HMP, and subsequent normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to assess viability. Twelve control livers underwent NMP immediately after SCS. mRNA expression of transcription factor Kruppel-like-factor 2 (KLF 2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and thrombomodulin (TM) was quantified by RT-PCR. Endothelial cell function and injury were assessed by nitric oxide (NO) production and release of TM into the perfusate. Results: In HMP livers, mRNA expression of KLF 2 (p = 0. 043), eNOS (p = 0. 028), and TM (p = 0. 028) increased significantly during NMP. In parallel, NO levels increased during NMP in HMP livers but not in controls. At the end of NMP cumulative TM release was significantly lower HMP livers, compared to controls (p = 0. 028).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hypothermic machine {{perfusion}} {{may improve}} outcome after transplantation of kidneys donated after cardiac death (DCD), but no sufficiently powered prospective {{studies have been}} reported. Because organ shortage {{has led to an}} increased use of DCD kidneys, we aimed to compare hypothermic machine perfusion with the current standard of <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> preservation. METHODS: Eighty-two kidney pairs from consecutive, controlled DCD donors 16 years or older were included in this randomized controlled trial in Eurotransplant. One kidney was randomly assigned to machine perfusion and the contralateral kidney to <b>static</b> cold <b>storage</b> according to computer-generated lists created by the permuted block method. Kidneys were allocated according to standard rules, with concealment of the preservation method. Primary endpoint was delayed graft function (DGF), defined as dialysis requirement in the first week after transplantation. All 164 recipients were followed until 1 year after transplantation. RESULTS: Machine perfusion reduced the incidence of DGF from 69. 5 % to 53. 7 % (adjusted odds ratio: 0. 43; 95 % confidence interval 0. 20 - 0. 89; P = 0. 025). DGF was 4 days shorter in recipients of machine-perfused kidneys (P = 0. 082). Machine-perfused kidneys had a higher creatinine clearance up to 1 month after transplantation (P = 0. 027). One-year graft and patient survival was similar in both groups (93. 9 % vs 95. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermic machine perfusion was associated with a reduced risk of DGF and better early graft function up to 1 month after transplantation.

Porcine livers were perfused with pump pressures that were set at 4 mmHg (continuous, portal vein) and 30 / 20 mmHg, at 60 BPM (pulsatile, hepatic artery). Control livers were preserved using the clinical golden standard: <b>static</b> cold <b>storage.</b> In the HMP group, pressure, flow and temperature were continuously monitored for 24 h. At time-points t = 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h samples of University of Wisconsin machine preservation solution were taken for measurement of partial oxygen pressure (pO(2)) and lacto-dehydrogenase. Biopsies in every lobe were taken for histology and electron microscopy; samples of ice, preservation solution, liver surface, and bile were taken and cultured to determine sterility.
