5|$|At {{the time}} of his {{succession}} Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas-Home) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues, ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E

5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the year) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority. Each of these communities sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show their loyalty. At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> all the communities under him.|$|E

25|$|Because {{there was}} no orchestra, {{there was no}} space {{separating}} the audience from the stage. The audience could stand {{directly in front of}} the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and hear every word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.|$|E

Kislyak was hesitant to allow Americans to have access to Russia's secure communications network, and no such channel was actually set up.|$|E

Their requests to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> Elvis about their employment termination and the nominal severance pay were not granted.

25|$|Members of the Royal Family {{have been}} present in Canada since the late 18th century, their reasons {{including}} participating in military manoeuvres, serving as the federal viceroy, or undertaking official royal tours. A prominent feature of the latter are numerous royal walkabouts, the tradition of which was initiated in 1939 by Queen Elizabeth {{when she was in}} Ottawa and broke from the royal party to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> gathered veterans. Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of Canadian culture will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other royals will be asked to participate in lesser occasions. A household to assist and tend to the monarch forms part of the royal party.|$|E

With the Worldmind and the Nova Force, Rider possesses tremendously augmented strength and durability as well as nearly limitless quantities of energy. The Worldmind consists of the entire culture and history of Xandar as well as the individual minds of thousands of years of dead Xandarians. The consensus voice of the Worldmind can <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> Rider, helping him to control the Nova Force, fight enemies, sense energy, interface with electronics, and protect against psionic abilities. The Worldmind can also assume direct control of Rider's body when he is asleep.|$|E

25|$|By 1995, the {{governing}} New Democratic Party and incumbent Premier Bob Rae had become extremely unpopular with the electorate, {{partly due to}} the state of the Ontario economy and its record debt and deficit amidst a Canada-wide recession. Lyn McLeod's Liberals were leading in pre-election polls and were expected to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP, but they began losing support due to several controversial policy reversals and what was generally regarded as an uninspiring campaign. The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris' performance in the televised leaders' debate. Harris used his camera time to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the camera to convey his party's Common Sense Revolution platform. He was elected with a large majority government in the 1995 election. Roughly half of his party's seats came from the suburban belt surrounding Metro Toronto, often called the '905' for its telephone area code.|$|E
25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them to keep moving {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{communication between}} diver and attendant was by pulls on the diver's lifeline. Later a speaking tube system was tried, {{but it was}} not very successful. A small number were made by Seibe-Gorman, but the telephone system was introduced soon after this and since it worked better and was safer, the speaking tube was soon obsolete, and most helmets which had them were returned to the factory and converted. In the early 20th century electrical telephone systems were developed which improved the quality of voice communication. These used wires incorporated into the lifeline or air line, and used either headsets worn inside the helmet or speakers mounted inside the helmet. The microphone could be mounted {{in the front of the}} helmet or a contact throat-microphone could be used. At first it was only possible for the diver to talk to the surface telephonist, but later double telephone systems were introduced which allowed two-divers to <b>speak</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> each other, while being monitored by the attendant. Diver telephones were manufactured by Siebe-Gorman, Heinke, Rene Piel, Morse, Eriksson, Draeger and others. This system was well-established by the mid-20th century, and has been technologically improved, but is still in common use for surface-supplied divers using lightweight demand helmets and full-face masks.|$|E
