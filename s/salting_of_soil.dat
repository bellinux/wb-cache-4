As a result of drip-irrigation with local high salinity groundwater (2.8 ~ 29.7 g/L), soil salt crusts develop extensively in the shelterbelt [7, 10].

Environmenal and socio-economic aspects of industrial effluent irrigation have not been studied as extensively as domesticsewage based irrigation practices, at least for developing countries like India. Disposal of treated and untreated industrial effluents on land has become a regular practice for some industries. Industries located in Mettupalayam taluk, Tamilnadu dispose their effluents on land, and the farmers of the adjacen farmlands have complained that their shallow open wells get polluted and also the <b>salt</b> content <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> has started building up slowly. This study attempts to capure the environmental and socio-economic impacts of industrial effluent irrigation in different industrial locations at Mettupalayam taluk through primary surveys and secondary information. This study found that coninuous {{disposal of}} industrial effluents on land, which has limited capacity to assimilate the pollution load, has led to groundwater pollution. Ground water quality of shallow open wells surrounding the industrial locations has deteriorated, and the application of polluted groundwater fo irrigation has resulted in increased <b>salt</b> conent <b>of</b> <b>soils.</b> In some locations drinking water wells (deep bore wells) also have high concentration <b>of</b> <b>salts.</b> Since the farmers had already shifted their cropping pattern to salt toleran crops (like jasmine, curry leaf, tobacco etc.) and substituted their irrigation source from shallow open wells to deep bore wells and/or river water the impact of pollution on livelihood was minimised. Since the local administration is supplying drinking water to households the impact in the domestic secor has been minimised. It has also been noticed that in some locations industries are supplying drinking water to the affected households.

Scientists at the US Agricultural Research Service have discovered that a grass which is a cross between sorghum and Sudan Grass, called 'Sordan Grass', has the same effect as gypsum. The roots of this grass produce twice as much carbon dioxide as other plants. When combined with water the carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid which dissolves the chalk found in the soil. This chalk then replaces the sodium retained by the clay particles in the soil. There is much to be said for this approach: it is cheaper, since not only is it expensive to apply gypsum, but the land then cannot be used for a whole season.
