50|$|Coscinasterias tenuispina is a starfish in {{the family}} Asteriidae. It is {{sometimes}} called the blue <b>spiny</b> <b>starfish</b> or the white starfish. It occurs in shallow waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|Marthasterias is a genus of starfish in {{the family}} Asteriidae. It is {{monotypic}} and the only species in the genus is Marthasterias glacialis, {{commonly known as the}} <b>spiny</b> <b>starfish.</b> It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The main {{predator}}s on P. lividus in the Mediterranean Sea are {{the spider}} crab (Maja crispata), the fish Diplodus sargus, Diplodus vulgaris,Labrus merula and Coris julis and the gastropod, Hexaplex trunculus. The <b>spiny</b> <b>starfish</b> (Marthasterias glacialis) is a main predator elsewhere. Predation {{is dependent on}} size; juvenile urchins are more vulnerable as their spines are less formidable. In most locations the urchins are nocturnal feeders, but where predators are more active at night the urchins may feed during day instead.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the <b>spiny</b> scallop include <b>starfish,</b> {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|R
50|$|There are twelve small islands on the Namibian coast between Walvis Bay and Orange River. Due to the Benguela Current, {{the seas}} {{on the west}} coast of {{southern}} Africa {{are some of the most}} productive in the world. The current flows north from the Southern Ocean and offshore winds drive the surface water away from the coast. Water rises from depths of hundreds of metres and at speeds of up to 12 m per minute bringing nutrients to the surface. A combination of sunlight and nutrients provide the conditions for phytoplankton which are the foundation for other life in the Benguela marine ecosystem. Feeding on the phytoplankton are Zooplankton, which attract an abundance of shoaling pelagic fish and is the reason why southern Africa is home to one of the richest seabird communities in the world. The islands off the west coast of southern Africa provide refuge from predators and Cape gannet (Morus capensis) and Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) are the region's most abundant seabirds with tens of thousands on the islands during the nesting season. The birds guano also provide nutrients which flow into the surrounding sea when large waves hit the island or when it rains. The guano enriches the rocky shore with carpets of seaweed grazed by goat's-eye limpets, which are predated by <b>spiny</b> <b>starfish.</b>|$|E
40|$|Asteroids {{are largely}} {{recognized}} as important predators {{in all of}} the world's oceans and for this reason, they {{play a crucial role in}} shaping the structure and functioning of benthic ecosystems. The <b>spiny</b> <b>starfish</b> Marthasterias glacialis is generally considered a voracious predator of molluscs, in particular bivalves. Using field observations and carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) stable isotopes, we explored possible changes in diet in relation to size of M. glacialis. Data were collected at Ustica Island (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea) from June 2008 to June 2010. M. glacialis showed a size shift in feeding preferences due to different use of food items: bivalves, Columbella rustica, Euthria cornea and Trochoidea were strongly selected by small starfish whereas the larger ones preferred Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus. The clear picture that emerged is that large M. glacialis is able to control sea urchin populations and indirectly Mediterranean rocky reef ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral Western European {{countries}} are {{planning for a}} significant development of offshore renewable energy along the European Atlantic Ocean coast, including many thousands of wave energy devices and wind turbines. There is an increasing interest in articulating the added values {{of the creation of}} artificial hard bottom habitats through the construction of offshore renewable energy devices, for the benefit of fisheries management and conservation. The is a test park for wave power located about 100 km north of Gothenburg at the Swedish west coast. A wave energy device consists of a linear wave power generator attached to a foundation on the seabed, and connected by a wire to a buoy at the surface. Our field experiment examined the function of wave energy foundations as artificial reefs. In addition, potentials for enhancing the abundance of associated fish and crustaceans through manufactured holes of the foundations were also investigated. Assemblages of mobile organisms were examined by visual censuses in July and August 2007, 3 months after deployment of the foundations. Results generally show low densities of mobile organisms, but a significantly higher abundance of fish and crabs on the foundations compared to surrounding soft bottoms. Further, while fish numbers were not influenced by increased habitat complexity (holes), it had a significantly positive effect on quantities of edible crab () on average leading to an almost five-fold increase in densities of this species. Densities of <b>spiny</b> <b>starfish</b> () were negatively affected by the presence of holes, potentially due to increased predator abundance (e. g.). These results suggest a species-specific response to enhanced habitat complexity...|$|E
