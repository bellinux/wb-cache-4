5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, <b>swamp</b> <b>deer,</b> blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Jahangir {{also kept}} {{detailed}} records of his hunts. From {{the ages of}} 12 (1580) to 48, 28,532 animals had been hunted with 17,167 by himself. These included 86 tigers (and lions), 9 bears, leopards, foxes, otters (ubdilao) and hyaenas, 889 – blue bulls (nilgai) and 35 mhaka. Salim Ali suggests that the mhaka must refer to <b>swamp</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>swamp</b> <b>deer</b> or {{barasingha}} {{was found}} in Mehrgarh in Baluchistan till 300 BC and probably became locally extinct due to over-hunting and loss of riverine habitat to cultivation. A species of wild cattle, Bos primegenius nomadicus or the zebu vanished early on from its range in the Indus basin and western India, possibly due to inter-breeding with domestic cattle and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.|$|E
50|$|Finlayson survives as {{a getaway}} place for vacationers. During deer season, Finlayson {{is packed with}} the colors of blaze orange and camouflage. The city's land {{consists}} of many fields and <b>swamp</b> where the <b>deer</b> are common. The Municipal hosts a gun raffle and a meat raffle during these weeks that attract outsiders to join in with the festivities.|$|R
50|$|Fauna on the {{mountain}} includes <b>swamp</b> wallabies, <b>deer,</b> spotted-tailed quolls, southern brown bandicoots, grey-headed flying foxes, sugar gliders, wombats, possums, giant burrowing frogs, red-crowned toadlets, striped marsh frogs, eastern water dragons, water skinks, blue-tongued lizards, diamond pythons, red-bellied black snakes, golden-crowned snakes and broad-headed snakes, {{although it is not}} common to see snakes, as some sources state incorrectly. Common birds are lyrebirds, spotted turtle doves, kookaburras, satin bower birds, superb blue wrens, crimson rosellas, king parrots, white-headed pigeons, brown cuckoo-doves, silvereyes, eastern yellow robins, rainbow lorikeets, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, golden whistlers, topknot ("flocker") pigeons, wonga pigeons, Australian magpies, pied currawongs, Australian ravens, noisy miners, honeyeaters (Lewin's, New Holland, spinebill, yellow-faced) eastern whipbirds, white-browed scrub wrens, rufous fantails, red-browed finches, and welcome swallows. In 1804 a logrunner bird was collected on Mount Kembla, this being the first to be scientifically described, although it is not common to see logrunners, or brush turkeys as some sources incorrectly state.|$|R
60|$|Solitary {{and remote}} from the usual haunts of men as this lake was, there was no feeling of {{solitude}} {{about it at the}} time we write of. The entire region was alive with wild fowl of many kinds. Wild geese trumpeted their advent as they came from the far north, en route for the far south, and settled on the bosom of Silver Lake to take a night's lodging there. Ducks, from the same region, and bound for the same goal--though with less stately and regular flight--flew hither and thither with whistling wings, ever and anon going swash into the water as a tempting patch of reeds invited them to feed, or a whim of fancy induced them to rest. Wild swans occasionally sailed in all their majesty on its waters, while plover of every length of limb and bill, and every species of plaintive cry, waded round its margin, or swept in clouds over the neighbouring <b>swamps.</b> Sometimes <b>deer</b> would trot out of the woods and slake their thirst on its shore, and the frequent rings that broke its smooth surface told of life in the watery depths below.|$|R
25|$|Dudhwa National Park: It covers {{an area of}} 500km2 {{along the}} Indo-Nepal border in Lakhimpur Kheri {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh, {{is best known for}} the barasingha or <b>swamp</b> <b>deer.</b> The grasslands and woodlands of this park, consist mainly of sal forests. The barasingha is found in the southwest and southeast regions of the park. Among the big cats, tigers abound at Dudhwa. There are also a few leopards. The other animals found in large numbers, are the Indian rhinoceros, elephant, jungle cats, leopard cats, fishing cats, jackals, civets, sloth bears, sambar, otters, crocodiles and chital.|$|E
25|$|The {{endangered}} species that {{live within the}} Sundarbans and extinct species {{that used to be}} include the royal Bengal tigers, estuarine crocodile, northern river terrapins (Batagur baska), olive ridley sea turtles, Gangetic dolphin, ground turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (Axis porcinus), water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), barasingha or <b>swamp</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervus duvauceli), Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), single horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British. There are other threatened mammal species, such as the capped langurs (Semnopithecus pileatus), smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), Oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea), and great Bengal civets (Viverra zibetha).|$|E
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, <b>swamp</b> <b>deer,</b> wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We studied <b>swamp</b> rabbits, white-tailed <b>deer,</b> {{and small}} mammals in an old-growth and {{adjacent}} second-growth and young-growth bottomland hardwood forest stands in southern Arkansas, August 1991 –February 1993. Based on average home range size {{and degree of}} overlap, minimum and maximum density estimates of swamp rabbits were 31 per km 2 (no overlap) and 52 per km 2 (overlap), respectively. Pellet group estimates of white-tailed deer suggested that density varied from virtually zero in spring to 22 per km 2 during autumn. With 29, 436 trap nights of total effort during winter, spring, and summer seasons, we captured 939 small mammals that were distributed among 14 species. There were more individuals (n = 445) of more species (S = 11) in old-growth forest than other habitats; more new animals were captured during spring (n = 378). Peromyscus gossypinus was clearly the most abundant species in all habitats during all seasons; {{but it was always}} more abundant in old growth than other habitats. Ochrotomys nuttalli was the only species that was notably more abundant in habitat other than old growth...|$|R
500|$|A major {{incident}} {{in the history of}} the reserve followed the construction of a dam at the Kalagarh river and the submerging of [...] of prime low lying riverine area. The consequences ranged from local extinction of <b>swamp</b> <b>deer</b> to a massive reduction in hog deer population. The reservoir formed due to the submerging of land has also led to an increase in aquatic fauna and has additionally served as a habitat for winter migrants.|$|E
2500|$|The eastern <b>swamp</b> <b>deer</b> had 468 {{individuals}} in 2002, down 38% from 756 in 1984. This {{may be a}} reflection of the increasing tiger population.|$|E
