50|$|Air shafts {{are used}} on many {{converting}} machines. An {{example of one}} of these machines is a <b>slitting</b> <b>machine</b> or slitter rewinder which is used to cut or slit large rolls of material into smaller rollers.|$|E
50|$|Many {{converting}} {{companies will}} process large diameter, wide rolls of material as this increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes. On {{completion of the}} converting process the rolls may be cut into smaller rolls on a <b>slitting</b> <b>machine.</b> These rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and other machines. Alternatively, the rolls may be sheeted-cut into sheets — as happens in newspaper and book printing. Further processes such as collation may occur after sheeting.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of gravure presses print on rolls (also known as webs) of paper or other substrates, rather than sheets. (Sheetfed gravure is a small, specialty market.) Rotary gravure presses are the fastest and widest presses in operation, printing everything from narrow labels to 12-foot-wide (3.66-meter-wide) rolls of vinyl flooring. For maximum efficiency, gravure presses operate at high speeds producing large diameter, wide rolls. These are then cut or slit down to the finished roll size on a <b>slitting</b> <b>machine</b> or slitter rewinder. Additional operations may be in line with a gravure press, such as saddle stitching facilities for magazine or brochure work.|$|E

50|$|Web guiding systems work at high speed, {{constantly}} {{making small}} adjustments {{to maintain the}} position of the material. The latest systems use digital technology and touch screen operator interfaces so simplify set up. Web guiding systems are used on <b>slitting</b> <b>machines,</b> slitter rewinders, printing presses, coating and laminating machines.|$|R
50|$|The rewind section {{also has}} options. The main type is centre winding using {{differential}} rewind shafts. These shafts are becoming universal on most <b>slitting</b> <b>machines.</b> The differential shafts ensure an even tension across the full {{width of the}} material. Closed-loop control of the winding tension using feedback from load cells provides the total tension-control system required for running tension-sensitive materials. Precise and accurate tension control {{is the key to}} good roll <b>slitting.</b> Modern <b>machines</b> use AC vector drives with closed-loop feedback from AC motors. When used with the correct control algorithms, they produce excellent results with the minimum of maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a technique}} heavily used by Converters (industry). The converter industry normally refers to companies who print, coat and laminate materials. A typical converter {{is a company that}} produces flexible packaging material for packaging food. This may involve purchasing large rolls of plastic film such as biaxially orientated polypropylene (BOPP) which is then printed to the customer's design and coated with cold seal adhesive for use on high speed packaging machines. This material is printed and coated in wide, large diameter rolls for maximum efficiency. The rolls are then slit, using a <b>slitting</b> <b>machine,</b> into smaller rolls of the size to be used on the packaging machine.|$|E
5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into narrower rolls. There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form narrower rolls. The multiple narrower strips of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For rewind slitting the machine used is called a slitter rewinder, a slitter or a <b>slitting</b> <b>machine</b> - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|E

50|$|Printing press {{speeds of}} up to 600 meters per minute (2000 feet per minute) are {{achievable}} now with modern technology high-end printers. Flexo printing is widely used in the converting industry for printing plastic materials for packaging and other end uses. For maximum efficiency, the flexo presses produce large rolls of material that are then slit down to their finished size on <b>slitting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Laser cutting {{can place}} many precise holes in a web. Laser {{perforations}} look similar {{in many respects}} to hot needle perforations. However, laser systems are expensive. The big advantage of laser perforation is {{the consistency of the}} hole size, compared to mechanical perforation. This is very important in modified atmosphere packaging for fresh produce. The laser perforation is often carried out on roll <b>slitting</b> <b>machines</b> (slitter rewinder) as the printed material is slit down to the finished roll size.|$|R
50|$|When {{polypropylene}} film is extruded and stretched {{in both the}} machine direction and across machine direction it is called biaxially oriented polypropylene. Biaxial orientation increases strength and clarity. BOPP is widely used as a packaging material for packaging products such as snack foods, fresh produce and confectionery. It is easy to coat, print and laminate to give the required appearance and properties {{for use as a}} packaging material. This process is normally called converting. It is normally produced in large rolls which are <b>slit</b> on <b>slitting</b> <b>machines</b> into smaller rolls for use on packaging machines.|$|R
50|$|Acres {{invented the}} first British 35 mm moving picture camera, the first {{daylight}} loading home movie camera and projector, Birtac, {{was the first}} travelling newsreel reporter in international film history and the first European film maker who had his films shown in the United States in public performances. He contributed much to the introduction and development of cinematography in all its aspects, from the construction of cameras, projectors, film viewers, coating- and <b>slitting</b> <b>machines</b> and the manufacture of highly sensitized 35 mm raw film stock, to mobile newsreel reporting and the public projections of moving pictures.|$|R
50|$|Materials such as paper, plastic film, {{foil and}} cloth often are {{produced}} in long, continuous sheets that are rolled up for more convenient handling and transportation. These rolls of material vary significantly {{in size and}} weight — ranging from 2 - 203 inch cm wide and weighing as much as several tons. The converting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin, flat materials — known as webs — threads them through processing machines (such as printing presses, laminating, coating and <b>slitting</b> <b>machines)</b> and converts or changes the web of material into an intermediate form or final product. For example, a converter’s equipment might take a web of plastic film, cut it into lengths, and fuse their edges, thus converting it into plastic bags. This activity is known as web processing.|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} used {{because of its}} low cost and high {{precision}} for mass production. Some machines have a program that monitors the blades and sharpens the blades often to maintain the quality and precision of the cut. Depending on the industry and the product that is being <b>slit</b> these <b>machine</b> can run between 10m/min (special metal webs) and 5000 m/min (paper making process). The machines can also incorporate extensive automation to precisely control material tension, automatically position the slitting knives, automatically align the cores onto which the material is wound and to reduce manual handling of the rolls.|$|R
50|$|The {{searchlight}} {{was mounted}} in an armoured turret fitted to a tank. Initially, the Matilda tank was used, with its normal turret {{replaced by a}} cylindrical one containing the searchlight (the light emitting through a vertical <b>slit)</b> and a <b>machine</b> gun. This was later replaced by the US M3 Grant, which was superior in several ways; it was a larger roomier tank, better {{able to keep up}} with battle tanks, such as the Sherman, and it had a hull mounted gun that was unaffected by the replacement of its normal turret with the searchlight turret.|$|R

A three-dimensional finite element program (PAFAC) was used to predict the strain distribution ahead of the slit tip for several layups. For all layups, except the (0) sub 8, the yielding of the metal matrix caused the fiber stress concentration factor to increase with increasing load. This is contrary to the behavior seen in homogeneous materials where yielding causes the stress concentration to drop. For the (0) sub 8 laminate, yielding of the matrix caused a decrease in the fiber stress concentration. The finite element analysis predicted these trends correctly...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{polymeric}} {{materials such as}} FRP {{have been widely used}} in various engineering structures. These materials, however, can be also degraded by the acidic or alkaline corrosive environmental solutions that penetrate into the material inside. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the penetration of environmental solutions and to conduct the appropriate countermeasure before the material deteriorates. In this study, the possibility of a new health monitoring technology with optical fiber sensors, that could simply detect the penetration of corrosive environmental solutions into plastics by using pH indicator, was examined. The optical fiber sensor was prepared as follows; a narrow <b>slit</b> was <b>machined</b> in an optical fiber and the slit was filled by pH indicator added thermosetting resin.

It extends the results presented in the previous papers (1, 2). The study was confined to simulated cracks (<b>machined</b> <b>slits)</b> underneath the cladding. Crack heights ranging from 1. 68 mm to 19. 04 mm underneath Stainless Steel, Inconel and Ferritic cladding could be sized with an accuracy of ± 0. 2 mm. Difficulty was experienced using TOFD to size cracks starting from the interface between Inconel /Stainless Steel cladding and the ferritic base i. e. (5 mm/ 6 mm below the scanning surface). However, these cracks could be well detected and sized by scanning through the cladding from the opposite surface of the blocks. Even the small cracks {{of the order of}} 1. 9 mm could be detected {{as long as they are}} not influenced by the lateral wave. Experimental errors are presented. Introduction: In case of the welded structures, embedded vertical cracks are very often encountered necessitating reliable procedure for determining their size.

40|$|Diabetes is {{a disease}} that interferes with the body's ability to use and store sugar, which can cause many health problems. Over time, {{diabetes}} affects the circulatory system including the retina. As diabetes progress, {{the vision of a}} patient may start to deteriorate and then leading to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) which further will cause blindness. So, early detection of the disease is important to avoid blindness. There are several ways to diagnose DR and slit – lamp examination is one of the traditional method used by the ophthalmologist. This method requires the clinician to see directly into patient’s eye through an ophthalmoscope or the <b>slit</b> lamp <b>machine</b> {{to determine whether or not}} the eyes contain any abnormal features that indicate DR. However, this is not the most effective method yet. Any human can get tired and drowsy including doctors. This natural flaws of human being can affect the diagnosis and then causing false result analysis. Besides, every individuals doesn’t hold same opinion and judgment. Therefore, this project is proposed to assist the clinicians in identifying DR. There are two main abnormal features that are formed in the retina of a diabetic retinopathy’s patient. They are hemorrhage and exudates. Hemorrhage are formed as a result due to leakage of retinal blood vessel which has similar red colour to the vessel. Whereas exudates are yellow-white deposits structure on the retina that is formed due to leakage of blood from abnormal vessels. This thesis mainly focuses on developing a Fundus Image Analysis (FIA) system that extracts the anatomical and both the abnormal features of the retina in order to diagnose the disease. This research is carried out in three phases. In the first phase, an automated system is developed to distinguish the anatomical features of the retina from the abnormal features. This phase is called the Masking Phase. This phase involved combinations of several image processing techniques including Specify Polygonal Region of Interest (ROIPOLY), Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), Morphological Opening and Structuring, Median Filtering and Thresholding. The second phase is the Haemorrhage Extraction phase. In this phase, Saturation Adjust Method, Morphological operations and Regional Minima technique is proposed. The third and the last phase is the Exudates Extraction phase. In this phase, Edge Detection, Gradient Magnitude and Region Of Interest techniques are combined to form a complete working algorithm. The experimented images in this project are the retinal fundus images that was taken from a public database (diaretdb 1 - Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database). It is a public database for benchmarking diabetic retinopathy detection from digital images. By using this database and the defined testing protocol, the results between different methods can be compared. At the end of this project, the result shows that the method applied is able to detect exudates features and capable of detecting and distinguishing hemorrhage from blood vessels. Final result shows the accuracy of 48. 3...|$|R
