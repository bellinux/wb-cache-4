50|$|In pre-European society, Māori had {{specific}} plantations of flax, {{which was}} {{their most important}} textile. It was prepared by cutting the green leaves close to the base before the leaves were <b>split</b> and <b>woven.</b> Various preparations of the leaves allowed the material to be used both as a hardy flat thick-woven material (as in kete and mats) and also as a fibrous twine, used for creating both rope and finely woven cloaks.|$|R
50|$|The {{prepared}} fibre (muka) of the New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) {{became the}} basis of most clothing. The flax leaves were <b>split</b> and <b>woven</b> into mats, ropes and nets but clothing was often made from the fibre within the leaves. The leaves were stripped using a mussel shell, dressed by soaking and pounding with stone pounders, (patu muka), to soften the fibre, spun by rolling the thread against the leg and woven. The fibre within the flax is called muka.|$|R

He mentions three popular plants used for weaving baskets sarhebanaro (a liana type), tiriti (a type of reed) and ikhana (a liana type). He himself uses sarhebanaro most often (which can be seen on the photos) and mentions the steps involved in this particular process: peeling the bark, <b>splitting,</b> smoothing, <b>weaving</b> the bottom, the walls, binding the rim and attaching the rope used for carrying baskets...|$|R

50|$|Bamboo {{has also}} long {{been used as}} scaffolding; the {{practice}} has been banned in China for buildings over six stories, but is still in continuous use for skyscrapers in Hong Kong. In the Philippines, the nipa hut is a fairly typical example {{of the most basic}} sort of housing where bamboo is used; the walls are <b>split</b> and <b>woven</b> bamboo, and bamboo slats and poles may be used as its support. In Japanese architecture, bamboo is used primarily as a supplemental and/or decorative element in buildings such as fencing, fountains, grates and gutters, largely due to the ready abundance of quality timber.|$|R
50|$|Traditional hurdles {{are made}} from wattle, usually of hazel or willow. Hurdle-making is a {{traditional}} woodland craft, done by placing upright sticks in holes in a log and <b>weaving</b> <b>split</b> branches between them. Historically {{they were used to}} pen livestock or to separate land in open field systems, but they are now popular as decorative fencing for gardens. In medieval England such a hurdle was sometimes used as a makeshift sledge, to which a prisoner was tied to be dragged behind a horse to a place of execution.|$|R
50|$|Factors local to the Braintree Split {{contribute}} to chronic congestion at the interchange. The split is bordered {{on the south}} by South Shore Plaza, a major regional shopping mall. It is adjacent to the I-93 intersection with Route 37/Granite Street in Braintree which feeds retail, lodging, manufacturing and office complexes along Wood Road and Forbes Road, which run parallel {{to the north and}} south lanes of I-93 west of the split. The Crown Colony office complex in South Quincy and office buildings on Willard Street, the northern continuation of Route 37/Granite Street into West Quincy, are also accessed from the south via ramps at or next to the <b>split.</b> Short <b>weaves,</b> lane drops and line-of-sight problems all {{contribute to}} congestion in the interchange and the highways it serves. In addition to these issues, the split also serves the Quincy Adams subway station and Burgin Parkway, a major route into downtown Quincy, through ramps exiting the directional ramps for each roadway.|$|R

50|$|In the Preakness Stakes, {{he was a}} lukewarm 10-1 fourth {{choice in}} the morning line. A P Valentine faced a premium field of stakes winners that {{included}} Kentucky Derby Winner Monarchos, eventual Horse-of-the-Year Point Given, Derby runner-up Invisible Ink, multi-millionaire Congaree, Blue Grass Stakes runner-up Dollar Bill and local favorite Richly Blended. At {{the start of the}} race he was shuffled back by jockey Victor Espinoza as they passed the grandstand the first time around. Richly Blended and Congaree led most of the race. He raced seventh in a field of eleven during most of the early race. With three and a half furlongs to go A P Valentine <b>split</b> horses <b>weaving</b> his way through traffic while Point Given and Monarchos looped the field wide. At the top of the stretch Point Given took the lead and widened it to win by two lengths. A P Valentine bore down and was able to outfinish Congaree down the lane by a half length to win second place money of $200,000. Derby winner Monarchos faded to be no factor.|$|R
50|$|Lao Loum {{houses are}} built on wooden piles with the floor from one to two-and {{one-half}} meters above the ground. This style keeps the living area above the mud of the rainy season, provides a shady area under the house to work or rest during the day, and allows the house to catch breezes for natural cooling. Depending on the wealth and resources of the family, the walls and floor may be made of <b>woven</b> <b>split</b> bamboo or sawn wood; the roof is constructed from grass thatch, bamboo, wood shingles, or corrugated steel roofing sheet. Some older houses in well-off villages are roofed with clay tiles, but this style was no longer common in the early 1990s. A separate rice granary is built in the house compound, also on posts using similar construction. Livestock is sometimes kept under the house.|$|R
5000|$|Rice barns in Indonesia (known as lumbungs) {{are built}} on four poles, usually stand between 1½ metre and 2 metres up from ground level. The upper storage area often has a {{distinct}} omega shape created by bending flexible framing of split bamboo or betel nut trees to support the roof. The roof is generally covered with alang-alang grass and the sides are made of <b>woven,</b> <b>split</b> bamboo (called pagar). The pole support structure beneath the raised, enclosed rice barn is open with no walls. A floor or platform is constructed of wood and bamboo about 1/2 metre above the ground. This lower platform provides a convenient, shady place for people to sit and relax. In many traditional villages this lower sitting area is a meeting place for village residents where both business activities and social interaction commonly occur.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} natural {{solution}} to the strong CP problem {{in the context of}} split fermions. By assuming CP is spontaneously broken in the bulk, a weak CKM phase is created in the standard model due to a twisting in flavor space of the bulk fermion wavefunctions. But the strong CP phase remains zero, being essentially protected by parity in the bulk and CP on the branes. As always in models of spontaneous CP breaking, radiative corrections to theta bar from the standard model are tiny, but even higher dimension operators are not that dangerous. The twisting phenomenon was recently shown to be generic, and not to interfere with the way that <b>split</b> fermions naturally <b>weaves</b> small numbers into the standard model. It follows that out approach to strong CP is compatible with flavor, and we sketch a comprehensive model. We also look at deconstructed version of this setup which provides a viable 4 D model of spontaneous CP breaking which is not in the Nelson-Barr class. Comment: 30 pages, 5 Figure...|$|R
50|$|Some of humans' {{earliest}} manufactured items {{may have}} been made from willow. A fishing net made from willow dates back to 8300 BC. Basic crafts, such as baskets, fish traps, wattle fences and wattle and daub house walls, were often woven from osiers or withies (rod-like willow shoots, often grown in coppices). One of the forms of Welsh coracle boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or split willow rods can be woven into wicker, which also has a long history. The relatively pliable willow {{is less likely to}} <b>split</b> while being <b>woven</b> than many other woods, and can be bent around sharp corners in basketry. Willow wood is also used in the manufacture of boxes, brooms, cricket bats, cradle boards, chairs and other furniture, dolls, flutes, poles, sweat lodges, toys, turnery, tool handles, veneer, wands and whistles. In addition, tannin, fibre, paper, rope and string can be produced from the wood. Willow is also used in the manufacture of double basses for backs, sides and linings, and in making splines and blocks for bass repair.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the new methods for the {{investigation}} of the yarn slippage at the sewn seams in woven fabrics and for the determination of the parameters of yarn pulling out from woven fabrics were suggested. The original test methods capable to imitate similar to the real clothing wearing conditions, to evaluate the influence of external friction, of deformation method and of the position of seam allowances in respect to stitching line on the yarn slippage parameters were designed. Applying the new method based on the yarn pulling out from woven fabric with sewn seam, the analysis of the friction that occurs between warps and wefts during their sliding was done. Consequently, the behavior of the sewn seams in woven fabrics was analyzed applying the linear regression model which describes the dependence between the parameters such as: yarn pull out force F pull-out, yarn pull out displacement e pull-out, the woven fabrics’ mechanical characteristics such as: bending rigidity in warp direction B 1, fabric elongation in warp direction E 100 - 1 and yarn slippage at sewn seam parameter (seam opening d). The created three-cluster model enabled to <b>split</b> the investigated <b>woven</b> fabrics into three statistically different groups. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, the {{aerospace}} industry has gradually shifted from metals to composites in many different applications due to the lightweight properties of composite materials. Some benefits of composites include higher strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. At this point in time, the composite industry researchers are focusing on renewable and sustainable materials (bio-composites). By understanding the structural capabilities of bio-composites {{that have been used}} for centuries, new developments of sustainable materials will spark more interest throughout the industry. Bio-composites include fibers such as hemp, bamboo, flax, etc. The high demand for bio-composites in composite structures can also reduce raw material costs. This study investigated, through experimental and numerical analysis, the mechanical behavior of sandwich panels under edgewise compressive loading. The first task {{of the study was to}} use four different facesheet materials and the same Nomex honeycomb core. The number of facesheet layers consecutively increased from one layer to four layers on each side of the core for each material. The facesheet materials used were Hexply AGP 280 - 5 H Carbon Fiber Pre-Preg, B 601 Plain Weave Hemp, D 118 DKBR <b>Split</b> Herringbone <b>Weave</b> Hemp, and NB 308 T 7725 Texalium Fiberglass Pre-Preg. The sandwich panels were cured using a composite heat press and followed the recommended cure cycle for the material’s resin matrix. The variation of the facesheet materials while keeping the core consistent showed how the edgewise strength and displacement of the composite sandwiches were affected under compressive loading. The second task of the study was to try and create a multifunctional hybrid composite sandwich with two different facesheet materials; using one hemp material and one pre-preg material. The goal of this task was to try and minimize the damage occured upon failure. Being that the pre-preg materials are more brittle than the hemp material, the hybrid composite sandwiches can potentially create a superior composite structure. The sequence of stacking of the facesheet materials was manipulated to study how changing the outer and inner layers affected the results. All the specimen were loaded at a rate of 0. 05 in/min in a steel jig specifically made per ASTM C 364 standard using an Instron 8801 to determine the mechanical behavior. These experimental results combined with results from theoretical and finite element analysis using Matlab and Abaqus, respectively, were used to compare composite sandwich designs under compressive loadings. Failure mode comparison between the individual material composites and the hybrid composites were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The film The Day After Tomorrow (2004) was {{notable for}} {{being one of}} the early Hollywood made, high budget general release films that {{addressed}} issues of climate change. Setting aside both its interesting twists – American citizens crossing into Mexico for security reasons, cynical and disbelieving national politicians eating humble pie, and mawkish family based sentiments that beset so many American movies – what interests me is the treatment of time in relation to narrative and plot. To affect a classic Hollywood pattern of quest, conflict, suspense and resolution within the narrative, the writers and director simply speeded the process of climate change so that America (and in fact the whole Northern Hemisphere) was subject to a new ice age in the period of six weeks!! Standard Hollywood motifs of (car) chases were created in a new forms. Killer temperature gradients literally chasing a protagonist and his comrades through the streets of New York, who just make their refuge in time, the killer weather sounding menacingly at the door just as they slam it shut. And two military helicopters being over taken and frozen out the sky by another high speed killer weather front. This, and similar examples, tells us a lot about the challenges of representing ecological time within the temporalities of human narratives. Stories are the tissue – or essence - of life itself as A S Byatt says. They underpin constructions of the self, individual and collective identities, and cultural, social and political atmospheres more broadly. The narratives which dominate enlightenment culture are set at human pace and to human durations -so narratives of lives and generations of lives, and the twists and turns in the common time frames of human life, be they in hours, days, week, season, years, stages of life. There is little tradition or skill within these modern narratives of extreme human exceptionalism and a <b>split</b> nature-culture, of <b>weaving</b> many forms of natural temporality into our stories. Indeed {{it could be argued that}} modern narratives rest in part on stripping non-human temporalities out of our stories. Be they the differing processes speeds of non-human brains; the very other life cycles of other beings (from weeks to centuries) : the ‘long’ rhythms within the biosphere such as ice ages, and sun spot cycles, we don’t know how (with some emerging exceptions) to tell stories with these other temporalities woven into the plot. This is one reason why, as the one of the greatest (most tragic) events ever unfolds (the unravelling of the current diversity of the biosphere by a self-other destructive single species), as the band Talking Heads put it, “as things fell apart, nobody paid much attention"...|$|R
