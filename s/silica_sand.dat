The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. <b>Silica</b> <b>sand</b> is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E

This paper {{studies the}} {{impacts on the}} {{particle}} {{size and shape of}} <b>silica</b> <b>sands</b> by roasting times and different methods of cooling, which finds out that different methods of cooling may lead to different cooling rates of sands; that is, adopt water-cooled fluidized bed to cool down sands, the cooling rate is the highest; the secondary is by cooling cylinder, and common fluidized bed leads to the lowest cooling rate. After being roasted and cooled, no matter which method is adopted, the sands are not changed obviously in particle size and shape, which indicates that roasting times, different cooling methods and cooling rates have no obvious impacts on the particle size and shape of <b>silica</b> <b>sands...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{promotion}} of biomass gasification for hydrogen production in a fluidized bedreactor with the bed additives zeolite, CaO, and Ca- and Mg-based <b>silica</b> <b>sands.</b> The results show thatzeolite has higher capacity for enhancing hydrogen promotion abilities than CaO with the amount was 200 g in tests. Regarding the Ca- and Mg-based <b>silica</b> <b>sands,</b> Ca/SiO 2 decreases the CO 2 selectivity andMg/SiO 2 enhances the H 2 selectivity owing to CO 2 adsorption via the formation of CaO and the promotionof the water gas shift reaction, respectively. The optimal concentration of Mg-based bed materials correspondsto a Mg concentration of 0. 5 wt. %. The additives play important roles in increasing the reactionrate, enhancing the biomass gasification, and promoting carbon transformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{looks for the}} {{feasibility}} of preparing UHPC with iron ore tailings (IOT for short) as fine aggregate. To enhance outstanding high performances, some influences on UHPC mortars were investigated such as different kinds of sands, different mix ratio of sands, and different largest particle size of fine aggregate.

Among these factors, the particle size effect on hydrate saturation level in sediment have been studied with a series of <b>silica</b> <b>sands</b> with various sizes, and the results obtained clearly indicate that particle size does {{play an important role in}} affecting the saturation level of hydrate in sediments. The proton relaxation times of water confined in the same series of <b>silica</b> <b>sands,</b> which were determined with NMR measurement, show logarithmic relationship with particle size.

25|$|Most silicon is used industrially {{without being}} purified, and indeed often with {{comparatively}} little processing from its natural form. Over 90% of the Earth's crust {{is composed of}} silicate minerals, which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> and most kinds of building stone. Thus, {{the vast majority of}} uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making Portland cement (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in building mortar and modern stucco, but more importantly, combined with <b>silica</b> <b>sand,</b> and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals like granite), to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.|$|E

40|$|Coal {{gasification}} with in situ CO capture {{is believed}} to be able to produce highly concentrated H with little or no CO compared with the conventional process. This has been demonstrated by other researchers working on a single fluidised bed by continuously feeding the CaO sorbent. This work presents the results of coal gasification with in situ CO capture by a synthetic CaO sorbent in a 1 kW dual fluidised-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure, which has not been reported in the literature. The synthetic CaO sorbent is cyclically used by going through multiple carbonation/calcination cycles during coal gasification. The effect of temperature on coal gasification was firstly investigated with <b>silica</b> <b>sands</b> or the synthetic CaO sorbent as the heat carrier. H concentration was raised from normally 15 % with the addition of the synthetic CaO sorbent instead of <b>silica</b> <b>sands</b> at 740 - 800 °C. A long-term test at 740 °C confirmed the advantages of the addition of the synthetic CaO sorbent. However, CO concentration was not reduced to a very low level.
