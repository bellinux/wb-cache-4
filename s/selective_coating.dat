An emissiometer has been designed and built, capable for measurements of the directional emittance at angles up to 85 degree(s). The emissiometer can be used for absolute measurements, with a black body radiator as reference, and for relative measurements using a known reference sample. In the case of low-emissivity materials the directional emittance usually has a maximum at an angle between 80 degree(s) and 90 degree(s) (pseudo Brewster angle).
