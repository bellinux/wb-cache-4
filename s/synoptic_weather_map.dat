There, he was responsible for establishing a weather forecasting service for the northwestern part of Germany and the adjacent sea areas. After four years of service, he was able to move on to his primary interest fundamental research, and left the meteorological office.Köppen began a systematic study of the climate and also experimented with balloons to obtain data from upper layers of the atmosphere. In 1884, he published the first version of his map of climatic zones in which the seasonal temperature ranges were plotted. It {{led to the development of}} the Köppen climate classification system around 1900, which he kept improving for the rest of his life. The full version of his system appeared first in 1918; after several modifications, the final version was published in 1936.|$|E

The objective of this project {{is to determine the}} relationship between local weather patterns and rain water chemistry in Wilmington, NC. Daily and hourly meteorological data (average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and maximum and minimum temperatures) were collected for the 48 hour period prior to each rain event.

Arctic air masses are most favourable for new aerosol particle formation in the boreal forest.

40|$|Abstract：Windy {{meteorological}} conditions and dried fire fuels due to higher atmospheric instability and dryness {{in the lower}} troposphere can exacerbate fire controls and result in more losses of forest resources and residential properties due to enhanced large wildland fires. Long-term (1979 - 2005) climatology of the Haines Index reconstructed in this study reveals that spatial patterns and intra-annual variability of the atmospheric instability and dryness in the lower troposphere affect the frequency of wildland fire incidences over the Korean Peninsula. Exponential regression models verify that daily high Haines Index and its monthly frequency has statistically significant correlations with {{the frequency of the}} wildland fire occurrences during the fire season (December-April) in South Korea. According to the climatic maps of the Haines Index created by the Geographic Information System (GIS) using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the lowlands below 500 m from the mean sea level in the northwestern regions of the Korean Peninsula demonstrates the high frequency of the Haines Index equal to or greater than five in April and May.

40|$|Traditional flood-frequency {{techniques}} {{are based on}} the assumption that the observed flood record represents a sample that has been drawn from a single climatically homogeneous population of floods. A hydroclimatic approach was used to evaluate this assumption by identifying the circulation patterns and atmospheric flood-generating mechanisms which control the temporal and spatial variability of flooding. Mean monthly discharges and instantaneous peak flows of the partial duration series were analyzed for thirty gaging stations in the climatically sensitive, semiarid, Gila River basin for the period 1950 to 1980. Correlation fields and composite maps were constructed to define the relationship between 700 mb height circulation anomalies and mean monthly streamflow. Individual flood events were linked to climate by analyzing daily <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>maps</b> and classifying each flood event into one of eight hydroclimatic categories on the basis of the atmospheric mechanisms which generated each flow. The analysis demonstrated that floods and anomalously high streamflow in the Gila River basin originate from a variety of atmospheric processes which vary spatially, seasonally, and from year-to-year. The mechanisms most important for generating floods included winter fronts, cutoff lows, tropical storms, snowmelt, and widespread and localized summer monsoon-related circulation patterns. When flood discharges were grouped into hydroclimatically homogeneous categories, histogram plots of their frequency distributions exhibited means and variances that differed from those of the overall frequency distribution of the entire flood series. The means of the discharges generated by frontal precipitation and tropical storms tended to plot above the mean of the overall series, while the means of floods generated by snowmelt tended to plot below the overall mean. Flood estimates computed from a series containing mixed distributions were not the same as flood estimates computed from climatically homogeneous subsets of the same series. These results have implications for traditional flood-frequency analysis and other stochastic methods of analyzing hydrologic time series. The hydroclimatically-defined subgroups in the flood series of the Gila River basin indicate that nonhomogeneity and nonstationarity can be imparted to a hydrologic time series by differing atmospheric mechanisms alone...|$|R

The inability of forecasting is problematic because funnel clouds {{pose a threat}} to aviation, which serves as Alaska’s main form of transportation. Motivated by the lack of research on the formation of funnel clouds in Alaska, this research investigated characteristics of funnel clouds and atmospheric conditions under which funnel clouds form using operational Doppler weather radars and radiosonde soundings as well as <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>maps.</b> In Alaska, funnel clouds usually occur during the summer months May to September with a maximum of occurrence in July and around 1500 Alaska Daylight Time as shown in the funnel cloud observational data. The observed funnel clouds are usually not associated with severe thunderstorms and do not occur with strong synoptic scale forcing. As such, it was hypothesized that local effects from sea breeze fronts and orographic circulations might be the main forcing. Operational soundings indicate that some, but not all funnel cloud events occurred under large Convective Available Potential Energy (greater than 500 J) and strong lowlevel wind shear. Funnel clouds were difficult to identify in routine operational Doppler weather radars because the funnel clouds display small cross-sectional area compared to the radar resolution. An algorithm to retrieve similar vertical profiles from the entire radiosonde data than those observed during documented funnel cloud events was developed. By using similarity between radiosonde profiles of days of the observed funnel clouds and the similar radiosonde profiles scanned over the years, an idea of funnel cloud or severe storm occurrence can be ascertained. The mechanisms for funnel cloud formation differ by region. In Interior Alaska, the Alaska Range’s katabatic slope winds and the Tanana Valley wind create the needed vorticity. Along the west coast of Alaska, air-sea interaction plays a role. In Cook Inlet, topography and land-sea play a role. All funnel cloud events have weak synoptic scale forcing...|$|R

40|$|During {{the courses}} of a day, the Mars Observer {{spacecraft}} will acquire globally distributed {{profiles of the}} martian atmosphere. It is highly desirable that this data be assembled into <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>maps</b> (complete specifications of the atmospheric pressure, temperature, and winds at a given time), which can in turn be used as starting points {{in the study of}} many meteorological phenomena. Unfortunately, the special nature of the Mars Observer data presents several challenges above and beyond the usual difficult problem of data initialization. Mars Observer atmospheric data will consist almost exclusively of asynoptic vertical profiles of temperatures (or radiances) and pressures, whereas winds are generally in balance with horizontal gradients of these quantities (which will not be observed). It will therefore be necessary to resort to dynamical models to analyze the wind fields. As a rule, data assimilation into atmospheric models can result in the generation of spurious gravity waves, so special steps must be taken to suppress these. In addition, the asynoptic nature of the data will require a four-dimensional (space and time) data assimilation scheme. The problem is to find a full set of meteorological fields (winds and temperatures) such that, when marched forward in time in the model, they achieve a best fit (in the weighted least-squares sense) to the data. The proposed solution is to develop a model especially for the Mars Observer data assimilation problem. Gravity waves are filtered from the model by eliminating all divergence terms from the prognostic divergence equation. This leaves a diagnostic gradient wind relation between the rotational wind and the temperature field. The divergent wind is diagnosed as the wind required to maintain the gradient wind balance {{in the presence of the}} diabatic heating. The primitive equations of atmospheric dynamics (with three principal dependent variables) are thus reduced to a simpler system with a single prognostic equation for temperature - the variable that will be best observed. (This balance system was apparently first derived by Charney as a first-order Rossby number expansion of the equations of motion). Experience with a full primitive equation model of the martian atmosphere indicates that a further simplification is possible: at least for short-term integrations, the model can be linearized about the zonally symmetric basic state...|$|R

The synoptic pattern, atmospheric thermodynamics and output from a numerical weather prediction model have been studied to evaluate the occurrence of storms and to verify the threshold instability indices that are based on Gordon and Albert (2000) and Miller (1972). Using data from the Statistics and Data Center of the Iran Meteorological Organization, 195 synoptic stations were used to study the climatological pattern of thunderstorm days in Iran during a 15 -yr period (1991 – 2005). <b>Synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>maps</b> and thermodynamic diagrams have been drawn using data from synoptic stations and radiosonde data. A 15 -km resolution version of the WRF numerical model has been implemented for the Middle East region with the assistance of global data from University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The Tabriz airport weather station has been selected for further study due to its high frequency of thunderstorms (more than 35 thunderstorm days per year) and the existence of an upper air station. Despite the fact that storms occur less often at the Tehran weather station, the station has been chosen as the second case study site due to its large amount of air traffic.

This study provides a baseline climatology of severe hail throughout the Northeast United States (from 1955 - 2009) by investigating the spatial and temporal characteristics of severe hail storms, {{and the extent to which}} population density influences severe hail reports. Synoptic patterns and thermodynamic environments are also discussed by analyzing data from the top 85 most reported severe hail outbreaks, defined as significant severe hail event days. This data consists of daily mean composite <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>maps,</b> as well as information from nine upper air stations throughout the study region. The results show that the distribution of severe hail in the Northeastern United States is influenced by a combination of meteorological, technological, and societal factors. The daily mean composite synoptic maps show that significant severe hail outbreaks in the Northeastern United States commonly occur when the region is influenced by the ascending branch of a low amplitude, anomalous, 500 hPa trough, accompanied by an anomalous surface low pressure system, situated to the west or northwest of the study region. A weak east-west oriented cold front associated with this surface low typically provides the lifting needed to initiate severe convection. The largest reported severe hailstone throughout the duration of the study occurred in Virginia, in 1968, measuring 5 inches in diameter. Conversely, 57 % of all studied severe hailstones had a reported diameter of less than one inch. A majority of all severe hail reports occurred during the three month period of May, June, and July, between 1500 - 1659 hours local time. Thermodynamic information obtained using 00 UTC soundings showed that the K-Index, Total-Totals index, CAPE, and Wet Bulb Zero Level showed the most skill in forecasting significant severe hail outbreaks in the Northeastern United States.

The study specifically addresses the implications of climate change on future soil thermal dynamics in a maritime sub-Antarctic environment. Ground temperature were obtained from three ground temperature monitoring stations on the eastern side of Marion Island, which were established along an altitudinal gradient at Long Ridge North (200 m a. s. l.), Katedraalkrans (750 m a. s. l) and at Delta Extension (1000 m a. s. l.). To assess the <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> circulation patterns, a synoptic climate classification methodology that is based on the single station principal component (PCA) and cluster analysis were used. Results show that certain clusters were more dominant than others and over the measured time span certain <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns, mainly cyclonic air circulation types, have decreased while anticyclonic circulation have increased. Soil frost occurs at all three stations on Marion Island, not only under cyclonic circulations (as previously suggested) but significantly under anticyclonic air mass circulation as well. Soil frost is dependent on the duration of post-cyclonic Antarctic air mass circulation. <b>Synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns are also affecting ground surface lapse rates. Changes from positive to negative lapse rates were observed and this predominantly occurred under the atmospheric circulation pattern associated with clusters that are predominantly anticyclonic. Long term climatic change as predicted by the PCA show a reduction in low pressure systems or more anticyclonic conditions affecting the island. These change will significantly affect the soil thermal dynamics at an altitudinal scale on sub-Antarctic Marion Island...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACf: By associating <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> types {{with each}} hourly {{precipitation}} event, the underlying physical causes creating {{the frequency and}} intensity of hourly precipitation can be revealed. In this research, <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> types are associated with each hourly precipitation event during January (1951 - 1990) at both Lake Charles and New Orleans. Muller has identified eight <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> types for Louisiana and this classification is applied here. Results indicate that while New Orleans has 55 more hourly precipitation events during the study period. lake Charles exceeded the frequencies reported at New Orleans in all five types which occurred more than once except Frontal Overrunning (FOR). FOR events are more intense at New Orleans while non-frontal events are more common and heavier at Lake Charles. INTRODUcnON Hourly precipitation data are frequently utilized in precipitation climatologies on local (1), regional (2) and national (3) scales. Further insight can be gained into the processes underlying the spatial and temporal variability of hourly precipitation data by classifying the associated <b>weather</b> into discrete <b>synoptic</b> types (4). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the frequency and intensity of hourly precipitation patterns during January at both New Orleans an...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that daily pollutant transport patterns in East Asia are visible from satellite images when inspected with corresponding <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> analyses. Transport pathways of air pollutants in East Asia are investigated using satellite observations, surface weather charts, and chemical-transport model simulations. It is found that during cool season (fall to spring), pollutant transports in East Asia are largely determined by <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns {{associated with high}} pressure system over southern China, which is extended from the Siberia High, and low pressure system over Manchuria, which is initiated by Altai-Sayan cyclogenesis. Based on the relative location and strength of these weather systems, three types of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> patterns that may contribute to pollutants transport in East Asia, especially in China and Korea, are identified: i. e., (1) a strengthening of the Siberian High and its southeastward propagation; (2) a high-pressure system over southern China followed by a frontal passage associated with a northern low-pressure system; and (3) a stagnant high-pressure system over southern China. For all three patterns, the high-pressure system in southern China {{is essential for the}} development of regional air pollution, while frontal activities associated with low-pressure system provide a forcing mechanism to transport those pollutants eastward or southeastward. Observed and simulated surface PM distributions show good agreement in both aerosol optical depth and NO 2 column density further implying that anthropogenic emissions also contribute to regional events of high surface PM concentrations. It is argued that the quasi-periodic migration of <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> systems in East Asia works as an efficient pump of pollutants; i. e., regional air pollutions developed under high-pressure systems are transported downstream by low-pressure systems...|$|R

40|$|Fourteen {{years of}} {{meteorological}} parameters, aerosol variables (absorption and scattering coefficients, aerosol number concentration) and trace gases (CO, NO x, SO 2) {{measured at the}} Jungfraujoch (JFJ, 3580 m a. s. l.) have been analyzed {{as a function of}} different <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> types. The Schüepp <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> type of the Alps (SYNALP) classification from the Alpine Weather Statistics (AWS) was used to define the synoptic meteorology over the whole Swiss region. The seasonal contribution of each <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> type to the aerosol concentration was deduced from the aerosol annual cycles while the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence was estimated by means of the diurnal cycles. Since aerosols are scavenged by precipitation, the diurnal cycle of the CO concentration was also used to identify polluted air masses. SO 2 and NO x concentrations were used as precursor tracers for new particle formation and growth, respectively. The aerosol optical parameters and number concentration show elevated loadings during advective weather types during the December–March period and for the convective anticyclonic and convective indifferent weather types during the April–September period. This study confirms the consensus view that the JFJ is mainly influenced by the free troposphere during winter and by injection of air parcels from the PBL during summer. A more detailed picture is, however, drawn where the JFJ is completely influenced by free tropospheric air masses in winter during advective weather types and largely influenced by the PBL also during the night in summer during the subsidence weather type. Between these two extreme situations, the PBL influence at the JFJ depends on both the time of year and the <b>synoptic</b> <b>weather</b> type. The fraction of PBL air transported to the JFJ was estimated by the relative increase of the specific humidity and CO...|$|R
