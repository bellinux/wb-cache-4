40|$|The MEMS based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} due to its low-cost, small size, and low power consumption. However, its performance is affected by sensor noise, bias, and <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>error.</b> So the traditional strap-down algorithm, only using low-cost MEMS, cannot satisfy the attitude and heading performance requirements. To achieve a long term stable solution, modern attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) generally integrate IMU with other sensors, such as magnetometers. This paper proposed a new dynamic modelling method for low-cost IMU and magnetometer integrated AHRS. In this method, the system dynamics model is based on the Psi-angle error equation. The acceleration residuals in North and East detraction and heading residual are chosen as the observation vectors, and the corresponding system observation model has been developed. In order to yield optimal estimates, an adaptive Kalman filter is adopted, in which the measurement noise covariance matrix is tuned adaptively according to the system dynamics sensed by the accelerometers. This proposed method doesn’t need to model the system angular motions, avoids the nonlinear problem of system dynamic model, and considers the influence of dynamic acceleration to the filter.

(EBL), a parameter derived from the first law of thermodynamics based on a whole-building energy analysis, has been theoretically proved to be an effective tool for verifying whole-building energy-use data (Shao and Claridge, 2006). Quality control methodology using EBL has been proposed and applied to more than one hundred buildings on a large university campus by Baltazar et al. (2007). They picked the outside air dry-bulb temperature (TOA) as the explanatory variable of EBL, and used a plot of EBL versus TOA, called energy balance plot, to find faulty behavior in the data by visually observing the pattern. It has been demonstrated that this methodology can detect significant data problems caused by variety of reasons such as <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>error</b> and mislabeled meter successfully. This paper presents a possible enhancement on the existent EBL analysis technique by using the outside air enthalpy (hOA) as the explanatory variable of EBL instead of TOA. This enthalpy based analysis accounts for the effect of latent load on EBL, and therefore, may enhance the data screening capability for buildings operated at locations with hot and humid climate.

40|$|Abstract: Position and Orientation System (POS) is a {{technology}} widely used for motional error compensation of airborne InSAR. The measurement errors of inertial sensor (accelerometers and gyros) are the chief influencing factors to {{the precision of}} POS. In order to enhance the accuracy of POS, an improved SINS error model {{should be used in}} POS. Traditionally, the SINS error model is considered as a random constant error for both gyros and accelerometers. In this paper, a more precise error model for SINS is developed by augmenting random walks error, first-order Markov process error, <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>error</b> and installation error. According to the improved SINS error model, a Kalman filter is established with 45 states including three random constant errors s, three random walk errors, three first-order Markov process errors, three scale factor errors and six installation errors for both gyros and accelerometers, and nine navigation parameter errors. To validate the improved error model in respect of accuracy, the semi physical flight simulation based on the imitation of imaging-flight route of InSAR is made to compare with the traditional SINS error model which only considering the random constant error. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the improved SINS error model is one order higher than the traditional SINS error model. The improved SINS error model presented in this paper will lead to higher accuracy of POS used in InSAR motion compensation...|$|E

40|$|Line-of-sight {{path delay}} {{calibration}} accuracies of 1 mm {{are needed to}} improve both angular and Doppler tracking capabilities. Fluctuations in the refractivity of tropospheric water vapor limit the present accuracies to about 1 nrad for the angular position and to a delay rate of 3 x 10 (exp - 13) sec/sec over a 100 -sec time interval for Doppler tracking. This article describes progress in evaluating {{the limitations of the}} technique of water vapor radiometry at the 1 -mm level. The two effects evaluated here are: (1) errors arising from tip-curve calibration of WVR's in the presence of tropospheric fluctuations and (2) errors due to the use of nonzero beamwidths for water vapor radiometer (WVR) horns. The error caused by tropospheric water vapor fluctuations during instrument calibration from a single tip curve is 0. 26 percent in the estimated gain for a tip-curve duration of several minutes or less. This gain error causes a 3 -mm bias and a 1 -mm <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>error</b> in the estimated path delay at a 10 -deg elevation per 1 g/cm(sup 2) of zenith water vapor column density present in the troposphere during the astrometric observation. The error caused by WVR beam averaging of tropospheric fluctuations is 3 mm at a 10 -deg elevation per 1 g/cm(sup 2) of zenith water vapor (and is proportionally higher for higher water vapor content) for current WVR beamwidths (full width at half maximum of approximately 6 deg). This is a stochastic error (which cannot be calibrated) and which can be reduced to about half of its instantaneous value by time averaging the radio signal over several minutes. The results presented here suggest two improvements to WVR design: first, the gain of the instruments should be stabilized to 4 parts in 10 (exp 4) over a calibration period lasting 5 hours, and second, the WVR antenna beamwidth should be reduced to about 0. 2 deg. This will reduce the error induced by water vapor fluctuations in the estimated path delays to less than 1 mm for the elevation range from zenith to 6 deg for most observation weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{already used}} in USA in the Positive Train Control (PTC) system, in China {{for the high}} {{velocity}} and low capacity lines and in Russia, the GNSS technology is still not used in the European Train Control System (ETCS). ETCS will progressively replace the different systems {{that are used in}} Europe for an improved interoperability. In ETCS level 2 and 3, the train has to self-estimate its position by propagating the position of reference given by Eurobalises with wheel speed sensors (WSS). A large amount of balise must be settled on the rail tracks in order to bound the error on the position estimation that is growing {{as a function of the}} distance travelled since the last Eurobalise due to the WSS <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>error</b> and sliding effects. The current trend adopted by the rail community would consist in using the GNSS as a virtual balise. The first main challenge for the introduction of the GNSS in ETCS is the very low Tolerable Hazard Risk (THR), which, for the whole signaling system, shall not be over 2. 10 - 9 /h to fulfill the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 4 requirement [1]. Therefore, the tolerable uncertainty on the GNSS sensor shall be even lower. Depending on the risk allocation in the ETCS fault tree, the integrity risk allowed for GNSS can reach 1. 10 - 11 /h. Because the requirements are key in the design of the virtual balise platform, a proposition of accuracy and alert limit requirements is discussed in the paper. The second main challenge for the introduction of the GNSS in ETCS is related to the operational environment of the vehicle. Indeed the trains are likely to operate in suburban and in dense urban environments, where the GNSS satellites can be masked by the buildings, or where the GNSS receiver can be affected by large multipath errors, interference or Non Line-Of-Sight signals (NLOS). This paper proposes a complete positioning module that is designed to fulfill the tight integrity requirements for a virtual balise in ETCS. The navigation solution proposed is based on a combination of GNSS, Inertial Navigation Sensor (INS) and a track database that are tightly coupled through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The widely used WSS that are present onboard are purposely not used to avoid safety issues related to the joint dependency of the odometry function and virtual balise with respect to the same sensor. Together with the positioning algorithm, it is necessary to design an integrity monitoring algorithm that will ensure that the positioning requirements are fulfilled. This paper proposes such an algorithm, which can be seen as an adaptation of Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM) techniques that were developed for tightly coupled GPS/IRS systems in civil aviation. The considered nominal case and fault modes are described in the paper, including the presence of a major (GNSS) service failure, the presence of large multipath errors and the reception of NLOS signals. The problem caused by large multipath errors and NLOS signals on the integrity monitoring is lightened by the use of an a priori exclusion of some GNSS measurements that are likely to be faulty. The exclusion decision is based on different criteria including GNSS signal quality indicators based on the assessment of the distortion of the correlation function, the estimated C/N 0 or the satellite elevation. The proposed integrity monitoring algorithm assumes that all sensors are fault free. It is thus necessary to ensure that this condition is met. Considering this, and since the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of the considered MEMS IMU is not sufficiently high to neglect the probability of failure of the IMU, a fault detection algorithm based on the redundancy of the IMUs is proposed in the paper. This algorithm, which can detect sensor failures before any use of the sensor in the position computation, is based on Kalman filtering and on a hypothesis test based on Weighted Sum of Squared Residuals (WSSR). The fault modes of the sensors are also detailed in the paper. The next step is to prove that the proposed positioning system will be able to meet an integrity risk of 1. 10 - 11 /h. In a usual system, this means that it is necessary to characterize the nominal error model of each error sources using an extremely large amount of data (to know the error model down to an extremely low percentile). To overcome this issue, the paper proposes to divide the problem in two independent ones. It thus proposed to use two different GPS/Galileo dual constellation receivers. The idea consists in dividing the available satellites into two independent subsets of satellites. The measurements from each subset are integrated with two independent IMUs. Due to the division into two separate subsets, it is likely to have less than 4 satellites available which reinforce the interest of using tight integration. The two EKF are monitored by two AAIM algorithms that provide protection levels in real time. A new estimated position and protection level is formed from the two independent positions and protection levels. As shown in the paper, this separation of the whole system into two independent sub-systems reduces the integrity risk of each subsystem down to ? 10 - 11 /h, which appears much more manageable based on the current knowledge of the GNSS error sources. Finally, this paper assesses the nominal accuracy and integrity performances of the proposed architecture by realistic simulations. Starting from a typical rail trajectory and velocity profile, ideal inertial sensor, GNSS and track database outputs are generated. Typical error models are then added based on the manufacturer specifications for the IMU and on realistic values for the GNSS. Performances of the proposed solution are finally assessed on a real measurement campaign in urban environment. The reference trajectory is given by a NovAtel SPAN equipment hybridizing a tactical-grade IMU with a high accuracy GNSS solution. The outline of this paper is the following: • The first chapter focuses on the operational requirements that must be fulfilled by the studied solution • The second chapter discusses the architecture of the hybridized solution and on the integration approach by EKF. • The third chapter addresses the failures modes and the fault detection algorithm proposed to detect them before integration of the measurements in the filter. • The fourth chapter addresses the failure modes of the GNSS. The way to lighten the burden of the integrity monitoring algorithm by using signal quality indicators and external information is discussed. The method that is used to set the integrity requirement to ? 10 - 11 /h instead of 10 - 11 /h is discussed. • The fifth chapter provides nominal fault free performances of the system in terms of accuracy and integrity based on realistic simulations. The error models of each sensors are detailed. • The last chapter assesses the performances of the solution on a real measurement campaign...|$|E

Highest accuracy signals are obtained if the Lissajous Figure is circular (no gain or phase error) and perfectly centred. Modern encoder systems employ circuitry to trim these error mechanisms automatically. The overall accuracy of the linear encoder {{is a combination of}} the scale accuracy and errors introduced by the readhead. Scale contributions to the error budget include linearity and slope (<b>scaling</b> <b>factor</b> <b>error).</b> Readhead error mechanisms are usually described as cyclic error or sub-divisional error (SDE) as they repeat every scale period. The largest contributor to readhead inaccuracy is signal offset, followed by signal imbalance (ellipticity) and phase error (the quadrature signals not being exactly 90° apart). Overall signal size does not affect encoder accuracy, however, signal-to-noise and jitter performance may degrade with smaller signals. Automatic signal compensation mechanisms can include automatic offset compensation (AOC), automatic balance compensation (ABC) and automatic gain control (AGC). Phase is more difficult to compensate dynamically and is usually applied as one time compensation during installation or calibration. Other forms of inaccuracy include signal distortion (frequently harmonic distortion of the sine/cosine signals).|$|R

This thesis explores the fusion of gyroscope integration, gravity vector estimation, and magnetic field vector estimation using a complementary filter and an extended Kalman filter (EKF), both of which use a unit quaternion to represent the attitude portion of the state. First, a set of models, which contain bias, <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>errors,</b> alignment errors, and Gaussian white noise, is introduced to govern the available sensors.

Due {{in large part to}} the estimation of gyroscope bias in the EKF, this filter is shown to give a significantly more accurate state estimate.

The stability of each of the resulting closed loop systems is analyzed. The observers are then combined, and the gyro calibration parameters are estimated simultaneously. The stability of the combined observers is addressed, as well as the stability of the resulting closed loop systems. Simulated test results are presented for each scenario. Finally, the nonlinear observers are compared to a pseudo-linear Kalman filter...|$|R
40|$|European Navigation Conference, LAUSANNE, SUISSE, 09 -/ 05 / 2017 - 12 / 05 / 2017 The {{evolution}} of smartphones and their embedded sensors motivates research toward {{the development of}} handheld device based navigation solutions especially for harsh environments. In this context, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning is usually adopted to compute the pedestrian's trajectory. Step/stride lengths and walking directions are combined in a recursive process. Unfortunately the estimated path suffers from drifting errors due to the sensors' nature and the motion complexity. To reduce this error, map matching strategies are studied and several solutions are proposed in the literature. In this work a Matching Filter is proposed to mitigate the drifting errors. The Matching Filter is a nest filter based on an extended Kalman Filter and a Complementary filter. The key idea is to match the PDR trajectory with the standalone GPS trajectory during opportune phases in order to estimate a global heading and <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>errors</b> on the PDR path. The proposed strategy is tested with a 1 km walk in a shopping center. A 75 % improvement is found {{as compared to the}} PDR only trajectory...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the robust Kalman filtering problem for uncertain attitude estimation system with star sensor measurement delays. Combined with the misalignment <b>errors</b> and <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>errors</b> of gyros {{in the process}} model and the misalignment errors of star sensors in the measurement model, the uncertain attitude estimation model can be established, which indicates that uncertainties not only appear {{in the state and}} output matrices but also affect the statistic of the process noise. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of star sensor measurement delays is described by introducing Bernoulli random variables with different delay characteristics. The aim of the addressed attitude estimation problem is to design a filter such that, in the presence of model uncertainties and star sensors delays for the attitude estimation system, the optimized filter parameters can be obtained to minimize the upper bound on the estimation error covariance. Therefore, a finite-horizon robust Kalman filter is proposed to cope with this question. Compared with traditional attitude estimation algorithms, the designed robust filter takes into account the effects of star sensor measurement delays and model uncertainties. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the developed robust filter...|$|R
40|$|The {{errors of}} {{low-cost}} inertial sensors, especially Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) ones, are {{highly dependent on}} environmental conditions such as the temperature. Thus, {{there is a need}} for the development of accurate and reliable thermal compensation models to reduce the impact of such thermal drift of the sensors. Since the conventional thermal calibration methods are typically time-consuming and costly, an efficient thermal calibration method to investigate the thermal drift of a full set of gyroscope and accelerometer errors (i. e., biases, <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>errors</b> and non-orthogonalities) over the entire temperature range in a few hours is proposed. The proposed method uses the idea of the Ramp method, which removes the time-consuming process of stabilizing the sensor temperature, and addresses its inherent problems with several improvements. We change the temperature linearly for a complete cycle and take a balanced strategy by making comprehensive use of the sensor measurements during both heating and cooling processes. Besides, an efficient 8 -step rotate-and-static scheme is designed to further improve the calibration accuracy and efficiency. Real calibration tests showed that the proposed method is suitable for low-grade IMUs and for both lab and factory calibration due to its efficiency and sufficient accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for calibrating modern, solid-state strapdown magnetometers. The traditional method for calibrating these sensors is a cumbersome procedure called “swinging ” which involves leveling and rotating the vehicle containing the magnetometer {{through a series}} of known headings. The calibration procedure presented in this paper does not require any external reference. Furthermore, unlike the method of “swinging”, this calibration method performs the calibration in the magnetic field domain and not the heading domain. This makes the algorithm applicable for cases where the magnetometer is used in applications other than heading determination. The calibration algorithm uses an estimator where the states are the various sensor errors. These states in the estimator are hard iron biases, soft iron biases, and <b>scale</b> <b>factor</b> <b>errors.</b> This calibration procedure is implemented using a non-linear two step estimator where the first step problem is solved by using standard batch least squares linear estimation techniques and the second step is solved algebraically. This two step estimator outperforms an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) formulation. A low-cost magnetometer triad was used to collect data and experimentally validate the calibration algorithm. The non-linear two step estimator results in magnetometer calibration residual less than 0. 005 Gauss which translates to heading errors on the order of 1 degree...|$|R
