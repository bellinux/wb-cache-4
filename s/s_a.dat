40|$|Purpose: Pterygium is an ocular surface {{disease of}} unknown {{etiology}} associated with epithelial and fibrovascular outgrowth from the conjunctiva onto the cornea. S 100 proteins are calcium-activated signaling proteins that {{interact with other}} proteins to modulate biological functions such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence of various S 100 proteins in pterygium compared to normal conjunctiva. Methods: Immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 were conducted to investigate the expression and tissue distribution.

No significant difference was found in the localization and expression of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4. In both conjunctiva and pterygium, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 -positive cells were found in superficial and suprabasal layers. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6 expression was strong in the superficial layer of pterygium epithelium but relatively weaker in the suprabasal and superficial cells of normal conjunctiva epithelium. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 were localized in the superficial layer of both pterygium and normal conjunctiva epithelium, with higher levels in pterygium than uninvolved conjunctiva. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 was expressed in the basal cells of conjunctival epithelium but in the suprabasal layers of pterygium epithelium.

40|$|<b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 {{proteins}} {{have been}} described as playing roles in the control of tumor growth and metastasis. We show here that a chemical probe, oxyclozanide (OX), selected for inhibiting the interaction between <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) interacts with both <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4. Furthermore, we show that <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 interact with RAGE and TLR 4; interactions that can be inhibited by OX. Hence, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 display similar functional elements despite their primary sequence diversity. This was further confirmed by showing that <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 dimerize both in vitro and in vivo. All of these interactions required levels of Zn(++) that are found in the extracellular space but not intracellularly. Interestingly, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 are expressed by distinct CD 11 b(+) subpopulations both in healthy animals and in animals with either inflammatory disease or tumor burden.

40|$|<b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 are Ca 2 +-binding {{proteins}} {{that are associated}} with acute and chronic inflammation and cancer.

We investigated the stability of the heterodimer in myeloid and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 /S 100 A 9 over-expressing COS cells. In both cases, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 proteins were not completely degraded even 48 hrs after blocking protein synthesis. In contrast, in single transfected cells, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 protein was completely degraded after 24 h, while <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 was completely unstable. However, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 protein expression was rescued upon <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 co-expression or inhibition of proteasomal activity. Furthermore, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, but not <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, could be stabilized by LPS, IL- 1 b and TNFa treatment. Interestingly, stimulation of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 -transfected COS cells with proteasomal inhibitor or IL- 1 b lead to the formation of protease resistant <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 homodimers. In summary, our data indicated that <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 protein is extremely unstable but can be rescued upon co-expression with <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 protein or inflammatory stimuli, via proteolytically resistant homodimer formation.

After prolonged induction, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 foci localized to the cell vacuole, whereas the <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 foci remained in the cytoplasm when present alone, but entered the vacuole in cotransformants. Biochemical analysis of the proteins indicated that <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 alone or coexpressed together form amyloid-like aggregates in yeast. Expression of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 in wild type yeast did not affect cell viability, but these proteins were toxic when expressed on a background of unrelated metastable temperature-sensitive mutant proteins, Cdc 53 - 1 p, Cdc 34 - 2 p, Srp 1 - 31 p and Sec 27 - 1 p.

Materials and Methods: In this study, the protein expression of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 {{as well as that of}} <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 was investigated in thyroid tumors. Results: All of the undifferentiated carcinomas were immunopositive for <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 and overlap between staining patterns of both proteins was observed. In poorly differentiated carcinomas, all the cases were negative for <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, while slight immunopositivity of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 was seen in 2 cases. Papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, follicular adenoma and medullary carcinoma and normal follicules were negative for both proteins. Conclusion: <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 plays an important role in dedifferentiation of thyroid carcinom...|$|R
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies <b>S.</b> <b>a.</b> mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory owl is absent from Ireland (probably because of {{competition from the}} long-eared owl), and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E

It was Ashokan who helped Tirulokchandar cast M. G. Ramachandran in the film. Aaroor Das wrote the film's dialogues. Director S. P. Muthuraman worked as an assistant director on the film. S. Maruti Rao, R. G. Gope and A. K. Shekar {{were in charge of}} the cinematography, editing, and art direction, respectively. A. K.

40|$|The S 100 {{proteins}} are Ca 2 + binding proteins {{belonging to}} the EF-hand superfamily with diverse intracellular and extracellular functions. Three members (<b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 12) are upregulated in patients with acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, hence are known as inflammation-associated S 100 <b>s.</b> <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 are co-expressed constitutively in neutrophils, and induced in other cells by inflammatory mediators or oxidative stress. These proteins form homo- and hetero-complexes and have distinct intracellular and extracellular activities depending on their oligomeric forms. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 are highly sensitive to oxidation by hypochlorite and peroxides and may have a protective role in oxidative defense by scavenging oxidants. Studies in this thesis investigated the physiological and molecular effects of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during oxidative stress to elucidate its function in mammalian cells. Several differentially expressed genes involved in anti-oxidative defense and lipid metabolism were upregulated in microarray of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 -expressing yeast cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. PLB 1, encoding phospholipase B 1 that hydrolyzes phospholipids to generate lipid precursors, was upregulated in <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 -expressing HeLa cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 also localized to peroxisomes and/or lipid bodies in yeast, and closely associated with these structures in some mammalian cells. Collectively, these studies suggest possible roles for <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 in anti-oxidative defense and lipid metabolism. Oxidation of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 generates various reversible and irreversible modifications that may regulate their activities. Studies in this thesis characterized two novel modifications of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation, and their functional effects. S-nitrosylated <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 (<b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 -SNO) was detected by mass spectrometry in neutrophils treated with nitric oxide donors. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 -SNO reduced mast cell degranulation and mast cell-mediated leukocyte adhesion and extravasation in the rat mesenteric microcirculation, suggesting novel anti-inflammatory functions that are regulated by S-nitrosylation. S-glutathionylated <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 (<b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 -SSG) was generated in neutrophils activated by phorbol myristate acetate, and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 -SSG decreased neutrophil adhesion to fibronectin in complex with <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, suggesting that it may suppress excessive leukocyte transmigration. Studies in this thesis have elucidated several possible mechanisms whereby <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 contributes to anti-oxidative defense, and emphasized that specific oxidative modifications of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 are functionally important...|$|R

We used rat D 2 S dopamine receptor mutants, each containing <b>a</b> serine-to-alanine substitution (<b>S</b> 193 <b>A,</b> <b>S</b> 194 <b>A,</b> <b>S</b> 197 <b>A),</b> to investigate the mechanism through which these residues affect activation of the receptor.

There are currently no disease-modifying drugs available and due to poor management options, the number of joint replacement surgeries is increasing by nearly 10 % per annum in Australia. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 calcium-binding proteins are expressed by immune cells, and are involved in inflammatory situations, including inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where there {{is an increase in}} circulating and local (synovial fluid) levels of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9. They are present in the body preferentially as <b>a</b> heterodimer (<b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 /S 100 A 9) or less commonly as homodimers. Recently, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 were found in bone and cartilage cells; however their roles in these tissues are still unknown. The aim of this research therefore was to determine the role(s) of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 in cartilage degeneration and OA. The results presented in this thesis have provided insight into the role(s) of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 in cartilage and in OA. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 act as primers of cartilage degradation, through TLR 4 and MAPK signalling pathways, but require a second messenger in order to achieve full biochemical breakdown. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 is abundant in chondrocytes of human OA joints, but {{does not appear to be}} involved in non-inflammatory mouse models. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, and to <b>a</b> lesser degree <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, are also abundant at joint margins and in osteophytes from human OA patients, and may play a role in chondrogenesis. The results presented in this thesis have determined some of the mechanisms of action of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 in cartilage, however, the exact role of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 in OA remain unclear, and further work will need to be performed to fully determine the significance of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 in OA...|$|R
