It is aimed to know the wage and salary system {{implemented}} by this company, to know the strength and weakness of this system and to evaluate the company’es internal controlling system. To reach the objectives aforementioned, the author holds a research using three methods. The first is direct observation in UD. Berdijaya, the second is direct interview session with an informant, in such case the author holds direct ask-and-answer session with Mr. Sutaryo as the Company’s General Manager, {{and the third is}} the search information from literatures in library. Of research held, the author finds some strength and weakness of this system implemented by UD. Berdijaya. The strengths, among the other, are wage and salary list, absence card, letter of overtime instruction which had authorized by the related officer, doubled documents and forms, printed ordering number which also had authorized, Jamsostek (Labor Social Insurance) for all employees and in wage and salary distribution has been well managed. While the weakness, the registration of employee absence is still manually implemented, there is no work rotation, there has not been verificator function, the less employee monitoring on the work time and the wage and salary payment are still manually implemented, not involving bank service. The author concludes that the wage and <b>salary</b> <b>accounting</b> system in UD. Berdijaya has been quite well implemented, such also with the internal controlling system. While the recomendations from the author for the company therefore are {{it would be better if}} the time account machine on employee absence starts to be used, it is necessary to rotate the work for the employee not to bore, and it is necessary to use reliable verificator function in holding the inspection on the implemented procedures.

Topics covered include: an industry overview; industry performance and trends; forms and conditions of employment; and earnings and wage instruments. The retail industry is relatively concentrated among large firms and profit margins are the lowest of any industry. On average, wages and <b>salaries</b> <b>account</b> for about 10 per cent of industry expenses. Over the three decades to 2008, output growth {{was similar to that}} of the broader economy, although recent business surveys indicate that economic activity in Retail trade is now declining. Retail trade employs a relatively large proportion of low-skilled and low-paid employees, relying relatively heavily on industrial awards and Australian Pay and Classification Scales for setting rates of pay. Hourly earnings within the industry are highly concentrated in a narrow band. Relative to the workforce as a whole, the industry contains high proportions of women and young people. The high rate of part-time work, which has grown very strongly over the past two decades with only modest growth in full-time employment, ensures a high incidence of casual employment. Retail trade workers are more likely than the workforce as a whole to be either unemployed or underemployed. They also have shorter average job tenure and are more likely than unemployed workers from any other industry to have voluntarily left their last job...|$|R

A problem has arisen: how to integrate this system with an existing ERP.

The experience, gained during this industrial case study, could be useful for solving problems of integrating ERP with external systems and choosing the right method for integration.
