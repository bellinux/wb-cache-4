5|$|In response, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus {{joined with}} the Allied fleet off Delos. They were then {{approached}} by a delegation from Samos, who suggested that the Ionian cities would revolt if the Allied fleet successfully engaged the Persian fleet. They furthermore pointed out the poor morale and reduced <b>seaworthiness</b> of the Persian fleet. Leotychides decided to attempt this, and sailed for Samos.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting <b>seaworthiness.</b> This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for <b>seaworthiness,</b> and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her <b>seaworthiness</b> in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her <b>seaworthiness,</b> but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of <b>Seaworthiness</b> from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E
25|$|Chris Craft {{is better}} looking than Limestone, but Limestone {{projects}} <b>seaworthiness</b> and reliability. (Two attitudes, two brand names).|$|E
25|$|A U.S. Congressional {{hearing was}} also held, and {{provided}} some determinations, notably {{about the lack}} of ballasting specified by the builders during the fatal voyage and the resulting lack of <b>seaworthiness</b> of Andrea Doria after the collision.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Alfonso XIII {{finally was}} {{completed}} on 18 May 1900, {{and she was}} commissioned the same day. Her shortcomings in <b>seaworthiness</b> led her to having a short career, and she was soon stricken and scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Though {{small in}} terms of {{accommodation}} in comparison with modern boats with wider beams and greater headroom, the compact cabin of the Contessa resulted from the low, narrow-beamed design that emphasized rough weather handling and <b>seaworthiness</b> {{at the expense of}} cabin space.|$|E
25|$|During its {{construction}} the Ro III {{was known as}} the Ro II series III, indicating its close similarity to its predecessor. The most obvious difference was a sharp bow to improve <b>seaworthiness.</b> It was advertised in two forms, either as a ten passenger airliner or a long range reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Gallagher {{sold the}} boat to new owners who pledged to {{continue}} with the restoration work. In 2006 the boat was moved to Hoboken, New Jersey while the local council carried out an upgrade to Pier 25. Although operational, the boat is apparently not used for actual voyages since it lacks a <b>seaworthiness</b> certificate.|$|E
25|$|On {{her return}} to England, Victory was {{examined}} for <b>seaworthiness</b> and found to have significant weaknesses in her stern timbers. She was declared unfit for active service and left anchored off Chatham Dockyard. In December 1796 she was ordered to be converted to a hospital ship to hold wounded French and Spanish prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} Naniwa and Takachiho {{was based on}} a steel hull with high {{freeboard}} to increase <b>seaworthiness.</b> Compared with Izumi, the armor was stronger and the coal bunkers formed an additional shield around critical areas. The hull was split into multiple watertight compartments, with a double bottom. Both ships were equipped with naval rams as was standard for the time.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{plans for}} an assault motor torpedo boat, the MTS model, began in December 1939. The Italian Naval Command goal was a small, high speed two-seat motor torpedo boat based on the MTM. In {{addition}} to speed, <b>seaworthiness</b> and range should have made the motorboat capable of carrying out operations against anchored targets successfully. The MTS was armed with two 450mm torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|Converting the {{assembled}} barges into landing craft involved cutting {{an opening in}} the bow for off-loading troops and vehicles, welding longitudinal I-beams and transverse braces to the hull to improve <b>seaworthiness,</b> adding a wooden internal ramp and pouring a concrete floor in the hold to allow for tank transport. As modified, the Type A1 barge could accommodate three medium tanks while the Type A2 could carry four.|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, {{making use}} of the {{modified}} wing roots as water-displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, port and starboard wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and <b>seaworthiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carpenter: (name unknown). He was {{responsible}} for {{making sure that the}} hull was well-caulked and the masts were in good order. He was the person responsible for maintaining all areas of the ship in good condition and being a general repairman. He also maintained the tools and all necessary items to perform his carpentry tasks. His name is unknown, but his tasks were quite important to the safety and <b>seaworthiness</b> of the ship.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{issues with}} their {{stability}} and <b>seaworthiness</b> {{due to the}} top-heavy design became evident. Takao and Atago were rebuilt, resulting in an improved design: {{the size of the}} bridge was reduced, the main mast was relocated aft, and hull bulges were added to improve stability. After rebuilding was completed, Takao and Atago patrolled off the coast of China in 1940 and early 1941. She was commanded by Captain Tomiji Koyanagi from October 1940 to July 1941.|$|E
25|$|Infernal {{was among}} the last bomb vessels to be built to a two-masted ketch rig design. Over the {{preceding}} decade the Navy Board had considered {{ways to improve the}} handling and <b>seaworthiness</b> of its bomb vessels, including using a three-masted ship rig instead of the ketch. To test this concept, the Board resolved that four Infernal-class bombs, including Infernal herself, would be ketch-rigged and the other three ship-rigged, and that their relative performance would determine future bomb vessel design.|$|E
25|$|Alvise Da Mosto, {{built at}} the Cantieri Riuniti del Quarnaro in Fiume, was laid down on 22 August 1928, {{launched}} on 1 July 1929 and completed on 15 March 1931. During the sea trials she reached {{a top speed of}} 42.7 knots, the fastest ship in her class. As the was the next-to-last of her class to enter service, she had already received the modifications that her sisterships needed after completion in order to improve stability and <b>seaworthiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the Imperial German Navy placed {{orders for}} a {{flotilla}} of 12 torpedo boats {{as part of}} its shipbuilding programme for that year, with one half flotilla of six ordered from AG Vulcan, and six from Germaniawerft. The 1911 torpedo boats were smaller than those ordered in recent years in order to be more manoeuvrable and so work better with the fleet, which resulted in the numbering series for torpedo boats being restarted. The reduction in size resulted in the ships' <b>seaworthiness</b> being adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|Dix was {{purpose-built}} for one route only, the {{run across}} Elliott Bay from Seattle to Alki Point, then the main recreation area for Seattle. Her owners were A.B.C. Dennison and W.L. Dudley, doing business as the Seattle and Alki Point Transportation Company. She was lightly built, and apparently top-heavy, as the steamboat inspectors twice refused to issue her a <b>seaworthiness</b> certificate, only relenting when her builders installed 7tons of gravel ballast in her hull and 5tons of iron weights bolted to her keel. Even so, she {{was said to}} be difficult to handle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1977 two Dutch DJs of Radio Mi Amigo went on strike protesting the bad and {{dangerous}} condition the ship was in, and ridiculed by the staff ashore in Spain, left the ship. Although nothing {{had been done to}} improve the ship's safety and <b>seaworthiness,</b> both DJs returned to the ship in October 1977, resuming their shows. During the winter of 1977/1978 due to the project running out of financial assets the crew didn't get any cargo aboard for three weeks, no food and water nor any technical spare parts and fuel.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands found Lynx to be unsuitable, {{and it was}} {{transferred}} to Italy in 1961, where it was renamed Aquila. In service, the SMP 3 guns {{proved to be a}} failure, being too complex and unreliable, (Lynx suffered an explosion in one of its SMP 3 guns during its brief service with the Netherlands Navy) and adversely affecting the ships' <b>seaworthiness.</b> As a result, Italy re-armed its ships in 1963, replacing the 76mm guns with single 40mm Bofors guns. Danish ships used U.S. pattern 3-inch guns which were retained for the entire ships service lives.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 2012, Marion Dufresne ran aground as {{she reached}} Crozet Islands as part of third {{resupply}} campaign of the year. The incident resulted in a 25-metre breach in the hull, flooding of two watertight compartments, and disabling of the bow thruster. The crew managed to control the damages and safely returned the vessel off the island. The 110 passengers were evacuated by the on-board helicopter to the small station located on the island. After being assessed for <b>seaworthiness,</b> repairs were effected at the Elgin Brown & Hamer shipyard in Durban, South Africa. A similar accident occurred in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Type C barge was {{specifically}} converted {{to carry the}} Panzer II amphibious tank (Schwimmpanzer). Because of the extra width of the floats attached to this tank, cutting a broad exit ramp into {{the bow of the}} barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel's <b>seaworthiness</b> to an unacceptable degree. Instead, a large hatch was cut into the stern, thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before turning under their own motive power and heading towards shore. The Type C barge could accommodate up to four Schwimmpanzern in its hold. Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September.|$|E
25|$|An {{integrated}} system has several technical advantages {{in comparison to}} towed barges. Traditionally tugs, being short in length, have to operate at relatively high Froude numbers resulting in high wave making resistance and the barges, being towed in the tugs' wake, have skegs that improve directional stability but increase drag. Positioning the tug behind the barge in a stern notch improves the hydrodynamic efficiency of the combination, resulting in significant reductions in the total resistance. In addition the tug, operating {{in the wake of}} the barge, has better control over the combination and thus improves <b>seaworthiness</b> and maneuverability in comparison to the traditional towing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Its {{maiden voyage}} {{included}} a port visit to Hawaii and docking at Alameda, California {{to finish the}} remaining work, with around 13 separate contracting actions. Gregorio del Pilar conducted a test at the coast of California to measure the crew’s capabilities and the ship’s <b>seaworthiness.</b> Gregorio del Pilar made a port visit at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam {{which was the first}} time that a Philippine vessel docked at Pearl Harbor. She arrived on the Philippines on August 17, 2011 after port visit in Guam. Gregorio del Pilar arrived in Manila on August 21, 2011. The arrival ceremony was held on August 23, 2011 and minor improvements were done the following days.|$|E
25|$|Equipped with {{a double}} hull, Andrea Doria was divided into 11 {{watertight}} compartments. Any two of these could be filled with water without endangering the ship’s safety. Andrea Doria also carried enough lifeboats to accommodate all passengers and crew. She carried a total of 16 steel lifeboats, eight positioned {{on each side of}} the ship, coming in three different designs; two 58-person launches for emergency use, two 70-person motorboats with inboard radio transmitters, and 12 146-person hand-propelled standard boats. Furthermore, the ship was equipped with the latest early warning radar. However, despite its technological advantages, the ship had serious flaws concerning its <b>seaworthiness</b> and safety.|$|E
25|$|Water {{traffic on}} the Euphrates and canal system was early on, quite considerable. Ships, whose tonnage was {{estimated}} {{by the amount of}} grain they could carry, were continually hired for the transport of all kinds of goods. The Code fixes the price for shipbuilding and insists on the builder's giving a year's guarantee of <b>seaworthiness.</b> It also fixes the rate of hire for ship and crew. The captain was responsible for the freight and the ship; he had to replace all loss. Even if he refloated the ship, he had to pay a fine of half its value for sinking it. In the case of collision, the boat under way was responsible for damages to the boat at anchor.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} of the turbine-powered {{destroyer}} HMS Cobra, which broke in two and sank while on its delivery voyage on 19 September 1901, the Admiralty set up a committee to investigate the strength and <b>seaworthiness</b> of its destroyers. As part of these investigations, a number of full-scale tests were carried out on Wolf to determine the stresses to which destroyers could be exposed to at sea. Wolf was fitted with strain gauges and subject to hogging and sagging tests in dry dock at Portsmouth. Following this, Wolf, still fitted with strain gauges, was sent to sea to look for bad weather. The investigation indicated that the destroyers built to Admiralty design requirements had adequate strength.|$|E
25|$|Unanswered {{questions}} about the tragedy, and questions of cause and blame, have intrigued observers and haunted survivors for over 50 years. The fact that Andrea Doria and Stockholm were speeding in heavy fog (21.8 knots and 18.5 knots, respectively, at the collision) and {{questions about}} their <b>seaworthiness</b> arose at the time. Captain Calamai never assumed another command because the Italian Line feared bad publicity. However, largely because the out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies ended the fact-finding which was {{taking place in the}} hearings immediately after the disaster, no resolution of the cause(s) was ever formally accomplished. This has led to continued development of information and a search for greater understanding, aided by newer technologies in over half a century since the disaster.|$|E
25|$|After the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), {{these ships}} became {{known simply as}} destroyers. Destroyers became so much more useful, having better <b>seaworthiness</b> and greater {{capabilities}} than torpedo boats, that they eventually replaced most torpedo boats. However, the London Naval Treaty after World War I limited tonnage of warships, but placed no limits on ships of under 600 tons. The French, Italian, Japanese and German Navies developed torpedo boats around that displacement, 70 to 100 m long, armed {{with two or three}} guns of around 100mm (4in) and torpedo launchers. For example, the Royal Norwegian Navy s were in fact of a torpedo boat size, while the Italian s were closer in size to a destroyer escort. After World War II they were eventually subsumed into the revived corvette classification.|$|E
25|$|BMP-3F – Specially {{designed}} for operations at sea, with improved <b>seaworthiness</b> and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the required accuracy at sea state 2. Compared {{to the basic}} model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle. A new main sight, the SOZH, which has an integrated laser range finder and an ATGM guidance channel, is installed. This version can endure continuous amphibious operation for seven hours with the running engine.|$|E
25|$|Galleys {{have since}} their first {{appearance}} in ancient times been intended as highly maneuverable vessels, independent of winds by being rowed, and usually {{with a focus on}} speed under oars. The profile has therefore been that of a markedly elongated hull with a ratio of breadth to length at the waterline of at least 1:5, {{and in the case of}} ancient Mediterranean galleys as much as 1:10 with a small draught, the measurement of how much of a ship's structure that is submerged under water. To make it possible to efficiently row the vessels, the freeboard, the height of the railing to the surface of the water, was by necessity kept low. This gave oarsmen enough leverage to row efficiently, but at the expense of <b>seaworthiness.</b> These design characteristics made the galley fast and maneuverable, but more vulnerable to rough weather.|$|E
