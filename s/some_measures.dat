5|$|The {{assets of}} Icelandic pension funds are, {{according}} to one expert, expected to shrink by 15–25%. The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have to be cut in 2009. Iceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink {{by as much as}} 10% {{as a result of the}} crisis, putting Iceland by <b>some</b> <b>measures</b> in an economic depression. Inflation may climb as high as 75% by the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|Although Minton {{supported}} the Roosevelt Administration {{and became a}} regular guest at the White House, Minton opposed the president on <b>some</b> <b>measures.</b> He voted to override a presidential veto of a grant of $2.5 ($ billion in 2015 dollars) in bonus pay for World War I soldiers (Bonus Army). He {{supported the}} Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which Roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states. He also supported {{an extension of the}} Hatch Act of 1939, a law that prevented federal employees from being forced to take part in state election campaigns, effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 India {{enacted the}} National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Some of its primary goals were to reduce infant {{mortality}} {{and also the}} maternal mortality ratio. Additionally, the NHRM aimed to create universal access to public health services and also balance the gender ratio.

5|$|The FBI {{estimates}} that nearly 50,000 members of Tablighi Jamaat {{are active in}} the United States. As of 2008, according to one estimate the organization had a presence in nearly 200 countries and a total following of between 100 and 150 million people. By <b>some</b> <b>measures</b> this made Tablighi Jamaat the largest Muslim movement in the World. The majority of the followers of the Tablighi Jamaat live in South Asia. Another source (Pew Research Center’s Religion and Public Life project) estimates there are between 12 and 80 million adherents, spread across more than 150 countries.|$|E
5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. <b>Some</b> <b>measures</b> of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E
