40|$|Depending on {{practical}} {{considerations and}} standards, {{different types of}} test specimens are used for {{the determination of the}} uniaxial compressive strength of concrete. Appropriate conversion factors, also referred to as <b>shape</b> <b>factors,</b> are needed to convert the compressive strength as determined on one type of specimen to the equivalent compressive strength of another type of specimen. As such <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> for vibrated concrete are influenced by the composition of the concrete, questions arise concerning the factors that affect the <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> for powder-type self-compacting concrete (SCC). This paper describes the findings of an extensive research programme performed by three laboratories on the influencing parameters of the <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> for SCC. Concrete composition parameters such as powder content, cement/powder ratio, water/cement ratio and the type of coarse aggregates, cement, filler and plasticiser appear to have little effect on the experimentally obtained <b>shape</b> <b>factors.</b> Any possible influence on compressive strength was overshadowed by experimental scatter...|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing {{technology}} has proved a magnificent role in urban development. High resolution remotely sensed imagery provides remote sensing mapping, GIS data acquisition and automatic updates, and also supports for extraction train {{features such as}} building. In this work, a new approach for building extraction in colored high resolution remotely sensed imagery is proposed. The approach includes Statistical Region Merging (SRM) segmentation, boundary tracing and clustering based on new shape-factors. After performing SRM, the boundary tracing algorithm is carried out. Moore neighbour contour tracing algorithm is used for this purpose. New <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are proposed based on geometry of buildings and other terrain features. The correlation of <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> between buildings and road features is significantly low. The <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are based on circularity, elongation and compactness. Afterwards K-means classifier is utilized in order to discriminate between buildings and other objects. In this step squared Euclidean distance has been opted.

40|$|In 1920 Prandtl {{published}} an analytical {{solution for the}} bearing capacity of a strip load on a weightless infinite half-space. This solution was extended with a surrounding surcharge by Reissner and with the soil weight by Keverling Buisman. It was Terzaghi who wrote this with three separate bearing capacity factors for the cohesion, surcharge and soil-weight. Meyerhof extended this to the equation which is nowadays used; with <b>shape</b> and inclination <b>factors.</b> He also proposed equations for the inclination factors, based on his own laboratory experiments. Since then, several people proposed updated equations for the soil-weight bearing capacity factor, and also for the <b>shape</b> and inclination <b>factors.</b> The common idea is that failure of a footing occurs in all cases with a Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. In order to check the failure mechanisms and the currently used equations for the bearing capacity <b>factors</b> and <b>shape</b> <b>factors,</b> {{a large number of}} finite element calculations of strip and circular footings have been made. These calculations proof that for some cases there are also a few other failure mechanisms possible. Also the currently used bearing capacity <b>factors</b> and <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are not correct. In fact, for footings on a soil with a higher friction angle, all three bearing capacity factors and all three <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> can be much lower than the currently used values. This means that the currently used equations for the soil-weight bearing capacity <b>factors</b> and the <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are inaccurate and unsafe. Therefore, based on the finite element calculations, new equations have been presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Foundation {{design is}} of utmost {{importance}} within the structural and geotechnical engineering sector. They must be designed properly with a good margin of safety. There has been {{a considerable amount of}} research conducted and work completed in this area in the decades following Karl Terzaghi’s initial experiments in the 1930 ’s and 40 ’s to determine the bearing capacity of soil. As a result much experimental data has since been published in relation to the <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> for shallow foundations. Bearing capacity theory includes formulae which allow the bearing capacity formula to recognise the foundation shape: different shapes are more efficient at resisting loads and these formulae are known as <b>shape</b> <b>factors.</b> The <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> that are recommended for use by Eurocode 7 were derived in the 1970 ’s and the tests that were carried out on loose, fine sand. This kind of sand obviously isn’t representative of the majority of actual soil conditions hence the use of these factors may underestimate the actual bearing capacity of the ground. This dissertation has investigated this hypothesis and through both research into the theory of bearing capacity and results from model tests that have been carried out, comparisons have been made on the whether the <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> prescribed by Eurocode 7 are adequate or if they result in an underestimated, conservative value for bearing capacity. After both the research and the model testing results were documented, analysis and comparison between the theoretical and experimental values found that the Eurocode 7 factors are in fact quite conservative and would lead to a more expensive foundation solution than is required. Recommendations have been made in relation to how to improve the current <b>shape</b> <b>factors.</b> This is a shortcoming {{that needs to be addressed}} and this dissertation aims to present a basis on which to do so...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{inversion}} of irradiance measurements for the inherent optical properties of a hydrosol {{such as the world}} ocean has been examined with the NOARL optical model. This model is a Monte Carlo simulation of the radiative transfer equation that, given the optical properties of a hydrosol, generates the zonal radiances and the commonly measured n-radiances of that hydrosol. This information allows us to test the optical inversion capability of any irradiance model. We have demonstrated that the two-flow model, used often in atmospheric optics, cannot be inverted to yield the inherent backscattcr coefficient of natural hydrosols due to the extreme asymmetry of the hydrosol volume scattering function. The asymmetry of the volume scattering function interacting with the radiance distribution introduces parameters called <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> into the models for irradiance inversion. The presence of <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> in an irradiance model renders it unsolvable; thus, simplifying assumptions are required for an inverse solution. We inquire into the possibilities for irradiance inversion given the existence of <b>shape</b> <b>factors.</b> There is great interest in the problem of inversion of irradiance measurements in...|$|R
