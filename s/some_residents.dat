5|$|On 19 May, <b>some</b> <b>residents</b> of Jerusalem's Silwan {{neighborhood}} informed rebel {{leaders that}} they could use a sewer tunnel that ran from the Dung Gate to a mill in the Jewish Quarter, to clandestinely enter Jerusalem.

The Egyptian commander of the city, Rashad Bey, subsequently withdrew his garrison into Jerusalem's citadel to take up positions against the incoming rebels.|$|E
5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive.

He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for <b>some</b> <b>residents,</b> but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>residents</b> of Glenwood Springs {{have argued}} instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids {{downtown}} completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E
