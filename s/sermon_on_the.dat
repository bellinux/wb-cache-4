5|$|The Gospels portray Jesus {{teaching}} in well-defined sessions, such as Matthew's <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount or Luke's parallel <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plain. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which {{had originally been}} recorded without context. While Jesus' miracles fit within {{the social context of}} antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{seemed to}} have {{influenced}} him with certain moral principles, though Gandhi himself had been influenced by The Kingdom of God Is Within You, a nonviolent classic written by Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy. In turn, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King had read Tolstoy, and King, Gandhi and Tolstoy had been strongly influenced by Jesus' <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount. King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a <b>sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gospel lesson {{of a particular}} Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E
25|$|While Matthew groups Jesus' teachings into sets {{of similar}} {{material}}, {{the same material}} is scattered when found in Luke. The <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount may {{be compared with the}} similar but more succinct <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plain as recounted by the Gospel of Luke (6:17–49), which occurs at the same moment in Luke's narrative, and also features Jesus heading up a mountain, but giving the <b>sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way down at a level spot. Some scholars believe that they are the same sermon, while others hold that Jesus frequently preached similar themes in different places.|$|E
25|$|This period {{includes}} the <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, {{one of the}} major discourses of Jesus in Matthew, and the <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plain in the Gospel of Luke. The <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, which covers chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Gospel of Matthew, is the first of the Five Discourses of Matthew and is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the New Testament. It encapsulates many of the moral teaching of Jesus and {{includes the}} Beatitudes and the widely recited Lord's Prayer.|$|E

25|$|Unlike triple-tradition {{material}}, double-tradition {{material is}} very differently arranged {{in the two}} gospels.
