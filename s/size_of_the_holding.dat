Nobuhira had an elder son (Tsugaru Nobuyoshi) by his first wife, the {{daughter}} of Ishida Mitsunari, who {{had been reduced to}} concubine status when Nobuhira married the niece of Tokugawa Ieyasu to secure his position vis-à-vis the new Tokugawa bakufu following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, his position as the son of a concubine resulted in a split in the ranks of the senior retainers of Tsugaru Domain, with a large faction supporting the younger Tsugaru Nobufusa due to his blood connection to the Tokugawa clan, and {{due to the fact that}} he was born as son of Nobuhira’s official wife. This resulted in an O-Ie Sōdō known as the Funahashi Sōdō of 1634, which was only suppressed with assistance by the Tokugawa shogunate and resulted in the exile of a number of Nobufusa’s supporters in 1636. Problems arose again in 1647 in what was called the Tempyō Sōdō, with remaining supporters of Nobufusa demanding that Nobuyoshi retire in favor of Nobufusa, alleging misgovernment through excessive drinking and womanizing. The situation was partly resolved by the creation of a semi-autonomous subsidiary holding for Nobufusa based at Kuroishi. The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> was later reduced to 4000 koku after Nobufusa's death.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The present paper {{investigates the}} {{question}} of a suitable basic model for the number of scrapie cases in a holding and applications of this knowledge to the estimation of scrapie-affected holding population sizes and adequacy of control measures within holding. Is the number of scrapie cases proportional to the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> in which case it should be incorporated into the parameter of the error distribution for the scrapie counts? Or, is there a different – potentially more complex – relationship between case count and holding size in which case the information about the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> should be better incorporated as a covariate in the modeling? Methods We show that this question can be appropriately addressed via a simple zero-truncated Poisson model in which the hypothesis of proportionality enters as a special offset-model. Model comparisons can be achieved by means of likelihood ratio testing. The procedure is illustrated by means of surveillance data on classical scrapie in Great Britain. Furthermore, the model with the best fit is used to estimate the size of the scrapie-affected holding population in Great Britain by means of two capture-recapture estimators: the Poisson estimator and the generalized Zelterman estimator. Results No evidence could be found for the hypothesis of proportionality. In fact, {{there is some evidence that}} this relationship follows a curved line which increases for small holdings up to a maximum after which it declines again. Furthermore, it is pointed out how crucial the correct model choice is when applied to capture-recapture estimation on the basis of zero-truncated Poisson models as well as on the basis of the generalized Zelterman estimator. Estimators based on the proportionality model return very different and unreasonable estimates for the population sizes. Conclusion Our results stress the importance of an adequate modelling approach to the association between holding size and the number of cases of classical scrapie within holding. Reporting artefacts and speculative biological effects are hypothesized as the underlying causes of the observed curved relationship. The lack of adjustment for these artefacts might well render ineffective the current strategies for the control of the disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGreece is a {{traditional}} agricultural country and has an important primary sector, mainly characterized by family farms. The major structural problems of the Greek agricultural sector are the small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding,</b> the land fragmentation, and the low educational level of human resources in rural areas. As a supplier of the Agribusiness sector, the farm is directly linked to the manufacturing industry.

The research was conducted in the Greek Agribusiness sector, using the SCP paradigm, in 2012. We found that special and atypical conditions prevail in Greek market, such as the significant heterogeneity of products, the bulk products supply, the existence of heterogeneity in the product sectors, and the special geographical conditions in a large part of Greek territory. We argue that imperfect competition prevails in parts of the Greek market, creating local niche markets, and giving to the local smes the opportunity to do business, to promote and sell their product range. Therefore, we note the existence of fragmentation in Greek market, either product or geographic, and the existence of a multidimensional Greek market reality, which have some specific impacts on the Greek Agribusiness market and thus, on th...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReaching and {{grasping}} {{movements have}} been studied mostly in seated contexts. There are several tasks, however, that also impose specific postural constraints that may affect <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> these movements. For example, in rock climbing, a successful grasp is conditional of an accurate static and dynamic postural control. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> our study was to analyze if postural constraints, imposed by rock climbing, would mask speed-accuracy tradeoff normally observed in pointing and grasping movements. More specifically, {{it was predicted that}} climbers, in order to reduce <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presumably less stable tripodal phase, would shorten <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> their reachings whatever <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> This time reduction would be incongruous with the longer end-phase control observed in seated conditions when precision requirements increase. Seven expert rock climbers performed grasping movements in two different postural conditions (easy and complex) towards holds of various depths (0. 8, 2 and 5 cm). As expected, <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> depth (precision requirements) did not influence <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> movements until contact with <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> More specifically, movement duration and velocity-time profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reachings were not affected by the accuracy requirements but were shortened by an increased postural difficulty. <b>The</b> duration <b>of</b> force adjustments once a contact with <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> was established increased with a decreased target size and were not affected by the postural complexity. The present findings suggest a hierarchical processing of postural constraints and precision constraints. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} will be {{emphasized}} the importance of the other profitable activities (OPA) on the family agricultural holdings, according to their economic size within the territory of Republic of Serbia, with special focus on the Vojvodina Region. Economic size of the agricultural holding is recognized by the value of its total standard output (SA). Other profitable activities related to the agricultural holdings include incomes from agricultural products sale, rural tourism, fishery, etc., whether they are performed on or outside the holding. Other profitable activities that are not related to agricultural holdings include activities that do not consume resources of the holding, but only the labor, as like in previous case they may be carried on, or outside the holding. According to gained results, average economic <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> in the Republic of Serbia is 5. 939 EUR, while the realized economic value on the family agricultural holdings (FAH) is 4. 990 EUR. Census of Agriculture in 2012 showed that the highest average economic size of the agricultural holdings has a Vojvodina Region (12. 032 EUR), what is 3, 5 times higher than the value achieved in other regions. From the total sum of 631. 552 agricultural holdings in the Republic of Serbia (family agricultural holdings (FAH), as well as legal entities (LE) and entrepreneurs) only 78. 301 holdings possess DPA that are in relation to the holding (where 21 % of them are within the economic class in range of 4. 000 - 7. 000 EUR). At the level of the Vojvodina Region, in total there were registered 147. 624 agricultural holdings (AH), where 8. 405 of them have OPA in relation to the holding (13, 6 % are within the class of economic sizes 100. 000 and more EUR) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to being motivated by profit, the management decisions taken by non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners involve other considerations beyond timber, such as non-timber goods and services, as well as factors that affect the level of timber output from the land. Ensuring and improving forest profitability to make NIPF management viable {{is one of the}} main challenges faced by this type of landowner. This study empirically explores and assesses management by NIPF owners, through analysing attributes of forest economics (investment in holdings, expenditure on planting and silviculture, public subsidies, along with timber and non-timber incomes). With the aim of predicting outcomes, a multiple regression model was also constructed to investigate and quantify the relationship between socioeconomic and holding factors, and the planting activities carried out by NIPF owners. For this, 103 resident forest landowners in a forest region in northern Spain were interviewed in person, during March 2004, about their commitment to and involvement in land management during the period 1999 - 2003. The results mainly revealed that attractive forest returns and favourable market conditions for timber production are significant factors for investment in and development of forestry, with personal and family conditions also being important factors in explaining the type of land management carried out. In particular, the multiple linear regression model for forest planting activity correctly explained 84. 5 % of the variability observed in the study population, indicating that both the investments in and the incomes from forestry play an important role in the activity, as does the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding.</b> The findings may be of interest in promoting public measures related to timber markets and economic incentives for forest management, which will allow landowners to develop economically viable practices, as well as enabling fulfilment of social and environmental demands for sustainable forestry and rural development.

40|$|Transfers to {{the rural}} land-poor are widely {{advocated}} and used in attempts to reduce rural poverty. Such transfers {{are believed to be}} productive, in that the final gain to the poor exceeds the initial transfer. The evidence cited most often to support this view is the negative correlation between output per acre and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding.</b> In other words, small farms appear to be more productive. There are reasons to question that evidence, however, say the authors. It is unclear, for example, how much differences in productivity are really attributed to unmentioned differences in land quality (someone might be given a larger plot of poor land so that a living can be made from it). Other factors also constrain the impact on poverty of land-based targeting, notably incentive constraints (whereby the"land-rich"alter their behavior to gain from the policy) and political economy constraints (whereby theland-rich undermine the policy by creating political pressure for tradeoffs). To inform the debate, the authors quantify the potential gains from land-based targeting under seemingly ideal conditions, incorporating only a limited set of constraints on such a policy. Their aim is to quantify gains to the poor from a benchmark policy designed to characterize the probable upper-bound on real-world outcomes. A key constraint on such schemes is that targeting is done on the basis of landholding class alone. Ignoring productivity differentials, the relevant indicator in making transfers is a suitably defined poverty measure for each landholding class. The more general formulation the authors offer calls for two indicators: the marginal productivity of transfers (assumed to be proportional to current output per acre on owned land) and a poverty measure (derived from a standard poverty profile). After applying this approach to new data for rural Bangladesh, they find that landholding class is a relevant indicator for targeting. Under ideal conditions, redistribution from land-rich to land-poor households will reduce aggregate poverty in rural Bangladesh (even without productivity effects). And transfers from an external budget would have the greatest impact on poverty if they were concentrated on landless, marginal farmers. Moreover, productivity effects (consistent with the relationship between farm size and productivity in Bangladesh) imply an additional impact on rural poverty when transfers are made from land-rich to land-poor households. But the gains are modest, even if one postulates virtually unheard-of powers of redistribution across landholding classes. Depending on the initial conditions of agricultural technology, and the relative productivity effects among the landless, they estimate that the maximum impact on rural poverty from land-based targeting under revenue neutrality is equivalent to a uniform lump-sum transfer of between Tk 10 and Tk 20 per person per month - or between 2. 5 percent and 5 percent of rural mean consumption. This is under ideal circumstances, putting aside the constraints mentioned, and with no consideration for administrative costs. Real-world circumstances will entail even less impact on poverty. One must hope, for the sake of Bangladesh's poor, that targeting the land-poor with such redistribution is not all that is done to attack rural poverty.

40|$|During recent years, most open feedlot {{operators}} {{have found}} it desirable and, in some cases, necessary to install runoff control facilities. Even though {{the primary purpose of}} feedlot runoff control systems is the prevention of water pollution, many producers have found that good management of these systems also offers limited economic benefits in the form of fertilizer nutrients and supplemental irrigation water. Well managed runoff control systems also reduce weeds, odors, insects and muddy areas at or near feedlot edges. The runoff control system that has proved most satisfactory for all areas of the country is one consisting of clean water diversion, runoff collection, a solids settling facility (or debris basin), a runoff holding pond and pond dewatering equipment (Figure l). Management consists of cleaning solids from the settling facility and pumping out the holding pond when necessary. The amount of labor required for proper management of runoff control systems is not excessive, but this type task usually has a low priority in a general farming situation and, therefore, is often not accomplished when it should be. A lack of cattle lot maintenance can lead to undrained muddy areas and to nuisance conditions such as fly and odor problems. Such conditions have also been shown to decrease animal performance. If the settling basin is not cleaned when solids build-up reaches the design-full level, the outlet clogs and more solids carry through to the holding pond. Allowing solids to reach the holding pond reduces its capacity and shortens its useful life unless periodic sludge removal is practiced. Additionally, an excessive accumulation of solids and undrained liquids in the basin frequently results in odor and insect problems. Failure to pump out the holding pond on a timely basis may lead to overflows with dubsequent loss of crop nutrients, water pollution, and potentially to a lawsuit. Clean Water Diversion To minimize the amount of water which must be handled through a runoff-control system; diversion terraces, channels and roof gutters should be utilized and kept in good repair. Keeping clean water diverted away from feedlots decreases the quantity ofliquids to be separated in the settling basin and subsequently stored in the holding pond. Control of clean water effectively reduces the required <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> pond or can increase the time between dewatering operations. In· situations where clean water is to be collected for use as irrigation water, it should be diverted around the settling basin directly to the holding pond. Careful sizing and design of the holding pond is essential to ensure adequate capacity for storing both the diverted clean water and feedlot runoff. Runoff can be collected from feedlot areas and diverted to settling basins and holding ponds by using curbs, channels, terraces, pipes or combinations of these. All parts of the runoff control facilities need to be kept free of obstructions such as weeds, tree limbs, and accumulations of solids. Obstructions in runoff collection devices may cause overflows with resultant pollution or nuisance conditions due to unconfined feedlot runoff. Obstructions can also cause solids to settle in areas where removal may be difficult, or impossible. Routine moving and clean-up supplemented with periodic grading and shaping of earthen runoff collection devices will effectively minimize the development of erosive or low, soggy areas...|$|E

In this regard, the General Agricultural Censuses from 2002 and 2010 reveal a series of information that outline {{the manner in which}} the agricultural holdings with legal entity engage themselves in using the agricultural lands in Romania. Thus we notice holding groups distributed on size categories and how their holding structure is influenced by <b>the</b> usage category <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lands utilized and also by <b>the</b> geographical particularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. Additionally, there is an improvement regarding the qualitative developments made in order to change <b>the</b> medium <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>holding</b> with legal entity. The study identifies the current and perspective trends concerning <b>the</b> changes <b>of</b> agricultural <b>holding</b> (with legal entity) structure as effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct relation between the agricultural holdings without legal entity and those with legal entity when using the agricultural lands in Romania...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{enormous}} <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data <b>holding</b> and <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{information system}} {{resulting from the}} EOS system pose several challenges to computer scientists, {{one of which is}} data archival and dissemination. More than ninety percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data holdings <b>of</b> NASA is in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> images which will be accessed by users across the computer networks. Accessing the image data in its full resolution creates data traffic problems. Image browsing using a lossy compression reduces this data traffic, as well as storage by factor of 30 - 40. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> several image compression techniques, VQ is most appropriate for this application since <b>the</b> decompression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VQ compressed images is a table lookup process which makes minimal additional demands on the user's computational resources. Lossy compression of image data needs expert level knowledge in general and is not straightforward to use. This is especially true in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> VQ. It involves <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> appropriate codebooks for a given data set and vector dimensions for each compression ratio, etc. A planning and scheduling system is described for using the VQ compression technique in the data access and ingest of raw satellite data...|$|R
