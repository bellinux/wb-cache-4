5|$|Increasingly, private {{companies}} pay for weather forecasts tailored {{to their needs}} {{so that they can}} increase their profits or avoid large losses. For example, supermarket chains may change the stocks on their <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions. Weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market, such as futures in oranges, corn, soybeans, and oil.|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronica outsold Shenmue (1999) {{within its}} first week on <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> February 2000. In total, the Dreamcast version sold almost 450,000 {{units in the}} United States and 1.14 million copies worldwide. The sales were weak {{compared}} to series predecessors, but strong compared to other Dreamcast games. The PlayStation 2 version of Code: Veronica X had sold 900,000 copies and earned $27 million in the United States by July 2006, outselling Resident Evil 4. It went on to sell 1.4 million copies worldwide. Next Generation ranked it as the 63rd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. Combined console sales of Resident Evil games released in the 2000s reached 3 million units in the United States by July 2006.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> relation to other books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to {{all but the most}} privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|The DVD {{edition of}} Ed Wood {{initially}} had difficulty reaching store <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> The United States and Canada due to unspecified legal issues. The initial release had a featurette on transvestites — not {{relating to the}} film or its actors in any way — which was removed from subsequent releases. An initial street date of August 13, 2002 was announced only to be postponed. A new date of February 3, 2003 was set, only {{for it to be}} recalled again without explanation, although some copies quickly found their way to collectors' venues such as eBay. The DVD was finally released on October 19, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The day of {{the main}} event two {{aftershocks}} occurred (5.6 at 14:51 and 5.4 at 22:07) but the initial shock was V (Moderate) on the Mercalli intensity scale and the second event was felt only. Ten days following the mainshock on July 31, a stronger aftershock occurred with a local magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). That aftershock was felt in California and western Nevada, broke windows and knocked items of <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> Bishop, and light fixtures were damaged at the National Weather Service office.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{entering}} the Ellwood House, guests of Isaac or Perry Ellwood {{would have been}} greeted or formally welcomed {{by members of the}} family. After Perry Ellwood inherited the house in 1910 the entry parlor began to become known as the library. Prominent among the library's features is a carved Italian marble mantle with a large gilt mirror hung above it. The library's bookshelves are cast in a Neo-Italian Renaissance style and constructed of fine mahogany. Presently filling the <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> the Ellwood House are a large collection of books with Ellwood family nameplates. Near the library window, which is adorned with its original walnut shutters, is an 1890s French statue. The statue was donated to the Ellwood House Association from someone in Sycamore who bequeathed it to the museum.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store <b>shelves.</b> <b>In</b> Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E
5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store <b>shelves</b> <b>in</b> May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the shelves and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I. Joe: Retaliation Movie Prequel was published by IDW Publishing from February 2012 to April 2012. Written by John Barber, it acted as a prequel to the 2013 movie.|$|E
