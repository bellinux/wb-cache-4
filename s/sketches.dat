5|$|Sax Rohmer (pseudonym of Arthur Henry Ward; 1883–1959) was a British {{writer of}} songs <b>sketches,</b> plays and stories. Born in Birmingham to Irish {{immigrant}} parents, {{the family moved}} to London in about 1886, where Rohmer was schooled. His formal education finished in 1901, following the death of his alcoholic mother. After attempting careers in the civil service, as well as the banking, journalism and gas industries, Rohmer began writing comic songs, monologues and <b>sketches</b> for music hall performers, including Little Tich and George Robey. Rohmer's first book was Pause!, a series of <b>sketches</b> conceived by Robey and written by Rohmer, which was published anonymously in 1910; his second book was the ghost-written biography of Little Tich, published with Tich's real name, Harry Relph.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{systematic}} approach to <b>sketch</b> map interpretation. The method decomposes {{the elements of a}} <b>sketch</b> map into a hierarchy of categories, from the material <b>sketch</b> map level to the non-material representational <b>sketch</b> map level, and then interprets the <b>sketch</b> map using the five formal representation spaces that we develop. These spaces (set, graph, metric and Euclidean) provide a tiered formal representation based on standard mathematical structures. We take the view that a <b>sketch</b> map bears information about the physical world and systematises this using extensions of existing formal ontologies. The motivation for this work is the partially automatic extraction and integration of information from <b>sketch</b> maps. We propose a set of ontologies and methods as a first step {{in the direction of a}} formalisation of partially automatic extraction and integration of <b>sketch</b> map content. We also see this work as a contribution to spatial cognition, where researchers externalise spatial knowledge using <b>sketch</b> mapping. The paper concludes by working through an example that demonstrates the <b>sketch</b> map interpretation at different levels using the underlying method...|$|R

40|$|To design {{innovative}} {{temporal and}} interactive behavior for a multimedia application, a multimedia designer needs to rapidly explore numerous behavioral design ideas {{early in the}} design process.

Through its <b>sketching</b> language and layers, DEMAIS reduces the need to create multiple copies of similar storyboards when <b>sketching</b> behavior.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} recognized that free-hand <b>sketch</b> maps {{are influenced by}} cognitive impacts and therefore <b>sketch</b> maps are incomplete, distorted, and schematized. This {{makes it difficult to}} achieve a one-to-one alignment between a <b>sketch</b> map and its corresponding geo-referenced metric map. Nevertheless, <b>sketch</b> maps are still useful to communicate spatial knowledge, indicating that <b>sketch</b> maps contain certain spatial information that is robust to cognitive impacts. In existing studies, <b>sketch</b> maps are used frequently to measure cognitive maps. However, little work has been done on invariant spatial information in <b>sketch</b> maps, which is the information of spatial configurations representing correctly the real world. We aim to study such information from a cognitive perspective. This paper first presents basic spatial objects identified in <b>sketch</b> maps and then introduces <b>sketch</b> aspects that capture invariant spatial information. The accuracy and reliability of these aspects were evaluated by a human study. We collected <b>sketch</b> maps from participants, extracted and measured spatial relations of identified spatial objects, and in the end analyzed the accuracy and statistical significance of these relations. Based on the statistical survey, we propose in this paper a set of seven <b>sketch</b> aspects that constitute invariant spatial information, along with a spatial analysis method to measure them. The findings of these aspects help to understand which spatial information is preserved under the transformation from the physical world to human <b>sketch</b> maps...|$|R

5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and {{it was assumed that}} the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and <b>sketches</b> were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript <b>sketches</b> have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E
