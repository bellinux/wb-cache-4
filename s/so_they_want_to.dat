The comet will come in a matter of days, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make sure that there are either no dragons around, or, if there is one, confirm that its heart is pure and that it will not be tempted into fulfilling the prophecy. Meanwhile, the King (Ken Shorter) makes a mysterious man named Osric (Harry Van Gorkum) his adviser, and Osric pledges to unite the kingdom under the old code, but corrupts it by forcing each status of citizen to wear a certain color of tunic.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2004, the Maoists {{ordered the}} closure of all private schools in Sandhikharka, {{as well as the}} rest of Arghakhanchi District. This came a year after they promised to keep the schools open if they cut their tuition fees by at least 20 percent, which was what occurred. According to schoolchild Pratiba Acharya, [...] "Maoists thought that only rich people study in {{boarding}} schools like mine, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> close them." [...] Further, they destroyed schools who were operated by their enemies and those they disagreed with, after trying to change their curricula was to no avail. Many students were sent to public schools, which teach in Nepali. This posed two problems. For one thing, Nepali, though widely spoken and understood, is not invariably the mother tongue of all students in multilingual, multi-ethnic Nepal. In addition, private school students are accustomed to English as the primary medium of instruction.|$|E

50|$|The {{band was}} known for having an all-ages policy at almost every concert which it headlined. This meant that they would often choose to play at {{unconventional}} locations such as basements, Jaycee halls, and college auditoriums, {{rather than at the}} traditional 18+ or 21+ (alcohol-serving) music clubs. They did this because they frequented all-ages shows in Olympia as teens, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> let fans of any age attend their own gigs.|$|R
5000|$|As {{they look}} at the table of {{residual}} values, they see that the residual value of a CR-V is 25% higher than that of a Pilot (0.55 is 125% of 0.44). They reason that such a greatly higher residual value is an indication of a better or more desirable car, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> place a premium on cars with relatively high residual value. After some thought and discussion, they decide that, when comparing residual values, they {{want to look at the}} higher one as a percentage of the lower, and assign their intensities on that basis. Where one model has a residual value that is less than 105% of another, they consider the residual values as equal for all practical purposes. Where one model has a residual value that is 125% of the residual value of another, they consider the former model as quite strongly more important, desirable, valuable, etc., as indicated by its much higher resale value. With a bit more thought and discussion, they decide to make their judgments on this basis: ...|$|E

Henne finished the game with 18 completions for 211 yards and four touchdowns, while Manningham had eight receptions for 129 yards and two touchdowns. After the game, Michigan running back Mike Hart called Michigan State Michigan's [...] "little brother." [...] "I was just laughing,” Hart said of Michigan State taking the lead. “I thought it was funny. They got excited. Sometimes you get your little brother excited when you’re playing basketball, and you let him get the lead, and then you come back and take it back."

Otherwise you become a parody of what you started out doing. But it's impossible play more from the new album. Back in the early 80s you could probably do it, but now with YouTube and downloading, the songs would all be out before the album was out. We did Somewhere Back in Time and that dealt with the 80s, and the time before that we did A Matter of Life and Death, just the one album. You can't go out and play the greatest hits every time - it's important to play the newer songs because we really believe in them." ...|$|E

5000|$|The media often {{comparing}} Fox to actress Angelina Jolie, dubbing her the [...] "next Angelina Jolie", {{also affected}} Fox's image. The actresses have been compared {{partly because they}} each have a [...] "tattoo collection", status as a [...] "built in sex-symbol" [...] and [...] "share exotic, sultry looks". There were additionally reports that Fox was to replace Jolie in a new Lara Croft film and that Jolie was displeased by this development, but Fox indicated that these were only rumors {{and said that she}} did not want to portray the character. Fox commented that the comparisons indicate a lack of creativity on the part of the media, adding, [...] "I am a brunette with tattoos, I curse and I have made mention of sex before. I joked about it which people find outrageous <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> constantly compare that to her." [...] She said, [...] "I'm sure Jolie has no idea who I am. But if I were her, I'd be like, 'Who the fuck is this little bullshit brat who was in Transformers that's going to be the next me?' I don't want to meet her. I'd be embarrassed." [...] Lee stated that Jolie and Fox are partly differentiated because of Jolie's [...] "pronouncements on such subjects as the need to ban land mines in Southeast Asia or repatriate Afghan war refugees", while Zach Johnson of E! Online stated that, given various similarities between Jolie and Fox, the two may be more alike than Fox is willing to acknowledge.|$|E

50|$|Revisiting {{the first}} story arc from Grant Morrison's run on the Marvel Comics title New X-Men, Professor X is holding {{a gun to his}} head, ready to shoot himself in order to prevent the twin sister he killed in the womb from make her way to Cerebra (in order to take over his mind). The psychic backlashed knocked out Jean Grey and put her in a coma while {{encasing}} her inside the Phoenix Egg. 10 years after the death of Professor X, Magneto has his own institute with 90% mutant students, as well as his own team of X-Men consisting of the students who attended Xorn’s Special Class in the original run. A group calling themselves The Patient show up to commit violence on the mutants. They’re presumably humans who have genetically given themselves powers and they want to kill off the real mutants. Magneto shows up with his X-Men, all young and with a few familiar faces like Angel Salvadore, Basilisk, Beak, Dust, Glob Herman, Ernst, No-Girl, Redneck, the Stepford Cuckoos, and Tattoo. Another group of middle-age X-Men eventually do show up, albeit late and pathetic. Cyclops pretends like he’s still the guy leading an entire race, but he just makes a fool of himself. Magneto establishes here that Cyclops and Emma Frost are basically a bunch of has-beens since their powers are fading away. Even the rest of Magneto’s team goes {{out of their way to}} berate them and not in a very good way. Meanwhile, at a mutant medical center, Beast is helping out a couple of prospective parents. Apparently, they want to make sure their child is a mutant. In a domain where mutants are the majority, just being normal is basically a handicap <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make sure their kid has that advantage. Later, Wolverine is approached by Cyclops at a bar saying he has a mission and it involves Jean Grey. As it turns out Magneto has had Jean Grey locked away at the school for quite some time now. Magneto then explains to Esme Cuckoo that Jean Grey fell into a coma after Professor X killed himself. Apparently, their minds were linked during the struggle against Cassandra Nova. Now she’s stuck in this pseudo-Phoenix Egg and he wants to wake her up. Unbeknownst to him, Cyclops had an informant inside his ranks and discovered Jean was in his possession. To try and save Jean, Cyclops assembled the old X-Men Emma Frost and Wolverine and released Xorn from his prison that was run by the U-Men so that he could help them.|$|E

It was to have been named the Borneo or Galileo, to differentiate it with the previous LM003. The idea was taken to SZ Design, an offshoot of Zagato, but it never went past a few concept drawings that looked vaguely similar to a modern Range Rover.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to afford the topic of when and how the Theodosian Code gained legal force {{in the western part}} of the Empire, lately solved with {{solutions}} that do not ought to be widely accepted. Overlooked theories on the subject, here is stated that in the West there was no official enactment of the Code because its copying and spreading into the chancellery of the judges would have been evaluated by contemporaries as far as enough to give legal strength to it. No question was raised for lack of simultaneity with eastern part of the Empire because the constitution that enacted to the Code and gave legal force since January 2 439 in the East (Nov. Th. 1) was not even known in the West (that’s why the Senate met in December 438). The sending of Nov. Th. 1 to the West in 447 shows that in the eastern part of the Empire a distintinction between enactment and spread, by officially copying the legal book of Theodosius, was made, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> mend the mistake taken into the West in the legal procedure to enact and spread the Code...|$|E
