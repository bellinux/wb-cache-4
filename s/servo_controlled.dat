50|$|A Griggs {{apparatus}} has {{the ability}} to create and maintain confining pressure on a sample while separately being able to strain the sample. Confining pressure is generated by advancing a hydraulic ram either by using a hand operated lever pump or a <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> syringe pump. The advancing ram then compresses the outer tungsten carbide piston (σ3) that in turn depresses the Pb plug {{at the top of the}} sample assembly and then in turn stresses the NaCl pressure medium. Deviatoric stress is created by a mechanical drive train that is powered by an electric motor that sits on top of the apparatus. When the electric motor is powered it engages with a set of gears that allow for variable strain rates to be chosen that range from 10−3sec-1 down to 10−8sec-1. To eliminate the torque from the advancing drive train produced by the gear set, a recirculating ball screw is located in between the gear set and deformation piston (σ1) that provides the axial load. Connected in series with the deformation piston is also an external load cell which measures the load applied to the inner (σ1). The outer (σ3) and inner (σ1) pistons that sit above the sample are two separate pieces, this allows for the advancement of the deformation piston with the drive train without altering the confining pressure which is operated with the hydraulic ram.|$|E

METHODS: The hourly rectal temperature recordings from 17 infants treated with <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> and an equal number treated with manually adjusted cooling equipment were examined. The target rectal temperature for all infants is 33. 5 degrees C for 72 h. RESULTS: During 6 to 72 h after start of cooling, the mean (95 % CI, variance) of the averaged rectal temperatures was 33. 6 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 4 degrees C to 33. 8 degrees C, 0. 1 degrees C) in the manually adjusted group and 33. 4 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 3 degrees C to 33. 5 degrees C, 0. 04 degrees C) in the <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> group (means, p= 0. 08; equality of variance, p= 0. 03). The variance was also significantly different between infant groups during 1 to 5 h after start of cooling, p= 0. 01, but not during rewarming. CONCLUSION: The rectal temperature can be maintained close to the target temperature with either manually adjusted or <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> equipment, but there is less temperature variability with the <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> system in use in the UK...|$|E

The scientific goals of this research are to develop a new visual servo control methodology that: (1) adapts for the unknown camera calibration parameters (e. g., focal length, scaling factors, camera position and orientation) and the physical parameters of the robotic system (e. g., mass, inertia, friction), (2) compensates for unknown depth information (extract 3 D information from the 2 D image), and (3) enables multi-uncalibrated cameras {{to be used as a}} means to provide a larger field-of-view.
