Picard meanwhile is suffering from persistent headaches and <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> help of Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). She scans Picard, but can not find what is causing them. Meanwhile, on the bridge, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) reports that a second vessel is approaching. Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) identifies it as a Federation Constellation-class starship.|$|E
5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which lasts for four to six days), it <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E

5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn).

Mark informs Ron that an inspection is needed {{to ensure that the}} facility meets all current zoning code standards, and an obviously lying Ron claims it does, clearly underscoring his vexation with governmental regulations. During the inspection, Mark finds numerous code violations, including oily rags placed above a wood-burning fireplace and a long-outdated fire extinguisher. Later, Mark takes a half-day off so that he can help his friend's woodshop meet city code. Ron thanks Mark by building a wooden canoe and leaving it in his office.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged Van der Sloot with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance issued {{an arrest warrant}} through Interpol to have Van der Sloot prosecuted in the United States. On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek Van der Sloot's extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a federal grand jury formally indicted Van der Sloot of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to Van der Sloot.|$|E

5|$|This {{campaign}} {{starts as}} Yodit attempts to flee from her nephew Gidajan, who has framed her for theft. She then <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> {{hand of the}} Syrian prince Zanobis in marriage and performs several deeds to increase her reputation, {{having to deal with}} the Beja tribes, Nobatia, and the Ikshids.

Following this, she takes the fight to Gidajan and takes control of several stelae in the region surrounding the city of Massawa before taking the city itself. She pursues her nephew to Aksum itself and destroys his palace in the city.|$|E
5|$|Hilde is the {{daughter}} of the king of Wolfkrone, a fictional European kingdom under assault by series antagonist Nightmare's forces. After her father was driven insane by the Evil Seed event brought upon by the cursed sword Soul Edge (which took place seven years before the events of Soulcalibur IV), Hilde was forced to take the throne of Wolfkrone despite her young age. She took the responsibilities to protect her people and lead her armies in the front lines against Nightmare. As a desperate measure, Hilde <b>seeks</b> <b>the</b> Sword of Resurrection, Soul Calibur, to bring back an ancient king who once restored peace to the world. Eventually, both Nightmare and Soul Edge are destroyed for good by Soul Calibur, wielded by Hilde's friend, Siegfried, thus ending the long-term war. However, the Wolfkrone is still at turmoil, and Hilde must search for a new land for her people to settle. Throughout seventeen years, Hilde goes from nation to nation to search for territory, where she also became a mother of two children. Eventually, the Wolfkrone manages to find a land and live at peace, but Hilde is alarmed by Siegfried that an army of malfested have challenged wars upon the kingdom.
