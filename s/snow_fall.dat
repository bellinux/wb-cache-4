5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Pageantry Committee was Walt Disney, {{who was responsible for}} producing both the opening and closing ceremonies. He organized an opening that included 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies were held on February 18, 1960, at Blyth Arena {{in the midst of a}} blizzard. The heavy <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour. The festivities began with a sustained drum roll as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles. Vice President Richard Nixon represented the United States government and declared the Games open. The Olympic cauldron was lit by Kenneth Henry, Olympic champion of the 500meter speed skating race at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The Olympic oath was taken by Carol Heiss on behalf of all the athletes. As the national delegations left the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclement weather}} caused many {{educational}} institutions, such as universities and secondary schools, to close. Among these were University of Michigan–Dearborn in Dearborn, Michigan, Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, Ohio, Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois, Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois, Champlain College and the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, Mount St. Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland, Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois, Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut, Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, The University of Akron, Kent State University, Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio, Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, The University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio, the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, The Pennsylvania State University, Lyndon State College in Lyndonville, Vermont, George Mason University, Northern Virginia Community College and James Madison University in Virginia, Sherbrooke University and Bishop's University, in Quebec, the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, UMBC in Catonsville, Maryland, Georgetown University in Washington, DC, Cornell University, University of Pittsburgh, Chatham College in Pittsburgh, and West Chester University of Pennsylvania.

25|$|Frost {{and snow}} are rare {{phenomena}} {{in the city}} as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, snow fell {{in the city and}} in January 2007 feather light snow fell in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in {{the upper reaches of the}} hills of the city. During this time heavy snowfall was also observed in the Cuyamaca Mountains of San Diego County.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} low height {{of most of}} the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on Helvellyn 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{parts of}} Azad Kashmir including Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts has extremely hot weather in summers and moderate cold weather in winters. It receives rains mostly in monsoon weather.In {{the central and}} northern parts of state weather remains moderate hot in summers and very cold and chilly in winter. <b>Snow</b> <b>fall</b> also occurs there in December and January. This region receives rainfall in both winters and summers. Muzaffarabad and Pattan are among the wettest areas of the state. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800mm). During summer, monsoon floods of the Jhelum and Leepa river are common, due to high rainfall and melting snow.|$|E

25|$|Mississippi has a humid {{subtropical}} climate with long summers and short, mild winters. Temperatures average about 81°F (about 27°C) in July and about 48°F (about 9°C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near Mississippi Sound is significantly warmer than the inland {{portion of the}} state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from , in 1966, at Corinth in the northeast, to , in 1930, at Holly Springs in the north. Heavy snowfall is possible across the state, such as during the New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm. Yearly precipitation generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, Clarksdale, in the northwest, gets about 50inches (about 1,270mm) of precipitation annually and Biloxi, in the south, about 61inches (about 1,550mm). Small amounts of <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional {{in the southern part}} of the state.|$|E
25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, {{when you look at the}} fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit a far cry from the 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E

500|$|Skyrim {{is powered}} by Bethesda's Creation Engine, created {{specifically}} for Skyrim. After Fallout 3s release, the team devised numerous design objectives to meet for Skyrim, and according to Howard, the team [...] "got all those done and kept going". Had the team {{not been able to}} meet their design goals with current hardware, they would have waited for the next generation and released Skyrim then, but Howard felt that the technology of the time did not hold the team back at all. The Creation Engine allows for numerous improvements in graphical fidelity over Bethesda's previous efforts. For example, the draw distance renders farther than in previous Elder Scrolls games; Howard provided an example where the player can stare at a small object such as a fork in detail, and then look up at a mountain and run to the top of it. Dynamic lighting allows shadows to be created by any structure or item in the game world, and the Creation Engine allowed for greater detail in flora production than SpeedTree had in previous Bethesda games. For example, with Bethesda's own technology, developers were able to give weight to the branches of trees, which affects how trees blow in the wind. In addition, the technology allows wind to affect the flow of water in channels such as rivers and streams. Because of the large presence of snow in Skyrims game world, the technological upgrades were applied to weather effects and allow for dynamic <b>snow</b> <b>fall</b> upon the terrain, instead of snow that was rendered as a textural effect in previous games.|$|E
