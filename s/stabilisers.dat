5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, <b>stabilisers,</b> dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture of iodine), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic <b>stabilisers</b> which contributed far more than discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E

Marlow then appears with Taylor and tells Ripley {{that he plans to}} {{overload}} the Anesidoras fusion reactor and destroy the station, thus ensuring that no aliens survive. In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an electric discharge while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital <b>stabilisers,</b> causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown into the ship due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with no option but to open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift and unconscious in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E
40|$|Poly(vinyl amine) (PVAm) was derivatised using 2 -thiophenecarboxaldehyde via Michael {{addition}} {{to prepare a}} statistical copolymer <b>stabiliser</b> for the synthesis of primary amine-functionalised polypyrrole (PPy) particles. A minimum <b>stabiliser</b> concentration of around 20 % (w/v) relative to pyrrole was required for well-defined PPy particles of approximately 100 – 200 nm, as judged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS).

40|$|Pipes {{of random}} {{polypropylene}} was (PP-R) were hydrostatic pressure tested {{and the distribution}} of the primary <b>stabiliser,</b> Irganox 1010, was measured in the radial direction over the pipe wall by Infrared (IR) microscopy. Parabolic concentration profiles of the <b>stabiliser</b> develop during testing indicating a loss of <b>stabiliser,</b> at both the inner and outer pipe walls. Raising the temperature of the water bath leads to a uniformly accelerated loss of <b>stabiliser.</b> An increase of the hoop stress accelerates the <b>stabiliser</b> migration at the inner pipe wall. The concentrations of Irganox 1010 averaged over the pipe wall as determined by IR microscopy were in excellent agreement with those obtained from High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Oxidation Induction Time (OIT) analysis. Diffusion constants were calculated from the <b>stabiliser</b> concentration profiles based on the Fickian equations using appropriate initial and boundary conditions. A literature value is compared to these experimental results. The developed IR technique allows monitoring the <b>stabiliser</b> migration faster and more reproducibly than the conventional approach by manual abrasion of layers and measurement of the OIT. Additionally, this brings a tremendous improvement with regard to spatial resolution. As a result the impact of hoop stress and extrusion rate on the migration of <b>stabiliser</b> in PP-R pipes can be shown for the first time...|$|R

The effect of <b>stabiliser</b> on efflux time or ‘flow time’ of GP cement grout was studied and the dosage required to achieve an efflux time of 35 seconds was estimated. The results showed a linear relationship with increasing <b>stabiliser</b> dosage extending the holding time of the grout. The effect of <b>stabiliser</b> on the timing and measure of peak hydration temperature was then assessed and the results showed that for GP cement and GB cementitious grouts, peak temperatures were lower after adding <b>stabiliser,</b> and for all three grouts the time to peak hydration was significantly increased. Finally, the effect of <b>stabiliser</b> on the plastic and hardened properties of fresh concrete, stabilised concrete, and a blend of fresh and stabilised concrete was assessed.

25|$|Early {{versions}} of the Fw 42 design featured vertical <b>stabilisers</b> mounted {{on the end of}} the wing, with additional fins located just outboard of the engine nacelles, for a four-tail arrangement. In addition, these early concepts featured the canard being mounted above the fuselage in a parasol arrangement, which had been used on the F 19. As the design was developed between 1931 and 1933, the canard was moved from the top to the bottom of the fuselage, to improve vision for the pilot and field of fire for the forward gunner. In addition, wind tunnel tests of the four-fin configuration showed that it did not provide a significant advantage over a single, large fin, and so the latter configuration was adopted for simplicity.|$|E
