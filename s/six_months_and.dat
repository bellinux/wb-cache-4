Method: Data were obtained from clinical records of 3, 449 Vietnamese HIV/AIDS patients aged 18 years or older who initiated ART between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, log rank test were conducted to examine the trends of baseline characteristics, <b>six</b> <b>month</b> mortality <b>and</b> LTFU.

40|$|The TOT {{procedure}} {{is considered one}} of the most useful techniques for treating female SUI. The hypothesis of this study is to confirm its real efficacy in daily practice. The material of the study is a group of 55 women affected by SUI in which this technique was performed. After a preoperative standardized assessment the patients underwent an early postoperative evaluation <b>and</b> a <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> one year follow up looking for surgical complications and evaluating the efficacy of the procedure using QL questionnaires. The results show that there were no major intra or post operative complications. At the <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> one year follow up 95. 5 % of the patients were fully satisfied while the remaining 4. 5 % stated they had improved. The authors can confirm that TOT is a very safe and successful technique for treating SUI and can be widely employed in daily practice...|$|R

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type.

40|$|Study objective: To {{assess the}} {{relations}} between characteristics of the neighbourhood internal and external built environment <b>and</b> past <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> lifetime depression. Design and setting: Depression and sociodemographic information were assessed in a cross sectional survey of residents of New York City (NYC). All respondents were geocoded to neighbourhood of residence. Data {{on the quality of}} the built environment in 59 NYC neighbourhoods were collected from the United Status census, the New York City housing and vacancy survey, and the fiscal 2002 New York City mayorâs management report. Main results: Among 1355 respondents, residence in neighbourhoods characterised by a poor quality built environment was associated with greater individual likelihood of past <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> lifetime depression in multilevel models adjusting for individual age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income and for neighbourhood level income. In adjusted models, persons living in neighbourhoods characterised by poorer features of the built environment were 29 %â 58 % more likely to report past <b>six</b> <b>month</b> depression <b>and</b> 36 %â 64 % more likely to report lifetime depression than respondents living in neighbourhoods characterised by better features of the built environment. Conclusions: Living in neighbourhoods characterised by a poor quality built environment is associated with a greater likelihood of depression. Future prospective work designed to assess potential mechanisms underlying these associations may guide public health and urban planning efforts aimed at improving population mental health...|$|R

5|$|Initial DVT {{costs for}} an average hospitalized patient in the U.S. are around $7,700–$10,800. VTE {{follow-up}} costs at three months, <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> a year are about $5,000, $10,000, and $33,000 respectively; in Europe, the three and six-month figures are about €1,800 and €3,200. Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs. Annual DVT costs in the U.S. are an estimated $5 billion or in excess of $8 billion, and the average annual cost per treated individual {{is thought to be}} about $20,000. As an example, if 300,000 symptomatic DVT patients were treated at costs averaging $20,000 annually, that would cost $6 billion a year.|$|E
