In these regions there exist ultrabroadband <b>solid-state</b> <b>oscillators</b> that allow using the method of transient intracavity laser spectroscopy (ICLAS) [1 - 3]. The ultrahigh sensitivity of this method in detection of the weak narrowband absorbers results from the extremely large effective absorption length, which is achieved by many round-trips of the broadband laser field, before it collapses to a narrow laser line. In this work we analyse a quasi-steady-state realization of the broadband intracavity spectroscopy, which is possible with a mode-locked femtosecond oscillator emitting an ultrabroad spectrum affected by the narrowband absorbers (e. g. gases). We demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that the resulting spectrum is different from the usual transient ICLAS [3] and the extra-cavity femtosecond absorption spectroscopy [4], because the soliton spectrum is affected mainly by the intracavity dispersion of the oscillator. The results of simulations based on the nonlinear cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau model of a femtosecond oscillator [5] are presented in Fig. 1.
