40|$|In rubber {{friction}} studies it {{is often}} observed that the kinetic friction coefficient μ depends on the nominal contact pressure p. We discuss several possible origins of the pressure dependency of μ: (a) saturation of the contact area (and friction force) due to high nominal squeezing pressure, (b) non-linear viscoelasticity, (c) non-randomness in the surface topography, in particular {{the influence of the}} skewness of the surface roughness profile, (d) adhesion, and (e) frictional heating. We show that in most cases the non-linearity in the μ(p) relation is mainly due to process (e) (frictional heating), which <b>softens</b> the <b>rubber,</b> increases the area of contact, and (in most cases) reduces the viscoelastic contribution to the friction. In fact, since the temperature distribution in the rubber at time t depends on on the sliding history (i. e., on the earlier time t 0 < t), the friction coefficient at time t will also depend on the sliding history, i. e. it is, strictly speaking, a time integral operator. The energy dissipation in the contact regions between solids in sliding contact can result in high local temperatures which may strongly affect the area of real contact and the friction force (and the wear-rate). This is the case for rubber sliding on road surfaces at speeds above 1 mm/s. In Ref. [14] we have derived equations which describe the frictional heating for solids with arbitrary thermal properties. In this paper the theory is applied to rubber friction on road surfaces. Numerical results are presented and compared to experimental data. We observe good agreement between the calculated and measured temperature increase. Comment: 14 pages, 21 figure...|$|R

40|$|Stress {{softening}} during {{initial loading}} cycles, {{known as the}} Mullins effect, and the residual strain upon unloading are not accounted for when the mechanical properties of rubber are represented {{in terms of a}} strain-energy function, i. e. if the material is modelled as hyperelastic.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} a high molecular weight polyisobutylene has been revisited to investigate the unique high-frequency peak (or shoulder) seen in the loss tangent behavior in the glass to <b>rubber</b> <b>softening</b> dispersion. Creep measurements made in the temperature range- 74 to f 2 7 "C were initially reduced to a curve, which, upon transformation from the time to the frequency domains, yielded a loss tangent peak with no hint of any shoulder. The original creep compliance curves were rescrutinized independently, and slight variations in the derivatives of the curves revealed the elusive high-frequency loss peak. Additional dynamic measurements were made to connect the transformed creep data {{to some of the}} original Fitzgerald, Grandine, and Ferry data [JAppl. Phys. 1953, 24, 9111. The combined results cover over 9 decades of frequency. This extensive range revealed that the mechanisms contributing to the high-frequency peak have a different temperature dependence than that of those contributing to the main loss peak.

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-heating}} temperature of filled rubbers under cyclic loading at environmental conditions is well-known. This increase in temperature seriously affects the constitutive stress–strain behavior by producing a thermal <b>softening</b> of the <b>rubber</b> compound. Although this feature is well-recognized and considered {{as important to}} its function, few constitutive thermo-mechanical models attempt to quantify the stress–temperature relationship. In this work, a physically-based model is developed to describe the large strain relaxed response of filled rubbers {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. The non-linear mechanical behavior is described via a Langevin formalism in which the temperature and filler effects are, respectively, included by a network thermal kinetics and an amplification of the first strain invariant. Experimental observations on the relaxed state of styrene-butadiene rubber hourglass-shaped specimens with a given carbon-black content are reported at different temperatures. A hybrid experimental–numerical method is proposed to determine simultaneously the local thermo-mechanical response and the model parameters. In addition, the predictive capability of the proposed constitutive thermo-mechanical model is verified by comparisons with results issued from micromechanical simulations containing different arrangements of the microstructure. The results show that the model offers a satisfactory way to predict the relaxed response of filled rubbers at different temperatures...|$|R

The nature of my invention consists in compounding with rubber, in any proportions, other suitable substances, so as to form not only an agreeable chewing-gum, but also, that from the scouring-properties of the same, it will subserve the purpose of a dentifrice. It is well known that rubber itself is too hard {{to be used as a}} chewing-gum, but in combination with non-adhesive earths may be rendered capable of kneading into any shape under the teeth. In the manufacture of this improved chewing-gum, no vulcanizing-process is employed. It is produced by simply dissolving the rubber in naphtha and alcohol, and when of the consistence of jelly, mixing with it prepared chalk, powdered licorice-root, or any other suitable material, in the desired proportions, and subsequently evaporating the solvents. I do not, however, confine myself to this method alone for the manufacture of the gum. For commercial purposes, other equally effectual processes maybe used for the uniting of the rubber with suitable substances. Instead of the solvents named, any other that will <b>soften</b> the <b>rubber,</b> without being offensive, may be employed, such as paraffine, spermaceti, wax, gums, resins, and the like.

40|$|In {{this era}} of rapid {{development}} and economic growth, waste management is of high concern for humans. According to statistics, {{a great amount of}} rubber waste materials are produced annually. The major amount of these waste rubber material comes from scrap tires. Only a few percent of the waste rubber materials are recycled and made into new products. Recycling of waste rubber has a certain problem: the crosslink structure of thermoset rubber. Due to the presence of three dimensional crosslink structures in rubber products, they cannot be reprocessed by application of heat, like we do for thermoplastic materials. In order to recycle and reuse the vulcanized rubber {{we have to find a}} way to cleave the crosslink bonds. This technique which can break down the crosslink bonds in the rubber is called devulcanization. Different devulcanization processes are utilizing heat, chemicals, ultrasound, and mechanical stresses in order to break down the crosslink structure of vulcanized rubber and convert the insoluble thermoset rubber into a soft and sticky material which can be processed and vulcanized again. Comparing various devulcanization processes, the thermo-mechanical devulcanization process which applies mechanical forces and heat to break down the crosslink network of rubber is very effective. One of the common ways to maintain the required shear stresses and mechanical forces to cleave and break down the crosslink structure of vulcanized rubber is utilizing the extrusion process. In this research, twin screw extruders are preferred due to their modular designs which enable us to adjust the different levels of shearing on the material. In order to facilitate the extrusion process supercritical carbon dioxide is used. Supercritical carbon dioxide diffuses into the rubber particles during the devulcanization process and facilitates the process by expanding and <b>softening</b> the <b>rubber</b> particles. In this research we have established a high throughput devulcanization process to produce devulcanized scrap tire rubber at an industrial scale. The effect of different process parameters on obtained devulcanized rubber properties, such as network structure, rheological properties, and physical and mechanical properties are studied. Results showed that in the range of our experiment design, the only effective parameter on crosslink density and Mooney viscosity of the devulcanized scrap tire is feed rate. Using Horikx theory, it was shown that the devulcanization mechanism for our scrap tire devulcanization process is a selective crosslink cleavage rather than a random chain scission. The obtained devulcanized rubber was then incorporated in a virgin tire rubber compound and the impact of devulcanized rubber utilization on tire compound performance was studied. Results showed that incorporation of devulcanized rubber into a tire tread compound up to 30 percent does not deteriorate the tire tread properties in a significant manner. Finally, a high throughput devulcanization process was established for scrap ethylene-diene-propylene (EDPM) rubber devulcanization. The effects of main process variables on the properties of the devulcanized EPDM rubber were studied. It was observed that crosslink density and Mooney viscosity of the devulcanized EPDM rubber are affected by the feed rate and screw speed in a significant manner. 1 yea...|$|R
