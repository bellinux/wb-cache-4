40|$|The reliabilities {{of steel}} and wood poles {{designed}} according to the 1997 NESC provisions for Grade C construction were evaluated. It {{was found that the}} reliability of steel poles is significantly higher than that of wood poles. Reasons for the discrepancy relate to the historical development of the deterministic design approach used in the NESC specifications. To correct the discrepancy, fundamental principles of structural reliability were used to develop modified load <b>factors</b> (LF) and <b>strength</b> <b>factors</b> (SF), applicable to all materials under grade C construction. A load factor LF= 1. 75 is proposed for all materials, and a table of <b>strength</b> <b>factors</b> are proposed. The <b>strength</b> <b>factors</b> are a function of the coefficient of variation of the pole strength, and the lower exclusion limit corresponding to the nominal design strength value. As an interim fix, it is proposed that the modified load and <b>strength</b> <b>factors</b> for grade C construction be allowed as an alternate approach in the NESC. Ultimately a complete rewrite of the NESC to incorporate a reliability-based LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design) approach will be necessary to guarantee consistent safety levels across all materials and structure types...|$|R

During structural testing performed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, the proposed structure demonstrated not only the required <b>strength</b> <b>factor</b> of six, but reached 11 without any sign of failure, providing the geodesic airframe to possess a strength far in excess of normal levels.

30|$|The {{strength}} factor-based {{criterion for}} tunnel deformation prediction proposed by Hoek in 2000 is reckoned {{to be the}} most practical criterion among the tunnel deformation criteria since 1980 s. In {{view of the fact that}} Hoek’s criterion was obtained based on case studies under squeezing ground conditions, it has a limited range of applications, applicable mainly in squeezing tunnels. In this work, this criterion was modified by taking into consideration the conditions of eight unstable stations in three non-squeezing tunnels in Iran to amplify its application range. Relative displacements and <b>strength</b> <b>factor</b> (defined as a strength-to-stress ratio) were obtained in unstable stations first. Then, the parametric values were plotted on a Cartesian coordinate’s plane. By using the optimal regression line passing through all points, a criterion for prediction of tunnel deformation was proposed finally. A comparison made between the measured values and the ones predicted by the new criterion shows that the variance accounted for was 77 % and the root mean square error was 2 %, an acceptable accuracy and a small error implying the effectiveness of the new criterion in tunnel deformation prediction. In addition, the results show that the <b>strength</b> <b>factor</b> of 0.38 can be used to determine the boundary between squeezing and non-squeezing conditions; the behavior and type of failure of the tunnel would be predictable by use of the <b>strength</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
