25|$|E.N.V. Motors was {{incorporated}} on 30 May 1919 which then acquired on 3 June 1919 the engineering business of Joseph Frederick Laycock who traded {{under the name}} of E.N.V. Motor Company at Willesden. The property and assets were acquired for Â£45,000 and new company invested in new plant and machinery including building a new factory for manufacturing of gearboxes and camshafts for engines and in particular <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears. In 1928 the company changed name to E.N.V. Engineering Company Limited.|$|E
25|$|The XCH-62 {{prototype}} was in {{an advanced}} state of assembly in 1975, being readied for a planned initial flight in 1976. Failures in the <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gearing of the main transmission were experienced in tests because the method of analysis employed had not considered the effect of rim bending. Consequently, new gears with strengthened rims were designed and fabricated. For a more accurate prediction of the load capacity of the gears, an extensive Finite Element Method (FEM) system was developed. The U.S. Army's XCH-62 HLH aft rotor transmission was finally successfully tested at full design torque and speed, but the US Congress cut funding for the program in August 1975. The designers of the Mil Mi-26 avoided similar problems by using a split-torque design in the main rotor transmission.|$|E
500|$|A single dry-plate clutch and an unsynchronized three-speed gearbox were {{bolted to}} the engine. [...] The gearbox was {{operated}} directly with a central shift lever. The drive shaft was enclosed in a torque tube and drove the live rear axle through a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> drive.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{transmitted}} to the rear wheels with the usual Daimler fluid flywheel and self-changing gearbox but the final drive was now by <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel.</b> A pin roller-bearing propeller-shaft led to a half-floating <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> driven back axle.|$|E
50|$|Zerol {{bevel gears}} are an {{intermediate}} type between straight and <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears. Their teeth are curved, but not angled. Zerol bevel gears {{are designed with}} the intent of duplicating the characteristics of a straight bevel gear but they are produced using a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> cutting process.|$|E

5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Comparison of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears to {{hypoid gears}} ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears are {{important}} components on rotorcraft drive systems. These components {{are required to}} operate at high speeds, high loads, and for {{a large number of}} load cycles. In this application, <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears are used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Bevel gears are also used as speed reducers ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears have {{curved teeth}} {{at an angle}} {{allowing}} tooth contact to be gradual and smooth.|$|E
50|$|Note that a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> {{gear and}} pinion are always of {{opposite}} hand, including {{the case when}} the gear is internal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears can be {{manufactured}} as Gleason types (circular arc with non-constant tooth depth), Oerlikon and Curvex types (circular arc with constant tooth depth), Klingelnberg Cyclo-Palloid (Epicycloide with constant tooth depth) or Klingelnberg Palloid. <b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears {{have the same}} advantages and disadvantages relative to their straight-cut cousins as helical gears do to spur gears. Straight bevel gears are generally used only at speeds below 5 m/s (1000 ft/min), or, for small gears, 1000 r.p.m.|$|E
50|$|Ata {{produces}} gears up to 3000 mm {{of outer}} diameter. The annual production is 8000 <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear sets of which 65% are exported.|$|E
50|$|Daimler fluid {{flywheel}} and Wilson four-speed preselective self-changing gearbox.The {{propeller shaft}} {{is open and}} has mechanical joints. The banjo back axle case contains <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gearing.|$|E
50|$|In older {{automotive}} designs, {{hypoid gears}} were typically used in rear-drive automobile drivetrains, but modern designs {{have tended to}} substitute <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears to increase driving efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Ata Gears Oy is a Finnish {{producer}} of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears founded in 1937. The headquarter is in Tampere. The company produces transmission parts for marine and industrial applications.|$|E
50|$|Axial {{pressure}} angle and axial profile angle are the {{pressure angle}} and the profile angle in an axial plane of a helical gear or a worm, or of a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> {{gear set}} {{should always be}} {{replaced}} in pairs i.e. both the left hand and right hand gears should be replaced together since the gears are manufactured and lapped in pairs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engineering}} {{was largely}} conventional with a 72 x 120 mm long stroke, monobloc, side-valve 1954 cc, four-cylinder 35 bhp engine built in-unit with a four-speed gearbox and <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> geared rear axle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears {{have their}} teeth formed along spiral lines. They are {{somewhat}} analogous to cylindrical type helical gears {{in that the}} teeth are angled; however, with spiral gears the teeth are also curved.|$|E
50|$|The {{back axle}} was of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> type with ratios between 4.4:1 and 5.6:1. A short torque tube ran {{forward from the}} {{differential}} housing to a bearing and bracket on the rear axle cross member.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Scott Rossiter {{purchased}} the company, renaming it the Lampin Corporation. In 1990, Lampin acquired MITRPAK, {{a line of}} <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear drives, from Johnson & Bassett, a Worcester, Massachusetts company founded in 1870.|$|E
50|$|In 1927, Gleason Works again led the {{innovation}} in this market, {{as it was}} the first machine tool builder to create machine tools to cut hypoid gears (which are an advanced variant of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears).|$|E
50|$|Hypoid gears {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher hypoid offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the hypoid offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency hypoid gears with more efficient <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears in automotive use because the <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque. Increasing {{the size of the}} drive axle gear would require an increase {{of the size of the}} gear housing and a reduction in the ground clearance.|$|E
5000|$|After {{engineers}} at Packard developed <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gears, Gleason pioneered the machine tools to mass-produce them (with automotive differentials being the primary market). Packard and Gleason settled an infringement lawsuit regarding Packard's patents ( [...] and [...] ) and Gleason's patent (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|The IIIB, {{launched}} September 1960, {{reverted to}} a single carburettor which improved fuel consumption and facilitated servicing [...] "in remoter territories". The IIIB also received a new back axle featuring a hypoid bevel {{in place of the}} former model's <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Normal {{pressure}} angle and normal profile angle are {{the pressure and}} profile angles in a normal plane of a helical or a spiral tooth. In a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear, unless otherwise specified, profile angle means normal profile angle at the mean cone distance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a Gardner 8-cylinder, 4-stroke 8L3 of [...] {{connected}} to a Wilson-Drewry CA5 R7, 5-speed epicyclic gearbox with RF11 <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> reverse and final-drive unit. Drive is through a jackshaft mounted beneath the cab, driving the wheels through coupling rods.|$|E
50|$|A {{right hand}} <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear {{is one in}} which the outer half of a tooth is {{inclined}} in the clockwise direction from the axial plane through the midpoint of the tooth as viewed by an observer looking at the face of the gear.|$|E
50|$|A single dry-plate clutch and an unsynchronized three-speed gearbox were {{bolted to}} the engine. The gearbox was {{operated}} directly with a central shift lever. The drive shaft was enclosed in a torque tube and drove the live rear axle through a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> drive.|$|E
50|$|A {{left hand}} <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear {{is one in}} which the outer half of a tooth is {{inclined}} in the counterclockwise direction from the axial plane through the midpoint of the tooth as viewed by an observer looking at the face of the gear.|$|E
50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear whose axis {{does not}} {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E
50|$|The LG6 chassis {{is based}} on the one used on the V12 model {{lengthened}} by 3.5 in to cater for the longer engine fitted. Suspension is independent torsion bar front suspension and live rear axle with <b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear final drive. The braking system is Lockheed hydraulic.|$|E
50|$|The {{spiral angle}} in a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> gear is the angle between the tooth trace and {{an element of}} the pitch cone, and {{corresponds}} to the helix angle in helical teeth. Unless otherwise specified, the term spiral angle is understood to be the mean spiral angle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a Gardner 8-cyl, 4-stroke 8L3 {{developing}} [...] at 1200 rpm, {{connected to a}} Wilson-Drewry CA5 R7, 5-speed epicyclic with RF11 <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> reverse and final drive unit mounted on a jackshaft. The drive to the wheels was by coupling rods from the jackshaft.|$|E
50|$|The J type is {{fitted with}} a 1476 cc four-cylinder side-valve engine based on the one used in the {{contemporary}} Morris Oxford MO car. Drive to the rear wheels is through a three-speed gearbox and initially a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> type rear axle, later replaced by a hypoid type.|$|E
