40|$|As a {{consequence}} of an aging workforce, electric utilities {{are at risk of}} losing their most experienced and knowledgeable electrical engineers. In this research, the problem was a lack of understanding of what electric utilities were doing to capture the tacit knowledge or know-how of these engineers. The purpose of this qualitative research study was to explore the tacit knowledge capture strategies currently used in the industry by conducting a case study of 7 U. S. electrical utilities that have demonstrated an industry commitment to improving operational standards. The research question addressed the implemented strategies to capture the tacit knowledge of retiring electrical engineers and technical personnel. The research methodology involved a qualitative embedded case study. The theories used in this study included knowledge creation theory, resource-based theory, and organizational learning theory. Data were collected through one time interviews of a <b>senior</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>engineer</b> or technician within each utility and a workforce planning or training professional within 2 of the 7 utilities. The analysis included the use of triangulation and content analysis strategies. Ten tacit knowledge capture strategies were identified: (a) formal and informal on-boarding mentorship and apprenticeship programs, (b) formal and informal off-boarding mentorship programs, (c) formal and informal training programs, (d) using lessons learned during training sessions, (e) communities of practice, (f) technology enabled tools, (g) storytelling, (h) exit interviews, (i) rehiring of retirees as consultants, and (j) knowledge risk assessments. This research contributes to social change by offering strategies to capture the know-how needed to ensure operational continuity in the delivery of safe, reliable, and sustainable power...|$|E

50|$|When the <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers,</b> Royal Engineers (Volunteers) {{was formed}} in 1897, Crompton became Commanding Officer with the rank of Major. He {{designed}} a range of searchlights for military use, ranging from small tripod-mounted types to large fixed designs using his own arc lamp design. Early in the Second Boer War, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell improvised searchlights to deter night attacks during the Siege of Mafeking. Soon afterward Crompton led a detachment of the <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> Volunteers to South Africa where they operated electric searchlights, the first use of such equipment by the Royal Engineers on campaign. The detachment served from April to October 1900 in the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Crompton was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, Mentioned in Dispatches and made a Companion of the Bath for his efforts and was later given the honorary rank of Colonel. Crompton continued as CO of the London Division of the <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> Volunteers, and its successor the London <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers,</b> RE. He retired from the Territorial Force in 1910, but was appointed Honorary Colonel of the London <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers</b> in 1911, and of its successor, 27th (London <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineers)</b> Battalion, RE, in 1923.|$|R
