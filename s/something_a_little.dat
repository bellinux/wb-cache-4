500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different, <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone, {{called the}} video [...] "powerful" [...] and a found [...] "the final crescendo {{reaching}} a breaking point of true sorrow". Chris Payne, from Billboard called the music video [...] "somber". Nicole Sia of Spin praised [...] "the song's visual". According to Lansky of Idolator, [...] "the clip, {{which is basically}} just Mars...sitting and singing at the piano...works". He continued, [...] "While he certainly could have gone for <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more high-concept, the clip’s elegant framing just draws attention to...the song".|$|E

The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write Oklahoma! for 2011?" [...] He has also said that, [...] "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't {{have to worry about}} an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was {{unavailable}} {{to shoot the}} brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew {{they wanted to do}} <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more creative for the scene. They talked to cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school to do all the modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not come in to have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in [...] "Peter".|$|E

The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories like Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence {{on the character of}} Alex.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, and wondered if their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing. Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ("Clenching the Fists of Dissent"), and asked the band questions similar to [...] "Are you sure you don’t want to get into <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more direct?" [...] The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically {{for the remainder of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Heather Phares, Taking Back Sunday [...] "sometimes {{comes off}} as less than distinctive, and the album can sound like a generic soundtrack to generic teenage angst." [...] Phares called Where You Want to Be [...] "definitely a solid album... but crafting <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more unique would take Taking Back Sunday's music that much farther." [...] On Chart Attack, despite the album's being [...] "overwrought" [...] its [...] "quality songwriting and some killer arrangements conceal Where You Want to Bes occasional off-the-chart cheese readings." [...] Although Drowned in Sound writer Mat Hocking expected the album {{to be one of}} the [...] "grittiest, most emotionally driving punk-pop records of the year," [...] it turned out to be [...] "an album that's playing it far too safe: melodies rise and fall, soaring and curving with painful predictability." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, DeLonge claimed {{the album was}} only an attempt to [...] "challenge myself to do different shit": [...] "I did it for myself, whether it sold a million copies or just one, it was for myself." [...] He clarified the band's future succinctly: [...] "There {{are a lot of}} emotions between Mark and I and that's why there’s never going to be another Box Car Racer album. It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more serious and a little more important." ...|$|E

500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought [...] "Bart the Murderer" [...] was season three's first [...] "truly great" [...] episode {{because it}} [...] "starts off strong and gets even better as it moves." [...] Even though he thinks Mafia parodies have been overused, Jacobson thought this one brought [...] "a fresh {{approach}} and remains consistently amusing. A great guest spot from Mantegna helps. It also {{feels like the}} first episode of this season that really moves the series ahead; it seems like <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more incisive than most of what came before it." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN called [...] "Bart the Murderer" [...] his favorite of the season, and praised the episode for its references to The Godfather and MacGyver. The episode's reference to GoodFellas was named the 28th greatest film reference {{in the history of}} the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|The couple's {{marriage}} reflected {{aspects of}} their personalities and courtship. [...] George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note. [...] George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. [...] The couple quarreled often, so much that their grandchildren would later nickname them [...] "the Bickersons". [...] In the end, their closeness {{would allow them to}} settle arguments amicably, often by her finally accepting what he wanted. [...] She still had a restive nature; Mitt later recalled that, [...] "It always seemed that she wanted <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more for herself." [...] (Mitt himself would later show a more reserved, private, and controlled nature than George's, traits he got from Lenore.) ...|$|E
500|$|For the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 {{aspect ratio}} shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight {{sequences}} and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, [...] "Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 {{was a good}} call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [...] going from standing full-size to falling {{through a crack in}} the floor." [...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more weathered." ...|$|E

Due to rapper Trick Daddy's music video for [...] "Sugar (Gimme Some)" [...] already having candy references, 50 Cent said, [...] "we tried to do <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different" [...] and not follow the same route.

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album. BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "I'm sure there's a punkrock reason why we should all get together and hate it, but {{for the life of me}} I just can't. Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics, this is a corker." [...] McAlpine praised the [...] "grand" [...] chorus and wrote: [...] "Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rocks wholesome Disneyfication of popular song might be <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more confessional." ...|$|E

500|$|On November 30, 2009, Montgomery Gentry {{released}} the single [...] "Oughta Be More Songs About That". It {{was to have}} been included on an album titled Freedom, which was to have included a song that the two wrote with Gary Hannan and Phil O'Donnell titled [...] "Freedom Never Goes Out of Style". The label scrapped Freedom and instead chose to release an extended play titled Hits and More: Life Beside a Gravel Road, which would have included past hits and three new songs. Its first single, [...] "While You're Still Young", peaked at number 32 in mid-2010. On September 17, 2010, a day before the extended play's slated release, Montgomery Gentry exited the label, and Hits and More was shelved.

500|$|Review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{gives the}} film {{a rating of}} 80% based on 41 reviews. A number of contemporary critics find it compelling and enjoyable because of its offbeat and bizarre qualities; the BBC summarised: [...] "for those willing to experiment with <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different, a little bit outré, The Rocky Horror Picture Show {{has a lot to}} offer". The New York Times called it a [...] "low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution" [...] and considered the songs featured in the film to be [...] "catchy". Geoff Andrew of Time Out noted that the [...] "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars. Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader on the other hand considered the wit to be [...] "too weak to sustain a film" [...] and thought that the [...] "songs all sound the same".|$|E
500|$|Fleming House {{students}} and alumni quickly began plotting {{for the return}} of the cannon, setting up a command center in a trailer on campus and soliciting donations from alumni. Their initial plan was to use a helicopter to fly the cannon out of the MIT campus.

[...] The students instead decided to surreptitiously steal back the cannon under cover of darkness. [...] On the morning of April 10, about two dozen Fleming students, dressed in their signature red Fleming jerseys, descended upon the cannon to reclaim it and begin its journey back to Pasadena. However, MIT students had been tipped off and were waiting for the Caltech students with a friendly barbecue prepared, and played Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, a forbidden song at Caltech due to its association with final exams, as the Flems entered. The Fleming students left a miniature toy cannon with a note reading, [...] "Here's <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more your size." ...|$|E
