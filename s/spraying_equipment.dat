5|$|No.486 (Maintenance) Squadron was {{established}} at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, on 26August 1946. Commanded by Wing Commander Alexander Abicair, its allocated strength was 257, including ten officers. The unit {{was part of}} No.86 (Transport) Wing, which also controlled Nos.36, 37, and 38 Squadrons, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas, and No.386 (Base) Squadron. No.37 Squadron was disbanded in February 1948 and No.386 Squadron in March 1949. On 22June 1949, No.86 Wing, comprising Nos.36, 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated to the nearby RAAF Station Richmond. No.486 Squadron's role included servicing and replacing engines, and fitting long-range fuel tanks and <b>spraying</b> <b>equipment.</b> It occasionally serviced CAC Wirraways {{in addition to its}} Dakota maintenance tasks.|$|E

25|$|Green Muscle was {{developed}} under the LUBILOSA Programme, which was initiated in 1989 {{in response to}} environmental concerns over the heavy use of chemical insecticides to control locusts and grasshoppers during the 1987-89 plague. The project focused {{on the use of}} beneficial disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens) as biological control agents for grasshoppers and locusts. These insects were considered to be too mobile and to reproduce too fast to be readily controlled by classical biological control. Pathogens have the advantage that many can be produced in artificial culture in large quantities and be used with ordinary <b>spraying</b> <b>equipment.</b> Entomopathogenic fungi were traditionally seen as needing humid conditions to work well. However, the LUBILOSA Programme found a way to avoid this by spraying fungal spores in an oil formulation. Even under desert conditions, Green Muscle can be used to kill locusts and other Acridid pests, such as the Senegalese grasshopper. During recent trials in Algeria and Mauritania (2005 and 2006), various natural enemies, but especially birds, were abundant enough to eliminate treated hopper bands in about a week, because the diseased hoppers became sluggish and easy to catch.|$|E

Aircraft fitted with <b>spraying</b> <b>equipment</b> were given the U prefix as a role modifier, with the most common types being the UC-123B and the UC-123K.

Materials & Methods: This is a descriptive facility based study on 20 spray workers, 11 were females and 9 males. Data was collected through an interview administered questionnaire and records of vector control activities. Results: Most of the spray workers were females 11 (55 %) while 9 (45 %) were males. Nine (45 %) of the spray workers age range between 20 - 30 years. The majority of workers, 91. 9 %(147) had a adequate knowledge regarding the activities related to malaria vector control. 50 %(10) of spray workers had been working 2 - 3 years.
