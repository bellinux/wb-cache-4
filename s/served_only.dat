5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work <b>served</b> <b>only</b> to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context. Erskine's reply opened with a defence {{of the freedom of}} lawyers to represent whichever clients came to them, and followed with an exposition of his views {{on the nature of the}} freedom of the press—arguing that the publication of radical tracts <b>served</b> <b>only</b> to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses, and could not be seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and paved the way for the 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Tyndall {{was convicted}} of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, {{although}} he <b>served</b> <b>only</b> four months before his release. In 1987, the BNP opened discussions with an NF faction, the National Front Support Group (NFSG), to discuss {{the possibility of a}} merger, but the NFSG decided against it, remaining cautious about Tyndall's total domination of the BNP.|$|E

5|$|William Sylvester Taylor (October 10, 1853 – August 2, 1928) was the 33rd Governor of Kentucky. He was {{initially}} declared {{the winner of}} the disputed gubernatorial election of 1899, but the Kentucky General Assembly, dominated by the Democrats, reversed the election results, giving the victory to his Democratic Party (United States) opponent, William Goebel. Taylor <b>served</b> <b>only</b> 50 days as governor.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce <b>served</b> <b>only</b> as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E

After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{was dropped}} from the {{ministry}} but was later elected as the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1937, holding office until the Mair Government lost power in 1941. Weaver then witnessed {{the death of the}} United Australia Party in 1943 and became the leader of the new Democratic Party in 1944. He was then involved in the negotiations to form the future Liberal Party of Australia, which were ultimately successful, with Weaver becoming the first leader of the Liberal Party in April 1945. He <b>served</b> <b>only</b> briefly until dying {{of a heart attack in}} November 1945.|$|E
5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship <b>served</b> <b>only</b> to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E

After {{the end of the}} war, she was ceded to France as a war prize and renamed Colmar. She <b>served</b> <b>only</b> briefly in the French Navy, including a deployment to Asia in 1924. She was stricken in 1927 and broken up two years later.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's wars against {{independence}} guerrilla {{fighters in}} its 400-year-old African territories began in 1961 with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 {{as a result}} of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which <b>served</b> <b>only</b> to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of maintaining {{an air force}} with little funding {{during a time of}} rapid technological development was compounded by the Swiss militia system: all but a handful of military personnel were citizen soldiers who <b>served</b> <b>only</b> a few weeks each year following their initial recruitment phase. Military pilot candidates underwent the same recruit training, NCO school and officer candidate school as other Swiss army officers, followed by a pilot school of 173days, then re-entered civilian life. During his first two years of service, a pilot's training continued with ten logged flight hours per month, and thereafter he was required to fly fifty hours per year at his convenience.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 {{on the site of}} an older, unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating {{part of the}} structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, in which case the licence from Edward III <b>served</b> <b>only</b> to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle was surrounded by a manor which included mills for corn and fulling, lime kilns and coal mines.|$|E
