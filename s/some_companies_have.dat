25|$|In Japan 2 {{business}} schools offer the accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS). The {{concept of an}} MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, <b>some</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> been known to place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent {{the perception of the}} MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.|$|E
25|$|The Drupal core {{search is}} {{ineffective}} at searching content: There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, {{but they are}} not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module. One of the faceted search options is Apache Solr Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, Jetty or Resin. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response <b>some</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> created Apache Solr SaaS products.|$|E

25|$|A tape ball is {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in {{electrical}} tape and is used in playing street cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of tape ball {{that in recent years}} <b>some</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls.

25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, <b>some</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E
