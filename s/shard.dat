5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The {{last line of}} defense for the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline <b>shard</b> in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the <b>shard</b> and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E

40|$|Online social {{networking}} platforms regularly support {{hundreds of millions}} of users, who in aggregate generate substantially more data than can be stored on any single physical server. As such, user data are distributed, or <b>sharded,</b> across many machines. A key requirement in this setting is rapid retrieval not only of a given user’s information, but also of all data associated with his or her social contacts, suggesting that one should consider the topology of the social network in selecting a <b>sharding</b> policy. In this paper we formalize the problem of efficiently <b>sharding</b> large social network databases, and evaluate several <b>sharding</b> strategies, both analytically and empirically. We find that random sharding—the de facto standard—results in provably poor performance even when nodes are replicated to many <b>shards.</b> By contrast, we demonstrate that one can substantially reduce querying costs by identifying and assigning tightly knit communities to <b>shards.</b> In particular, we introduce a scalable <b>sharding</b> algorithm that outperforms both random and location-based <b>sharding</b> schemes. 1...|$|R

She is able to stab him with two shards, but before she can deliver the final blow, she is interrupted by Eckhardt's right-hand man, Karel. Karel kills Eckhardt with the final <b>shard,</b> revealing that he is a Nephilim himself, and had used Eckhardt to ensure the survival of his species. He had also manipulated Lara, in the guise of Bouchard, Luddick and Kurtis, to retrieve the Obscura Paintings. He offers Lara immortality if she will help him complete the task, but Lara experiences a flashback to Von Croy’s murder, and sees that Karel, in Eckhardt's form, was the Monstrum. She refuses, retrieves the Sanglyph from Eckhardt's body, and plants it on the Sleeper, overloading it with energy and causing it to explode, taking Karel with it. In the aftermath, Lara discovers Kurtis' Chirugai blade, which directs her towards Boaz's chamber. Smiling, she heads inside.|$|E

Lara also encounters a captive Bouchard near the crime scene, who reveals Eckhardt's full plan for reviving the Nephilim. Soon after, Lara rediscovers Bouchard dead. With Luddick's assistance, Lara infiltrates the Cabal's headquarters, the Strahov, {{and in the process}} accidentally frees the Proto-Nephilim, the Cabal's unsuccessful attempt to breed a new Nephilim species. Meanwhile, Lara witnesses Eckhardt murder Luddick. She again encounters Kurtis, who locks her in a compartment while he kills the Proto-Nephilim using two Periapt Shards. After an exchange of information, Lara and Kurtis team up to stop Eckhardt assembling the Sanglyph, with Lara retrieving the final Obscura Painting buried deep beneath the Strahov. However, Lara must surrender this painting to save Kurtis, after he is captured by Eckhardt. Kurtis gives Lara his Periapt shards, but she will need a third lost <b>shard</b> to defeat Eckhardt, which Eckhardt has hidden in his laboratory. While Lara flees to track this <b>shard</b> down, Kurtis attempts to hold off an attack from Boaz, the horribly mutated remains of a fallen Cabal member. Kurtis succeeds in killing her, but is severely wounded in the process.|$|E

40|$|Search engine indexes {{for large}} {{document}} collections are often divided into <b>shards</b> that are distributed across multiple computers and searched in parallel to provide rapid interactive search. Typically, all index <b>shards</b> are searched for each query. For organizations with modest computing resources the high query processing {{cost of this}} exhaustive search setup can be a deterrent to working with large collections. This thesis questions the necessity of exhaustive search and investigates distributed selective search as an alternative where only a few <b>shards</b> are searched for each query. For selective search to {{be as effective as}} exhaustive search {{it is important for the}} chosen <b>shards</b> to contain the majority of the relevant documents. Toward this goal, we study three types of document allocation policies that organize the collection into <b>shards</b> using different strategies for concentrating the relevant documents for a particular query into a few <b>shards.</b> Empirical evaluation with three large datasets indicates that topical partitioning of the collection provides the most cost-effective selective search setup. We further develop the best performing allocation policy to control for the distribution of sizes of the constructed <b>shards.</b> The resulting <b>shards</b> exhibit nearly uniform size distribution, and support comparable selective search performance...|$|R

5|$|The fourth book {{chronologically}} in the series, {{although the}} first published, is The Crystal <b>Shard</b> (1988), {{the first in}} The Icewind Dale Trilogy. It describes Drizzt's meeting with the barbarian Wulfgar and the halfling Regis, and their adventures as they stop Akar Kessel, a mage possessed by the sentient artifact Crenshinibon (the book's eponymous Crystal <b>Shard),</b> from gaining control of the region. Streams of Silver (1989), {{tells the story of}} the group as they journey to Mithral Hall, Bruenor's boyhood home. Artemis Entreri, a recurring character in the series, also makes his first appearance. In later books, Artemis is Drizzt's equal in combat, and they clash often due to their conflicting views and goals. In the 1990 book The Halfling's Gem, Artemis kidnaps Regis while in the employ of a powerful crime lord. Drizzt and Wulfgar chase the assassin by sea, with the help of Captain Deudermont, to recover Regis. Drizzt ends up in combat with Artemis Entreri, who leaves the battle wounded. At the end of the book the group finds Regis, and Guenhwyvar kills Artemis's employer.|$|E

5|$|To repair Zulf's {{damage to}} the Bastion, the Kid starts {{collecting}} Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate <b>shard</b> needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion {{had the ability to}} somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last <b>shard.</b> There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.|$|E
40|$|Indexes {{for large}} {{collections}} are often divided into <b>shards</b> that are distributed across multiple computers and searched in parallel to provide rapid interactive search. Typically, all index <b>shards</b> are searched for each query. This paper investigates document allocation policies that permit searching {{only a few}} <b>shards</b> for each query (selective search) without sacrificing search quality. Three types of allocation policies (random, source-based and topic-based) are studied. K-means clustering is used to create topic-based <b>shards.</b> We manage the computational cost of applying these techniques to large datasets by defining topics on {{a subset of the}} collection. Experiments with three large collections demonstrate that selective search using topic-based <b>shards</b> reduces search costs by at least an order of magnitude without reducing search accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Volcaniclastic sediments of {{the active}} Kolbeinsey Ridge, north of Iceland, reflect {{changing}} fragmentation mechanisms due to increasing sea level during the last deglaciation. Glass <b>shards</b> deposited on the western flank of the mid-oceanic ridge before 13. 4 ka are vesicular (20 %- 60 %), whereas <b>shards</b> deposited since 13. 4 ka are mostly vesicle free and of hyaloclastic origin. The vesicle-rich <b>shards</b> display morphology thought to be atypical for submarine eruptions at this depth (400 - 500 m). The environmental conditions during the deposition of these layers (regional ice cover, more than 200 km from the nearest subaerial source) preclude a subaerial origin for these <b>shards.</b> We propose an eruption mechanism in which hot vesiculating bombs from a low-energy eruption are transported upward through the water column by convection. These particles reach their volcanic fragmentation depth (VFD) and undergo secondary fragmentation, creating the vesicle-rich <b>shards</b> recovered near the ridge. Rising sea level {{since the end of}} the last glaciation was sufficient to prevent the erupted particles from reaching the VFD, thus ending the formation of vesicle-rich <b>shards.</b> This model explains the presence of vesicular <b>shards</b> in sediments of mid-oceanic ridges where no subaerial source can be inferred...|$|R
