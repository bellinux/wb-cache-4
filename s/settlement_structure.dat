25|$|Survey {{work has}} many {{benefits}} if performed as a preliminary exercise to, {{or even in}} place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, {{because it does not}} require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ sampling methods.) As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It {{is the only way to}} gather some forms of information, such as settlement patterns and <b>settlement</b> <b>structure.</b> Survey data are commonly assembled into maps, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.|$|E
25|$|The nuclei of the Great Moravian <b>settlement</b> <b>structure</b> were well-defended {{fortified}} settlements {{built by}} the local Slavs both on elevated positions and lowland areas like marshes and river islands. Most Great Moravian castles were rather large hill forts, fortified by wooden palisades, stone walls and in some cases, moats. The typical Great Moravian ramparts combined an outer drystone wall with an internal timber structure filled with earth. The fortifications usually formed several contiguous enclosures, with the elite buildings concentrated in the centre and crafts in the outer enclosures. Most buildings were made of timber, but ecclesiastical buildings and residential dwellings were made of stone. In many cases, prehistoric fortifications were also integrated. The Great Moravian towns, especially in Moravia, {{but also in the}} lowlands of Slovakia, were frequently far from the place where the stone was mined and material was transported dozens of kilometres.|$|E
25|$|Being {{exposed to}} raids from the Ottoman Empire, the <b>settlement</b> <b>structure</b> of Banat {{underwent}} significant changes {{from the beginning}} of the 15th century. The Cseri domain in Temes County included more than 70 villages inhabited by Hungarian or Vlach peasants in the early 15th century, but more than 50 of them had been abandoned by the first decade of the 16th century. Out of the 168 settlements where Catholic parishes were documented in the 14th century, only about 115 survived till the mid-16th century. Most of the surviving villages were inhabited by Serbs. Serbs came to the southern region in five major waves during the reigns of Sigismund and Matthias Corvinus. They settled in the lowlands of Keve, Krassó, Temes and Torontal Counties where Catholic peasants had lived a century earlier, according to papal registers. During Corvinus's reign, thousands of mainly Serbian peasants were granted the status of vojnik ("warrior"). They were exempted of taxes, but they were required to provide military service on the frontier.|$|E

Focussed on the Gallo-Roman era, archaeological explorations were executed at Weinplatz 3/4/5 and Storchengasse 23 (harbour area and thermae), Storchengasse 13 (cultic building) and neighbored Fortunagasse 28/Rennweg 38 (maybe a hostel) and gold jewellery at the Sihlbühl area, Poststrasse/Zentralhof at Münsterhof (probably early medieval graves), {{and the island}} sanctuary (Rundtempel) on the former Grosser Hafner island.|$|R

2500|$|On December 1, 2004, Sharon {{dismissed}} five ministers {{from the}} Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget.

Between August 16 and 30, 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. Once {{it became clear that}} the evictions were definitely going ahead, a group of conservative Rabbis, led by Yosef Dayan, placed an ancient curse on Sharon known as the Pulsa diNura, calling on the Angel of Death to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every <b>settlement</b> <b>structure</b> except for several former synagogues, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on September 11, 2005 and closed the border fence at Kissufim. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate, with more than 80 percent of Israelis backing the plans. On September 27, 2005, Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52–48 percent vote. The move was initiated within the central committee of the governing Likud party by Sharon's main rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, who had left the cabinet to protest Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. The measure was an attempt by Netanyahu to call an early primary in November 2005 to choose the party's leader.|$|E

50|$|A <b>structured</b> <b>settlement</b> is a {{negotiated}} financial or insurance arrangement whereby a claimant agrees {{to resolve a}} personal injury tort claim by receiving {{some part of the}} settlement in the form of periodic payments on an agreed schedule, rather than as a lump sum.
