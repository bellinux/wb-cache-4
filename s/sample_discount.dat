We present a methodology to analyze data from experimental surveys on intertemporal preferences. Focusing on the exponential and the hyperbolic discounting models, we model the experimental data published by Thaler (1981) by means of different specifications. Standard measures of goodness of prediction are then applied to fitted data to select among alternative specifications. We first present our approach by applying it to simulated data. We then present a procedure for statistical estimation of the <b>sample</b> <b>discount</b> rate, testing four specifications. The estimation procedure we adopt can be easily extended to other functional forms, allowing for non-linearity of the valuation function, inclusion of socio-economic individual characteristics as regressors, and different specifications for the discounting model. ...|$|E

Previous research has shown variable restoration success {{in the early years}} of restoration management. In this study we investigated whether restored heather moorland vegetation increasingly resembles long-established moorland vegetation over a longer time period. Vegetation at seven moorland restoration sites (six in northern England and one in Scotland) was sampled in 2003 (to assess short-term restoration success) and 2010 (to assess long-term restoration success). Three of these sites were restored solely by grazing control and four by a suite of more intensive techniques. On each visit, vegetation sampling was carried out in degraded, restored and long-established control areas at each site. Restored vegetation assemblages closely resembled control assemblages. The samples were, though, {{dominated by}} the species targeted for management, Molinia caerulea and Nardus stricta in degraded samples and Calluna vulgaris in control <b>samples.</b> <b>Discounting</b> these species and concentrating on the remainder of the vegetation assemblage, areas restored solely by the reduction or removal or sheep grazing more closely resembled control assemblages whilst those managed more intensively were more intermediate between degraded and control assemblages. There was no systematic pattern of change in restored areas between the sampling dates. At two sites restored samples become more similar to control samples whilst restored samples at other sites either showed little change or moved back towards a degraded assemblage.

In three experiments, {{the strength of a}} causal or dispositional attribution to a target actor (or object) was varied by manipulating the number of observations (i. e., sample size) of an alternative actor (or object).

This effect of <b>sample</b> size on <b>discounting</b> and augmentation cannot be explained by current algebraic attribution models, but is consistent with predictions from a connectionist framework.

Pure discounting lowers the value of all future consumption whereas a lack of imagination will especially lower the value of specific situations that are more difficult to be imagined. So while in general high discount rates are associated with lower investments, the uncertainty related to the transition from school to work is a counteracting force that stimulates high discounters to stay longer in education. Consistent with this we show that on the one hand students with a high discount rate put less effort per time period in their study.

These deposits contain many diatoms which indicate an age corresponding to the Sangamonian Interglacial sensu lato (80, 000 to ca. 220. 000 yr BP). Two of the four samples in this study are associated with the Dorenberg skull or with stratigraphic units which contain bifacial tools. The remaining two samples are from diatomaceous deposits which are also Sangamonian and stratigraphically above the artifact units. These four diatomaceous samples yielded 30 extinct and 143 extant diatom taxa. The ages of the four samples correspond to other diatomaceous samples (some of which are associated with artifacts) from nearby Valsequillo localities. A post-Sangamonian age for these four diatom-bearing <b>samples</b> is <b>discounted</b> by the presence of Navicula bronislrrae and N. dorenbeqi, both of which have short stratigraphic ranges and are known only from the Sangamonian (or its equivalents), and by 13 diatoms which evidently have known long stratigraphic ranges and extinctions {{before the end of the}} Sangamonian.

40|$|Most {{previous}} work on influence maximization in social networks {{is limited to}} the non-adaptive setting in which the marketer is supposed to select all of the seed users, to give free <b>samples</b> or <b>discounts</b> to, up front. A disadvantage of this setting is that the marketer is forced to select all the seeds based solely on a diffusion model. If some of the selected seeds do not perform well, there is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical setting is the adaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and observes how well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product adoptions. Based on this market feedback, she formulates a policy for choosing the remaining seeds. In this paper, we study adaptive offline strategies for two problems: (a) MAXSPREAD [...] given a budget on number of seeds and a time horizon, maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS [...] given a time horizon and an expected number of target users to be influenced, minimize the number of seeds that will be required. In particular, we present theoretical bounds and empirical results for an adaptive strategy and quantify its practical benefit over the non-adaptive strategy. We evaluate adaptive and non-adaptive policies on three real data sets. We conclude that while benefit of going adaptive for the MAXSPREAD problem is modest, adaptive policies lead to significant savings for the MINTSS problem...|$|R

One of the central problems {{in this area is}} the problem of identifying influencers, such that by convincing these users to perform a certain action (like buying a new product), a large number of other users get influenced to follow the action. The client of such an application is essentially a marketer who would target these influencers for marketing a given new product, say by providing free <b>samples</b> or <b>discounts.</b> It is natural that before committing resources for targeting an influencer the marketer would be interested in validating the influence (or network value) of influencers returned. This requires digging deeper into such analytical questions as: who are their followers, on what actions (or products) they are influential, etc. However, the current approaches to identifying influencers largely work as a black box in this respect. The goal {{of this paper is to}} open up the black box, address these questions and provide informative and crisp explanations for validating the network value of influencers. We formulate the problem of providing explanations (called PROXI) as a discrete optimization problem of feature selection. We show that PROXI is not only NP-hard to solve exactly, it is NP-hard to approximate within any reasonable factor. Nevertheless, we show interesting properties of the objective function and develop an intuitive greedy heuristic. We perform detailed experimental analysis on two real world datasets – Twitter and Flixster, and show that our approach is useful in generating concise and insightful explanations of the influence distribution of users and that our greedy algorithm is effective and efficient with respect to several baselines.

ANC is well assessed for the attenuation of Gaussian noise, but {{the rejection of}} non-Gaussian impulsive noise signals represents a much more critical task that may even impair algorithm convergence. To overcome this problem the adaptive filter weight update process must be modified by discarding or <b>discounting</b> <b>samples</b> associated with impulsive noise.

A range of models have been proposed that approximate the shape of the discount curve describing the relationship between subjective value and time.

Nonetheless, many temporal discounting studies in psychiatry, psychology and neuroeconomics still apply single-parameter models, despite their oftentimes poor fit to single-subject data. Previous comparisons of temporal discounting models have either not taken model complexity into account, or have overlooked particular models.

Analyses of previous group and context effects on temporal discounting with the winning model provided additional theoretical insights.

Firstly, it tests for {{the validity of}} the pecking order, the static trade-off and the dynamic trade-off theories in the context of South African manufacturing, mining and retail firms. The study used data from 42 manufacturing, 24 mining and 21 retail firms with complete data for four or more consecutive years during 2000 - 2010 (panel 1) to test {{the validity of the}}se theories. The research hypotheses were formulated and tested using generalised least squares (GLS) random effects, maximum likelihood (ML) random effects, fixed effects, Prais-Winsten regression, Arellano and Bond, Blundell and Bond and the random effects Tobit models. Secondly, the thesis examines the impact of the firm’s key financial performance variables on firm leverage and speed of target adjustment. A panel of 49 manufacturing, 24 mining and 23 retail firms with complete data for two or more consecutive years during the period 2005 - 2010 (panel 2) was constructed and used in this test. The research hypotheses were formulated and tested using the same regression models used in panel 1. Lastly, the thesis examines the existence of the discounted value premium in manufacturing, mining and retail firms listed on the JSE. This study was done using panel of 47 manufacturing, 31 mining and 20 retail firms with complete data for four or more consecutive years during the period 2006 - 2010. A simple t-test was used to evaluate the significance of the <b>sample’s</b> <b>discounted</b> value premium. The study documents that firm growth rate, non-debt tax shields, financial distress, profitability, capital expenditure, asset tangibility, price earnings, ordinary share prices and changes in working capital were significant predictors of firm leverage. Dividend paid, capital expenditure, firm growth rate, profitability, cash flow from operations and economic value added were positively correlated to leverage. Asset tangibility, firm profitability, non-debt tax shields, financial distress, liquidity, price earnings, share price and retention rate were negatively correlated to leverage. Asset tangibility, financial distress, firm growth, non-debt tax shields, and long-term debt repaid were negatively correlated to changes in debt issued, whilst profitability, actual dividend paid, capital expenditure and changes in working capital were positively correlated. These results confirm the complementary nature of the trade-off and pecking order theories. Furthermore, the firms had positive and significant speeds of adjustment. In panel 1, the true speed of adjustment for the sample was 57. 64 % (0. 81 years) for book-to-debt ratio (BDR) and 42. 44 % (1. 25 years) for market-to-debt (MDR). The speed for manufacturing firms was 45. 08 % (1. 16 years) for BDR and 44. 59 % (1. 17 years) for MDR; for mining firms, 72. 07 % (0. 54 years) for BDR and 56. 45 % (0. 83 years) for MDR; and for retail firms, 28. 42 % (2. 07 years) for BDR and 42. 48 % (1. 25 years) for MDR. In panel 2, the true speed of adjustment for the sample was 64. 20 % for book-to-debt ratio (BDR) and 28. 11 % for market-to-debt ratio (MDR). The true speed for manufacturing firms was 34. 42 % for BDR and 30. 56 % for MDR; for mining firms, 69. 59 % for BDR and 45. 77 % for MDR; and for retail firms, 9. 34 % for BDR. These results confirm the validity of the dynamic trade-off theory. Finally, manufacturing, mining and retail firms had a positive discounted value premium. This ranged from 5. 16 % to 9. 48 % (on perpetual growth), with mining firms having the largest (9. 48 %), followed by manufacturing (8. 54 %) and retail firms (5. 16 %). Of the observations for the full sample, 92. 23 % showed a positive discounted value premium. This evidence on the speed of adjustment and discounted value premium suggests the existence of a target capital structure different from the theoretical optimal capital structure hypothesised by the static trade-off theory.

40|$|Social {{networks}} have been popular platforms for information propagation. An important use case is viral marketing: given a promotion budget, an advertiser can choose some influential users as the seed set and provide them free or <b>discounted</b> <b>sample</b> products; in this way, the advertiser hopes {{to increase the}} popularity of the product in the users' friend circles by the world-of-mouth effect, and thus maximizes the number of users that information of the production can reach. There has been a body of literature studying the influence maximization problem. Nevertheless, the existing studies mostly investigate the problem on a one-off basis, assuming fixed known influence probabilities among users, or the knowledge of the exact social network topology. In practice, the social network topology and the influence probabilities are typically unknown to the advertiser, which can be varying over time, i. e., in cases of newly established, strengthened or weakened social ties. In this paper, we focus on a dynamic non-stationary social network and design a randomized algorithm, RSB, based on multi-armed bandit optimization, to maximize influence propagation over time. The algorithm produces a sequence of online decisions and calibrates its explore-exploit strategy utilizing outcomes of previous decisions. It is rigorously proven to achieve an upper-bounded regret in reward and applicable to large-scale social networks. Practical effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms previous stationary methods under non-stationary conditions. postprin...|$|R

Such programs are usually based on scenario generation model about future environment developments. In the present paper, the scenario model is {{developed for the}} case when enough data paths can be generated, but due to solvability of stochastic program the scenario tree has to be constructed. The proposed strategy is to generate multistage scenario tree from the set of individual scenarios by bundling scenarios based on cluster analysis. The K-means clustering approach is modified to capture the interstage dependencies. Such generation of scenario tree {{can be useful in}} cases when it is difficult to construct the adequate scenario tree from the stochastic differential equations or time-series models, and the sampled paths can be obtained by sampling or resampling techniques. While generating the initial fan of individual scenarios, the copula is employed for modeling the dependence between stochastic variables in a multivariate structure. It allows to model nonlinear dependencies between non-elliptically distributed stochastic variables. While investigating the copula effect on the scenario tree structure, we will try to answer the question: does the copula features are captured in the approximate representation of uncertainty in the form of scenario tree.

In this paper, the phylogenetic history of 28 Rhagoletis species and 6 species in related tephritid genera is inferred from nucleotide sequences of subunit II of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COII) gene and the adjacent tRNALeu/COII intergenic region. Analyses of the data using distance and character-state ap-proaches suggest the following: (i) the genus Rhagole-tis as currently defined is not monophyletic; (ii) the 5 predominantly North American Rhagoletis species groups do constitute a monophyletic assemblage; (iii) the North American species groups form 2 clades, 1 consisting of taxa in theR. pomonella andR. tabellaria species groups (plus R. fausta), and the other consist-ing of taxa in the R. ribicola, R. cingulata, and R. suavis species groups; and (iv) the origin(s) of the North American species groups is obscure, as evi-denced by the recovery of clades containing both Palearctic and Neotropical taxa. Areas of congruence and conflict with published phylogenies of Rhagoletis are examined and, while many areas of conflict may be due to an insufficient number of characters or incom-plete taxon <b>sampling,</b> we cannot <b>discount</b> the possibil-ity that real differences exist between the Rhagoletis mitochondrial DNA gene tree and the Rhagoletis spe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the results of a survey based on {{conjoint}} choice experiments that was specifically designed to investigate the effect of context on the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL), an important input into the calculation of the mortality benefits of environmental policies that reduce premature mortality. We define “context” broadly to include i) the cause of death (respiratory illness, cancer, road traffic accident), ii) the beneficiary of the risk reduction (adult v. child), and iii) the mode of provision of the risk reduction (public program v. private good). The survey was conducted following similar protocols in Italy and the Czech Republic. When do not distinguish for the cause of death, child and adult VSL are not significantly different from one another in Italy, and the difference is weak in the Czech sample. When we distinguish for the cause of death, we find that child and adult VSLs are different at the 1 % level for respiratory illnesses and road-traffic accidents, but do not differ for cancer risks. We find evidence of a “cancer premium” and a “public program premium. ” In both countries, the marginal utility of income is about 20 % lower among wealthier people, which makes the VSL about 20 % higher among respondents with incomes above the <b>sample</b> average. The <b>discount</b> rate implicit in people‘s choices is effectively zero. We conclude that there is heterogeneity in the VSL, and that such heterogeneity is primarily driven by risk characteristics and mode of delivery of the risk reduction, rather than by individual characteristics of the respondent (e. g., income and education). For the most part, our results do not disagree with environmental policy analyses that use the same VSL for children and adults, and that apply a cancer premium.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that acquiring {{a private company}} is an attractive option for maximizing shareholder wealth. This thesis aims {{to contribute to the}} existing literature by providing empirical evidence about private company M&A transactions from the acquiring company's management perspective. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis is to examine how an industrial acquirer, Company X, has divided its expected synergistic gains between the target shareholders and what are the factors that affect this division. The data utilized in this study comes from internal databases of Company X. The sample includes 168 initiated acquisition processes, of which 133 were successful and 35 unsuccessful. The acquisition processes were initiated between 2006 and early 2013, while the acquisition targets were privately held, relatively small and located in 36 countries in total. The data was manually gathered {{for the purposes of this}} study from confidential documents including valuation materials, legal contracts, and reports to the executive management team of Company X containing the rationale of the deal and the basis for managerial decision making. By allowing access to these highly secret documents, Company X has provided a unique window into the complex price setting mechanisms behind the M&A transactions. I find that most of the gains resulting from the transactions accrue to the acquirer, Company X. Moreover, on average, Company X has been able to acquire the targets in the <b>sample</b> with a <b>discount</b> relative to their estimated stand-alone value. The results suggest that target's size seems to be the dominant factor in determining the price level relative to the estimated stand-alone value; companies with the highest revenues and estimated total value are associated with lower discounts and the smallest companies with the largest discounts. My analysis further reveals that the wealth effects to targets are comparable when there are multiple competing bidders trying to acquire the target and in situations when competition seems largely absent. Namely, when controlled for the size effects, auctions do not seem to provide higher returns for target shareholders than one-on-one negotiations. The evidence is consistent with the view that the choice of an auction or a negotiation in a particular takeover reflects a trade-off between competition and information costs (French and McCormick, 1984; Hansen, 2001). To an extent, the evidence is also consistent with the argument that it is not the actual observed competition that affects the price offered to the target shareholders, but rather the anticipated competition; it is the existence of potential competitors that drive Company X toward more competitive actions...|$|R
