5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E
25|$|In a small <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> {{operating}} at its rated currents, the voltage drop is about 0.6 to 0.7 volts. The value is different for other diode types—Schottky diodes can be rated {{as low as}} 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{locomotives}} incorporate traction inverters, AC to DC, {{with the}} capability to deliver 1,200 volts (earlier traction generators, DC to DC, had {{the capability to}} deliver only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> technology. With the capability to deliver 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the necessity for [...] "transition" [...] was eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{substantially}} lower forward voltage (0.3V versus 0.7V for <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes)</b> germanium diodes have an inherent advantage over <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes,</b> especially in circuits like full-wave bridge rectifiers which result in 2X voltage drop because the current must pass through two diodes.|$|R
25|$|In {{the modern}} world, <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> {{are the most}} widely used {{rectifiers}} for lower voltages and powers, and have largely replaced earlier germanium diodes. For very high voltages and powers, the added need for controllability has in practice led to replacing simple <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> with high-power thyristors (see below) and their newer actively gate-controlled cousins.|$|R

2500|$|Normal (p–n) diodes, which {{operate as}} {{described}} above, are usually made of doped silicon or, more rarely, germanium. Before {{the development of}} silicon power rectifier diodes, cuprous oxide and later selenium was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7V per [...] "cell", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often {{an extension of the}} diode's metal substrate), much larger than the later <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p–n diodes found in CMOS integrated circuits, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.|$|E

50|$|If a DC {{output is}} required, the AC output from the {{transformer}} is rectified. For output voltages above ten volts or so, ordinary <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> {{are commonly used}}. For lower voltages, Schottky diodes are commonly used as the rectifier elements; they have the advantages of faster recovery times than <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> (allowing low-loss operation at higher frequencies) and a lower voltage drop when conducting. For even lower output voltages, MOSFETs {{may be used as}} synchronous rectifiers; compared to Schottky diodes, these have even lower conducting state voltage drops.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 W.T. Read and Ralph L. Johnston of Bell Laboratories {{proposed}} that an avalanche diode that exhibited significant transit time delay might exhibit a negative resistance characteristic. The effect was soon demonstrated in ordinary <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> {{and by the}} late 1960s oscillators at 340 GHz had been produced. <b>Silicon</b> IMPATT <b>diodes</b> can produce up to 3 kilowatts of power continuously, with higher power available in pulses.|$|R

50|$|This {{machinery}} {{was undoubtedly}} successful; its efficiency {{was determined to}} be 97.25%. Contact life was never fully determined but considerably exceeded 2000 hours. However, the rapid development of the <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> made it ultimately redundant.|$|E

The system includes a thin film resistor acting as heater and thin film hydrogenated amorphous <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> acting as temperature sensors. An electronic system controls the lab-on-chip temperature through a Proportional-IntegralDerivative algorithm. In particular, an electronic board infers the system temperature measuring the voltage across the amorphous <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> and drives the heater to achieve the set-point temperature. Taking into account the 16 -bit ADC resolution and the sensors sensitivity, which is around 3. 6 mV/C, we estimate that our system is able to detect temperature variation as low as 3. 5 · 10 - 3 C...|$|R
5000|$|The {{available}} power for traction is [...] - produced at 600 V AC, and is rectified to DC through {{two groups of}} 30 <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes,</b> and eventually supplies six nose suspended traction motors which drive the wheels via a pinion gear {{at a ratio of}} 59:18.|$|R
40|$|During {{the initial}} {{deuterium-tritium}} experiments on TFTR, neutron emission {{was measured with}} {sup 235 }U and {sup 238 }U fission chambers, <b>silicon</b> surface barrier <b>diodes,</b> spatially collimated {sup 4 }He proportional counters and ZnS scintillators, {{and a variety of}} elemental activation foils. The activation foils, {sup 4 }He counters and <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes</b> can discriminate between 14 MeV and 2. 5 MeV neutrons. The other detectors respond to both DD and DT neutrons but are more sensitive to the latter. The proportional counters, scintillators, and some of the fission chambers were calibrated absolutely, using a 14 -MeV neutron generator positioned at numerous locations inside the TFTR vacuum vessel. Although the directly calibrated systems were saturated during the highest power deuterium-tritium operation, they allowed cross-calibration of less sensitive fission chambers and <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes.</b> The estimated absolute accuracy of the uncertainty-weighted mean of these cross-calibrations, combined with an independent calibration derived from activation foil determinations of total neutron yield, is {plus_minus} 7 %...|$|R
50|$|For {{cryogenic}} {{temperature measurement}} down to 30K, PT-100 sensor (resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)) is used, and for lower than 30K it {{is required to}} use <b>Silicon</b> <b>Diode</b> for accuracy. There are also other cryogenic detectors which are used to detect Cryogenic particles.|$|E
50|$|The {{traction}} alternator usually incorporates integral <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> rectifiers {{to provide}} the traction motors with up to 1200 volts DC (DC traction, which is used directly) or the common inverter bus (AC traction, which is first inverted from dc to three-phase ac).|$|E

5000|$|Some {{instrument}} tube amplifier designs use {{a vacuum}} tube rectifier instead of <b>silicon</b> <b>diodes,</b> and some designs offer {{the choice of}} both rectifiers via a switch.

Noise was reduced by sprayed asbestos on the floor, body and roof.|$|R
50|$|When {{sufficient}} {{forward voltage}} is applied, a current flows {{in the forward}} direction. A <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> has a typical forward voltage of 600-700 mV, while the Schottky's forward voltage is 150 - 450 mV. This lower forward voltage requirement allows higher switching speeds and better system efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{regulated}} supplies mostly use a transformer, <b>silicon</b> <b>diode</b> bridge recitfier, {{reservoir capacitor}} and voltage regulator IC.

50|$|A digicon {{detector}} is a spatially resolved {{light detector}} using the photoelectric effect directly.
