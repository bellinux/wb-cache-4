As the name suggests, the main visual differences are the five-bearded rockling having five barbels around its mouth, whereas the three-bearded rockling has a significant redness to its brown colouring {{when compared to the}} <b>shore</b> <b>rockling.</b> Shore rocklings live in and around rocky areas throughout the English Channel, feeding on both worms and crustaceans. Other than in the English Channel, they are also found in the Atlantic (Europe) and Mediterranean.|$|E
