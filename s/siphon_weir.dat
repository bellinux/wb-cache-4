5|$|Woolston <b>Siphon</b> <b>Weir,</b> {{built in}} 1994 to replace an earlier {{structure}} and located on an extant {{section of the}} Mersey near Latchford, controls {{the amount of water}} in the Latchford Pond by emptying canal water into the Mersey. Howley Weir controls water levels downstream of Woolston Weir. Further upstream, Woolston Guard Weir enables maintenance to be carried out on both.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, the wet/dry filter may {{be placed}} below the tank. In this design, water is fed by gravity to the filter below the aquarium. Prefiltered water is {{delivered}} to a perforated plate (drip plate). Prefiltering may {{take place in}} the aquarium via a foam block or sleeve in the overflow, or <b>weir</b> <b>siphon,</b> or it may be prefiltered by filter wool resting on the perforated plate. The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over the drip plate, and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or [...] "Double Layer Spiral") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO2 is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump.|$|R
