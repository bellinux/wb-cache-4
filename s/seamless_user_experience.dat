The relay architectures defined in IEEE 802. 16 m and 3 GPP LTE-Advanced are optimized only for nonmobile relay, i. e., the Relay Station is attached to a designated Base Station and becomes a part of the fixed access network. A mobile relay architecture, where relay may switch attached BS according to operation demand, will promise more resilient relay deployment. In this paper, we first highlight three use cases where mobile relays can offer useful deployment options. Next, we propose an enhanced handover mechanism for relay-based group mobility by extending the IEEE 802. 16 m specification on relay. To this end, we describe the handover architecture for mobile relay highlighting the C-plane and U-plane enhancements required in order to support group mobility of mobile stations.

While frequent updates providing higher user satisfaction/retention are naturally more desirable than sparse updates, the steadily escalating resource costs are a significant bottleneck. We thus propose extensions to the traditional periodic refresh model based on an adaptive smart sync approach that enables variable rate updates closely modeling expected user behavior over time. An experimental evaluation on a sizeable subset of users of the GMAIL web interface further indicates that the proposed refresh policy can achieve {{the best of both}} worlds- limited resource provisioning and minimal user-perceived delays.

System complements user privacy even more by accepting the segregation and distinction among the different identity contexts such as personal, social and corporate identity. Authorization is provided through role based access control model that implements access control policies considering user roles. The Identity Federation mechanism is ensured via distributed storage and computation mechanism, which distributes the identifying information across multiple locations, for instance partial user credentials are held in the network storage area, whereas the other half is stored at the user’s mobile device (SIM card).
