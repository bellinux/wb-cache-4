40|$|Abstract. The {{additive}} {{structure of}} multiplicative semigroup Zpk = Z(·) mod pk is analysed for prime p> 2. Order (p − 1) pk− 1 of cyclic group Gk of units mod pk implies product Gk ≡ AkBk, with cyclic ’core ’ Ak of order p− 1 <b>so</b> <b>np</b> ≡ n for core elements, and ’extension subgroup ’ Bk of order p k− 1 consisting of all units n ≡ 1 mod p, generated by p+ 1. The p-th power residues np mod pk in Gk form an order |Gk|/p subgroup Fk, with |Fk|/|Ak | = pk− 2, so Fk properly contains core Ak for k ≥ 3. The additive structure of subgroups Ak, Fk and Gk is derived by successor function S(n) = n+ 1, and {{by considering the}} two arithmetic symmetries C(n) = −n and I(n) = n− 1 as functions, with commuting IC = CI, where S does not commute with I nor C. The four distinct compositions SCI, CIS, CSI, ISC all have period 3 upon iteration. This yields a triplet structure in Gk of three inverse pairs (ni, n − 1 i) with ni + 1 ≡ −(ni+ 1) − 1 for i = 0, 1, 2 where n 0 · n 1 · n 2 ≡ 1 mod pk, generalizing the cubic root solution n+ 1 ≡ −n− 1 ≡ −n 2 mod pk (p ≡ 1 mod 6).

40|$|The {{pivotal role}} of {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in cellular metabolic processes justifies the interest in nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) as an attractive target for the rational design of new drugs. NMNAT is an indispensable enzyme in both de novo and salvage pathways of NAD or deamido-NAD (NaAD) biosynthesis. Significant differences between bacterial and human enzymes in both substrate specificity and active site conformations have been described {{that might lead to}} the rational design of highly selective chemotherapic agents. Therefore, the specific aim of my research was the identification of molecular ligands which could act as selective inhibitors of NMNAT from specific species, useful for the biological characterization of the enzymes and the discovery of new drugs. With this purpose in view, two dinucleoside polyphosphate NAD analogs, having a polyphosphate linker between the nicotinamide riboside function and adenosine (Np 3 AD and Np 4 AD), that should mimic the structure of the hypothetical transition state of the reaction catalyzed by NMNAT, were prepared. Interestingly, both dinucleosides polyphosphates and, in particular Np 4 AD, exerted a different inhibitory effect toward the bacterial enzyme with respect to eukaryotic NMNAT. <b>So,</b> <b>Np</b> 4 AD might represent the first lead compound for the development of novel potent and selective bacterial NMNAT inhibitors. Another part of the research was addressed to the synthesis of β-nicotinamide and nicotinic acid ribosides (β-NAR and β-NaR, respectively) in order to investigate the subdomain of NMNAT that binds the substrates nicotinic mononucleotides (NMN/NaMN). Nicotinamide riboside is an intermediate in one biosynthetic pathway by which nicotinamide is converted into NAD. It is known that kinetic and structural studies of both bacterial and human NMNAT require the β-anomer of nicotinic ribosides as substrates and of monoribotides as products of the NAD degradation pathways. -NAR and its nicotinic acid analog (-NaR) were obtained in high yields by a stereoselective synthesis via glycosylation of the presilylated bases under Vorbruggen’s protocol and controlled conditions. In order to obtain novel NAD analogs as substrate/inhibitors of key enzymes involved in the nucleotide biosynthesis, a β-NAR analog, methylated in 3 -position of the ribofuranose moiety, was also synthesised. Novel potential inhibitors of NMNAT from different sources were also developed as product analogs of the enzymatic reaction. Recently, three distinct human NMNAT isoforms, named hNMNAT- 1, hNMNAT- 2, and hNMNAT- 3, have been characterized. The tissue distribution pattern of the human isoenzymes is different, suggesting that their expression is differentially controlled at transcription level. Thus, each isoenzyme may have a distinct cellular and physiological role; however, several questions remain to clarify and characterize the specific roles of these isoenzymes in NAD metabolism and regulation. In this respect, the proposed study combines efforts directed toward the design and synthesis of mechanism-based enzyme-inhibitors, with biochemical studies on targeted enzymes to better understand the biological function of the human NMNAT isoforms and define their suitability as specific targets for drug development. With this in view, a NAD analog and its deamido derivative were synthesized in which the adenylyl part of the dinucleotides was modified at the C 2 ’ position of the furanose ring by introduction of a methyl group (N 2 ’-MeAD and Na 2 ’-MeAD, respectively). The effect of the dinucleotides on the enzymatic activity of NMNAT resulted in a selective inhibition of the human enzyme with respect to the archeal enzyme, suggesting that the modification in the ribose moiety of NAD, which induces a stabilization of the North(3 T 2) -anti conformation, as detected for both N 2 ’-MeAD and Na 2 ’-MeAD, proved to be favourable to the binding at human enzymes. N 2 ’-MeAD showed a significant competitive inhibitory activity toward the hNMNAT- 2, but no activity toward the hNMNAT- 1 isoform. Surprisingly, the deamido dinucleotide Na 2 ’-MeAD resulted a non-competitive inhibitor of hNMNAT- 2 and a selective competitive inhibitor of hNMNAT- 3 isoform. A molecular modeling study was also carried out starting from the recently solved structures of NAD/NaAD-bound hNMNAT- 1 and hNMNAT- 3 complexes. Compared with these complexes, the N 2 ’-MeAD/Na 2 ’-MeAD-bound showed conformational changes in the binding sites of both hNMNAT- 1 and hNMNAT- 3 induced by the modified adenylyl part of the dinucleotides. The inhibitory effect of the modified NAD analogs toward the human enzymes might be helpful for the rational design of molecules potentially useful as new chemotherapic agents...|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have been}} able to show that {{effective}} and selective GCPII inhibitors are able to decrease the brain's levels of glutamate and even provide protection from apoptosis or degradation of brain neurons in many animal models of stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropathic pain. This inhibition of these NAAG peptidases, sometimes referred to as NPs, are thought to provide this protection from apoptosis or degradation of brain neurons by elevating the concentrations of NAAG within the synapse of neurons. NAAG then reduces the release of glutamate while stimulating the release of some trophic factors from the glia cells in the central nervous system, resulting in the protection from apoptosis or degradation of brain neurons. It is important to note, however, that these NP inhibitors do not seem to have any effect on normal glutamate function. The NP inhibition is able to improve the naturally occurring regulation instead of activating or inhibiting receptors that would disrupt this process. Research has also shown that small-molecule-based NP inhibitors are beneficial in animal models that are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. Some specific applications of this research include neuropathic and inflammatory pain, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, schizophrenia, diabetic neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as drug addiction. Previous research has found that drugs that are able to reduce glutamate transmission can relieve the neuropathic pain, although the resultant side-effects have limited a great deal of their clinical applications. Therefore, it appears that, since GCPII is exclusively recruited for the purpose of providing a glutamate source in hyperglutamatergic and excitotoxic conditions, this could be an alternative to avert these side-effects. More research findings have shown that the hydrolysis of NAAG is disrupted in schizophrenia, and they have shown that specific anatomical regions of the brain may even show discrete abnormalities in the GCP II synthesis, <b>so</b> <b>NPs</b> may also be therapeutic for patients suffering with schizophrenia. One major hurdle with using many of the potent GCPII inhibitors that have been prepared to date are typically highly polar compounds, which causes problems because they do not then penetrate the blood-brain barrier easily.|$|R

For example, proteins in the blood or cell culture medium can adsorb onto the NP surface, increasing NP size by as much as a factor of two [7, 8], altering the surface charge [7 – 9], and under different conditions either preventing [10, 11] or facilitating [12, 13] inter-particle aggregation. These new surface and structural properties can consequently determine which cell types NPs are targeted to [14], the extent of cellular uptake [15 – 19], and where NPs localize within cells [7, 16].

Interestingly, from the change of absorption spectrum as a function of reaction time, we observed that the characteristic absorption peak of Ag NPs shows no peak position shift in a quite long time without extra stabilizer while red-shift and broaden after continuous reaction. To explain this phenomenon, we further proposed a growth mechanism that CO, which is generated from reduction of functional groups on GO, adsorbed on the surface of Ag NPs and leaded to growth cease of Ag NPs into a narrow size distribution during the reduction of GO. Meanwhile, Ag NPs can catalyze the oxidation of adsorbed-CO to CO 2 in the presence of O- 2 which can easily desorb from Ag surfaces. Hence, after fully removal of functional groups on GO, continuous supply of CO was cutoff while the desorption of adsorbed-CO was still happening continually, <b>so</b> Ag <b>NPs</b> start to gradually grow and resulting in aggregation. Moreover, the dosage of less DMAc or more AgNO 3 would cause the anisotropic growth and form multiply twinned structure of Ag NPs. Our study presents a useful understanding on the growth of Ag NPs on graphene...|$|R

Watering resulted in continuing CaCO 3 accumulation in the soils. TC and TN to 160 cm depth increased rapidly over the first 50 years (120 g C m− 2 a− 1 and 9. 7 g N m− 2 a− 1), then the increases slowed. In contrast, TP continued to accumulate steadily (4. 8 g P m− 2 a− 1). AtU 0, TP to 160 cm depth was very small (= 88 mg kg− 1) and dominated by Ca-P with OP as a minor component. At U 10, OP and Ca-P were in equal proportions. The latter acquired increasing dominance with increasing period of treatment whereas OP reached a steady state. NP increased at a rate which decreased with time. It is likely that most of OP compounds have been leached down the profile where mineralization and subsequent immobilization, probably by Ca 2 + ions from irrigation waters, have occurred...|$|R
40|$|Negative priming (NP) {{refers to}} the finding that people's {{responses}} to probe targets previously presented as prime distractors are usually slower and more error prone than to unrepeated stimuli. In a typical NP experiment, each probe target {{is accompanied by a}} distractor. It is an accepted, albeit puzzling, finding that the NP effect depends on the presence of these probe distractors; for, without probe distractors, NP diminishes. This phenomenon causes severe problems for the majority of theoretical accounts of NP. In the present study, we follow a simple argument, namely that without probe distractors, the difficulty of responding to the probe is <b>so</b> low that <b>NP</b> becomes irrelevant. Hence, by increasing perceptual processing difficulty, as well as by increasing conceptual processing difficulty, significant NP effects with constantly absent probe distractors can be reliably observed. In addition, our results also show that NP without probe distractors can be found by exclusively manipulating probe display processing. This finding furthers our understanding of the processes causing NP...|$|R
