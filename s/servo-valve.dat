50|$|As {{development}} of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting over 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. The first of which was TLAC, for Top Loading Air Cleaner. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life. Its top loading configuration also made it easier to service. Next came the AOS meaning Add-On Stabilization that was introduced in late 1972. As its name implies, this was an add on stabilizer kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. It was made up of several components: the rate sensor package, a control selector box, the electronics package, a shut-off valve, the traverse <b>servo-valve</b> assembly, the elevation <b>servo-valve</b> assembly, the handle shaping assembly, an hydraulic filter, and an antibacklash cylinder. At short to medium ranges, hit probabilities better than 50% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1(AOS) was the designation received by M60s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the new T142 steel track, which had replaceable rubber pads and improved service life.|$|E

Although rollovers are relatively rare events, they are usually deadly accidents when they occur. The roll stability loss is {{the main cause of}} rollover accidents in which heavy vehicles are involved. In order to improve the roll stability, most of modern heavy vehicles are equipped with passive anti-roll bars to reduce roll motion during cornering or riding on uneven roads. However these may be not sufficient to overcome critical situations. This paper introduces the active anti-roll bars made of four electronic <b>servo-valve</b> hydraulic actuators, which are modelled and integrated in a yaw-roll model of a single unit heavy vehicle. The control signal is the current entering the electronic <b>servo-valve</b> and the output is the force generated by the hydraulic actuator.

A comparison of several LQR controllers is provided to allow for tackling the considered multi-objective problems.

Active and semi-active solutions are adopted when there is particular interest in varying the damping response of the shock absorbers for vehicle handling and comfort. To this end, electro-hydrostatic actuation (EHA) devices represent a promising alternative in active vibration control. In these systems, an electric motor is employed to drive a fixed-displacement hydraulic pump. The flow generated by the pump is then conduced into a hydraulic piston {{that acts as a}} conventional damper. The use of a motor as a primary actuation device eases the control task and offers a large output bandwidth.
