Systematic <b>staff</b> <b>appraisal</b> or performancemanagement <b>procedures</b> are generally assumed to comprise {{an important part of}} quality management and development in higher education institutions. Past approaches to such appraisal and performance management in higher education have had limited and confused purposes and their contribution to enhanced institu-tional performance and quality hasbeen minimal. In some cases, the impact hasbeen negative. For performance management to be relevant to the management and development of quality in the 21 st century, the spotlight will need to fall on the manner in which organisational units are managed and led, and on the nurturing of teams, rather than the management of individual performance. A shift in emphasis from management to leadership will be required such that performance manage-ment becomes a central element in the leadership of change and the provision of transformational leadership...|$|R

Sports participation is all over the world.

Anders Larsson and Åsalill Olsson Performance appraisals have been given a central role in leading businesses in the public sector and are seen as a tool to create development opportunities and achieve better results. This has resulted that performance appraisal in many organizations takes up capacity and time. This was the starting point of our interest to study whether the time spent on performance appraisals effectively pays for itself in the organization, in other words whether the effects expected actually are achieved. The paper examines first line managers` views on <b>staff</b> <b>appraisal</b> purposes and effects of a function within the Landstinget. The survey design, methodology and transaction are of qualitative and quantitative method with three different sources: literature review of previous research, interviews with first line managers in Landstinget Västmanland and the results from an employee satisfaction survey conducted on behalf of Landstinget Västmanland.
