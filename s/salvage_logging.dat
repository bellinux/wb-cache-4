5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from <b>salvage</b> <b>logging,</b> such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by <b>salvage</b> <b>logging.</b> However, some environmental groups endorsed the <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> plan.|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 2014, Stanislaus Forest {{supervisor}} Susan Skalski {{signed a}} Record of Decision approving the Rim Fire Recovery Project. The plan allowed logging within {{an area of}} , including interior portions of the burned area and along roadways. Its goals were to: [...] "Salvage dead trees to capture economic value; remove roadside hazard trees to protect public and worker safety; reduce fuels for future forest resiliency; improve roads for hydrologic function; and, enhance wildlife habitat. A portion of the money captured from the <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> was ear-marked for additional projects following the fire." [...] The plan attempted to balance competing interests. Instead of the 660 million board feet initially proposed for logging, the final plan included <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> of 210 million board feet. The plan left small areas untouched as snag habitat for Black-Backed Woodpeckers and other snag-dependent wildlife. Instead of building permanent new roads, the plan eliminated permanent new road construction and reduced the mileage of temporary roads {{as part of the}} <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> plan. The Forest Service said that the final plan reflected a collaboration between the timber industry and various environmental groups, who had joined together in an attempt to find consensus on the recovery process. Skalski cited that collaborative agreement as being influential in her decision to significantly reduce the amount of salvage material. Forestry officials praised the plan, but some environmental groups denounced it.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} year post fire, species {{richness}} was significantly lower on high severity burns than on unburned, low, or moderate severity plots, {{regardless of whether they}} were <b>salvage</b> <b>logged</b> or not (P < 0.001) (Table 3). In the second, third, fourth, and sixth years post fire, species richness did not differ significantly on plots burned with high, moderate, and low severity that were not <b>salvage</b> <b>logged</b> (P > 0.05); species richness increased significantly between the first post-fire year and the sixth post-fire year on both <b>salvage</b> <b>logged</b> and not <b>salvage</b> <b>logged</b> plots (Figure 2). Of plots that were <b>salvage</b> <b>logged,</b> species richness was lower in the fourth post-fire year in high severity burned plots than in either low or moderate burn severity plots (P = 0.002). Species richness was higher on the seeded and unseeded high severity plots that were not <b>salvage</b> <b>logged</b> than on the salvage-logged counterparts (P = 0.03 and < 0.001, respectively) (Table 3).|$|R
5000|$|A related form of <b>logging</b> {{consists}} of <b>salvaging</b> <b>logs</b> which loggers have abandoned after they became waterlogged and sank.

2500|$|In 2005, the Forest Service {{approved}} {{a plan for}} <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> on [...] burned by the B Complex Fires. The plan allowed commercial loggers to harvest trees killed by the fire. There was some criticism of the plan; however, the Forest Service determined that in the specific areas identified for post-fire timber harvest, the prescribed operations would utilize valuable timber assets, prevent the build-up of light fuels in burned areas, and help prevent soil degradation by encouraging rapid reforestation.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the primary}} {{motivation}} of <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> is economic, {{it has also}} been suggested that <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> may reduce erosion, reduce intensity of future wildfires, and slow buildup of pest insects.

50|$|In the United States, <b>salvage</b> <b>logging</b> is a {{controversial}} issue for two main reasons.

30|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} describing the often negative effects of timber harvest or fragmentation by forest roads on amphibian populations and habitats (e.g., Marsh and Beckman 2004, Karraker and Welsh 2006, Semlitsch et al. 2009), but to our knowledge, no studies have explicitly measured the combined effects of wildfire and timber harvest. Research on synergies between wildfire and disturbances will be especially important in areas that have been harvested after wildfire because characteristics of forests that have been <b>salvaged</b> <b>logged</b> (e.g., reduced recruitment of large wood, increased soil heating; Lindenmayer and Noss 2006) suggest that the combined effect of wildfire and harvest could be more harmful to forest amphibians than either factor alone. Negative interactive effects of wildfire and timber harvest or fragmentation may be more likely for isolated populations, where there are greater physiological costs of dispersal and reduced likelihood of rescue from neighboring populations.|$|R

40|$|Compound {{disturbances}} {{occur when}} multiple disturbances happen in rapid succession, and {{may result in}} changes to ecosystem recovery processes. Activities performed by management agencies,such as salvage-logging, following severe disturbances may act as a compound disturbance by altering the ecosystem’s recovery mechanisms. The site of the present study, located in Routt National Forest, Colorado, sustained a catastrophic blowdown event that impacted over 10, 000 ha in 1997 and was partially <b>salvage</b> - <b>logged</b> between 1998 and 2001. The present study evaluates the interacting effects of these two disturbance events on soil characteristics, seedling regeneration, growth and density, and any changes to community composition. These measurements were recorded within ten heavily wind-damaged Picea-Abies stands, ten <b>salvage</b> - <b>logged</b> blowdown stands, and ten intact control stands. While soil characteristic results suggest a long-term significant difference between treatments, trends initially observed post disturbance generally diminished over time. Similarly, regeneration characteristics were significantly different between treatments but less significant so than for the short-term effects. This apparent differential recovery suggests that salvage-logging following severe blowdown results in reduced regeneration and in lasting alterations of soil properties. The present findings thus suggest that salvage-logging does act as a compound disturbance. With climate change, more frequent and severe disturbances may occur, and it is thus necessary for management agencies to quantitatively evaluate the potential compounding effects of their decisions...|$|R

The challenge to resource managers is that once the decline is visible on the ground, the forest stand is beyond treatment and must be <b>salvage</b> <b>logged.</b> Local forest resource managers are interested in a remote sensing technique that is capable of detecting subtle changes in forest health, so that remediation measures can be applied before the stand is totally lost. Therefore, the goal of this project is to determine the ability of the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) to detect forest change in the Mark Twain National Forest using only the wetness component (TCW) and compare this technique to the more common Short wave-infrared/Near-infrared (SWIR/NIR) ratio technique used extensively in the eastern United States for forest change detection. This project tested the usefulness of this easy and inexpensive technique by applying it to the Missouri Ozark forest landscape in order to detect changes in forest biomass, characterize the structure of forest change patches, and assess contrasting rates of change on public and privately owned forests. This study found that the TCW detected biomass decrease as well as the SWIR/NIR ratio, forest change patch shapes worked well in identifying anthropogenic change, and that rates of biomass change were higher on private lands than public lands...|$|R
40|$|Malaria cases {{caused by}} Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian {{parasite}} naturally found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, are increasing rapidly in Sabah, Malaysia. One {{hypothesis is that}} this increase is associated with changes in land use. A study was carried out to identify the anopheline vectors present in different forest types and to observe the human landing behaviour of mosquitoes. Mosquito collections were carried out using human landing catches at ground and canopy levels in the Tawau Division of Sabah. Collections were conducted along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (primary forest, lightly logged virgin jungle reserve and <b>salvage</b> <b>logged</b> forest) between 18 : 00 and 22 : 00  h. Anopheles balabacensis, a vector of P. knowlesi, was the predominant species in all collection areas, accounting for 70  % of the total catch, with a peak landing time of 18 : 30 - 20 : 00  h. Anopheles balabacensis had a preference for landing on humans at ground level compared to the canopy (p <  0. 0001). A greater abundance of mosquitoes were landing in the logged forest compared to the primary forest (p <  0. 0001). There {{was no difference between}} mosquito abundance in the logged forest and lightly logged forest (p =  0. 554). A higher evening temperature (p <  0. 0001) and rainfall (p <  0. 0001) significantly decreased mosquito abundance during collection nights. This study demonstrates the potential ability of An. balabacensis to transmit P. knowlesi between canopy-dwelling simian hosts and ground-dwelling humans, and that forest disturbance increases the abundance of this disease vector. These results, in combination with regional patterns of land use change, may partly explain the rapid rise in P. knowlesi cases in Sabah. This study provides essential data on anthropophily for the principal vector of P. knowlesi which is important for the planning of vector control strategies...|$|R
