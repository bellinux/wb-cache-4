50|$|Metal {{moulding}} systems, with {{a flattened}} oval section {{consisting of a}} base strip and a <b>snap-on</b> <b>cap</b> channel, were more costly than open wiring or wooden moulding, but could be easily run on wall surfaces. Similar surface mounted raceway wiring systems are still available today.|$|E
50|$|The custom bottle {{design was}} created by {{designers}} Brian Adducci and Dan Baggenstoss of the Minneapolis design firm CAPSULE. It is uniquely flat and rectangular, unlike virtually any spirit container on the market, made from high-end French crystal, laser engraved custom calligraphy with 18th-century Slovakian poetry {{on the back and}} the Double Cross logo on the front, and topped with a heavy polished metal <b>snap-on</b> <b>cap.</b> The Double Cross name acknowledged the brand's heritage from the cross found in the Slovak flag and coat of arms.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of {{freezing point depression}} {{as a method of}} determining osmotic potentials in solutions has been used for some time. Re-cently, this same principle has been applied to the determination of moisture stress in plant leaves. The advent of efficient solid state Pettier cooling units has made possible the construction of portable field freezing-point meters of rela-tively low cost and acceptable accuracy (1). Some problems still exist with these units. The first is that the temperature control circuit for the Peltier battery is relatively complex, requiring some skill {{on the part of the}} person constructing its. Next is the fact that the units are not, strictly speaking, portable since they require a large 12 -volt DC current and so are restricted to use in a relatively small area around a vehicle whose battery can supply this current. Lastly, the price of parts for these units varies from $ 200 to $ 250, which becomes prohibitive if a number of units is desired. The unit described here eliminates these problems by use of a different cooling method. The Peltier cooling battery is replaced by a can of pressurized Freon 33 3 refrigerant. The freezing chamber is a piece of %-inch O. D. copper tubing inserted through and soldered onto the side of a large metal <b>snap-on</b> <b>cap</b> for standard-size aerosol cans. This type of cap is used by several com-panies packaging aerosol products and is ap-proximately the same diameter as the can. A baffle is installed inside the tubing to prevent direct contact between the refrigerant and th...|$|E

50|$|Hubcaps {{were first}} {{used on the}} Newton Reaction Carriage in 1680. The first hubcaps were more {{commonly}} known as dust or grease caps. These caps threaded onto the center hub on the wood, steel, or wire wheel. These were made {{from the beginning of}} car manufacturing to 1932. Pre-1915 hubcaps were all mostly made of brass that was nickel-plated. The 1920s hubcaps were mostly aluminum. Grease caps of the wire wheel brands such as Houk, Hayes, Frayer, Dayton, Buffalo, House, Phelps, Pasco, Rudge Whitworth, Budd, and Stewart are some of the hardest to find. When a customer went to buy the wire wheels, the make of the vehicle would be stamped in the center. During 1927 and 1928, the first <b>snap-on</b> center <b>caps</b> were being made on the wire wheels. After 1932, most every car had a <b>snap-on</b> style center <b>cap</b> on the middle of their wire, steel, or wood wheels. Wire wheel center caps in the 1930s had a spring-loaded retention clip system that has been used on many hubcaps and center caps on every style of car and truck to the present day.|$|R
