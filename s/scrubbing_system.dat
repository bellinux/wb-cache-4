5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system,</b> in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

50|$|Inert gas {{generator}} (IGG) refers to machinery on board marine product tankers. Inert {{gas generator}}s consist distinctively {{of a gas}} producer and a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> use sprays either {{prior to}} {{or in the}} bottom of the primary {{scrubber}} to remove large particles that could plug it.|$|R
50|$|Corrosion {{can be a}} prime problem {{associated}} with chemical industry <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems.</b> Fibre-reinforced plastic and dual keys are often used as most dependable materials of construction.|$|R
50|$|Dry <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> can be {{categorized}} as dry sorbent injectors (DSIs) or as spray dryer absorbers (SDAs). Spray dryer absorbers are also called semi-dry scrubbers or spray dryers.|$|R
50|$|The {{utility area}} was located under {{the floor of}} the {{mid-deck}} and contained air and water tanks in addition to the carbon dioxide <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Venturis are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used scrubber for particle collection and are capable of achieving the highest particle collection efficiency of any wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> As the inlet stream enters the throat, its velocity increases greatly, atomizing and turbulently mixing with any liquid present.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} {{possesses}} a modern {{sulphuric acid plant}} which was commissioned in 1996, for utilizing the tail gas recycling DCDA (Double Catalysis Double Absorption) technology. An alkali <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> is incorporated in the plant, and this in turn helps to keep sulphur dioxide emissions from the factory well within permissible limits.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to using liquid sprays or the exhaust stream, <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> can use motors to supply energy. The motor drives a rotor or paddles which, in turn, generate water droplets for gas and particle collection.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically aided {{scrubbers}} {{are generally}} not used for gas absorption. The contact time between the gas and liquid phases is very short, limiting absorption. For gas removal, several other <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> provide much better removal per unit of energy consumed.|$|R
40|$|Low-NOx burners, wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> baghouses and ammonia {{injection}} systems are feasible {{for use on}} large combustion sources such as utility boilers. These devices, used in combination with coal handling techniques which minimize fugitive dust and coal transportation related emissions, should enable new power plants and large industrial boilers to burn coal without the adverse air quality impacts for which coal became notorious...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of dry type <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> designs. However, all consist of two main {{sections}} or devices: a device to introduce the acid gas sorbent material into the gas stream and a particulate matter control device to remove reaction products, excess sorbent material as well as any particulate matter already in the flue gas.|$|E
5000|$|In a wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system,</b> dust {{particles}} {{will tend to}} follow the streamlines of the exhaust stream. However, when liquid droplets are introduced into the exhaust stream, particles cannot always follow these streamlines as they diverge around the droplet (Figure 1). The particle's mass causes it {{to break away from}} the streamlines and impactor hit the droplet.|$|E
50|$|A dry or {{semi-dry}} <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system,</b> {{unlike the}} wet scrubber, does not saturate the flue gas stream {{that is being}} treated with moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally {{do not have a}} stack steam plume or wastewater handling/disposal requirements. Dry scrubbing systems are used to remove acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl) primarily from combustion sources.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} parameter in wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> is {{the rate}} of liquid flow. It is common in wet scrubber terminology to express the liquid flow {{as a function of}} the gas flow rate that is being treated. This is commonly called the liquid-to-gas ratio (L/G ratio) and uses the units of gallons per 1,000 actual cubic feet or liters/cubic meter (l/m³).|$|R
50|$|Dry <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> {{are often}} used {{for the removal of}} odorous and {{corrosive}} gases from wastewater treatment plant operations. The medium used is typically an activated alumina compound impregnated with materials to handle specific gases such as hydrogen sulfide. Media used can be mixed together to offer a wide range of removal for other odorous compounds such as methyl mercaptans, aldehydes, volatile organic compounds, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically aided {{scrubbers}} {{have been}} used to control exhaust streams containing particulate matter. They have the advantage of being smaller than most other <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> since the fan is incorporated into the scrubber. In addition, they operate with low liquid-to-gas ratios. Their disadvantages include their generally high maintenance requirements, low absorption efficiency, and high operating costs. The performance characteristics of mechanically aided scrubbers are given in Table 1.|$|R
50|$|Calcium looping {{already has}} an energy {{advantage}} over amine scrubbing, {{but the main}} problem is that amine scrubbing is the more market-ready technology. However, the accompanying infrastructure for amine scrubbing include large solvent scrubbing towers, {{the likes of which}} have never been used on an industrial scale. The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale. Although the individual technologies differ in terms of current technological viability, the fact that the infrastructure needed to properly implement an amine <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> has yet to be developed keeps calcium looping competitive from a viability standpoint.|$|E
50|$|The {{off-gases}} {{from the}} {{flash smelting furnace}} contain 35-40% sulfur dioxide. They are cooled and cleaned in a waste-heat boiler, electrostatic precipitator and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> before {{being sent to the}} sulfuric acid plant. The acid plant produces either 94% or 98% sulfuric acid with tail gas containing typically 50-70 ppm sulfur dioxide, resulting in a measured sulfur fixation of greater than 99.9%. In 2006 the company produced and sold approximately 833000 ST of sulfuric acid, made from the formerly released gas. The acid recovery plant is designed to also recover waste heat from the process to produce electrical power. Approximately 24 MW of electrical power is generated, representing 70% of the smelter’s electrical requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Otherwise {{known as}} the Business Office or Patient Financial Services department, the Billing/Collections team are {{responsible}} for submitting a complete UB-04 claim (facility and ancillary billing) or a CMS1500 form (physician billing) to the insurance payers after a patient has received services for either an inpatient or outpatient type of visit. Usually, a third party claim <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> is then used to ensure that claims are as clean and complete as possible, including edits that may automatically update the raw claim data received from the host system. The intention of this scrubbing is to inevitably avoid generating a potential denial from the payer, which can prolong reimbursement to a provider. The claim is then sent out from the provider to the payer in a ANSI 837 5010 standard format.|$|E

The straightforward approach of global search and replace properly located no more than 30 - 60 % of all personally-identifying information that appeared explicitly in our sample database. On the other hand, our <b>Scrub</b> <b>system</b> found 99 - 100 % of these references. Scrub uses detection algorithms that employ templates and specialized knowledge of what constitutes a name, address, phone number and so forth...|$|R
50|$|Small liquid {{droplets}} {{cool the}} exhaust stream {{more quickly than}} large droplets because they evaporate more easily. Therefore, less liquid is required. However, in most <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> approximately one-and-a-half to two and- a-half times the theoretical evaporation demand is required to ensure proper cooling. Evaporation also depends on time; it does not occur instantaneously. Therefore, the quencher should be sized to allow for an adequate exhaust stream residence time. Normal residence times range from 0.15 to 0.25 seconds for gases under 540°C (1000°F) to 0.2 to 0.3 seconds for gases hotter than 540°C.|$|R
50|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} capture {{relatively small}} dust particles with large liquid droplets. In most wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> droplets produced are generally larger than 50 micrometres (in the 150 to 500 micrometres range). As {{a point of}} reference, human hair ranges in diameter from 50 to 100 micrometres. The size distribution of particles to be collected is source specific.For example, particles produced by mechanical means (crushing or grinding) tend to be large (above 10 micrometres); whereas, particles produced from combustion or a chemical reaction will have {{a substantial portion of}} small (less than 5 micrometres) and submicrometre particles.|$|R
50|$|The team's project - {{renamed the}} NRS 588 - did win the 1992 Isle of Man TT, ridden by Steve Hislop, {{as well as}} North West 200 and Ulster Grand Prix races ridden by Robert Dunlop. Whilst in Northern Ireland, the team met Professor Gordon Blair, one of the {{foremost}} automotive engineers from Queen's University Belfast. Prof Blair commented that the Japanese had abandoned development of the motorcycle variant of the Wankel engine on two main counts: 1. As the team had realized, there was just too much heat to be confined in a motorcycle chassis. 2. The pollution created by the engine burning both oil for lubrication and fuel for power was just too great to meet the impending pollution regulations without a large and expensive exhaust <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> In his TV Series on British Industry Sir John Harvey-Jones commented that the company was governed more by heart than head and the Racing team were the only ones worth saving.|$|E

5000|$|Chattanooga Process is an {{extraction}} process {{that uses a}} fluidized bed reactor and an associated hydrogen-fired heater. In this process, retorting occurs at relatively low temperatures (...) through thermal cracking and hydrogenation of the shale into hydrocarbon vapors and spent solids. The thermal cracking allows hydrocarbon vapors to be extracted and scrubbed of solids. The vapors are then cooled, inducing the condensate {{to drop out of}} the gas. The remaining hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, and acid gases are passed through an amine <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> to remove hydrogen sulfide which is converted to elemental sulfur. The cleaned hydrogen and light hydrocarbon gases are then fed back into the system for compression or into the hydrogen heater to provide heat for the fluidized bed reactor. This system is a nearly-closed loop; almost all of its energy needs are provided by the source material. The demonstration plant in Alberta was able to produce [...] of oil per kilotonne of oil shale with an API gravity ranging between 28 and 30. With hydrotreating (the reaction of oil with high pressure hydrogen), it would be possible to improve this to 38-40 °API.

50|$|The ejector venturi {{is unique}} among {{available}} <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> since it {{can move the}} process gas {{without the aid of}} a fan or blower. The liquid spray coming from the nozzle creates a partial vacuum in the side duct of the scrubber. The partial vacuum is due to the Bernoulli effect, and is similar to water aspirators used in chemistry labs. This partial vacuum can be used to move the process gas through the venturi as well as through the facility's process system. In the case of explosive or extremely corrosive atmospheres, the elimination of a fan in the system can avoid many potential problems.|$|R

5000|$|Radico Khaitan Ltd. was {{established}} as Rampur Distillery & Chemical Company Ltd. in 1943 at Rampur, Uttar Pradesh. The distillery in Rampur initially produced extra neutral alcohol (ENA) and supplied bulk alcohol for several liquor {{companies such as}} Shaw Wallace, Mohan Meakin and the United Breweries Group. It had a turnover of [...] 6.5 million in 1979. It was only in 1999 that the company commenced production of its own brands. Lalit Khaitan's father, G. N. Khaitan, bought out the loss-making Rampur Distillery from Vishnu Hari Dalmia for [...] 1.6 million in 1972. According to Lalit Khaitan, {{his father was a}} teetotaler throughout his life, and even Khaitan himself had never tasted alcohol until his father bought the distillery.G. N. Khaitan divided the family business (which included construction, real estate, liquor industries and others) among his 4 sons in 1995, and Lalit Khaitan inherited the relatively small liquor division. Prior to that the distillery was run by Lalit's cousin and others. In 1991, Radico set up a malt spirit plant with an installed capacity of 460 KL per annum; a soya oil/rapeseed extraction plant with an installed capacity of 300 tpd based on soyabean seeds & 350 tpd based on rapeseed oil cake at Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh and a biogas cogeneration and secondary treatment plant. The company also modernized the distillery unit by installing new copper distillation plant and a fully automatic bottling line. It also balanced its Single Superphosphate (SSP) plant by putting equipment like a ball mill and a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> The entire modernisation-cum-expansion programme cost the company [...] 365 million. The company undertook a major expansion of its solvent extraction plant to increase the capacity from 300 tpd to 600 tpd in 1994, and launched Contessa Rum, Contessa Whisky and a few other products in CMI markets in 1995. Contessa Rum is mainly sold to the Canteen Stores Department (CSD). Radico entered into a joint venture with Whyte & Mackay Group plc. in the same year, and launched Scotch whisky brands 15 YO, Findlater and WMSR in India.|$|E
40|$|CANSOLV SO 2 Scrubbing in Refinery Applications Tighter regulations, an {{increasing}} spread between {{sweet and sour}} crude prices and attractive revenue opportunities for sulfur and its byproducts have led refiners to increase their use of high sulfur fuels internally and install flue gas desulfurization systems to capture SO 2.

40|$|AbstractBabcock Hitachi {{has been}} {{developing}} a new amine-based scrubbing technology for capturing {{carbon dioxide in the}} flue gas of coal-fired power plants. The development program includes testing of commercial and new combinations of absorbents and additives. More than thirty kinds of amines have been evaluated and characterized by both fundamental tests in the laboratory and slipstream pilot plant tests. The pilot plant tests of the CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> were conducted at a coal-fired power plant in co-operation with Tokyo Electric Power Company. Two thousand hours of continuous operation was achieved with more than 90 % CO 2 reduction on average during the entire operation. Energy consumption with the original absorbent blend was much less than that with typical MEA. Since then the CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> has been further advanced to reduce the energy consumption as well as absorbent degradation drastically by improving the amine-based absorbent in a bench-scale test facility. Pilot tests at Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), University of North Dakota, were conducted in 2010 and the test results indicated high performance of the improved amine-based absorbent, H 3 - 1. This latest advanced solvent is also scheduled to be demonstrated in a large mobile test facility at several coal-fired power plants in Europe starting 2010. In parallel, conceptual designs of the CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> for commercial plants up to 800  MWe in size are being developed...|$|E
