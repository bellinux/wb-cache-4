It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E

Gordon continued to lead on the restart, and on lap 155, five laps from the finish of the event, rain began to fall once again; the caution flag was thrown, then the red flag, stopping the race to allow the track to be dried and the event to finish under green.|$|E

One significant order given by Long was to transfer the USS Oregon (one of the Navy's most powerful ships) from the west coast to the Caribbean; the ship made the journey around Cape Horn from San Francisco to Key West, Florida, in 66 days. War was declared in April 1898. Roosevelt resigned his post the next month, a move Long thought foolhardy but later acknowledged was significant in advancing Roosevelt's career.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 J Harlen Bretz {{published}} a paper {{arguing that the}} channeled scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This view, which was seen as arguing for a Catastrophic explanation for the geologic development, which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially decried. Bretz defended his theories, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> forty-year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz’s view of a catastrophic flood finally prevailed. Waitt extended Bretz's argument, arguing for a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more. Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon. This represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods, but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula.|$|E

The alternate Superman attempts to destroy the Watchtower, but fails when Deathstroke overcharges its core, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> massive explosion. Luthor tries to use the kryptonite weapon to kill Superman, but Shazam (Joey Naber) stops him, allowing Superman to execute him. Now aware of humanity's determination to depose him, Superman decides to destroy Gotham and Metropolis to demonstrate the chaos that would arise in his absence and murders Shazam when the latter protests, causing Flash (Neal McDonough) to defect and fight {{his way to the}} Insurgency.|$|E

Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien) tests Clark's abilities by <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> bomb in his truck, while he is inside. Nixon confronts Clark in the Talon coffee shop, but Lex intervenes on Clark's behalf.

Nixon goes to the Luthor mansion and steals the octagonal key, and immediately returns to the storm cellar with a video camera.|$|E
5|$|In May 1809, {{the rebels}} {{captured}} Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman {{attack on the}} village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to take its fortress. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, they failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and never came close to the Adriatic Sea. Karađorđe had described acquiring access to the sea {{as one of his}} key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> massive explosion that killed him and everyone else in the vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning to others who wished to rebel.|$|E
5|$|Nick flees at high speed, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> traffic camera. The trio meet {{to discuss}} their {{reservations}} about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him {{to get rid of}} the witness.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was known}} to create tower {{structures}} from the skulls of rebel fighters in order to elicit terror among its opponents. The First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman rule erupted in February 1804, with Đorđe Petrović (Karađorđe) as its leader. On 19 May 1809, 3,000 Serbian rebels {{under the command of}} Stevan Sinđelić were attacked by the Ottomans on Čegar Hill, in Niš. The rebels were plagued by lack of coordination, largely due to the rivalry between commanders Milivoje Petrovic and Petar Dobrnjac. As a result, Sinđelić's fighters failed to receive support from the other rebel detachments. The numerically superior Ottomans lost thousands of soldiers in a number of failed attacks against the rebels, but eventually overwhelmed the Serbian lines. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> massive explosion. The resulting blast killed him and everyone else in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The Whig National Convention {{opened on}} December 4, 1839, {{almost a year}} before the general election. The {{candidates}} did not travel to the convention, and with no telegraph yet in operation, they did not learn of events in Harrisburg until the convention was over. Each state was allocated two delegates for each member of the House of Representatives and Senate it was entitled to send to Washington. There were four absent states from the South, which hurt Clay. The rules of the convention, once passed by the delegates, also hurt Clay, since they provided that the entirety of a state's vote would be cast as a majority of the delegation directed, negating Clay's sizable minorities in Northern states such as New York. That state's delegation was run by its Whig boss, Thurlow Weed, who deemed Clay unelectable as a slaveholder. New York provided much of Scott's vote through the first four ballots, which were deadlocked, with Clay ahead but not close to a majority. Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, a leader of the Harrison forces, had obtained possession of a letter Scott had written expressing sympathy for abolitionists. Stevens intentionally dropped the letter while walking among the pro-Clay Virginia delegation. After reading it, the Virginians announced Harrison was their second choice, <b>setting</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> stampede for him, and he became the Whig nominee for president on the fifth ballot.|$|E
