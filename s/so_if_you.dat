5|$|When {{you think}} about Goya, who painted the most horrendous {{pictures}} of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E

If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now.

5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E

Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation.

500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor.

500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa. [...] In his autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "Iowa had one thing in its favor as far as I was concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director. [...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll {{give me a chance to}} hire another coach, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don’t make it, neither will I." [...] He is the only person to have been with Rose Bowl teams in five capacities – player, assistant coach, head coach, assistant athletic director, and athletic director.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E

500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate {{what it is to be}} about and <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E

I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode.

500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? Would that be OK? The only problem is, I don't know all the words. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E
500|$|The console {{version of}} Crash Nitro Kart {{received}} mixed to positive reviews upon release. Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{concluded that the}} gameplay of Crash Nitro Kart was addictive though not innovative. [...] said that Crash Nitro Kart was [...] "satisfying and challenging at the same time" [...] and [...] "a great way to fill that need for speed." [...] Nintendo Power praised the karts as [...] "fast" [...] and the power-ups as [...] "creative". Official PlayStation Magazine concluded that [...] "Vicarious Visions did all it could to emulate the Naughty Dog classic (Crash Team Racing) and just added a PS2 coat of paint." [...] Play magazine said that the game was [...] "a little generic and heavily recycled, but the powerslide system from CTR pulls it together." [...] Matt Helgeson of Game Informer dismissed the game as [...] "probably {{one of the least}} exciting racing titles I've played recently." [...] Demian Linn of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that the gameplay was [...] "nearly identical to Crash Team Racing's, even down to the speed-boosting wumpa fruits, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> loved it before, you'll still love it, and if not... not." ...|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
