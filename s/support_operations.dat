5|$|Pioneer {{arrived in}} Australia in early 1945 to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> by the BPF against Japanese forces from {{a base in}} the Admiralty Islands. The ship and her {{facilities}} were used to help repair Hong Kong's infrastructure in late 1945 and {{she returned to the}} UK in early 1946. Pioneer was immediately placed in reserve upon her arrival and she was sold in 1954 for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The 36th Engineer Brigade was {{originally}} constituted on 1 October 1933 as the 36th Engineer Regiment and activated on 1 June 1941 at Plattsburgh Barracks, New York. During World War II the 36th Engineer Regiment consisted of nine combat engineer companies trained for amphibious assault and <b>support</b> <b>operations.</b> Because of this training, the unit’s distinctive insignia was designed with a seahorse {{on a red}} and white shield.|$|E
50|$|In early August 1993, the {{squadron}} embarked on USS America {{to begin their}} third Mediterranean deployment in three years. During this deployment {{the squadron}} conducted humanitarian operations {{off the coast of}} Bosnia-Herzegovina <b>supporting</b> <b>Operation</b> Provide Promise and Operation Deny Flight. In late October the squadron <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> Restore Hope off the coast of Mogadishu, Somalia. By Mid-December they were <b>supporting</b> <b>Operation</b> Southern Watch in Iraq.|$|R
50|$|February and March 1995 saw a {{deployment}} to Somalia to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> United Shield, {{helping the}} remaining UN troops evacuate. The next major deployment was in October 2000 to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Determined Response.|$|R
50|$|Veghel was {{abandoned}} and reopened {{at various times}} between 1968 and 1971. It was reopened in March 1969 to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Massachusetts Striker and again in February 1971 to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Dewey Canyon II.|$|R
5|$|In England {{the brigade}} trained for {{operations}} in North-West Europe {{under the supervision}} of the I Airborne Corps. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties. Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade would act as an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division. However, the speed of the Allied advance towards the River Seine and then onwards from Paris northwards, was accomplished without airborne assistance and the plans were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The 313thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{its first}} mine-laying operation {{on the night}} of 27/28March when it mined the Shimonoseki Strait to prevent Japanese warships from using this route to attack the US landing force off Okinawa. Mine-laying operations were disrupted in April as the wing was assigned to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> in Okinawa and participate in conventional bombing raids. Its rate of effort increased in May, when it conducted missions against harbors and other choke points around Honshu and Kyushu. The air-dropped minefields greatly disrupted Japanese coastal shipping.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, the Italian {{invasion}} of Egypt began. Much to Pattle's distaste, the squadron was {{heavily involved in}} close air <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> and ordered specifically to avoid air-to-air combat unless attacked. On occasion, he chanced upon Italian aircraft, but the Gladiator's limited speed denied Pattle further success. Pattle succeeded in damaging a Savoia-Marchetti S.79 bomber which emitted black smoke but dived away and Pattle could not catch it. The speed of the Savoia-Marchetti S.79 enabled it to escape the RAF fighters on a consistent basis. The unit withdrew to Habbaniyah to re-equip with Mark II machines, but was then ordered to Greece after the Italian attack.|$|E
50|$|Throughout its history, {{the unit}} has been {{extremely}} active in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. In 2005, the unit <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> UNIFIED ASSISTANCE, the relief effort from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In 2011, the unit <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> TOMODACHI, the relief effort from the great East Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011. In 2013, the unit <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> DAMAYAN, the relief effort from Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|In January 2003 the Battalion {{activated}} and deployed {{personnel in}} <b>support</b> of <b>Operation</b> Iraqi Freedom. December 2004 activated and deployed personnel {{to serve as}} members of the 5th Civil Affairs Group and continue to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. 8 members of the battalion were killed <b>supporting</b> <b>operations</b> in Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The 728th was {{occasionally}} {{diverted to}} <b>support</b> tactical <b>operations.</b> It hit airfields, V-weapon launching sites, bridges and other objectives in preparations for Operation Overlord, {{the invasion of}} Normandy. It bombed enemy positions to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Cobra, the breakout at Saint Lo in July 1944 and the attacks on Brest, France in August. It <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> Market Garden, airborne attacks in the Netherlands in September and, during the Battle of the Bulge, struck German lines of communication. It struck an airfield to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine.|$|R
5|$|USS Canonicus was a single-turret monitor {{built for}} the United States Navy during the American Civil War, the lead ship of her class. The ship {{spent most of her}} first year in service {{stationed}} up the James River, where she could <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the Confederate ironclads of the James River Squadron. She engaged Confederate artillery batteries during the year and later participated in both attacks on Fort Fisher, defending the approaches to Wilmington, North Carolina, from December 1864 to January 1865.|$|E
5|$|HMS Pioneer was a Colossus-class {{aircraft}} carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy during World War II. She was modified whilst under construction into an aircraft maintenance carrier. The ship arrived in Australia in mid-1945 to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> by the British Pacific Fleet against Japanese forces. She supported the British attacks on the Japanese Home Islands from mid-June {{until the end of}} the war in August from a base in the Admiralty Islands. The ship and her facilities were used to help repair Hong Kong's infrastructure in late 1945 and she returned to the UK in early 1946. Pioneer was immediately placed in reserve upon her arrival and she was sold in 1954 for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). He faced {{enormous}} engineering challenges. Most of New Guinea {{consisted of}} mountains and jungle, {{with very few}} airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to <b>support</b> <b>operations.</b> To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had Leif Sverdrup assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his Australian Army counterpart at General Sir Thomas Blamey's Allied Land Forces headquarters, Major General Clive Steele. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the Allied Works Council. Casey attempted to coordinate {{the activities of the}} various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the U.S. Army Air Forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The Royal Australian Air Force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after its}} activation, the 99th <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> Urgent Fury, which {{replaced}} the Stalinist regime in Grenada. In December 1989, 99th tankers <b>supported</b> <b>Operation</b> Just Cause, which ousted Manuel Noriega {{as the leader}} of Panama. In its last contingency operation while part of SAC, the unit deployed aircraft and crew to <b>support</b> <b>Operation</b> Desert Shield in August 1990 and continued its deployment through Operation Desert Storm, which ended the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq.|$|R

5|$|Like many ex-Army officers, {{he tended}} to see air power in the {{tactical}} role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for neglecting strategic bombing while over-focusing on close air support for the army. However the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. The two men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel like Kesselring. Interdiction and close air support were operations that suited the Luftwaffe's pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient in power for use in strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; Britain and France.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1999, two Chinooks of No. 27 Squadron left base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, {{carrying}} paratroopers to join NATO forces {{serving in}} the Balkans; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies. On 12 June 1999, waves of Chinooks, escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo {{as a part of}} NATO's first phase of deployment. On 10 August 1999 hundreds of Chinooks around the world, including those used by the British armed forces, were grounded due to cracking discovered in the landing gear of a British helicopter during routine inspection.|$|E
5|$|RAAF C-130s {{continued}} to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> {{in and around}} Australia during the early 2000s. During April 2003 a C-130 formed part of the force that tracked the North Korean freighter Pong Su before it was boarded by special forces personnel {{off the coast of}} New South Wales. No.36 Squadron Hercules took part in Operation Sumatra Assist {{in the wake of the}} 2004 Boxing Day tsunami; the aircraft were initially used to fly supplies into the badly damaged city of Banda Aceh. Hercules flew Australian forces into East Timor during May 2006 after the government of that country requested assistance to quell a military mutiny and widespread violence. In July that year one of the C-130s deployed to the Middle East was sent to Cyprus, where it picked up Australians who had been evacuated from Lebanon following Israeli air raids and flew them to Turkey.|$|E

5|$|She {{acted as}} a royal yacht for Crown Prince Umberto's 1924 tour of South America and then {{deployed}} to the Indian Ocean to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> in Italian Somaliland in 1925–26. San Giorgio served as a training ship from 1930 to 1935 and was then rebuilt in 1937–38 to better serve in that role. As part of her reconstruction, she received a modern anti-aircraft suite that was augmented before she was transferred to bolster the defences of Tobruk shortly before Italy declared war on the Allies in mid-1940. San Giorgio was forced to scuttle herself in early 1941 as the Allies moved in to occupy the port. Her wreck {{was used as an}} immobile repair ship by the British from 1943 through 1945. Salvaged in 1952, she sank while under tow to Italy to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|The ADF {{currently}} has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's {{contribution to the}} Military intervention against ISIL makes up the largest overseas commitment with 780 personnel deployed as part of Operation Okra. As of November 2015, six F/A-18A Hornets, one E-7A Wedgetail and one KC-30A tanker were deployed to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Approximately 380 personnel were deployed to Iraq {{as part of an}} international effort to provide training and other forms of assistance to the Iraqi military. Deployments in Afghanistan number 250 personnel in Operation Highroad, a non-combat training mission supporting the Afghan National Army. A frigate is also deployed to the Middle East in maritime security operations in and around the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces. Australian personnel also form part of peacekeeping missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} around Sattelberg was methodically {{reduced by}} intensive Allied bombing which lasted five days, {{coming to an}} end on 23 November. The same day, Japanese aircraft also undertook ground <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> with a force of 44Japanese aircraft attacking Australian positions round Jivevaneng. This did not change the situation around Sattelberg as by then the Australians had reached its southern slopes and the following day they began probing forward towards its summit. Throughout the day they launched a number of attacks, but heavy defensive fire pushed these back until a platoon under the command of Sergeant Tom Derrick fought its way almost to the top, with Derrick leading the way, destroying 10Japanese positions with grenades as he went. With the Australians having secured a toehold just below the summit for the night, the Japanese withdrew under the cover of darkness and the following morning the advance to the mission was completed. For his feat, Derrick later received the Victoria Cross, his nation's highest military decoration.|$|E

5|$|A modest force {{remained}} in Afghanistan over {{this time and}} was involved in counter-insurgency operations in Uruzgan Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal. The force consisted of motorised infantry, special forces, engineers, cavalry, artillery and aviation elements. By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion-sized battle group known as the Mentoring Task Force, and the Special Operations Task Group, both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of Tarin Kowt, {{as well as the}} Rotary Wing Group flying CH-47D Chinooks, the Force Logistics Asset and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in Kandahar. In addition, a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support, but are located outside of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, detachments of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. Also included is the deployment of one of the RAN's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties.|$|E
5|$|After repairs, {{she joined}} Task Group 51 under Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill {{for an attack}} on Darrit, {{steaming}} for that island on 23 January and arriving 30 January. After shelling the island for 30 minutes, it was discovered no Japanese were ashore. She then moved to <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> on Eniwetok Atoll on 8 February, providing shore bombardment on Parry Island ahead of landings which took place on 19 February. She then screened carriers conducting airstrikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai between 30 March and 1 April. She then joined with a carrier force assigned to cover the landings around Hollandia and Tanahmerah on New Guinea, which took place from 21–24 April. She steamed northward with the carrier force and struck Truk with five other cruisers and destroyers. Portland then bombarded Satawan in the Nomei Group. Following this series of operations, Portland returned to Mare Island for a more extensive overhaul, which was completed in August. She returned to the western Pacific for shore bombardments of Peleliu from 12–14 September. The cruiser supported the landing on Peleliu on 15 September, providing artillery to support the advance of Allied forces. She provided gunfire support at Peleliu through 29 September, and then steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island in the Admiralties.|$|E
5|$|Also on that morning, the 200 Home Guard {{troops and}} about 50 armed locals in Avtovac were {{attacked}} from three directions by rebels. They recovered from their initial surprise {{and held the}} town during the day, but in the evening a renewed assault caused them to withdraw from Avtovac and retreat to the villages of Međuljići and Ključ. Upon capturing Avtovac, the rebels looted the village, burned down {{a large number of}} Muslim homes and killed 32 Muslim civilians, mostly women, children and the elderly. Gacko was also attacked by the rebels, with eight soldiers killed, and one officer and 12 soldiers wounded. Also on 28 June, two Italian Army trucks driving from Bileća to Avtovac were ambushed by rebels, who killed three soldiers and wounded 17. Around 18:00, the Italian command advised Kvaternik that they would be clearing the route from Bileća via Gacko to Nevesinje on an unspecified future date. During the fighting around Gacko, several ZNDH aircraft were forced to land due to pilot casualties and engine trouble. ZNDH air <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> were suspended due to lack of fuel and spares for the aircraft.|$|E
