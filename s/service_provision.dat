5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially.

In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the methods of <b>services</b> <b>provision</b> in Slovak towns.   It {{addresses}} decision-making concerning selected <b>services</b> <b>provision,</b> based on a transaction cost economic model. The article looks at five types of services from that point of view. These are core services, i. e., services that are provided in most Slovak towns, thereby allowing outcomes of decision-making to be compared, and services which can be outsourced according to transaction cost theory. Findings partially confirm the hypothesis: Slovak towns do outsource, though “insourcing” moderately prevails. However, a comparison of several research studies in the area indicates a trend towards higher outsourcing of such local <b>services</b> <b>provision.</b>   The findings show that public bodies do not always select the most suitable methods of <b>services</b> <b>provision,</b> {{as suggested by the}} transaction costs theory (the Brown-Potoski model). This indicates that it is not only economic models that influence decision-making concerning the organization of <b>services</b> <b>provision</b> in the Slovak towns. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{environment}} in which <b>services</b> are <b>provisioned</b> in existing networks {{has a number of}} shortcomings. Neither the service domain nor the services therein have a standardised structure. Signalling between terminals and services uses network protocols that are inappropriately oriented towards bearer management. The control of bearer connections, and the view of call states, is maintained in the network layer, making bearer management difficult and limited. A service-centric <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> environment is proposed, which advocates a structured service domain, and a structured approach to <b>service</b> development and <b>provisioning.</b> A direct communication path between terminals and services at the application layer, that utilises high-level, service-oriented protocols, is proposed. Control of the call / session layer and the bearer network, and view of connection states is relocated to the application layer, facilitating bearer manipulation by services located in the service domain. It is shown that the capabilities and features of <b>services</b> <b>provisioned</b> in the proposed <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> environment are of a greater range, more advanced and more complex. It is also shown that the proposed <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> environment brings about potential efficiency gains for the initiation of 2 -party calls, and significant efficiency gains for the initiation of multiparty calls...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{competition between}} telecommunication service providers (TSPs) {{and the large}} amounts of human resource costs incurred to <b>provision</b> telecommunication <b>services</b> to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs), highlight the need for effective self-service provisioning methods to reduce costs. Existing <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> methods do not effectively support SMMEs in the <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. The current methods used are manual and Web-based. The manual <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> method is labour and time-intensive. TSPs {{are being forced to}} cut human resource costs as the profit margins for <b>provisioning</b> <b>services</b> are narrow due to competition. The current web-based systems do not allow SMMEs to effectively purchase services as they provide long textual lists to consult and limited information about services. The objective of this research was to develop an intelligent web-based self-service system to support SMMEs in telecommunication <b>service</b> <b>provisioning,</b> using a Design Science Research methodology. A constraint-based, knowledge-based recommender system was selected as the most appropriate intelligent system to support telecommunication <b>service</b> <b>provisioning.</b> A prototype called SelPro was developed as a solution to address the shortcomings of the current ineffective <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> methods available for SMMEs. SelPro incorporates an interactive wizard-style user interface with dynamic recommendations to support novice users as well as an expert interface which provides less user support. An expert review and a user study were conducted to determine if SelPro was usable, useful and effective. SelPro was perceived as being usable for SMMEs wishing to purchase telecommunication services. Expert participants were satisfied with the usability of SelPro and perceived it as being useful, easy to use and easy to learn. SelPro was considered effective because of the high task success ratings provided by the participants using the two interfaces. The research determined that intelligent web-based self-service provisioning can be used to effectively support SMMEs in telecommunication <b>service</b> <b>provisioning.</b> General design recommendations for similar systems were proposed and future work will involve using intelligent systems to support large enterprises in telecommunication service provisionin...|$|R
