40|$|Biocompatibility of {{bicarbonate}} buffered {{peritoneal dialysis}} fluids: Influence on mesothelial cell and neutrophil function. The present study compares {{the effects of}} lactate and bicarbonate buffered PDF on human neutrophil (PMN) and human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) viability and function. Acute exposure of PMN to lactate buffered PDF at pH 5. 5 (CAPD 2, 1. 5 % and CAPD 3, 4. 25 % glucose) resulted in significant reductions in cellular ATP levels, the phagocytosis of serum treated zymosan (STZ) and respiratory burst activation (CL). Exposure of PMN to bicarbonate buffered PDF (BIC 20, 1. 5 % glucose and BIC 30, 4. 25 % glucose both at pH 7. 2) had no significant effect on cell viability or the CL response. Phagocytosis was, however, depressed significantly more following exposure <b>to</b> <b>BIC</b> 30 than BIC 20. PMN cellular ATP levels and phagocytosis were significantly better in cells exposed <b>to</b> <b>BIC</b> 30 than <b>to</b> CAPD 3 at pH 7. 4 (P = 0. 043 for both). Pre-exposure of HPMC to CAPD 2, CAPD 3 or BIC 30 for 30 minutes resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} cellular ATP content compared to control medium. Pre-exposure <b>to</b> <b>BIC</b> 20 did not result in a reduction in HPMC ATP levels. HPMC synthesis of IL- 6 was unaffected by 15 or 30 minutes pre-exposure <b>to</b> <b>BIC</b> 20 or BIC 30, in contrast pre-exposure to CAPD 2 or CAPD 3 for 15 or 30 minutes resulted in a significant reduction in stimulated IL- 6 synthesis (24. 5 ± 3. 01 and 32. 3 ± 5. 0 vs. 43. 9 ± 10 pg/µg cell protein in M 199, N= 6; P = 0. 02). Neutralization of the pH of CAPD 2 and CAPD 3 resulted in normalization of HPMC IL- 6 secretion. Analysis of IL- 6 mRNA expression in control, BIC 20 and 30 pre-treated HPMC subsequently stimulated with IL- 1 β revealed no differences in the expression of the IL- 6 specific 465 base pair transcripts. The improved cellular function in bicarbonate buffered PDF indicates potentially improved host defence status and preservation of the peritoneal membrane in CAPD patients...|$|R
