25|$|The navigational {{message of}} the L1OC signal is {{transmitted}} at 100 bit/s. The string is 250 bits long and takes 2.5 seconds to transmit. A pseudo-frame is 1500 bits (15 seconds) long, and a <b>superframe</b> is 12000 bits or 120 seconds (2 minutes).|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message of}} the L3OC signal is {{transmitted}} at 100 bit/s, with each string of symbols taking 3 seconds (300 bits). A pseudo-frame of 6 strings takes 18 seconds (1800 bits) to transmit. A <b>superframe</b> of 8 pseudo-frames is 14400 bits long and takes 144 seconds (2 minutes 24 seconds) to transmit the full almanac.|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message of}} CDMA signals is {{transmitted}} as {{a sequence of}} text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains ephemerides for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) {{and part of the}} almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a <b>superframe</b> of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the <b>superframe</b> will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites. The message can also contain Earth rotation parameters, ionosphere models, long-term orbit parameters for GLONASS satellites, and COSPAS-SARSAT messages. The system time marker is transmitted with each string; UTC leap second correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver. The strings have a version tag to facilitate forward compatibility: future upgrades to the message format will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment {{will be able to use}} additional information from newer satellites.|$|E

25|$|The navigational {{message is}} {{modulated}} at 50 bits per second. The <b>superframe</b> {{of the open}} signal is 7500 bits long and consists of 5 frames of 30 seconds, taking 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) to transmit the continuous message. Each frame is 1500 bits long and consists of 15 strings of 100 bits (2 seconds for each string), with 85 bits (1.7 seconds) for data and check-sum bits, and 15 bits (0.3 seconds) for time mark. Strings 1-4 provide immediate data for the transmitting satellite, and are repeated every frame; the data include ephemeris, clock and frequency offsets, and satellite status. Strings 5-15 provide non-immediate data (i.e. almanac) for each satellite in the constellation, with frames I-IV each describing five satellites, and frame V describing remaining four satellites.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentally, WMA is a {{transform}} coder {{based on}} modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), somewhat similar to AAC, Cook and Vorbis. The bit stream of WMA {{is composed of}} superframes, each containing 1 or more frames of 2048 samples. If the bit reservoir is not used, a frame is equal to a <b>superframe.</b> Each frame contains a number of blocks, which are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 samples long after being transformed into the frequency domain via the MDCT. In the frequency domain, masking for the transformed samples is determined, and then used to requantize the samples. Finally, the floating point samples are decomposed into coefficient and exponent parts and independently huffman coded. Stereo information is typically mid/side coded. At low bit rates, line spectral pairs (typically less than 17kbit/s) and a form of noise coding (typically less than 33kbit/s) {{can also be used}} to improve quality.|$|E
2500|$|The high-precision {{signal is}} {{broadcast}} in phase quadrature with the standard-precision signal, effectively {{sharing the same}} carrier wave, but with a ten-times-higher bandwidth than the open signal. [...] The message format of the high-precision signal remains unpublished, although attempts at reverse-engineering indicate that the <b>superframe</b> is composed of 72 frames, each containing 5 strings of 100 bits and taking 10 seconds to transmit, with total length of 36 000 bits or 720 seconds (12 minutes) for the whole navigational message. The additional data are seemingly allocated to critical Luni-Solar acceleration parameters and clock correction terms.|$|E

30|$|The “AND” {{function}} or {{the logical}} multiplication function {{is applied to}} evaluate whether the nodes are mutually exclusive on the slot sharing in different <b>superframes</b> with the same slot number. If the results of logical multiplication are all zero, it indicates that the nodes can share the same slot number in different <b>superframes</b> without collision. If there is “ 1 ” value in the logical multiplication sequence, it means the slots with the same number in different <b>superframes</b> are utilized and that different nodes cannot share the slot with same number. The “OR” function or logical addition function is employed to express whether they can provide available slots for extra nodes. The zero value in the result of “OR” function indicates that the slot in different <b>superframes</b> is unoccupied and can be assigned to other nodes for data transmission. If the results of logical multiplication are all “ 1 ”, the slots in different beacon periods are fully occupied in the highest utility that cannot support slot allocation to new admitted nodes. But there are other slots with different slot number that can be provided to the new admitted nodes.|$|R

50|$|This layer will {{be based}} on {{cognitive}} radio technology. It also {{needs to be able to}} adapt dynamically to changes in the environment by sensing the spectrum. The MAC layer will consist of two structures: Frame and <b>Superframe.</b> A <b>superframe</b> will be formed by many frames. The <b>superframe</b> will have a <b>superframe</b> control header (SCH) and a preamble. These will be sent by the BS in every channel that it's possible to transmit and not cause interference. When a CPE is turned on, it will sense the spectrum, find out which channels are available and will receive all the needed information to attach to the BS.|$|E
5000|$|The Guide Channel {{consists}} of the first 2 non-Framing control Slots in each <b>Superframe.</b> This [...] "guide byte" [...] is normally 0, but if a control message straddles a <b>Superframe</b> boundary, it indicates the number of bytes {{until the end of}} that message.|$|E
50|$|Data {{transfers}} to the coordinator require a beacon synchronization phase, if applicable, followed by CSMA/CA transmission (by means of slots if <b>superframes</b> are in use); acknowledgment is optional. Data transfers from the coordinator usually follow device requests: if beacons are in use, these {{are used to}} signal requests; the coordinator acknowledges the request and then sends the data in packets which are acknowledged by the device. The same is done when <b>superframes</b> are not in use, only in this case there are no beacons {{to keep track of}} pending messages.|$|R

30|$|The AWA/IAWA {{coexistence}} mechanism can {{be applied}} to any pair of wireless networks which perform the transmission organized into <b>superframes,</b> for example, IEEE 802.15. 3, IEEE 802.15. 4, ECMA- 368, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.22, ETSI HIPERLAN/ 2.|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} of a <b>Superframe</b> is fixed {{in terms of}} Slots (and, therefore, Cells), but {{not in terms of}} time. The <b>Superframe</b> rate can be dynamically changed on SLIMbus to suit the particular application by changing either SLIMbus Root Frequency or Clock Gear, or both.|$|E
50|$|Frame {{synchronization}} {{is necessary}} to identify the timeslots within each 24-channel frame. Synchronization takes place by allocating a framing, or 193rd, bit. This results in 8 kbit/s of framing data, for each DS1. Because this 8-kbit/s channel {{is used by the}} transmitting equipment as overhead, only 1.536 Mbit/s is actually passed on to the user. Two types of framing schemes are <b>superframe</b> (SF) and extended <b>superframe</b> (ESF). A <b>superframe</b> consists of twelve consecutive 193-bit frames, whereas an extended <b>superframe</b> consists of twenty-four consecutive 193-bit frames of data. Due to the unique bit sequences exchanged, the framing schemes are not compatible with each other. These two types of framing (SF, and ESF) use their 8 kbit/s framing channel in different ways.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, {{extended}} <b>superframe</b> (ESF) is a T1 framing standard.|$|E
30|$|The {{specific}} bit sequence-scheduled {{algorithm is}} presented as follows. The network capacity can be largely expanded owing to the full utility of every slot in different <b>superframes.</b> Node i and node j can make a judgement if they can share the slots with same number in different <b>superframes</b> through the “AND” and “OR” function. Several nodes that share the slots may operate the algorithm repeatedly to realize the highest utilization of slots and the network capacity expansion. The nodes having common factors except for 1 are in high possibility to share the slots and reduce the waste of slots resource. Node j cyclic shifts the bit sequence since there are several expressions for m-periodic data (m> 1).|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} frame was {{introduced}} by Duffin and Schaeffer in [1], which dealt with nonharmonic Fourier series, and Gabor frames date back to [2]. Nowadays Gabor frames have been widely applied in signal processing [3 – 6]. They have been studied quite extensively on the whole space L^ 2 (R). Vector-valued frames were also called <b>superframes,</b> they were introduced in [7] by Han and in [8, 9] by Balan {{in the context of}} signal multiplexing, which means encoding several signals as a single one with the purpose of sharing a communication channel. In some structured cases with orthogonal windows known as <b>superframes</b> it is possible to find a Nyquist rate defining a phase transition between super-Riesz sequences and <b>superframes.</b> This was done in [10, 11] for the Gabor case, and in [12] for the wavelet case, following the constructions of vector-valued wavelet transforms [12 – 14]. In applications, when signals belong to a subspace of L^ 2 (R, C^L), one would like to perform a Gabor analysis of the signals in the most efficient way, while still preserving all the features of the observed data. That is why subspace Gabor analysis has interested many mathematicians. The literature [10, 11, 15 – 34] has considered Gabor frames for L^ 2 (R, C^L) and their subspaces.|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, {{the use of}} the Flag metric and the {{priority}} list assigns higher priority for the devices with a higher number of unserved requests to ascertain that their requests are served in the subsequent <b>superframes.</b> This ensures higher satisfaction and consequently higher fairness among the competing devices compared to [12].|$|R
5000|$|It is {{preferred}} to its predecessor, <b>superframe,</b> because {{it includes a}} cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and 4000 bit/s channel capacity for a data link channel (used to pass out-of-band data between equipment.) It requires less frequent synchronization than the earlier <b>superframe</b> format, and provides on-line, real-time [...] of circuit capability and operating condition.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the <b>superframe,</b> it is {{possible}} to avoid robbed-bit signalling and send call supervision over the data link instead.|$|E

30|$|As in [33] our {{proposed}} satellite MAC {{scheme is}} based on a multi-frequency time division multiple access (MF-TDMA) approach, according to which a carrier is divided in timeslots (grouped in frames and <b>superframes).</b> MF-TDMA was chosen since it is an attractive framing scheme for satellite uplinks with low power terminals and MF-TDMA schemes are capable of providing efficient bandwidth utilization [10, 33].|$|R
40|$|The <b>superframing</b> {{option of}} the recent DVB-S 2 X {{standard}} specifies, for the so-called SF-Pilot fields, {{the use of the}} orthogonal set of Walsh-Hadamard (WH) sequences. In order to exploit this orthogonality, waveforms coming from different beams to the k-th User Terminal (UT) should be quasi perfectly aligned in time. While in the downlink part of a terrestrial system this is quite straightforward, in satellite system, having a satellite as a relay, this is not the case, especially when large baudrates are considered in the transmission. A procedure to compensate for timing misalignment amongst waveforms is here presented and the advantages are quantified through numerical simulations. In particular, Channel State Information (CSI) estimation errors, which are fundamental for precoding techniques, are evaluated. While the focus of the work is on systems which enable precoding techniques, the procedure can be applied in each scenario which uses the <b>superframing</b> structure of DVB-S 2 X in an interference limited scenario...|$|R
30|$|In general, m-periodic {{data are}} in {{relatively}} lower user priority. They are mostly used for long-term monitoring. Through the bit sequence-scheduled algorithm, the heavy network traffic of different nodes {{is assigned to}} several <b>superframes.</b> The resource in the WBAN can be fully utilized, and more nodes can be admitted to the network for data transmission. At the same time, the network traffic transactions become more balanced for m-periodic sensor nodes.|$|R
