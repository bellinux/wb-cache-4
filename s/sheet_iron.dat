5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> or tiles.|$|E
5|$|The helmet is {{an example}} of a three-piece Roman {{ceremonial}} cavalry helmet, made of <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with gold leaf. Such helmets were worn by Roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as hippika gymnasia and may also have been worn in battle, despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration. Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans.|$|E
5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts {{on the inside of}} her hull to be covered with <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> to prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E

5|$|Weissenburg and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm were armored with {{nickel steel}} Krupp armor, {{but due to}} {{delivery}} problems, Brandenburg and Wörth were armored with a composite armor. The composite armor was constructed by layering steel-clad wrought iron plates and wood planks, which was backed by two more layers of <b>sheet</b> <b>iron.</b> Krupp's nickel steel armor {{was based on the}} Harvey process, which enriched the upper layers of the steel with carbon. This type of armor produced greater strength with thinner armor belts, which enabled ships equipped with it to carry more complete protection. Some portions of Brandenburg did receive the new Krupp armor, including the barbettes that held the fore and center main battery turrets. All four ships retained teak backing to their armor belts.|$|E
25|$|Tinplate {{consists}} of <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> coated with tin {{and then run}} through rollers.

25|$|Early {{road signs}} were usually cast iron, {{but this was}} {{increasingly}} displaced by cast aluminium in the 1930s. Cast signs were designed to be maintained by being repainted with the raised lettering and symbol easily picked out by an untrained hand. This sort of sign was sometimes given an element of night use by the inclusion of glass reflectors. An alternative to casting and painting was vitreous enamelled <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> or steel. In the 1950s cast signs were quickly displaced by sheet metal (usually aluminium) coated with adhesive plastics; these could be made reflective, famously by Scotchlite. Such signs had become almost universal by the reforms of the early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{propeller}} {{itself was}} of <b>sheet</b> <b>iron,</b> 5 feet 9inches {{in diameter and}} about 5 feet long, and consisted of a full 360° screw, single threaded and of a single turn in keeping with Smith's revised 1836 patent. Following the ship's entry into service, the propeller would subsequently undergo a number of modifications, {{the most important of}} which were an alteration to a double threaded/half turn format, and a division of the original 360° screw into two separate blades. The propeller had the unusual feature of being fully retractable in order to reduce drag when the ship was under sail—a task that took about 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana {{was laid}} down in mid-October 1861 by E.C. Murray in a new {{shipyard}} just north of New Orleans. The ship had two paddlewheels and two screws, each driven by its own engine. The paddlewheels were mounted one abaft {{the other in a}} center well. The screws were not intended for propulsion, but were to aid the two rudders in steering in the confined waters and unpredictable currents of the Mississippi. The engines were taken from steamer Ingomar, but two months were needed for their transfer. The casemate extended her full length, less 25 feet at each end. It was covered by T-rail iron in two courses, while its top was encompassed by <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> bulwarks nearly four feet high.|$|E

25|$|The pontoon hull {{was built}} of soft Siemens steel framing and 11 {{millimeters}} thick <b>sheet</b> <b>iron.</b> In November 1879, when the double bottom was 2/3 complete (but not formally laid down yet), Popov persuaded the imperial authorities to award interior finishes contact to the British, and hired Tideman {{to review the}} design again. Tideman built another 1:10 scale model, ran another series of tests and recommended changes to the powerplant and propeller arrangement that caused a significant extension of the contract. The Livadia had a double, perfectly flat bottom and only 7ft (2.1 m) of draft, excluding the propellers. Their blades projected 9 feet below the hull. Tideman found what he claimed was near-perfect propeller configuration: all three screws had the same diameter but varied in blade pitch, which in practice required running the engines at different revolutions per minute.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} the {{township}} is on the northern side of the railway. Parts of this are now destroyed by the Gulf Developmental Road and farm tracks. The central tailings dump associated with the mines along the Golden Gate reef, also now covers much of the former Golden Gate Township. Evidence of township habitation {{is located at the}} southern end of the Golden Gate Consols mine site. No extant structures survive but the remains of dwellings are found throughout the re-growth savannah woodland. These include earth floors, some stone footings, vertical sections of corrugated iron walls (possibly 'rat walls') set into the ground, and associated scatters of broken bottle glass, bricks, stove remains, <b>sheet</b> <b>iron,</b> tins and domestic ceramics. There are also some minor surface workings in and around the township site. There are further signs of habitation on the southern side of railway, connecting with the Golden Gate Cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Poorly {{characterized}} phases (PCP's) constitute up to 30 {{volume percent}} of some CM carbonaceous chondrites, {{and are therefore}} an important key {{to an understanding of}} the physico-chemical conditions attending matrix evolution. An iron rich form of the terrestrial phase tochilinite was recently identified as a common type of PCP. Tochilinite has the general formula 6 Fe(0. 9) S. 5 (Mg,Fe) (OH) 2 and consists of alternating machinawite (FeS) and brucite ((Mg,Fe) (OH) 2) <b>sheets,</b> with <b>iron</b> vacancies in the sulfide <b>sheets.</b> In <b>iron</b> rich tochilinite, ferrous hydroxide, called amakinite, replaces brucite. If CM carbonaceous kchondrites have underdone hydrothermal alteration, iron rich tochilinite, at least, probably grew from aqueous solutions characterized by low FO 2, high FS 2, pH 10 to 12, and at a temperature at or below 170 C...|$|R

Turner writes that it was made of plywood lined with rock wool and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron,</b> and had a chair inside and a small window. The boxes had multiple layers of these materials, which caused the orgone concentration inside the box to be three to five times stronger than in the air, Reich said. Patients were expected to sit inside them naked.|$|E

In George Town, a number of dwellings were destroyed. Of the 23ships in the harbor, only the Governor Blake survived. Most of the crews on board those ships were reported killed but loss of life on shore was minimal. Throughout the islands, all trees and crops were destroyed. In Cuba, the hurricane knocked out telegraphic communications in the eastern portions of the island, but the connection to Santiago de Cuba was quickly restored. A number of dwellings were damaged there, some were deroofed, while other homes were reduced to fragments. Pieces of <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> also became airborne. East of the city, all small ports received impact from the storm. Cienfuegos was [...] "ravaged by the storm", while extensive damage occurred in Cárdenas and Matanzas.

He used a combination of <b>sheet</b> <b>iron,</b> copper and porcelain plates, and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid. In a letter to the same publication written in December 1838 but published in June 1839, German physicist Christian Friedrich Schönbein discussed the first crude fuel cell that he had invented. [...] His letter discussed current generated from hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in water. Grove later sketched his design, in 1842, in the same journal.

2500|$|After graduation, Eiffel {{had hoped}} to find work in his uncle's {{workshop}} in Dijon, but a family dispute made this impossible. After a few months working as an unpaid assistant to his brother-in-law, who managed a foundry, Eiffel approached the railway engineer Charles Nepveu, who gave Eiffel his first paid job as his private secretary. [...] However, shortly afterwards Nepveu's company went bankrupt, but Nepveu found Eiffel a job designing a [...] <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> bridge for the Saint Germaine railway. Some of Nepveu's businesses were then acquired by the Compagnie Belge de Matériels de Chemin de Fer: Nepveu was appointed the {{managing director of the}} two factories in Paris, and offered Eiffel a job as head of the research department. In 1857 Nepveu negotiated a contract to build a railway bridge over the river Garonne at Bordeaux, connecting the Paris-Bordeaux line to the lines running to Sète and Bayonne, which involved the construction of a [...] iron girder bridge supported by six pairs of masonry piers on the river bed. These were constructed with the aid of compressed air caissons and hydraulic rams, both innovative techniques at the time. Eiffel was initially given the responsibility of assembling the metalwork and eventually took over the management of the entire project from Nepveu, who resigned in March 1860.|$|E

Some performances, including those of the Interlochen Arts Academy and Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, interpret the <b>iron</b> <b>sheet</b> part (see figure) as both for <b>iron</b> <b>sheet</b> and orchestral anvil, with anvil strikes on every beat as indicated by the vertical accents; however, the conductor's score published by Kalmus includes a note that the sheet is to be vibrated at each vertical accent and for the sheet to vibrate naturally between beats. The last ten measures of the piece accelerate and grow louder until the penultimate measure, where most of the instrumentation drops away. The horn and trumpet play a brief figure and the full orchestra returns to end the piece with a sforzando stab.|$|R
