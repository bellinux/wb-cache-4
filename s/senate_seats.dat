5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> were won by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|In April 1974, {{faced with}} {{attempts}} by the Opposition to obstruct supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam obtained the concurrence of the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, to a double dissolution. Labor was returned at the election on 18 May with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats,</b> with {{the balance of power}} held by two independents.|$|E
5|$|Pre-election public-opinion polls {{had promised}} victory to the communists. Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties {{came as a surprise}} to all involved: after the first round of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats.</b> After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E
50|$|Sheppard {{held his}} <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> {{until his death}} in Washington, D.C. in 1941. Then-Representative Lyndon B. Johnson ran for Sheppard's <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in the 1941 special election, and lost to Governor W. Lee O'Daniel.|$|R
50|$|Barbara Ann Radnofsky, the Democratic {{nominee for}} the Texas U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> held by Kay Bailey Hutchison in 2006. She {{is the first}} woman to have won the Democratic {{nomination}} for a U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in Texas.|$|R
50|$|Shumate {{left the}} Oklahoma House of Representatives {{to run for}} a state <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> He faced {{a member of the}} Tulsa City council in a 2012 primary for the state <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> vacated by Judy Eason McIntyre.|$|R
5|$|As {{almost all}} of the ACT's {{population}} lives in Canberra, political trends for both areas are closely aligned. The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory. The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two <b>Senate</b> <b>seats.</b> In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.|$|E
5|$|The Senate has 100 {{members with}} each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; {{one third of}} <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> are up for {{election}} every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college {{system in which the}} determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.|$|E
5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} {{seats to}} hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> up for election {{to hold a}} total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed {{in the three years}} of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period. The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, and was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Schaffer lost in {{the primary}} {{election}} to be the Republican nominee for a U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> He was the Republican nominee for Colorado's other <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in the 2008 election, which he lost to Democratic nominee Mark Udall.|$|R
25|$|Ensign {{was elected}} to Nevada's other <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in 2000. Ensign and Reid {{had a very good}} {{relationship}} despite their bitter contest in 1998. The two frequently worked together on Nevada issues until Ensign was forced to resign from his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 2009, Roberts {{was unable}} to run again for his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> As a result, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland {{appointed}} Roberts to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. He therefore was required to resign his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat,</b> and was replaced again by Fred Strahorn.|$|R
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} factions were {{inflamed}} {{almost as soon}} as the 1924 legislature convened. A bill to outlaw parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board's makeup; this attempt also narrowly failed. When Senator Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, sought re-election to the Senate in 1924, Fields and his allies did not support him, leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett and giving the Republicans both of the state's <b>senate</b> <b>seats</b> {{for the first time in}} history.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{had been}} elected unopposed to the new House of Assembly for Gatooma/Hartley and {{remained}} a close associate of Smith, becoming Vice-President of the 'Republican Front' (later renamed the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe). At the 1985 general election the boundaries for the White Roll seats were altered and Van der Byl fought in Mount Pleasant, opposing Chris Andersen. Andersen had broken with the Rhodesian Front to sit as an Independent and became Minister of State for the Public Service in Robert Mugabe's government. Van der Byl lost the election heavily, polling only 544 votes to 1,017 for Andersen and 466 for a third candidate. The Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe still controlled the election of ten white Senators and Smith agreed to elect Van der Byl {{to one of the}} <b>Senate</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hall saw {{the double}} {{dissolution}} {{as an opportunity}} to capture <b>senate</b> <b>seats</b> in all the states across the nation, and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia. On 18 November, a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria. A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch. Generally, the LM's attempts to spread its message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam's dismissal and the constitutional crisis, which produced angry demonstrations around the country. Amid the tumult, the media was almost completely focused on the two main parties, giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination. The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state-specific backdrop.|$|E
50|$|Ensign {{was elected}} to Nevada's other <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in 2000. Ensign and Reid {{had a very good}} {{relationship}} despite their bitter contest in 1998. The two frequently worked together on Nevada issues until Ensign was forced to resign from his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Tisei {{resigned}} {{his state}} <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> {{to run for}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, she ran for his <b>senate</b> <b>seat.</b> In the Democratic primary, she defeated Stoneham attorney Michael S. Day 64%-36%. She defeated Republican Craig Spadafora in the November 2010 general election 52%-48%.|$|R
5000|$|This {{election}} {{was the beginning}} of the end for the Australian Democrats, in that while they still had 4 senators from the 2001 election, they failed to win a single <b>senate</b> <b>seat</b> at the 2004 election and have not won a <b>senate</b> <b>seat</b> since.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} give the LM {{national}} exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM's main drawcard {{out of the spotlight}} entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible problem was that the media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution (meaning that all <b>Senate</b> <b>seats,</b> rather than half, were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate), and all ten South Australian <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> were contested. The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as {{a large part of the}} national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall's position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in off-year {{elections}} {{in the middle of}} terms for Presidents of the United States. Party nominations are determined by primary elections. The general election for <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> and all other state and federal {{elections in the}} normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of a}} term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.|$|E
5|$|The state's U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> have {{generally}} been split since the early 1990s, and in the 108th and 109th Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 midterm election, Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol Molnau narrowly won reelection. The DFL posted double-digit gains {{in both houses of}} the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first African American U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first Muslim elected to Congress nationwide. In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host Al Franken beat incumbent Republican Norm Coleman in the United States Senate race by 312 votes out of 3 million cast.|$|E
50|$|Lucas {{regained his}} State <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in 1824, and {{actively}} campaigned for Andrew Jackson. He was an Ohio Presidential elector in 1828 for Andrew Jackson. Lucas again lost his <b>senate</b> <b>seat</b> in 1828 to Kendall, and Lucas {{was part of}} the electoral congress that elected Jackson President that year. Lucas won his <b>senate</b> <b>seat</b> back in 1829, in a special election after Kendall resigned; again, he was elected Senate speaker. In 1831, Lucas ran for the state assembly and lost, but he quickly rebounded.|$|R

50|$|United States Senator Happy Chandler, a Democrat, {{resigned}} his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> {{to become}} Commissioner of Baseball on November 1, 1945. Republican Governor of Kentucky Simeon S. Willis appointed Stanfill, a Republican, to the vacant <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> on November 19, 1945. Stanfill {{did not run}} for election to the seat. He served from November 19, 1945, to November 5, 1946 when his successor, John Sherman Cooper who had won the seat by election, assumed the <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> Stanfill then resumed {{the practice of law}} and later retired to Lexington, Kentucky.|$|R
5|$|Pierce campaigned vigorously {{throughout}} {{his home state}} for Van Buren's re-election in the 1840 presidential election. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to William Henry Harrison, the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the Twenty-seventh Congress. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President John Tyler succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time. New Hampshire Democrats felt that no-one should hold one of the state's <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> for longer than one six-year term. Thus, he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at {{being a member of}} the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice. His last acts in the Senate before resigning in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states – believing that the money should go to the military instead – and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the New York Customs House, where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.|$|E
5|$|Trinsey v. Pennsylvania 941 F.2d 224 (1991) {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that {{confirmed}} the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case came about due {{to the death of}} H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> until a special election can be held, and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election. Instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidates. John S. Trinsey Jr., a voter and potential candidate, asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments, because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{appointed}} Senator Murphy to the High Court, {{even though}} Murphy's Senate seat {{would not be}} up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Labor then held {{three of the five}} short-term New South Wales <b>Senate</b> <b>seats.</b> Under proportional representation, Labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-Senate election but, if Murphy's seat were also contested, Labor was unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent. By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the Opposition, and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives. Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for the leadership, and defeated him on 21 March.|$|E

25|$|The National and Liberal Parties won {{the fifth}} and sixth <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> in Queensland, thus giving the Coalition 39 seats and {{outright}} control of the Senate.

25|$|Over three decades, the Australian Democrats {{achieved}} {{representation in}} the legislatures of the ACT, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> in all six states. However, at the 2004 and 2007 federal elections, all seven of its <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> were lost. The last remaining State parliamentarian, David Winderlich, left the party and was defeated as an independent in 2010.|$|E
50|$|In August 2009, Machen {{publicly}} endorsed George LeMieux to fill retiring U.S. Senator Mel Martinez's United States <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> Machen cited LeMieux's {{strong support}} for higher education and endorsed Governor Charlie Crist's selection to fill the open <b>senate</b> <b>seat.</b> He stipulated {{that he was not}} supporting LeMieux for political reasons.|$|R
