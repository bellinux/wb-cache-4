40|$|The {{development}} of a highly efficacious and durable vaccine for malaria remains a top priority for global health researchers. Despite the huge rise in recognition of malaria as a global health problem and the concurrent rise in funding over the past 10 - 15 years, malaria continues to remain a widespread burden. The evidence of increasing resistance to anti-malarial drugs and insecticides is a growing concern. Hence, an efficacious and durable preventative vaccine for malaria is urgently needed. Vaccines {{are one of the}} most cost-effective tools and have successfully been used in the prevention and control of many diseases, however, the {{development of}} a vaccine for the Plasmodium parasite has proved difficult. Given the early success of whole sporozoite mosquito-bite delivered vaccination strategies, we know that a vaccine for malaria is an achievable goal, with <b>sub-unit</b> <b>vaccines</b> holding great promise as they are simple and cheap to both manufacture and deploy. However a major difficulty in development of <b>sub-unit</b> <b>vaccines</b> lies within choosing the appropriate antigenic target from the 5000 or so genes expressed by the parasite. Given the liver-stage of malaria represents a bottle-neck in the parasite's life cycle, there is widespread agreement that a multi-component <b>sub-unit</b> malaria <b>vaccine</b> should preferably contain a liver-stage target.

40|$|International audienceSalmonella enterica in poultry {{remains a}} major {{political}} issue. S. serovar Enteritidis, particularly, remains a world-wide problem. Control in poultry by immunity, whether acquired or innate, is a possible means of containing the problem. Widespread usage of antibiotics {{has led to the}} emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria. This problem has indicated an increasing requirement for effective vaccines to control this important zoonotic infection. An attempt is made in this review to explain the relatively poor success in immunising food animals against these non-host-specific Salmonella serotypes that usually produce food-poisoning, compared with the success obtained with the small number of serotypes that more typically produce systemic "typhoid-like" diseases. New examinations of old problems such as the carrier state and vertical transmission, observed with S. Pullorum, is generating new information of relevance to immunity. Newer methods of attenuation are being developed. Live vaccines, if administered orally demonstrate non-specific and rapid protection against infection which is of biological and practical interest.

40|$|SUMMARY : Anthrax, an {{uncommon}} disease in humans, {{is caused by}} a large bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. The risk of inhalation infection is the main indication for anthrax vaccination. Pre-exposure vaccination is provided by an acellular vaccine (anthrax vaccine adsorbed or AVA), which contains anthrax toxin elements and results in protective immunity after 3 to 6 doses. Anthrax vaccine precipitated (AVP) is administered at primovaccination in 3 doses with a booster dose after 6 months. To evoke and maintain protective immunity, it is necessary to administer a booster dose once at 12 months. In Russia, live spore vaccine (STI) has been used in a two-dose schedule. Current anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general reactogenicity (erythema, induration, soreness, fever). Serious adverse reactions occur in about 1 &#x 0025; of vaccinations.

Mice were challenged 30 days post vaccination with B. abortus 544 strain. The LPS, OMP and LPS-OMP glyco-conjugate vaccinated mice were protected against the challenge. The percentage of animals protected with the <b>sub-unit</b> <b>vaccines</b> and the glyco-conjugate vaccine were comparable with the live, attenuated vaccine. The glyco-conjugate vaccine was able to induce strong immune response against both the components. The prominent isotypes were IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgG 3. In addition, the glyco-conjugate vaccine was able to induce a cell mediated immune response {{as indicated by the}} expression of IFN γ by splenocytes. The study indicated that the glyco-conjugate vaccine may be a useful candidate for prophylactic use...|$|R
