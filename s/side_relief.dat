40|$|A cycle {{analysis}} {{model for}} an airbreathing, rotating detonation wave engine (RDE) is presented. The engine {{consists of a}} steady inlet system with an isolator which delivers air into an annular combustor. A detonation wave continuously rotates around the combustor with <b>side</b> <b>relief</b> as the flow expands towards the nozzle. A model for the <b>side</b> <b>relief</b> is used to find the pressure distribution around the combustor. Air and fuel enter the combustor when the rarefaction wave pressure behind the detonation front drops to the inlet supply pressure. To create a stable RDE, the inlet pressure is matched in a convergence process with the average combustor pressure by increasing the annulus channel radial width {{with respect to the}} isolator channel. Performance of this engine is considered using several parametric studies and compared with rocket-mode computational results. A hydrogen–air RDE reaches a specific impulse of 3800 s and can reach a flight speed of Mach 5...|$|E

Because the detonation wave is followed immediately by expansion waves, {{due to the}} <b>side</b> <b>relief</b> in the axial direction, it is a Chapman-Jouguet wave. The strength of this wave, which may be characterized by the pressure ratio across the wave, {{as well as the}} wave speed and the local wave Mach number, are related to design parameters such as the contraction ratio, chamber speed of sound, chamber diameter, propellant injection density and velocity, and the specific heat ratio of the burned gases. In addition, the distribution of flow properties along the injector face can be computed. Numerical calculations show favorable comparison with experimental findings. Finally, the effects of drop size are discussed and a simple criterion is found to set the lower limit of validity of this strong wave analysis...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on single-pinned and double-pinned lugs made from alloy steel FV 520 B and loaded by means of 2 in diameter pins. The effects of pin fit for both clearance and interference and of various treatments were investigated. The treatments included side relieving the lug hole, bushing the bore, applying the Sulhuz process to the lug or overstraining the lug bore. Two conditions of mean stress were investigated, namely, pulsating or repeated tension and 15 tons/ina mean tension. Basing comparison on the fatigue strength at 30 x lo 8 cycles, the untreated lugs with close fit pins showed the lowest strength of all. Both clearance and interference fits were beneficial and by appropriate choice, the fatigue strength could be at least doubled {{and in some cases}} trebled. Lugs which had <b>side</b> <b>relief,</b> had been bushed, Sulfinuz treated or which had oversuained bores also gave worthwhile increases in fatigue strength and the strength ratios were generally in excess of 2. An increase in mean stress significantly reduced fatigue strength for all lugs tested, except for those with close fit or clearance fit pins. Comparing the present results with those obtained on lugs one-quarter the size, a considerable sue effect is evident for some conditions, large lugs being weaker than small lugs...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper on}} the outer-blade slicing {{analyzes}} {{the effects of the}} <b>side</b> <b>relief</b> angle a of the blade on the slicing mechanism theoretically. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) The larger α, the smaller the maximum value of the lateral grinding force component F_z. (2) The difference between the maximum values of F_z under the different conditions of γ_s (γ_s denotes the average half-tip angle of the abrasive grains on the blade side face) decreases with an increase in α. (3) A moderate value of a decreases the maximum blade deflection D_B largely, while too large a value of a increases D_B due to lessening of the flexural rigidity of the blade. (4) The difference between the values of D_B under the different conditions of γ_s decreases with an increase in α. (5) The flatness of the cutoff surface generated on the blade deflection side is improved largely with a moderate value of α, while that on the opposite side is deteriorated. (6) A moderate value of α decreases the kerfloss V_L largely. (7) V_L increases with an increase in γ_s in the case of α close to zero, while the tendency is reversed {{in the case of a}} exceeding a certain value...|$|E

40|$|Ara Tita Flavija Lucilija otkrivena je kao spolij u prvoj kuli s južne strane Andetrijskih vrata (PortaAndetria) tijekom zaštitnih arheoloških istraživanja 2001. godine. Nadgrobni spomenik svojemupatronu podiže oslobođenik Tit Flavije Eulog. U natpisu na pročelju are navodi se Lucilijev cursus. Onje iz vojne službe centuriona Osme dobrovoljačke kohorte (cohors VIII Voluntariorum), koja je u tovrijeme bila u Dalmaciji, regrutiran u equites singulares Augusti u Rimu. Dvije njegove vojne služberaspoznaju se na bočnim stranama spomenika. Izvanredan primjer vojničkog nadgrobnog spomenikau tradiciji uobičajene vojne ikonografi je nastao je u salonitanskim klesarskim radionicama u prvojpolovici 2. st. te bio postavljen na istočnoj salonitanskoj nekropoli. In {{the year}} of 170, during the Emperor Marcus Aurelius’ rule, new rings of town walls were buildaround the spacious suburbs east and west of the {{original}} Salona town centre. The reasons for thiswere the fi rst barbarian attacks of Quadi and Marcomanni at {{the borders of the}} Roman Empire. Asthe town spread towards the east and west - the so-called Urbs orientalis and Urbs occidentalis, theparts of the necropolises that were left within the new town walls had to be removed. Namely, fromthe oldest town gates Porta Caesarea the main road led and branched off into two main directions- east and south. From the so-called Porta Graeca the road led towards the west and necropoliseswere formed along that road. The oldest parts of the Salonitan necropolises were never systematicallyresearched. All the fi nds are incidental and give sporadic information about the time of their formingand the ways of their expanding. Numerous tombstones of these earliest graveyards were usedas a building material needed for the fast building of the town walls and consequently they werecompletely removed from the new town areas. Many examples built in the town walls and towerssuch as the altar of Titus Flavius Lucilius have been discovered near Porta Andetria during thepreservation archaeological research in 2001. It was built into the fi rst tower from the south side ofthe town gates. The tower was constructed from the large stone blocks where in the third row fromthe base level the altar of Titus Flavius Lucilius was built in. Considering the place where it was found near Porta Andetria, the altar of Titus Flavius Luciliuswas originally placed within the east Salonitan necropolis, as were some other military stelae ofthe soldiers from the 7 th legion. It is an exquisite example of the military tombstone constructedin the Salonitan stonemason workshop in the fi rst half of the 2 nd century, with its simple form andthe inscription on the front where all the military functions of the deceased are mentioned, andare represented on the sides in relief. The main story is the military career of Titus Flavius Luciliuspresented {{in the tradition of the}} usual military iconography. He is described on a right <b>side</b> <b>relief</b> asa centurio cohortis VIII Voluntariorum that was in Dalmatia of that time; from that military service hewas recruited as an equites singulares Augusti stationed on Celio in Rome where he won high militaryranks: vexillarius equitum singularium Augusti et summus curator equitum singularium Augusti. Hismilitary career ended as a vexillarius equitum singularium Augusti, what is described on the left side ofhis tombstone. As he stayed in Dalmatia when he was centurio cohortis VIII Volunatariorum, and thenwas transferred to Rome as a equites singulares Augusti, after honourable retirement during Hadrian’srule he returned to Salona where in the neighbouring military camps he had once started his militaryservice. He probably organized his life there, and slave Eulogus and his family were part of this. Thatis why his freed slave Eulogus chose Salonitan necropolis to build a tombstone for his patron, forhimself and his descendants. The altar of Titus Flavius Lucilius followed the specifi c development ofthe military iconography typical for the stonemason workshops close to the military camps, such asthe ones in Tiluri. Motifs of military tombstones are taken over and used by other workshops, what isobvious from the example of Lucilius’ altar that proves their activity in making military tombstonesin the 2 nd century. Lucilius’ altar is highly developed and popular form of the tombstone of the 2 ndcentury that was dominant in the Salonitan necropolises...|$|E
