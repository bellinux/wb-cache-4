Several of his collaborators were also removed. Edward Gierek was drafted as the new first secretary. Mieczysław Moczar, another strong contender, was not trusted (or was even blamed for the current debacle) by the Soviets.|$|E

25|$|Debra (née Whelan) Barone (Patricia Heaton) is Raymond's wife, {{and mother}} of Ally, Michael and Geoffrey. As a housewife, Debra claims she is {{frequently}} overworked, under-appreciated and <b>stressed</b> <b>out.</b> This leads to her yelling, largely because she {{has to deal with}} all the housework and her three rambunctious children with almost no assistance or support from Raymond; she constantly puts up with Marie's intrusiveness and criticism. On frequent occasions this frustration boils over and is vented towards Raymond. While Debra has a fractious relationship with Marie, she is shown to be fond of her in-laws on many occasions – particularly brother-in-law Robert.|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's <b>stressed</b> <b>out</b> reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E

Although everyone else goes back to work even more <b>stressed</b> <b>out,</b> Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin remarks that Savannah is a long way away, but does so in character; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the [...] "date" [...] was just part of the game.

Many reviews of the film in East Germany <b>stressed</b> <b>out</b> that the former war criminals had little to fear in the Federal Republic. Bill Niven wrote that the suggestion that the SS fled to West Germany was accentuated in the film more than in the novel, although Beyer was careful not to make explicit parallels between the camp and the FRG. Daniela Berghahn remarked that [...] "the film's production history illustrates how the 'Jewish question' was utilized for political ends": in the early 1960s, during and after the Eichmann Trial, the SED sought to [...] "maximize the propaganda value in a campaign to remind the world that many former Nazis were living in West Germany." ...|$|E

2500|$|Denise Youngblood {{wrote that}} {{although}} {{not the first}} to portray Stalin as [...] "war hero in chief" [...] – this was already done in pictures like The Battle of Stalingrad – The Fall of Berlin elevated him to a new status: [...] "it deified Stalin." [...] Richard Taylor pointed out the premier was the only decision maker in the plot, the only one responsible for the victory over Germany, and all other characters were either subservient or antagonistic. Stalin's stoic calm was <b>stressed</b> <b>out</b> by deliberately contrasting it to the hysterical rage of Hitler, or to the slow wit of Georgy Zhukov, who was portrayed in accordance with his political status in the late 1940s, after he was shunned by Stalin: Zhukov was not even among the generals who received Stalin in Berlin. Beside this, most characters – from Natasha to Gerd von Rundstedt – praise him as a great leader. Author Katerina Clark discerned that Stalin, beside his function as a great captain, was made the enabler of romantic relationship: before meeting him, Alexei was incapable of expressing his love to Natasha. Slavoj Žižek commented the leader played the part of the [...] "magician and the matchmaker who wisely leads the couple to reunion." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1975 Vysotsky {{made his}} third trip to France where he rather riskily visited his former tutor (and now a celebrated {{dissident}} emigre) Andrey Sinyavsky. Artist Mikhail Shemyakin, his new Paris friend (or a [...] "bottle-sharer", in Vladi's terms), recorded Vysotsky {{in his home}} studio. After a brief stay in England Vysotsky crossed the ocean and made his first Mexican concerts in April. Back in Moscow, there were changes at Taganka: Lyubimov went to Milan's La Scala on a contract and Anatoly Efros has been brought in, a director of radically different approach. His project, Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, caused a sensation. Critics praised Alla Demidova (as Ranevskaya) and Vladimir Vysotsky (as Lopakhin) powerful interplay, some describing {{it as one of}} the most dazzling in the history of the Soviet theater. Lyubimov, who disliked the piece, accused Efros of giving his actors [...] "the stardom malaise." [...] The 1976 Taganka's visit to Bulgaria resulted in Vysotskys's interview there being filmed and 15 songs recorded by Balkanton record label. On return Lyubimov made a move which many thought outrageous: declaring himself [...] "unable to work with this Mr. Vysotsky anymore" [...] he gave the role of Hamlet to Valery Zolotukhin, the latter's best friend. That was the time, reportedly, when <b>stressed</b> <b>out</b> Vysotsky started taking amphetamines.|$|E

[...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing.

It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside."
