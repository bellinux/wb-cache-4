5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that {{all she had to do}} was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram {{said in an}} interview that her role was on par with his, and she easily <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> on most occasions. Of her character in the film, Saran said that it was the best she has done so far. Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only high points of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy that takes a look at the serious nature of relationships between servants and employers. It was selected for the Toronto International Film Festival, which Saran attended.|$|E
25|$|In May, Jwala {{played for}} India at the 2015 Sudirman Cup {{as they were}} placed in group 1D, clubbed {{together}} with three-time winner Korea and Malaysia. The Malaysian team was buoyed by the return of former world no. 1 Lee Chong Wei from a dope-related suspension and that made things difficult for India. India started with a narrow 2–3 loss to Malaysia Saina Nehwal and the duo of Gutta and Ponnappa delivered the wins. Jwala and Ashwini <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> with their determined efforts that saw them upsetting the world no. 11 pair of Vivian Hoo and Woon Khe Wei 21–18, 19–21, 21–15.|$|E
5000|$|Greenvale Football club {{started in}} 1990 {{as a junior}} club by Les Norris, who died in April 2009. Greenvale has only been in {{operation}} as a senior club for {{a little over a}} decade, but already it has established itself as {{a force to be reckoned}} with in the powerful Essendon District Football League. Greenvale has won 3 senior premierships since the club was first founded. Greenvale had finished at the head of the ladder prior to the finals, and did so again in 2005 before reaching a second successive premiership play-off after an impressive 2nd semi final demolition of Keilor. The grand final turned into a nightmare, however, as rank outsiders Strathmore <b>stole</b> both <b>the</b> <b>show</b> and <b>the</b> flag with a hard-earned and well-deserved 10 point win. By 2005, the club was fielding fifteen teams in the Essendon District Football League.|$|R

25|$|It backfired spectacularly. Wood (48), Jaques (37), Michael Vaughan (53) and Harvey (47) {{all made}} {{entertaining}} knocks, {{but it was}} Anthony McGrath who <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> with a five-and-a-half-hour 165 not out - the grindstone of Yorkshire's amazing runchase, {{the highest in the}} Championship this season - indeed, the highest fourth-innings run chase in the club's history. Leicestershire's bowlers were smashed to all corners, Phil DeFreitas the only one who escaped with some respectability as he took two for 50 in eleven overs. Gibson, Leicestershire's best performer of the first innings, conceded 124 for no wicket the second time around.|$|E
25|$|Easter Sunday 2014, saw {{the return}} of Porsche to {{top-level}} sportscar racing in the World Endurance Championship event. However, it was Toyota who <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> with a dominant one-two. The Toyota TS040 Hybrid of Sébastien Buemi, Anthony Davidson and Nicolas Lapierre took victory by a clear lap over their teammates, Alex Wurz, Kazuki Nakajima and Stéphane Sarrazin, {{at the end of}} a race that was red-flagged before its scheduled finish courtesy of heavy rain. Porsche claimed a podium on its return with the 919 Hybrid. The partnership of Mark Webber, Timo Bernhard and Brendon Hartley took third, finishing two laps down on the winner and one down on the second-placed Toyota.|$|E
25|$|Again, the Oklahoma {{freshman}} <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Quarterback Sam Bradford {{finished the}} game connecting 21 of his 26 passes for 353yards and three touchdowns. The performance {{put him back}} atop the passing efficiency standings where {{he spent most of}} the early season. His passing efficiency for the season through Baylor was 180.4, ahead of Florida's Tim Tebow at 177.1. DeMarco Murray scored four touchdowns and averaged over seven yards on his 13rushing attempts. Murray was also named the Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week for his accomplishments. However, the Baylor offense also performed better than expected. The Sooners' ninth-ranked defense allowed Baylor to gain 450yards of total offense. Baylor running back Brandon Whitaker (from Edmond, Oklahoma) had 15carries for 149yards and 10catches for 68yards.|$|E

25|$|The opening match saw the semi-regular team of Sombra de Plata and Ricky Marvin faced {{off against}} the Stone brothers, {{also known as}} Los Bellos Stone (Chris and Alan Stone). Sombra de Plata and Marvin began working as a regular team in mid-1999 where their matches against Fugaz and Sangre Azteca in match that <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> earning four wrestlers {{standing}} ovations from the crowds. The success of this match earned all four a match at CMLL's biggest show of the year the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, which took place on September 24, 1999. This time Marvin and Sombra de Plata won the match. At the following year's CMLL 67th Anniversary Show Sombra de Plata teamed up with Mano Negra Jr. as they lost to Los Bello Stone. For the December 2000 show Sombra de Plata teamed up with his regular partner Marvin {{to take on the}} Stone brothers.|$|E
25|$|A massive batting {{effort from}} Warwickshire {{compounded}} with a remarkable second-innings bowling spell from Heath Streak and a spineless Gloucestershire effort in general, saw Warwickshire {{move to the}} top of the Division One table. It started all right enough for the hosts at Bristol, as a marathon three-hour fifty from James Pearson and 23 extras sent them to 254 on the first day. However, a partnership of 151 between Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott lifted Warwickshire into the ascendancy, as no Gloucestershire bowler found the required bite, and everyone of the top ten except Michael Powell went into double figures as Warwickshire amassed 473 in nearly 150 overs. Then, Streak <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> As Streak grabbed four wickets in the first hour, Gloucestershire were quickly 20 for 5, and despite a rescuing effort from Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher, Gloucestershire were all out for 217 - two runs short of making Warwickshire bat again.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti's studies {{began in}} Mackenzie College in São Paulo, but the limited world {{of art in}} Brazil {{was not enough to}} satiate her curious mind and so she left for Berlin in 1912. Europe still {{remained}} an extremely important agent in defining artistic tendencies during this era. Hence, when Anita Malfatti went to Germany and studied with important artists Fritz Burger-Muhlfeld (1867–1927), Lovis Corinth (1858–1925) and Ernst Bischoff-Culm her influences and creative exposure were inflated. During this period she studied German Expressionism. German Expressionism emphasized the color pallette and artists were expected to paint with expressive amounts of emotion that was emphasized and where subjects of the work were frequently altered or jarred. A huge influence in her artistic style lay in her exposure to the Armory Show in Cologne from May to September 1912. At the show a conglomeration of artists were exposed. Although there were many post-impressionist painters exhibited, Cubism <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> by far. Homer Boss was included in the show and Malfatti went to study with him in New York in 1915. Malfatti also studied under artists George Bridgman, Dimitri Romanoffsky (s.d.-1971), however it was her experience with Homer Boss at the Independent School of Art that was most influential. Homer Boss was a huge impact on Malfatti's style because of his comprehensive studies of the human anatomy. He stressed the idea of understanding the muscular body which helped Malfatti to hone her own technique. New York was central in celebrating Cubism and Malfatti was an exceptional student within the Independent School of Art. Thus she was exposed to European style, which by the early twentieth centuries was even being forged with other styles. Europe's views on Modernism included a subjective treatment toward subjects as well as a highly repellent attitude towards the artistic movements proceeding modernism such as Realism or Romanticism. Malfatti’s exposure to the European world of art allowed her a glimpse into an artistic world that she could never have known in São Paulo and gave her the more global viewpoint that she would pass on to other artists as well.|$|E

Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette praised the performance, writing that the dancers [...] "nearly <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> in their employer’s absence during another costume change, set to Illuminati's woozy thump".

500|$|... "Media Blitz" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators particularly praising {{the performance of}} Adam Scott, although some said the subplot with Chris and Ann was less effective. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook wrote, [...] "Party Down vet absolutely <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> on Parks and Recreation. ... Scott was a machine of mania, a dork gone wild, who gave the rapidly unraveling Ben {{just the right amount}} of crazy while completely cracking us up." [...] Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] continue a long period of excellent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode. Sundermann said Scott's slightly over-the-top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a straight man character. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews. Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza's performance and said the overall episode was very funny, but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly.|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "The Sponge Who Could Fly" [...] {{was adapted}} in 2009 {{as a stage}} musical at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, and later in South Africa. Actor Charles Brunton {{originated}} the role of Squidward, later recalling that he loved the character, and the [...] "fun [...] trying to re-create a well established cartoon character into a live performance on stage." [...] Brunton prepared for the role by buying nine DVDs of the series, acting out Squidward's part in each episode, in his bedroom. He said, [...] "it took ages to perfect the voice {{and the way he}} used his arms". Brunton's performance and the musical were well received by most critics. A critic from The Public Reviews wrote, [...] "Charles Brunton as Squidward really <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> for us, his character was nailed to perfection, from his comic acting, voice and mannerisms this was a faultless performance". In his review for The Northern Echo, Viv Hardwick said, [...] "Charles Brunton makes a convincing Squidward". The role was played by Chris van Rensburg in South Africa.|$|E

After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500. The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During [...] "Pinball Wizard", Abbie Hoffman took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of John Sinclair before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during [...] "See Me, Feel Me", the sun rose, almost as if on cue.

Heading the tour bill was the 16-year-old Shapiro, followed by the other five acts, the last of which was The Beatles. The band used the nationwide tour {{as an opportunity to}} generate further interest in [...] "Please Please Me", and the song was regularly included in their performances throughout the tour. The Beatles, though lowest on the bill, were immensely popular during the tour, as Gordon Sampson, a journalist with the tour, observed. His report did not include the word [...] "Beatlemania"; the term would not be coined until some months later, but the phenomenon was evident, with Sampson writing that [...] "a great reception went to the colourfully dressed Beatles, who almost <b>stole</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> for the audience repeatedly called for them while other artists were performing!".

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} the NBC/Comcast reference here [...] "wasn't exactly a well of laughs, but Baldwin's Donaghy kept the story entertaining enough to want to follow it."

[...] In conclusion, Canning gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. James Poniewozik of Time magazine said that the main story [...] "played more like a subplot even though it gave the episode its title". He added {{that there were some}} fine moments, and that overall Liz and Jack's plots [...] "have the potential to give the show some interesting forward movement".
