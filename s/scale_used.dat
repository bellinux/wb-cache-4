5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricane Severity Index (HSI) {{is another}} <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> and rates the {{severity}} {{of all types of}} tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields. The HSI is a 0 to 50 point scale, allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size. Points are awarded on a sliding scale, with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.|$|E

Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales, which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds. The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems, within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basins. The <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean and is adapted by Meteo France, for use in various French territories, including New Caledonia and French Polynesia.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} of sustained winds {{recommended by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies {{is that of a}} 10-minute average at a height of 10m (33ft). However, the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10m (33ft) above the surface. The <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, {{have criticized}} the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the Richter <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale; however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are defined}} as being warm cored, non-frontal synoptic cyclones, that develop over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. They are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked, by the World Meteorological Organisation's Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales. The <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in; with for example the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale and the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the Western Hemisphere. All of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds, which are either observed, measured or estimated using various techniques, over a period between one and ten minutes.|$|E

25|$|A {{pathologist}} {{examines the}} tissue under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist can usually determine {{the type of}} cancer and its grade. Here, 'grade' refers to a <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> to represent concisely the predicted growth rate of the tumour and its tendency to spread, and this {{is determined by the}} degree to which the cancer cells appear abnormal when examined under a microscope. Low-grade sarcomas, although cancerous, are defined as those that are less likely to metastasise. High-grade sarcomas are defined as those more likely to spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{breast cancer}} grade is {{assessed}} by {{comparison of the}} breast cancer cells to normal breast cells. The closer to normal the cancer cells are, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the <b>scale</b> <b>used).</b> The most widely used grading system is the Nottingham scheme; details are provided {{in the discussion of}} breast cancer grade.|$|E

25|$|Evans had met George Russell {{during his}} tenure with Lucy Reed. Russell's first {{impression}} of Evans was negative ("this {{is going to be}} like pulling teeth all day"), but when he secretly heard Evans play, he completely changed his mind. Russell was then developing his magnum opus, the treatise Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, in which he exposed that the Lydian mode was more compatible with tonality than the major <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> in most music. This new concept was ground-breaking in jazz, and would soon influence musicians like Miles Davis. Evans, who had already been acquainted with these ideas before, began to work with him in 1956.|$|E

He published a clarifying 3rd Bridge diagram related to this subject in 2012 (and a more elaborate version of this diagram in 2017). Besides his output as an inventor and noise musician, he starts to focus on music education, and participatory art. At first Landman started giving musicological lectures at venues, festivals and music related educational institutes. Landman published the essay 3rd Bridge Helix - From Experimental Punk to Ancient Chinese Music & the Universal Physical Laws of Consonance in which he clarifies the relation between this prepared guitar technique and the consonant values present in non-Western scales, especially the musical <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> on the Ancient Chinese musical instrument the guqin. He published an extensive 8 chapter guide on how to prepare a guitar, that was later transformed to the book Nice Noise.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Treisman, a UCLA {{political}} scientist, {{has criticized}} Freedom House's assessment of Russia. Treisman {{has pointed out}} that Freedom House ranks Russia's political rights on the same level as the United Arab Emirates, which, according to Freedom House, is a federation of absolute monarchies with no hint of democracy anywhere in the system. Freedom House also ranks Russia's civil liberties on the same scale as those of Yemen. In Yemen, according to the constitution, Sharia law is the only source of legislation, and allows assaults and killings of women for alleged immoral behaviour. Criticising the president is illegal in Yemen. Treisman contrasts Freedom House's ranking with the Polity IV <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> by academics and in which Russia has a much better score. In the Polity IV scale, Saudi Arabia is a consolidated autocracy (-10), while the United States is a consolidated democracy (+10); Russia has a score of +4, while United Arab Emirates has a score of -8.|$|E

25|$|In {{traditional}} Western notation, the <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> for {{a composition}} is usually indicated by a key signature {{at the beginning}} to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes {{the relationship of the}} overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the arrival of the storm, Governor Felix P. Camacho {{declared}} a state of emergency for the island of Guam and allocated $250,000 in funds for relief efforts. A tropical cyclone condition of readiness (TCCOR), a warning <b>scale</b> <b>used</b> by the military on the island, was placed at level one, the highest on the scale. Rota was also placed under a TCCOR at level 3. By the afternoon of September29, roughly 250 residents had sought refuge in shelters across the island. All flights to and from Guam were canceled and the Team Anderson Air Show was rescheduled. Five ships and a submarine from the United States Navy moved out to sea to avoid the storm; however, one submarine was unable to leave and remained at port during the storm. A total of 100 people from the Red Cross disaster team were deployed in Guam to prepare for any damage caused by the storm.|$|E
