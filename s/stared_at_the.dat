5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine are {{regarded}} as the pioneers of the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing, a term coined by Sounds journalists in the late 1980s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor". The band's releases on Creation Records influenced other shoegazing acts, including Slowdive, Ride and Lush, and {{are regarded}} as providing a platform to allow the bands to become recognised. Following the release of Loveless (1991), My Bloody Valentine were [...] "poised for a popular breakthrough", although never achieved mainstream success. However, the band are noted to have been [...] "profoundly influential {{in the direction of}} '90s alternative rock", according to AllMusic. [...] In 2017, a study of AllMusic's database indicated My Bloody Valentine as its 26th most frequently cited influence on other artists.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the music}} on Ecstasy has been criticised as being [...] "directionless and floundered about within the {{framework}} of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas," [...] which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that [...] "even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and it made us realise that we were still too twee". In response to the band's [...] "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term [...] "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory, was coined by Sounds journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor".|$|E
2500|$|A popular legend {{dating back}} to the 1960s, it has been claimed that several people took LSD and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun, going blind as a result. [...] This myth {{appeared}} in 1967 on the cop show Dragnet, and twice in the mainstream news media. [...] The legend is considered to be unfounded, since in 1968 the source of the hoax, Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, admitted that he had completely made up the story because of his [...] "concern over illegal LSD use by children." [...] After the sun-gazing on LSD story was widely publicized, a small number of case reports were published in the medical literature which describe this phenomenon temporarily occurring. In one case, the patient was a teenage girl described as having a [...] "hysterical personality" [...] who heard warnings about staring at the sun under LSD in a school anti-drug lecture and thought this [...] "would be a neat thing," [...] and in another case the patient had paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E
2500|$|In a documentary, Jay-Z {{revealed}} being {{inspired by}} a segment of Jackson's tour in which she stood in silence and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd for several minutes to massive applause; imitating the technique during his own concerts. Beyoncé has also been reported to emulate a similar tactic during several live shows. JoJo praised the tour, tweeting [...] "Janet Jackson Velvet Rope Tour DVD. Freaking out. Mesmerized. Living. Can't stop yelling at the tv screen. Omg." [...] JoJo later recorded the album Agápē while The Velvet Rope Tour played on a studio television for inspiration. Canadian singer Anjulie became [...] "obsessed with music" [...] and [...] "developed [...] through watching" [...] the tour, recalling [...] "I remember seeing The Velvet Rope Tour and then getting the VHS of that, putting it on slow motion so that I could learn every single dance move." [...] British artist Rowdy Superstar commended Jackson's performance of [...] "If" [...] and [...] "stayed up the whole night learning all the choreography from the Velvet Rope Tour." [...] BBC Asian Network presenter DJ Kayper called Jackson [...] "hands down, the best female performer of all time", praising the tour's rendition of [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] in which Jackson dances with nunchucks.|$|E
