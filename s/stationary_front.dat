A wide variety of weather can be found along a <b>stationary</b> <b>front,</b> but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

5|$|By November 30, {{the last}} day of the Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> extended across eastern Cuba into the southwestern Caribbean Sea. On December 1, a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of Panama, and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low-level center. The low remained nearly stationary for the next several days, and it gradually became separated from the <b>stationary</b> <b>front.</b> Convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and moderate divergence. Increased wind shear deteriorated the system on December 2, though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift. On December 3 a mid-level circulation developed about 140miles (225km) north of the surface center. Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200UTC on December 4 while located about 345miles (560km) south of Kingston, Jamaica; initially, the depression was forecast to track north-northeastward and pass over western Haiti.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a <b>stationary</b> <b>front,</b> organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within an environment of low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening, Mekkhala tracked northwestward {{and made}} landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar of the Philippines at around 15:00 Philippine Standard Time (07:00UTC), where Typhoon Hagupit also made landfall the month before. Both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Mekkhala to {{a tropical storm}} on January17, due to land interaction weakening the storm significantly. Mekkhala weakened further while crossing the Bicol Region on January 18, leading the JTWC to downgrade it to a tropical depression when it turned northward and emerged into the Philippine Sea. Late on the same day, the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression, and shortly after the JTWC issued the final warning as strong wind shear exposed the LLCC. The tropical depression drifted northeastward and maintained its exposed low-level circulation east of Luzon, until the system was completely absorbed by a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> early on January 21.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E

The degree of baroclinicity is examined using National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis temperature and zonal wind fields over a two-year period for Southeast Texas, yielding classifications of barotropic, weakly baroclinic, and strongly baroclinic for the background environment. Weakly baroclinic environments accounted for half of the days throughout the two-year period. Barotropic environments occurred most frequently during summer and strongly baroclinic environments occurred most frequently in winter, although less often than weakly baroclinic environments. A climatology of storm types, based on dynamical forcing (i. e., weak forcing, drylines, cold <b>fronts,</b> warm <b>fronts,</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>fronts</b> and upper level disturbances) and precipitation structure (i. e., isolated, scattered, widespread, linear, unorganized and leading-line/trailing stratiform), was compiled and compared to the baroclinicity designations. Non-frontal storm types (i. e., weak forcing, drylines and upper level disturbances) are typical of barotropic environments, while frontal storm types (i. e.,warm, cold and <b>stationary</b> <b>fronts)</b> are typical of weakly and strongly baroclinic environments. Storm events and drop-size distributions (DSD) were identified from surface rainfall data collected by a Joss-Waldvogel disdrometer located in College Station, Texas. The DSDs were compared by baroclinicity and storm type. The barotropic DSD is weighted towards the largest drops because of the stronger convection and stratiform precipitation in the weak forcing and dryline storm types, while the strongly baroclinic DSD is weighted towards the smallest drops because of the weaker convection from the warm <b>fronts</b> and <b>stationary</b> <b>fronts.</b> The weakly baroclinic DSD is weighted more evenly towards small and large drops than the barotropic and strongly baroclinic DSDs because of the conflicting microphysical processes in the different storm types.

On 4November 2011, a frontal system associated with another low-pressure area monitored by FU Berlin, designated Quinn, spawned a second low-pressure system inland near Marseille, which was subsequently named Rolf by the university. An upper-level trough on the European mainland stalled as it approached the Pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as Rolf. Heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern France and northwestern Italy, resulting in widespread landslides and flooding. On 5November, Rolf slowed while stationed above the Massif Central, maintaining a pressure of 1000mbar (29.53inHg). A <b>stationary</b> <b>front,</b> stationed between Madrid and Lisbon, approached Rolf the same day, with the cold front later encountering and become associated with Rolf, which would continue for several days.|$|E
5|$|In early January2016, a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> was {{draped across}} the western Caribbean; a non-tropical low {{developed}} along this boundary over northwestern Cuba by January6. Moving northeast {{ahead of the}} subtropical jet stream, the system acquired a surface vortex the following day to the northeast of the Bahamas. Initial conditions, including strong wind shear, low sea surface temperatures, and dry air, inhibited formation of a tropical cyclone as the storm moved northeast toward Bermuda. The large system featured gale-force winds, with maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h). On January8, the system passed about 75mi (120km) north of Bermuda, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the islands. On January9, an anomalous blocking pattern prevented the cyclone from continuing along a seasonal northeasterly track. Instead, the storm turned east-southeast into a region slightly more favorable for subtropical development. Hurricane-force winds developed around {{the core of the}} cyclone on January10 as it deepened to 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg), though convective activity near the center remained sparse. Separated from the jet stream, the cyclone dove south-southeast over the central Atlantic around a mid-latitude trough. Slight weakening took place on January11.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> and significant moisture from Hurricane Igor resulted in unprecedented rainfall across parts of eastern Newfoundland, leading to widespread flooding. In Bonavista, more than 10in (250mm) was estimated to have fallen between September20 and 21. In St. Lawrence, a confirmed 9.37in (238mm) of rain fell, ranking Igor as the third-wettest tropical cyclone in Canadian history. The widespread nature of heavy rains ranked the storm as a 1-in-100 year event. Similar to the rainfall, winds across eastern Newfoundland were exacerbated by {{the interaction of the}} front and Igor. In Cape Pine, near where the center of Igor tracked, sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts to 107mph (172km/h) battered the area. No records for sustained winds or gusts were broken; however, it was noted as a 1-in-50 year event even with powerful winter storms taken into account. Along the coast, Igor produced a storm tide of 3.5ft (1.1m). Additionally, offshore waves reached immense heights, measured up to 83.6ft (25.5m); one buoy reported a wave of 92ft (28m) but data is subject to further analysis to verify it.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a review}} of recent studies of {{extended}} oscillatory systems that are subjected to periodic temporal forcing. The periodic forcing breaks the continuous time translation symmetry and leaves a discrete set of stable uniform phase states. The multiplicity of phase states allows for front structures that shift the oscillation phase by ÃÂ€/n where n= 1, 2,Ã¢Â€Â¦, hereafter ÃÂ€/n-fronts. The main concern here is with front instabilities and their implications on pattern formation. Most theoretical {{studies have focused on}} the 2 : 1 resonance where the system oscillates at half the driving frequency. All front solutions in this case are ÃÂ€-fronts. At high forcing strengths only <b>stationary</b> <b>fronts</b> exist. Upon decreasing the forcing strength the <b>stationary</b> <b>fronts</b> lose stability to pairs of counter-propagating fronts. The coexistence of counter-propagating fronts allows for traveling domains and spiral waves. In the 4 : 1 resonance stationary ÃÂ€-fronts coexist with ÃÂ€/ 2 -fronts. At high forcing strengths the stationary ÃÂ€-fronts are stable and standing two-phase waves, consisting of successive oscillatory domains whose phases differ by ÃÂ€,, prevail. Upon decreasing the forcing strength the stationary ÃÂ€-fronts lose stability and decompose into pairs of propagating ÃÂ€/ 2 -fronts. The instability designates a transition from standing two-phase waves to traveling four-phase waves. Analogous decomposition instabilities have been found numerically in higher 2 n: 1 resonances. The available theory is used to account for a few experimental observations made on the photosensitive BelousovÃ¢Â€Â“Zhabotinsky reaction subjected to periodic illumination.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Florence {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} which developed in late October along a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> located 1,150mi (1,850km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The low gradually detached from the front and began developing convective banding features. The system was not fully tropical as the strongest winds were recorded a couple hundred miles from the center, leading to the system being classified a subtropical cyclone on the morning of November 2. Minor intensification followed shortly after and the subtropical depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm. This was based on ship reports of 40mph (65km/h) sustained winds associated with the system. By November 3, the storm became slightly disorganized and was downgraded to a subtropical depression. By the afternoon, the subtropical system began to undergo a transition from a subtropical system to tropical system. Later that day, the storm was classified Tropical Depression Eleven while located 875mi (1,400km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The depression was moving towards the northwest at 8mph (13km/h) and the same general motion was expected as a large upper-level low situated over the system was forecast to move towards the northeast, leading to Eleven moving around the periphery of the low.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of a}} non-tropical cold-core {{upper level}} low that drifted southward into the subtropics. The low interacted with a cold front, {{which resulted in the}} development of a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> over the Bahamas on October10. As the cold low drifted southward, a surface low developed on October12. The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October15 as it merged with the upper-level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida. Later that day, the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression. The storm remained stationary over warm water, with sea surface temperatures around , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics. Around 0000 UTC on October16, it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm. Later that day, the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low-level circulation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the storms which attained at least tropical storm strength in 1940, five additional tropical depressions were analyzed by the HURDAT reanalysis project to have developed during the season. Due to their weak intensity, however, they were not added to HURDAT. On September 2, a closed low-pressure area was detected in the open Atlantic Ocean southeast of Bermuda and was analyzed as a tropical depression. At the time, the disturbance had a minimum pressure of at least 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg). The depression initially moved to the southeast, but later recurved towards the northwest {{over the next two}} days. On September 4, the S.S. West Kebar en route for Boston, Massachusetts reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), which would be considered as tropical storm-force winds. The depression later moved to the northeast before it was absorbed by a <b>stationary</b> <b>front</b> on September 7. Since there was only one report that the disturbance may have reached tropical storm intensity, it was not included in HURDAT. Later on September 10, a trough was detected in a similar region in the Atlantic where the first depression formed. The trough later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression. The cyclone moved slowly to the east and did not further intensify before dissipating on September 13.|$|E
