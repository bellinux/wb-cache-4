2500|$|This {{generalization}} of state terror tactics has been explained {{in part by}} the information received by the Argentine militaries in the infamous School of Americas and also by French instructors from the secret services, who taught them [...] "counter-insurgency" [...] tactics first experimented during the Algerian War (1954–62). In 1976 there was a successful series of Montoneros bomb attacks in which the general commanding the Federal Police, Cesáreo Cardozo was killed. Lieutenant-General Jorge Videla narrowly escaped three Montoneros assassination attempts between February 1976 and April 1977. On 14 December 1975, the Montoneros conducted an assassination attempt against Navy Commandant Admiral Emilio Massera. In an underwater mining attack on the Itati yacht of the Argentine Navy, the luxury craft was badly damaged by the explosives but Massera escaped unscathed. As pressure mounted on the Montoneros, the urban guerrillas struck back. On 29 April 1976, the guerrillas planted explosives on six Mirage IIIEA interceptors from Grupo 8 but this attack was foiled by alert sentries. On 2 July 1976 a Claymore <b>shrapnel</b> <b>mine</b> exploded at the headquarters of the Federal Police in west Buenos Aires during a secret meeting of the police leadership, killing 21, and injuring 60 others. On 12 September 1976, a car bomb destroyed a bus filled with police officers in Rosario, killing 9 policemen and 2 civilians and injuring at least 50.|$|E

50|$|The Mini MS-803 {{is a small}} South African {{produced}} Claymore type landmine. The {{design is}} very simple, with a convex brown polystyrene case containing a PE9 plastic explosive charge with three hundred 6 x 8 millimeter cylindrical steel fragments embedded into it. The mine is supported by two pairs of wire legs, {{which can be used}} to stack the mines. On the top of the mine is a small hole for inserting a detonator, which is surrounded with a PETN booster charge. The mine is normally used with an S4 electrical detonator connected to an M57 electrical firing device which is also used with the similar but larger <b>Shrapnel</b> <b>mine</b> Mk 2. The mine could also be used with MUV type pull detonators and tripwires, but after the Ottawa mine ban treaty South Africa has said that it will not use this mine with victim activated fuzes.|$|E
50|$|For the Infantry Formation, this {{normally}} {{means at}} the Infantry School, where training commences with two weeks familiarisation {{training on the}} weapons found in a rifle platoon other than the R4. This includes training on pyrotechnics and flares, <b>shrapnel</b> <b>mines,</b> hand and rifle grenades, the 60mm patrol mortar, the RPG7 recoilless rocket launcher, the general purpose machine gun (FN MAG or Denel SS77) and the multiple 40mm grenade launcher. This phase may also include familiarisation with night vision equipment. Once mastered, a rifleman is next schooled on conventional operations, {{with an emphasis on}} section battle drills and trench routine. This entails spending many a night digging and occupying trench lines and posting sentries. Full defensive fire plans, including all platoon weapons, will also be executed. A rifleman is introduced to the art of patrolling and laying ambushes - skills equally useful on the conventional battlefield as during counterinsurgency campaigns and for peace support. Also practiced are vehicle movement, countermine and defile drills and procedures for occupying covert temporary bases.|$|R

Further details are unknown, since {{the composition of the}} material is classified. The monocoque steel v-hull provides protection against small arms fire, artillery shell <b>shrapnel,</b> anti-personnel/tank <b>mines</b> and IEDs. Front wheel arches are designed to be blown away to free blast pockets. The design is meant to follow the basic principle of US MRAP vehicles for peacekeeping missions.|$|R

50|$|The <b>shrapnel</b> {{from these}} <b>mines</b> can even disable some {{armoured}} vehicles, by puncturing their tires and—in {{the case of}} soft-skinned vehicles—also penetrating the skin and damaging internal components or injuring personnel. Because fragmentation mines generally contain a much larger charge than blast mines, they can cause severe damage to an unarmoured vehicle which runs directly over one.|$|R

50|$|Bounding mines {{have a small}} lifting charge that, when activated, {{launches}} {{the main}} body of the mine out of the ground before it detonates at around chest height. This produces a more lethal spray of shrapnel over a larger area. One such—the US M16 mine—can cause injuries up to 200 m away. The steel <b>shrapnel</b> makes bounding <b>mines</b> easy to detect, so they may be surrounded by Minimum metal mines to make mine clearance harder.|$|R
