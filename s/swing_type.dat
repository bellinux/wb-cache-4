40|$|AbstractSwinging types {{provide an}} {{integrated}} framework for specifying software {{on the basis}} of many-sorted logic in terms of “static” functions and relations as well as “dynamic” transition systems. <b>Swinging</b> <b>types</b> combine equational, Horn and modal logic for the purpose of using evaluation and proof rules from all three logics for rapid prototyping and verification. A swinging specification separates from each other visible sorts that denote domains of data identified by their structure; hidden sorts that denote domains of data identified by their behavior in response to observers; μ-predicates, i. e., least relations representing inductive(ly provable) properties of a system; and ν-predicates, i. e., greatest relations representing complementary “coinductive” properties, which often describe behavioral aspects “in the infinity”. Programming paradigms, such as functional, relational or state-oriented ones, and specification formalisms, such as algebraic, set-theoretic, rule-based, net-based, coalgebraic, order-theoretic ones, usually handle either static or dynamic components, either structural or behavioral aspects of a system. <b>Swinging</b> <b>types</b> admit the integrated design and analysis of these components and aspects. An integrated model is obtained naturally if all entities (objects, states, etc.) of the system are presented as terms built up of constructors for visible or hidden sorts, functions are specified in terms of conditional equations (=functional programs), least relations in terms of Horn clauses (=logic programs or transition system specifications) and greatest relations in terms of co-Horn clauses. Data equalities are either structural or behavioral, the former being least, the latter being greatest solutions of axioms that are determined by (components of) the type's signature. This paper mainly presents the theoretical foundations of <b>swinging</b> <b>types,</b> such as standard (term) models, criteria for structural and behavioral consistency, and proof rules. <b>Swinging</b> <b>types</b> admit flexible design guidelines, tailored to particular objectives or application fields.

No other international classifications for CSE have been proposed, and neither the WHO nor Raleigh criteria have been uniformly accepted for epidemiological studies.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION and AIM In children, {{hemiplegia}} is {{a common}} consequence of cerebral palsy (CP) and causes altered selective motor control, weakness and spasticity. A correct classification of children with CP is important to assist diagnosis and clinical decision-making. The classification of spastic hemiplegia proposed by Winters et al. is widely accepted in literature. Type I {{is defined by the}} presence of drop foot in <b>swing,</b> <b>type</b> II by the persistence of equinism throughout the gait cycle, with a possible knee hyperextension in stance. Foot-contact event detection is fundamental in clinical gait analysis, but it is particularly challenging in children with CP due to initial toecontact. In a recent work, we described an algorithm for the automatic segmentation of gait cycles from the foot-switch signal that it is applicable also to pathological gait. The aim of this contribution is to apply this method to a population of CP children to study their foot-floor contact sequences, considering also the sub-phases of stance. The activation patterns of tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) helped us in the interpretation of the result...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to perform both swing speed test and impact precision test to ascertain what <b>swing</b> <b>type</b> determines an effective impact. Methods: Seven golfers from a college team (handicap: 0 – 12) were recruited to complete a swing speed test and impact precision test using a 5 -iron club. A force plate and electromyography (EMG) system were used to collect data in the swing speed test to compare the difference between two motion sequences. High speed video cameras were used to determine the displacement of rotation center for impact precision test. Results: The results showed a significant difference (p <  0. 01) in clubhead speed with different motion sequences and muscle contraction patterns. In the impact precision test, the displacement of the rotation center which defined as the inner center point of the C 7 was significantly different (p <  0. 05) between different ball impacted marks on club face. Conclusion: The vertical peak ground reaction force on left foot occurring before impact and the left latissimus dorsi contracting prior to the right pectoralis major represent a superior skill by allowing the club to strike the ball with normal collision at a faster speed...|$|E
