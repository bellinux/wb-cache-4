5000|$|In certain jurisdictions' patent law, {{industrial}} applicability or industrial application is a patentability requirement {{according to which}} a patent can only be granted for an invention which is <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>application,</b> i.e. for an invention which can be made or used {{in some kind of}} industry. In this context, the concept of [...] "industry" [...] is far-reaching: it includes agriculture, for instance. An example of invention which would not be <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> is [...] "a method of contraception ... to be applied in the private and personal sphere of a human being".|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{overriding}} requirements {{for a patent}} to be granted under United Kingdom patent law. Firstly, {{there must have been}} an invention.

5000|$|At the European Patent Office (EPO), the {{requirement}} that an invention is <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> an <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> has generally been taken to {{be more or less}} automatically fulfilled but a 2005 decision of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO saw this requirement analysed in new detail. In decision T870/04 it was held that the mere fact that a substance can be made in some way {{does not necessarily mean that}} {{the requirement}}s of [...] are fulfilled, unless there is also some [...] "profitable use" [...] for which the substance can be employed.|$|R
40|$|Laccases {{represent}} versatile catalysts {{being able}} to oxidize {{a wide range of}} aromatic substrates and are <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> several <b>industrial</b> <b>applications</b> based on both oxidative degradation reactions and synthetic chemistry. The range of laccase based synthetic reactions is extremely wide. Laccases are able to catalyze transformation of antibiotics based on both -lactams functionalization and phtalides functionalization. These enzymes can also catalyze derivatization of amino acids to obtain metabolically stable amino acid analogues, maximizing biological response while minimizing toxicity, thus representing an useful system for drug development. Biomolecules having antioxidative and anticancer activity can also be produced by laccase-mediated reactions of flavonoids oxidative coupling and phenoxazinones synthesis. Application of laccases to production of new derivatives of the hormones resveratrol, 17 ß-estradiol, totarol and isoeugenol and oligomerization products of substituted imidazoles was also reported, with applications for pharmacological purposes due to hormonal activity of the products. The enzymatic preparation of aromatic polymeric materials by the action of laccases represents a viable and non-toxic alternative to the usual formaldehyde-based chemical production of these compounds and it has been reported for several substrates such as 2, 6 -dimethylphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid and 3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, aniline and acrylamide. Moreover, laccase-mediated biografting of phenols or certain other types of low-molecular weight compounds provides a method for tailoring the surface of lignocellulosics or for adhesion enhancement in binderless wood boards under mild conditions and usually without harmful solvents. Laccase-mediated modification of lignocellulosic materials is accomplished through two main routes: coupling of low-molecular weight compounds onto lignocellulosic materials and laccase mediated cross-linking of lignin molecules in situ. Depending on the choice of laccase substrate, properties such as improved strength properties, increased antimicrobial resistance, or hydrophilicity/ hydrophobicity can be imparted to lignocellulosic materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{exhaustion}} of rights, with general applicability in what concerns the intellectual property rights, implies that the patent holder loses {{a part of his}} prerogatives as an inventor {{as a result of the}} exhaustion of his right,from the moment the object of its patented invention is marketed by him or with his approval. But the approach to the exhaustion of rights in the Member-States of the European Union has been a danger to the good operation of the single market. However, the regulation, at the Community level, of the exhaustion of rights theory has solved this difficulty as well. The implementation of patents in the Member-States of the European Union – as long as the novelty conditions of the invention, of an inventive activity, are fulfilled and it is <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> having an <b>industrial</b> <b>application</b> – is an acknowledgement of the importance of the research, development and innovation sector at the level of the European Union both from the perspective of the material benefits as well as from that of the acknowledgement and guarantee of the right to renown and reputation of the inventor. The distinction between the three types of patents regulated at the levelof the Member-States of the European Union is made at the level of the legal protection, of the costs and of the possibilities of resolution of disputes that may arise from the exercise of the rights given to the patent beneficiaries. A comparison between the present European patent and the patents in the USA or Japan, from the point of view of costs, makes clear the excessive costs of obtaining a European patent (as high as eight times the cost in Japan, for example). The solution identified by the European legislator was to establish the Community patent. The preservation of the role of the European Patent Office (the same institution involved in the European patenting process) is combined with the accessibility of patenting costs for the patent applicants (especially for small and medium enterprises for whom they are intended), with the establishment of a single, unitary set of procedural rules and with a unitary and compulsory legal interpretation in the entire European Union, meant to lower the cost of the Community patent to half the cost of the European patent. intellectual property rights, development, innovation, {{theory of the}} exhaustion of rights...|$|R
50|$|The {{substantive}} {{examination of}} European patent applications includes {{the examination of}} patentability of the claimed invention, i.e. whether the invention is not excluded as unpatentable subject-matter by policy, whether the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>application.</b> In addition, the invention must be sufficiently disclosed in the application, and the claims must be clear and concise.|$|E
5000|$|... {{excludes}} [...] "methods {{for treatment}} of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body" [...] from patentability, because these methods are regarded as not <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>application.</b> The purpose of this exclusion is [...] "to deny patent protection to methods which serve medical purposes, {{so that no one}} could be hampered in the practice of medicine by patent legislation." ...|$|E
5000|$|But the {{patentable}} {{subject matter}} test of Article 52(2) and (3) {{is only the first}} step towards patentability, the first hurdle. Computer programs can also be refused and are often refused on the ground of lack of inventive step. This is the second hurdle, which should not mixed up with the first hurdle. As a Board of appeal put it in T 258/03 (Reasons 4.6) in relation {{to the fact that the}} [...] "contribution approach" [...] was no longer applicable, are aware that our comparatively broad interpretation of the term [...] "invention" [...] in Article 52(1) EPC will include activities which are so familiar that their technical character tends to be overlooked, such as the act of writing using pen and paper. Needless to say, however, this does not imply that all methods involving the use of technical means are patentable. They still have to be new, represent a non-obvious technical solution to a technical problem, and be <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

40|$|Computer {{programs}} must give a technical effect that goes beyond"normal physical interaction"to {{be considered to}} belong to a technical field. The invention shall be be <b>susceptible</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>application,</b> which means that {{it should be possible to}} reproduce or use in any other industrial way. The reqirement that the invention shall be new means that the technique must not be previously known because of patents, published articles, etc. That an invention shall be a contribution to the state of the art in a technical field means that the invention shall not be obvious to invent for a person skilled in the art. Patents do effect the innovation among the inventers, but in most industries most inventions would be invented independent if there was a patent system or not. Only in pharmaceuticals- and chemicals industries, the patent is of a great importance. Patents are probably of lesser importance for the computer industry than for those industries, even though the industry is of great importance for many other industries and therefor, the patent system can be of great importance for some computer-implemented inventions as well. There is a risque the the competition is negatively affected by the patent system, becuase of the monopoly it gives. I believe, though, that the gain of the patent system compensates for the risque of imperfections in the market. The free movement for goods, persons, services and capital will probably not be affected if the proposal of the directive about patentibility of computer-implemented invention will get passed...|$|E
