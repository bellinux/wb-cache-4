5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100.

Although <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E

Costs have been incurred from business disruption, replacement of damaged parts and insured losses. Ash fall impacts on critical infrastructure can also cause multiple knock-on effects, which may disrupt many different sectors and services.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the <b>storm,</b> <b>water</b> access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
5|$|In state {{legislative}} assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK {{was returned to}} power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, {{as well as for}} the restoration of water bodies and tanks. As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to rejuvenate local water bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{buildings}} in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with <b>storm</b> <b>waters</b> during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In contrast to {{most in the}} region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding. Within a year the building's market value declined by 21.6% ($65.7 million). In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms.|$|R
40|$|Numerous stream mouths on O'ahu are {{affected}} by sand berm blockages which prevent free flow of <b>storm</b> <b>waters</b> to the ocean and cause the stream water level to rise rapidly; often overflowing of the stream banks and flooding of adjacent land areas result. To avoid this hazard, removal of the sand blockage prior {{to the arrival of}} peak flood flows is necessary. An automatic hydraulic structure which utilizes early arriving <b>storm</b> <b>waters</b> to hydraulically erode the sand berm has been developed during this study. A hydraulic model study of a 1 - to 15 -scale Froundian model based on a generalized O'ahu prototype stream channel was conducted to test physically the conceptual structure design. The hydraulic model structure performed effectively, causing rapid breaching of the sand berm under severe storm flow conditions. In all cases, overtopping of the sand berm, which would result in high stream stages and possible flooding, was avoided. Design recommendations and modifications have been developed to permit proper application of the structure to various stream mouth conditions. Office of Water Research and Technology, U. S.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of the poor water quality of urban rivers in Brazil is the low efficiency of wastewater network system and its <b>storm</b> <b>waters</b> pipes unplanned interconnections. Also, the diffuse pollution, which is a considerable parcel of pollutant load discharge in urban water bodies, is a problem which hasn’t been considered in the remediation water plans in Brazil. Therefore, the higher challenge faced today by sanitation systems managers in Brazil, is to find solutions for recover the quality of urban water bodies through a more efficient and low cost technology. This article investigations are based in the largest daily quality monitoring already held in the country performed in Pinheiros River, in São Paulo. It evaluates d water quality parameters and the diffuse pollution effects during rain events of one of the main rivers of São Paulo Metropolitan Region. It also proposes integrated solutions for the water pollution control, based on European experience in urban water management and evaluates the performance of several wastewater and <b>storm</b> <b>waters</b> systems conceptions, comparing them with separate systems that are being used in Brazilian cities since the origin of sanitary systems in the country...|$|R

A project costing approximately 6billion rupees was proposed by UK based consultants hired by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to study the matter. Implementation of the project would have ensured that rainwater did not flood the streets of Mumbai. The project was planned to have completed by 2002 and aimed to enhance the drainage system through larger diameter <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> drains and pipes, using pumps wherever necessary and removing encroachments.
