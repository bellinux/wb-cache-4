50|$|The Tyson Holly Farms 400 {{was held}} September 30, 1990, at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Kyle Petty won the pole.

With the win, Martin retained his 16-point advantage in the Winston Cup Championship race. Two pit stops to remove <b>spring</b> <b>rubber</b> left him in 12th place on lap 196, but by lap 288 he was in second place. On lap 263, Martin was the only driver to pass Earnhardt under green.

50|$|On lap 186, Kurt Busch {{nudged the}} turn two wall with his right-rear side and spun on the backstretch, {{triggering}} the seventh caution. He regained {{control of his}} car to run in ninth place. Most of the leaders made pit stops. Johnson led at the lap-190 restart, followed by Vickers and Kenseth. Johnson held a one-second lead over Vickers by the 200th lap, by which time Edwards had moved in front of Stewart. Vickers retook the lead from Johnson on lap 206. Fifteen laps later, the eighth caution was triggered when Edwards's car suffered a cut right-rear tire, slowed on the track and spun at turn four while driving cautiously to the pit road. Edwards collected his teammate, Ragan, who was run into by Elliott. Mears was close by the incident but avoided damaging his car. On lap 222, Vickers reported a power steering problem, and Kyle Busch was losing battery power. Most of the leaders, including Vickers, made pit stops. Kyle Busch's car had a replacement battery fitted and Vickers topped up with more fluids; both drivers rejoined in twelfth and thirteenth positions. Johnson led at the lap-227 restart, with Kenseth in second place. One lap later, Kenseth passed Johnson to take over first place, while Kyle Busch made heavy contact with the wall on his right side; a caution was not needed. Johnson reclaimed the first position from Kenseth on the backstretch on the 245th lap. Kyle Busch's right-front tire was cut, {{and went into the}} turn four wall on lap 252, triggering the ninth caution. During the caution, most of the leaders, including Johnson, chose to make pit stops. Johnson made changes to his car's left and right rear <b>spring</b> <b>rubber,</b> and Stewart's car's air pressure was adjusted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Useful {{lifetime}} {{evaluation of}} chevron rubber spring {{was very important}} in design procedure to assure the safety and reliability. It is, therefore, necessary to establish a suitable criterion for the replacement period of chevron rubber spring. In this study, we performed characteristic analysis and useful lifetime prediction of chevron rubber <b>spring.</b> <b>Rubber</b> material coefficient was obtained by curve fittings of uniaxial tension equibiaxial tension and pure shear test. Computer simulation was executed to predict and evaluate the load capacity and stiffness for chevron rubber spring. In order to useful lifetime prediction of rubber material, we carried out the compression set with heat aging test in an oven at the temperature ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C during a period 180 days. By using the Arrhenius plot, several useful lifetime prediction equations for rubber material was proposed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{accurately}} obtain lateral stiffness of flexicoil circle <b>spring</b> with <b>rubber</b> pads, based on shear shape coefficient of solid and hollow thin-wall circle section, the shear shape coefficient of hollow circle section with different ratios between {{inner and outer}} diameter was obtained by difference method. By means of curve’s differential equations of elastic straight bar with uniform section, relations between forces and displacements as well as moments and rotation angles on end surfaces of <b>spring</b> and <b>rubber</b> pads was set up. According to the principle that force and moment under the connection surface between <b>spring</b> and <b>rubber</b> pad are the same and their signs are opposite, lateral stiffness of flexicoil circle <b>spring</b> with <b>rubber</b> pads was obtained.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in the <b>spring</b> <b>rubber</b> in the rubber plantation area in Loncatan Village Leap District Mangaran Ajung Jember district for 2 (two) months. The research objective is to observe the pollen combs area in rubber plantation area, know the protein content of combs pollen and assess the type and composition of amino acids of combs pollen. The materials used in research is the honey bee Apis mellifera colony of 7 colonies, each containing 9 units active frames. Adapted colonies in the study site for a week to eliminate the influence of feed from the previous place. During the study, colonies of bees do not get extra food so that all food comes from nature. Observations were carried out {{after a period of}} adaptation with a collection combs pollen. Measurement of pollen combs area done every week during the study period. Analysis of proteins made from combs pollen is collected each week, using the Kjeldahl method. Analysis of a type and composition of amino acids using amino acid analyzer (Hitachi, 1984) and then compare with the results of research de Groot (1953). Data obtained from these observations were analyzed descriptively to get an overview of research results. The results showed that during the study period in the area of rubber plantations there are variations in the comb area pollen honey bees collected at each week during the study with an average of 60. 80 ± 2. 857 cm 2, the protein content is 3. 77 ± 0. 629 %, there are 10 species amino acids in very low levels between 0, 212 - 1, 251 %.

40|$|Dampening {{systems are}} {{important}} in heavy vehicles utilized in rough terrains, with purpose to reduce shocks and vibrations with negative influences on the vehicle and, more importantly, on the operator of the vehicle. During the years the heavy vehicles require sturdier construction parts, due to demands on higher load capacity, where the easy solution to scale up the construction parts is not always applicable for dampening systems with nonlinear behavior. Hence, the sturdiness {{in the design of}} these dampening systems requires improvement.
