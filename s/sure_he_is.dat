500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, {{and other}} pop culture media have provided both praise and criticism on Edward's character. IGN writer Hilary Goldstein praises Edward {{as the perfect}} balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona, explaining that this allows the character to [...] "float between comical moments and underlying drama without seeming false." [...] Additionally, Melissa Harper from Anime News Network praises Edward's facial expressions {{as some of the}} most humorous highlights of the series, including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature. They also praise him for not being a stereotypical shōnen character as it is noted that he has [...] "very real skills, relationships, and personality". Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews also comments that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting, and praises their humor scenes as they help to balance the dark parts of the series. Similarly, Mania Entertainment's Jarred Pine liked the dynamic between the Elrics brothers as while Edward is often faced with following [...] "dark paths" [...] {{in the same way as}} villains with the series, he is always supported by Alphonse who makes <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> okay. Judge Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict commented on Edward's journey, considering it very complex morally because he is trying to do good within a morally questionable organization. Lydia Hojnacki listed Ed as one of the reasons she likes Fullmetal Alchemist, noting the progression of the character's personality throughout the series, from simple maturity to a deeper sensitivity. The character was noted to go through a notable development in the manga after meeting his father by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime as it made him decide to see the investigate from the human he and Alphonse created as children which led him to find a clue about how to recover his brother's body. On the other hand, Maria Lin from Animefringe criticized Edward's development in the first animated adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist, as in the series' finale he once again attempted to resurrect a human. When reviewing the video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, RPGFan's Neal Chandran enjoyed the dynamic between the main characters both in fights as well as dialogues.|$|E

2500|$|Beatrice Sherman, The New York Times Book Review (February 27, 1949) — [...] "A Nero Wolfe Threesome" [...] is the {{subtitle}} for {{this collection of}} mysteries. The opening situation in each story {{is that of a}} man who feels <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to be killed and wants to pay Wolfe handsomely to stave off the evil day — permanently, if possible. Wolfe refuses to set his nimble brain, his bulky body or his trusted aide, Archie, working on such cases. The odds against a determined murderer are too long. Mr. Wolfe would rather devote himself to his orchids. As it turns out, Wolfe and Archie are drawn into the thick of all three cases, and solve them by playing their usual fast-and-loose game of cooperation with the police. Lovely going all the way, but not the Nero Wolfe-Archie team at its best.|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony also {{issued a}} series of well wishes for his Cuban counterpart. Dr. Anthony said {{he was just as}} {{surprised}} as the Cuban people {{and the rest of the}} world by the sudden news of President Castro's illness.

In his press release the Saint Lucian Prime Minister also said, [...] "The Cabinet of Ministers, and indeed the people of Saint Lucia, have much admiration for the Cuban President and his personal interest in making humanitarian and social assistance available to Saint Lucia and the rest of the Caribbean, especially in the fields of health and education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chief Gadibia (Isaac Yongo), one of {{the chiefs}} who have been {{receiving}} bribes from Western Oil, and also embezzling funds meant for community development, tells his fellow elders that {{he is no longer}} interested in the [...] "unclean" [...] money and he wants to return his share to the people. Gadibia dies the following day, the Elders having poisoned his drink the previous night. Peter (OC Ukeje), Gadibia's son, to whom he has already confessed, explains the incident to Ebiere and how <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> that his father was murdered by the Elders. Gadibia's stolen fund is discovered in his house and the other elders involved are captured by the community people, led by Ebiere. Ebiere wants the Elders to be reported to the police, but the people refuse to listen and set them ablaze instead. Everyone at the vicinity of the crime is arrested by the Police; Ebiere however claims responsibility for the crime and is sentenced to death by hanging. The film shifts back to the present in the Los Angeles tunnel; Tom Hudson calls Nigeria's Head of State and tells him to do something to stop the execution of Ebiere, but his request isn't granted. Angela (Vivica Fox) of the US Anti-terrorism unit advises that the United States make a diplomatic call to the Nigerian Government, but the head of the department says they do not negotiate with terrorists. They eventually resolve to issue a deceptive press release, stating that Ebiere has been released. When the emancipation movement is informed about the release, they drop their weapons as a result and also release the rest of the hostages, including Tom Hudson. They are arrested by the United States Police, while Ebiere still gets hanged in Nigeria.|$|E
