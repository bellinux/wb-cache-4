5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, {{is often}} called the vestibulocerebellum. It is the oldest part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other <b>sensory</b> <b>input.</b> Damage to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} {{attributes}} of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The neocortex in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> from one modality. For example, primary visual area, V1, or primary somatosensory area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus {{features such as}} brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections {{to each other as}} well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well.|$|E

40|$|Humans {{control their}} posture by {{controlling}} the muscular {{activity of the}} whole body with the cranial nervous system using multi-sensory inputs. The construction of <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> and muscular activity model has a significant meaning medically and biologically because this model leads us {{to understand how the}} brain functions. Thus, it is important {{to examine the relationship between}} senses and muscular activity as the first steps in constructing this model. Therefore, purpose of this study is obtaining changes in muscular activity by changes in <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs.</b> To achieve this purpose the method to change <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> is a challenging point. We propose a method of changing <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> by inhibiting or stimulating three senses (visual, vestibular, and somatosensory senses) which are related to posture control. Concretely, A) the visual sense is inhibited by closed eyes, B) the vestibular sense is inhibited by a caloric test pouring cold water into the ear cavity, and C) the somatosensory sense is stimulated by touching a part of the body. Muscular activity is measured by electromyography (EMG) when subject's senses are inhibited or simulated by the method mentioned above. It is considered that the variety of muscular activity influenced by change in <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> is observable by comparing measured muscular activities. Experiments were performed on 5 subjects using the method mentioned above. Subjects tende...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In robotics, {{exogenous}} {{fault detection}} {{is the process}} through which one robot detects faults that occur in other, physically separate robots. In this paper, we study exogenous fault detection in a collective leader-follower task for autonomous robots. We record <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> from the robots while they are operating normally and after simulated faults have been injected. Given that faults are simulated, we can correlate the flow of <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> with the fault state of the robots. We use back-propagation neural networks to synthesize fault detection components. We show that the flow of <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> is sufficient information for performing exogenous fault detection, that is, we show that the leader robot is capable of detecting faults in the follower robot. All results are based on experiments with real robots. ...|$|R
40|$|Environment is {{represented}} in the brain by a neural code that {{is a result of}} the spatiotemporal pattern of incoming sensory information. <b>Sensory</b> neurons encode <b>inputs</b> across space and in time such that activity of a given cell inhibits the ability of near-simultaneously arriving sensory stimuli to excite the cell. At the behavioral level, consequences of such suppression are unknown. We investigated the contribution of spatially distributed, near-simultaneous <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> to decision making in a whisker-dependent learning task. Mice learned the task with a single whisker or multiple whiskers alike. Both groups of mice had similar learning curves and final success rates. However, multiple-whisker animals had faster response times than single-whisker mice, requiring only about half the time to perform the task successfully. The results show that spatially distributed <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> in a highly redundant sensory environment improve speed but not accuracy of the decisions made during simple sensory detection. Suppression of the near-simultaneous <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> could, therefore, act to reduce the sensory redundancy...|$|R

A study of significant changes in reduction of the output error loss functional is conducted as different permutations of parameters are considered. Since this canonical model includes parameters which are related to inputs to the human (such as the error signal, its derivatives and integration), {{the study of}} model order {{is equivalent to the}} study of which <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> are being used by the tracker.
