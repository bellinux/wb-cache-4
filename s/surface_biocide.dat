40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the inactivation effect of industrial formulations of peracetic acid biocides on bacterial spores adhering to stainless steel surfaces. A standardized protocol was used to validate biocide activity against spores in suspension. To validate sporicidal activity under practical conditions, we developed an additional protocol to simulate industrial sanitization of stainless steel surfaces with a foam sanitizer. Spores of three spore-forming bacteria, Clostridium sporo genes PA 3679, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, and Moorella thermoacetica/thermoautotrophica, were sprayed onto stainless steel as bioaerosols. Sporicidal activity was high against the C. sporogenes spore suspension, with more than 5 log CFU ml(- 1) destroyed at all liquid biocide contact times. Sporicidal activity also was high against G. stearothermophilus and M. thermoacetica/thermoautotrophica spores after 30 min of contact, but we found no population reduction at the 5 -min contact time for the highest sporicide concentration tested. The foam biocide effectively inactivated C. sporo genes spores adhered to stainless steel but had a reduced decontamination effect on other species. For G. stearothermophilus spores, sanitization with the foam sporicide was more efficient on horizontal steel than on vertical steel, but foam sanitization was ineffective against M. thermoacetica/thermoautotrophica whatever the position. These results highlight that decontamination efficiency may differ depending on whether spores are suspended in an aqueous solution or adhered to a stainless steel <b>surface.</b> <b>Biocide</b> efficiency must be validated using relevant protocols and bacteria representative of the microbiological challenges and issues affecting each food industry...|$|E

40|$|High {{resistance}} of biofilms for chemical challenges {{is a serious}} industrial and medical problem. In this work a gradient of surface covered with biofilm has been produced and correlated {{to the effectiveness of}} different commercially available oxidative biocides. The results for thin Escherichia coli biofilms grown in rich media supplemented with glucose or lactose on glass or poly methyl methacrylate surfaces indicate that the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide or chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compounds is inversely proportional to the fraction of the surface covered with the biofilm. In areas where biofilm covered more than 90 % of the available <b>surface</b> the <b>biocide</b> treatment was inefficient after 60 min of incubation. The combined effect of oxidant and surfactant increased the effectiveness of the biocide. On the other hand, the increased biofilm viscoelasticity reduced biocide effectiveness. The results emphasize differential biocide effectiveness depending on the fraction of the attached bacterial cells. The results suggest that biofilm biocide resistance is an acquired property that increases with biofilm maturation.

40|$|A {{relatively}} novel antimicrobial agent, ortho-phtalaldehyde (OPA), {{was tested}} in the control of biofilms formed by Pseudomonas fluorescens on stainless steel surfaces. The toxic action of OPA was assessed by means of activity tests and dry weight of the biofilms. For comparative purposes, the activity of OPA against bacterial suspended cultures was also evaluated. The results showed that concentrations of OPA higher than 15 mg L- 1 inactivate the planktonic populations while having a lower effect against the P. fluorecens biofilms. The inactivation of the biofilm was only attained with the higher OPA concentrations (50 and 100 mg L- 1) and for longer exposure times (3 h). The application of OPA appears to cause little effect in the removal of biofilms from the metal slides since the amount of biofilm mass that remained on the <b>surfaces,</b> after <b>biocide</b> treatment, stills to be very high and representative. These results suggest the fact that, with OPA application, biofilms can be inactivated but stay attached to the surfaces, decreasing, by this way, {{the success of the}} chemical treatment.

40|$|A {{relatively}} novel biocide, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), {{was tested}} to control biofilms formed by Pseudomonas fluorescens on stainless steel surfaces. The toxic action of OPA was assessed {{in terms of}} inactivation and removal of the biofilm by means of, respectively, {{the determination of the}} respiratory activity and the variation in the dry weight of the biofilms. For comparison, the activity of OPA against suspended bacteria was also evaluated. The results showed that higher concentrations of OPA and longer exposure times are needed to inactivate P. fluorescens biofilms than planktonic populations, thus denoting that sessile bacteria have a reduced susceptibility to OPA. This appears {{to be associated with the}} reaction with the proteins of the matrix, as demonstrated by the reduction of the antimicrobial action of OPA in the presence of a protein (bovine serum albumin). The application of OPA appeared to cause little effect in the removal of biofilms from the metal slides since the mass of biofilm that remained on the <b>surfaces,</b> after <b>biocide</b> treatment, was within the same range as those observed in the control tests.

40|$|International audienceTextiles for {{the food}} {{processing}} industry are treated by a patented technology combining an ionic polymer (antimicrobial agent) and a precipitating agent to obtain an insoluble deposit expected to exhibit antimicrobial properties. ToF-SIMS and XPS {{are used in the}} understanding of the surface chemistry at various steps of treatments (cleaning step prior to surface modification, antimicrobial deposit, industrial ISO 15797 washing). ToF-SIMS and XPS analyses show that the signatures of the antimicrobial treatment are detected at the surface after treatment. After industrial ISO 15797 washings, the precipitating agent is rapidly removed (possibly replaced by washing agent components) while the antimicrobial agent (PHMB) is still detected but is significantly removed from the surface after five washings. ToF-SIMS and XPS data are compared to microbiological tests specifically intended in relation with food processing industry applications. After the antimicrobial treatment, the <b>surface</b> is <b>biocide</b> as well as after a single ISO 15797 washing, but after 5 washings, either the surface is slightly active (cotton-based textile) or not active any more (polyester-based textile).

Even though a slight difference is observed for the ToF-SIMS normalized intensity for m/z = 184. 1561 (PHMB molecular peak) between C/P and P/C samples, it can hardly be concluded that this would be the only explanation for the difference in activity.

40|$|This report {{contains}} lectures {{presented at}} the 4 th expert meeting of Sueddeutsche Kunststoff-Zentrum (Wuerzburg, Federal Republic of Germany) on Transparent Plastics-Innovations in Processing and Application in Wuerzburg, April 28 th until April 29 th 2003. This meeting contributes to transparent plastics and proceedings in processing and application of transparent plastics. The first lectures deals with polycarbonate, synthesized by melt transesterification. Semifinished polycarbonate products are used as roof materials in stadiums and thermal baths. Transparent poly(methyl methacrylate) is produces non-dazzling light. As an additive, transparent PMMA is used for high-speed spinning of poly(ethylene terephthalate) and in displays of electronic devices and flat screens. Further applications of transparent PMMA are related to lighting technology, construction of aquariums and protection or removal of graffities. New products are styrene-butadiene-block copolymers with a particularly bright colour. Methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers have an increased thermal stability and tenacity. Aliphatic polyamides have a transparent neutral own colour and a low density. These materials are applied to spectacle frames, scratch-resistant lenses and flacons in the cosmetic industry. The synthesis of polyolefins by means of metallocene catalysis results in products with a unique combination of optical, mechanical and processing technological properties. Fields of application are household articles, Lufthansa catering boxes and packaging for CD-ROM and DVD. Topas Cycloolefine Copolymers are transparent polyolefins offering protection against moistness and enabling unbreakable and transparent syringes. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) is an innovative material with manifold applications in modern packaging such as plastic films and foils, casting foils, biaxial orientated foils or as a packaging for juice and beer concerning to its high oxygen and carbon dioxide barriere. High-performance plastics such as poly(arylene ether sulfone), poly(ether sulfone) or poly(ether imide) are used as secretion container in the medicine, packaging in household articles, microwave dishes for example. The precise moulding of thick-walled plastic materials is a great challenge in the optics. With respect to the optimization of the production process, Fries Research and Technology GmbH (Bergisch Gladbach, Federal Republic of Germany) developed a measuring instrument to study the surface of moulded articles. The advantage of this instrument is the point by point measurement and measurement by line at variable defined measuring tasks. Further lectures deal with optical polymer fibres for data exchange over short distances, microstructured transparent surfaces of plastics with optical functions for sun-protective systems or components of displays, <b>biocide</b> <b>surfaces</b> for the increase of anti-microbial efficiency of products and transparent scratch-resistant coatings.

40|$|M. Sc. The {{increasing}} demand for water in South Africa arises from a {{rapid population growth}} and supporting industrial development. This demand has to be met from limited water resources that are shared by competing user groups and neighbouring states. Deteriorating water quality further limits the sustainable use of water through point and diffuse source pollution of macro constituents, metals and biocides. Metals in the environment can originate as point sources, including industrial and mining effluent, or diffuse sources from geological origin, agricultural activities, acid mine draining and leachate from dumps. Biocides increase crop yields, protect forests and control vectors of serious human disease, but {{are in the process}} also carried to water courses. Bioaccumulation studies have been identified as a method to monitor pollutants in the environment. The analyses of data from bioaccumulation studies share a common problem in having to deal with many independent variables, for example variations in time and space, environmental conditions and biological parameters. The objectives of this study were to; investigate the metal levels in water and metal and biocide bioaccumulation in fish tissues from the Berg, Luvuvhu, Olifants and Sabie Rivers; develop a procedure to predict areas and biocides at risk of causing diffuse source pollution and; evaluate the available data and procedures to propose more efficient and cost effective bioaccumulation programmes. The investigation evaluated current and potential contamination of the selected catchments and identified research needs. Fish tissues and water grab samples were collected in the Berg, Luvuvhu, Olifants and Sabie Rivers. The samples were tested for physical variables and analysed for macro constituents and metal levels according to standard analytical procedures. Fish were caught (gill and seine nets) and larger specimens were selected for tissue analyses. Species were identified and standard length, mass, gender, gonadotrophic development index and age indicators were collected. Standard procedures were used to analyse fish tissues for metal levels with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) and biocide levels with gas chromatographic methods. A flow diagram of a statistical methodology was developed to incorporate the effects of all biological parameters in the analyses of bioaccumulation data. The procedures used to calculate human health risks are that of the Risk Assistant package reviewed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A Geographical Information System (GIS) model was developed, incorporating the factors affecting runoff of <b>surface</b> water and <b>biocides,</b> to predict areas and variables that could cause diffuse source pollution. The pH values of the rivers studied ranged from of 7. 2 to 8. 7 except for the Klipspruit River before its confluence with the Olifants River that had a pH of 4. 8. Nutrient levels in the Berg River are within the South African guidelines. Nutrients in the Luvuvhu River mostly exceed the guideline values for ortho-phosphate, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus. In the Olifants River the values for ortho-phosphate, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen and nitrate and nitrite nitrogen often exceed the South African guideline values. Nutrients in the Sabie River have low concentrations with only ammonia nitrogen exceeding the guideline values. TDS values in the Olifants River is the highest, which is an indication of the high salt loads in the river. The concentrations of various metals in water from the Berg, Luvuvhu, Sabie and Olifants Rivers exceeded the proposed South African and international guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{associated}} {{infections are}} responsible for substantial patient morbidity, mortality and economic cost. Infection control strategies for reducing rates of transmission {{include the use of}} nonwoven wipes, with or without a biocidal liquid, to remove pathogenic bacteria from frequently touched surfaces. Considerable research has been conducted on the role of biocides in disrupting microbes such as bacteria, but less is known about the influence of wiping surfaces with nonwovens regarding their removal. This research considers the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the removal of bacterial contamination from model healthcare surfaces. The extent to which systematic changes in wipe fibre surface energy and nano-roughness influence removal of bacteria from a polymer surface in dry wiping conditions was studied. Nonwoven wipe substrates composed of two commonly used fibre types, lyocell (cellulose II) and polypropylene (PP), with different surface energies and nano-roughnesses, were experimentally manufactured. The surface energy and nano-roughness of lyocell substrates were modified by either oxygen or hexafluoroethane plasma treatment. Static wiping of an inoculated surface under dry conditions produced bacterial removal efficiencies of between 9. 4 colony forming unit (CFU) % and 15. 7 CFU % versus control, with no significant difference (p 50 CFU % versus static wiping (p < 0. 05), depending on fibre type and bacterium. Under dynamic wiping conditions, nonwoven wipe substrates with a surface energy closest to that of the contaminated surface produced the highest E. coli removal efficiency, while the associated increase in fibre nano-roughness abrogated this trend with S. aureus and E. faecalis. Considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors of wiping and design factors on the removal of pathogenic bacteria, the single most important parameter affecting bacterial removal efficiency was impregnation with biocidal liquid (p < 0. 05). However, dynamic wiping in the dry state and with water alone without biocide still resulted in substantial removal. Bacterial removal was therefore not conditional on the presence of a biocide. For 100 % lyocell wipes impregnated with biocidal liquid, removal of E. coli, S. aureus and E. faecalis improved by increasing the fabric basis weight and hand weight wiping pressure to their maximal values (150 g. m- 2 and 13. 80 kN. m- 2 respectively). For 100 % polypropylene wipes, the same conditions maximised the removal efficiency of S. aureus. For E. coli and E. faecalis, a reduction in the hand weight wiping pressure to 4. 68 kN. m- 2 was required to maximise the removal efficiency with 100 % polypropylene. Generally, the lyocell wipes were more effective in removing bacterial contamination than 100 % polypropylene wipes. The removal and destruction of pathogenic bacteria partly by wiping relies on their transfer to fibre surfaces within the wipe. The extent to which the surface properties influences specific bacterial removal was investigated in terms of polymer composition and surface roughness, as well any residual antimicrobial activity conferred to the <b>surface</b> by the <b>biocide.</b> It was determined that {{there was no significant difference}} in removal of E. coli, S. aureus and E. faecalis from plastic, ceramic or metal surfaces by either 100 % lyocell or 100 % polypropylene nonwoven wipes (p < 0. 05) during wet wiping. No significant residual antimicrobial activity was seen form the biocide deposited on clinical surfaces after wiping (p < 0. 05). Therefore, regular disinfection of clinical surfaces, with a “one wipe, one surface” policy should be implemented...|$|R
