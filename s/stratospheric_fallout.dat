40|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of Pu in soils on {{and near the}} Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has been determined in order to apportion {{the sources of the}} Pu into those derived from <b>stratospheric</b> <b>fallout,</b> regional fallout from the Nevada Test Site (NTS), and facilities on the INEEL site.

It is estimated that the non-fallout Pu in INEEL soils is approximately 5. 7 GBq (~ 150 mCi) and that the majority of this site-derived Pu has its origin from releases of Pu at the SDA in the early and late 1960 s. <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> on the INEEL is approximately one-half of th [...] ...|$|E

There is convincing evidence from this study that {sup 241 }Am, in excess of that expected from weapons-grade Pu, constituted a part of the buried waste at the SDA that has subsequently been released to the environment. Measurements of {sup 236 }U in waters from the Snake River Plain aquifer and a soil core near the ICPP suggest that this radionuclide may be a unique interrogator of airborne releases from the ICPP. Neptunium- 237 and {sup 238 }Pu activities in INEEL soils suggest that airborne releases of Pu from the ICPP, over its operating history, may have recently been overestimated...|$|E
40|$|Short-lived nuclides, now {{extinct in}} the solar system, are {{expected}} to be present in interstellar matter (ISM). Grains of ISM origin were recently discovered in the inner solar system and at Earth orbit and may accrete onto Earth after ablation in the atmosphere. A favorable matrix for detection of such extraterrestrial material is presented by deep-sea sediments with very low sedimentation rates (0. 8 – 3 mm/kyr). We report here on the measurement of Pu isotopic abundances in a 1 -kg deep-sea dry sediment collected in 1992 in the North Pacific. Our estimate of (3 ± 3) × 105 244 Pu atoms in the Pu-separated fraction of the sample shows no excess over the expected <b>stratospheric</b> nuclear <b>fallout</b> content and under reasonable assumptions sets a limit of 0. 2 244 Pu atoms/cm 2 yr for extra-terrestrial deposition. Using available data on ISM steady-state flux on Earth, we derive a limit of 2 × 10 − 11 g- 244 Pu/g-ISM for the abundance of 244 Pu in ISM.

40|$|The {{main source}} of {{artificial}} radioactivity in the world`s oceans {{can be attributed to}} worldwide fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. Measurements of selected artificial radionuclides in the Pacific Ocean were first conducted in the 1960 `s where it was observed that fallout radioactivity had penetrated the deep ocean. Extensive studies carried out during the 1973 - 74 GEOSECS provided the first comprehensive data on the lateral and vertical distributions of {sup 9 O}Sr, {sup 137 }Cs and Pu isotopes in the Pacific on a basin wide scale. Estimates of radionuclide inventories in excess of amounts predicted to be delivered by global fallout alone were attributed to close-in fallout and tropospheric inputs from early U. S. tests conducted on Bikini and Enewetak Atolls in the Equatorial Pacific. In general, levels of fallout radionuclides (including {sup 9 O}Sr, {sup 137 }Cs and Pu isotopes) in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean have decreased considerably over the past 4 decades and are now much more homogeneously distributed. Resuspension and the subsequent deposition of fallout radionuclides from previously deposited debris on land has become an important source term for the surface ocean. This can be clearly seen in measurements of fallout radionuclides in mineral aerosols over the Korean Peninsula (Yellow dust events). Radionuclides may also be transported from land to sea in river runoff-these transport mechanisms are more important in the Pacific Ocean where large quantities of river water and suspended sands/fluvial sediments reach the coastal zone. Another unique source of artificial radionuclides in the Pacific Ocean is derived from the slow resolubilization and transport of radionuclides deposited in contaminated lagoon and slope sediments near U. S. and French test sites. Although there is a small but significant flux of artificial radionuclides depositing on the sea floor, > 80 % of the total 239, {sup 240 }Pu inventory and > 95 % of the total {sup 137 }Cs inventory remains in the water column. Studies conducted through the 1980 `s appear to be consistent with earlier findings and indicate that radionuclide inventories in mid-northern latitudes are at least a factor of two above those expected from global fallout alone. The long term persistence of close-in and/or <b>stratospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> from nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands still appears to be the only plausible explanation for this anomaly...|$|E
40|$|A high-precision mass {{spectrometry}} method {{has been developed}} to measure 240 Pu/ 239 Pu at low concentrations in environmental samples. A reproducibility of 0. 5 pg has been achieved using a highly sensitive and precise multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometer (Micromass IsoProbe). The research has involved applying the developed methods {{to a number of}} environmental studies. Application I: A chronology for 240 Pu/ 239 Pu is presented. This chronology over the period 1945 - 1980 is derived from grass samples from the IACR Rothamsted Archive at Harpenden (Hertfordshire, UK) and an Alpine ice core from Dome du Gouter, Mont Blanc, French Alps. Activity concentrations for 137 Cs and 239, 240 Pu and the 238 U/ 235 U atomic ratio were also determined in the same samples. The activity concentrations clearly reflect the yearly yields of atmospheric testing. A higher abundance of 235 U can be linked to nuclear testing between 1950 - 1963. A higher abundance of 238 U is found in the period 1970 - 80 in the grass, but not in the ice. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu ratio is compared with Polar ice core and stratospheric data that have appeared in the literature. It is particularly notable that the UK herbage samples clearly identify fallout from the early U. S. tests in the Nevada desert (1952 and 1953) and that 1954 - 68 samples show isotope ratios reflecting <b>stratospheric</b> <b>fallout.</b> Ratios for the 1970 s cannot be uniquely attributed to a single source. Complementary measurements of the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu have been carried out on stratospheric air filters from Sweden and ground-level air filters from Germany. Application IIA: Plutonium isotopes have been measured in a sediment core from the Wyre saltmarsh. Radionuclide contamination in this area is much higher than in many other UK sites because of its incorporation of discharges from the BNFL Sellafield. A model for the transport of radiolabelled sediment from the Sellafield area is also presented. Application IIB: Plutonium isotopic ratios in a mudflat core from Poole Harbour reflect the pattern that is expected from weapons fallout in the pre- 1970 period. The post- 1970 sediment shows an additional source that is considered to be the discharges from AEA Winfrith. Application III: Radioactive contamination of the environment by Pu and U as a result of operations at the AWE sites at Aldermaston and Burghfield has been investigated. Isotope ratio results show that contamination of the environment around the sites is patchy and its concentration very small. It {{is interesting to note that}} measurable contamination is not expected from the annual discharge records when a dispersion model is applied...|$|E
40|$|Plutonium (Pu) is a predominately {{anthropogenic}} element {{produced during}} neutron irradiation of U in reactors and nuclear weapon detonations. Pu {{has been released}} to the environment during nuclear weapon detonations, nuclear reactor accidents, and in association with reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The most important source of Pu in the environment were the 543 atmospheric nuclear detonations conducted worldwide in the period 1945 – 1980 by the former Soviet Union (FSU), USA, United Kingdom (UK), China and France. The most intensive period of atmospheric nuclear testing was 1945 – 1962, interrupted by a moratorium during November 1958 to September 1961. This period was dominated by US testing during the premoratorium period and FSU testing during the post-moratorium period. Debris from the atmospheric nuclear detonations was deposited on a local, regional and global scale depending on detonation height, yield and meteorological conditions. The isotopic composition of Pu is source dependent. Pu is produced by neutron capture in 238 U, generating 239 U which rapidly (t 1 / 2 = 23. 5 min) decay to 239 Pu. Heavier isotopes are produced due to neutron capture in this 239 Pu. Heavier isotopes of Pu are successively produced during continued neutron irradiation. Reactor derived Pu would have 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios reflecting the irradiation history of the fuel (burn up). For technical reasons, the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios in weapon purpose Pu has to be below 0. 07. The burn up in weapon production reactors kept low by frequent exchange of the fuel {{in order to ensure}} this. For power production reactors on the other hand, frequent exchange of the fuel is impracticable and uneconomical. The fuel is exchanged after a prolonged irradiation and high burn up. As the proportion of heavier Pu isotopes increase in relation to 239 Pu, all Pu atom ratios, and in particular the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios increase; 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios up to 0. 67 have been reported. Debris from undetonated weapons and low yield detonations would also have low 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios, similar to the original weapon material. Post detonation Pu atom ratios depend on the yield and design of the device with high yield detonations generally producing Pu with higher 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios than low yield detonations. Global fallout was the mixed debris injected into the stratosphere by high yield detonations. After a considerable retention time in the stratosphere, this debris was deposited to form a general Pu background with an easily recognizable 240 Pu/ 239 Pu signature of ~ 0. 18. Pu isotopic signatures substantially different from global fallout indicates significant influence from local or regionally deposited Pu from nuclear weapon test sites, reactor accidents or releases from reprocessing. In the present thesis U and Pu isotopic signatures has been utilised for source identification and quantification purposes. The samples employed have been humic surface soils from 45 geographically well distributed sites in Norway (Paper I); an ice core from Austfonna (Svalbard) covering the period 1949 – 1999 (Paper II); and air filter samples from Norway during 1957 - 1963 (Paper III). Radioactive particles have been identified in the air filter samples the ice core samples (Paper II) and (Paper III), while atmospheric dispersion modelling (NOAA HYSPLIT_ 4) has been used to corroborate the source identification in (Paper III). Debris from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was distributed over vast areas of Europe, including Fenno-Scandinavia. Whereas the deposition of caesium from the Chernobyl accident is known to have been strong in Norway, knowledge of the Pu deposition is scarce. In order to assess the relative importance of sources to Pu deposition in mainland Norway, Pu concentrations and atom ratios in humic surface soil samples collected from 45 geographically well distributed sites were determined by SF-ICP-MS (sector field inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry) and AMS (Accelerator mass spectrometry). Pu concentrations in samples collected from the same sites in 1990 and 2005 were compared in order to assess the relative migration of Pu from the surface layers. Pu concentrations (0. 7 – 149 Bq m- 2) were found to be higher at coastal sites with high annual precipitation than at inland sites with lower annual precipitation, this is in accordance with the global fallout theory. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios were found to vary within 0. 161 – 0. 211, mainly in accordance with the global fallout signature. However, at some inland sites Pu atom ratios were found to exceed global fallout Pu signatures, indicating a slight Chernobyl influence. Time resolved samples permit the investigation of variations of deposition and isotopic signatures in deposited debris. Pu and 236 U concentrations and atom ratios were determined by AMS in an Arctic ice core from Austfonna (Svalbard) covering the period 1951 – 1999, and in air filter samples collected during 1957 – 1963. The Austfonna represents an interesting sampling location in its proximity to FSU test site Novaya Zemlya (NZ). In addition tropospheric transport from Eurasia, and possibly the FSU test site in Semipalatinsk (STS) is facilitated by a semi-permanent high pressure area above Siberia during winter. Digital autoradiography indicated the presence of radioactive particles at depths corresponding to atmospheric nuclear testing (1949 – 1962) and the Chernobyl accident or a vented NZ underground detonation (1985 – 1989). Concentrations of Pu and 236 U in the Austfonna ice core (0. 008 to 0. 254 mBq cm- 2 and 0. 0039 to 0. 053 μBq cm- 2 respectively) were found to be higher at depths corresponding to the pre-moratorium period (1956 – 1959) than at depths corresponding to the post- moratorium period (1959 – 1962). This observation contrasts with observations at other sites where the deposition of anthropogenic radionuclides was found to be higher in the post-moratorium period. The discordance either indicates post depositional redistribution or a different depositional regime at the Austfonna glacier than at other sites. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratio measured in air filters (0. 0517 – 0. 237) showed a strong dependence on northern hemisphere atmospheric test activities, tending towards a value reflecting <b>stratospheric</b> <b>fallout</b> during periods without atmospheric nuclear testing, and substantially lower ratios in periods associated with atmospheric nuclear testing activities. The lower Pu atom ratios observed during periods of atmospheric nuclear testing indicates significant influence of tropospherically transported Pu from FSU atmospheric nuclear testing. A further indication is provided by the presence of radioactive particles in filters from the autumn and winter seasons of 1961 and 1962, i. e. periods associated with atmospheric testing at FSU test sites NZ and STS. Direct tropospheric transport from FSU test site STS was indicated by high Pu and 236 U concentrations and low 240 Pu/ 239 Pu, 241 Pu/ 239 Pu and 236 U/ 239 Pu atom ratios during November 1962. Atmospheric dispersion modelling (HYSPLIT) using real time meteorological data confirmed the plausibility of this transport, and limited the potential source to three low yield STS test detonations during 30 October – 1 November 1962...|$|E
