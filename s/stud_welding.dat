5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of <b>stud</b> <b>welding,</b> which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E
50|$|Portable <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{machines}} are available. Welders {{can also be}} automated, with controls for arcing and applying pressure. <b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> is very versatile. Typical applications include automobile bodies, electrical panels, shipbuilding and building construction. Shipbuilding {{is one of the}} oldest uses of <b>stud</b> <b>welding.</b> <b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> revolutionized the shipbuilding industry.

50|$|A type of <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> called capacitor-discharge (CD) <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{differs from}} regular <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> in that capacitor-discharge welding {{does not require}} flux. The weld time is shorter, {{enabling}} the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter studs to be welded to thin,lightweight materials. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn through showing {{on the opposite side}} of very thin metals. CD <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy. On the other hand, arc <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is primarily for structural purposes and larger diameter weld studs.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>stud</b> arc <b>welding</b> process {{is well known}} in various manufacturing fields and civil engineering due to simplicity of application, short welding time and cost efficiency. In this paper, {{application of}} on-line monitoring of main welding parameters (welding current and voltage) is used in the examination of process stability during <b>stud</b> arc <b>welding</b> with ceramic ferrule. The goal of this experimental work is to make the best choice of monitored welding parameter to assure the high quality of arc <b>stud</b> <b>weld</b> joint. So, the applicability of stability evaluation methods usually used in MAG (Metal Active Gas) welding process is analyzed for <b>stud</b> arc <b>welding</b> application.

The cyclone barrel is constructed with water cooled, tangential oriented, tube construction. Inside the cyclone barrel are short, densely spaced, pin <b>studs</b> <b>welded</b> to the outside of the tubes.

40|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used in {{building}} and architectural applications because of the unique combination of corrosion performance, aesthetic appeal, strength and ease of use. The grades of stainless steel commonly used in these applications can be readily fabricated using known technology although there are various issues that must be considered. Production of flat, thin skinned panels, for facades for example, starts at the design stage. Design to withstand fabrication stresses must be completed. Welding inevitably produces contamination of the steel surface, not {{least of which is}} the heat tint at the weld line. Care must be taken to minimise and control this contamination. Similarly care must be taken when designing and implementing <b>stud</b> <b>welded</b> structures. Welded structures should normally be cleaned after fabrication.

50|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> uses {{a type of}} flux {{called a}} ferrule, a ceramic ring which {{concentrates}} the heat generated, prevents oxidation and retains the molten metal in the weld zone. The ferrule is broken off of the fastener after the weld is completed.

50|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{technique}} similar to flash welding where a fastener or specially formed nut is welded onto another metal part, typically a base metal or substrate. The fastener can take different forms, but typically fall under threaded, unthreaded or tapped. The bolts may be automatically fed into the spot welder.

The surrounding infill walls were not fixed to the composite floor at the top to allow vertical movement of the floor. All of the columns and perimeter beams were fire protected. The composite deck slab had a total depth of 120 mm and was fixed to edge beams by lapping the steel reinforcing mesh over shear <b>studs</b> <b>welded</b> to the perimeter beams (as {{in the case of}} the COSSFIRE test). A natural fire was imposed using wooden cribs at a load of 587 MJ/m 2, resulting in a gas phase temperature 500 mm below the ceiling at 75 minutes which peaked at 1055 °C.|$|R

Contrary to CHS K-joints, in CFST K-joints no failure mode with inward deformation of the chord section can occur. Hence, punching shear failure was shown to be their typical failure mode of CFST K-joints, unless any brace failure mode occurred before. Resistance of CFST K-joints to punching shear was then compared with the resistance values obtained by the Eurocode 3 and the AWS code formulae on CHS K-joints.

40|$|The use of {{mechanical}} shear connectors, mainly headed stud bolts, {{is the most}} common way to achieve steel-concrete composite action. The encasement of the steel beam in the depth slab results in increase of strength and stiffness, reducing the total height of the floor. In this investigation, three partially encased composite beams were tested under flexural conditions and the main objective was to investigate some alternative positions for the headed studs. To provide longitudinal shear resistance between the I-shaped beam and the concrete, two positions of the,studs were investigated: vertically welded on the bottom flange and horizontally welded on the faces of the web. The experimental results have shown that the headed studs are effective to provide the composite action and increase the bending strength. Furthermore, the headed <b>studs</b> <b>welded</b> vertically on the bottom flange proved to be the most reliable position...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>welding,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "drawn arc stud welding", joins a stud and another piece of metal {{together}} by heating both parts with an arc. The stud is usually joined to a flat plate by using the stud {{as one of the}} electrodes. The polarity used in <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> depends on the type of metal being used. Welding aluminum, for example, would usually require direct-current electrode positive (DCEP). Welding steel would require direct-current electrode negative (DCEN).|$|E
5000|$|Friction <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{solid phase}} welding process where the metals do not liquefy.

The retort {{is a long}} cylinder {{with a series of}} internal spiral flights. The retort was manufactured from a wrought alloy, RA- 330, that is suitable for the temperature range (i.e., 1700  F (927  °C) maximum) and not reactive with the pyrolysis compounds. The outer casing was designed to withstand 345  kilopascals (50  psig) internal pressure. The vessel and dished ends were constructed of mild steel plates per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) boiler pressure vessel codes. Ceramic fiber modules, 25  cm thick and 10  in. thick with a density of 160  kg/m 3, were provided and <b>stud</b> <b>welded</b> to the furnace sidewalls, roof, and discharge end wall. The retort rotates around its longitudinal axis such that the spiral flights convey the feedstock from end to end in a defined period of time. Various devices (e.g., bars and rakes) are used between the flights to cause the feedstock to tumble and improve the rate of heat transfer.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of typical connections commonly used in precast concrete buildings subjected to reversed cyclic loads is presented, along with an analytical study of nonlinear behaviour of these specimens subjected to monotonically increasing loads until failure. Five different connection specimens were constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading to determine their seismic responses. The specimens represent a series of horizontal connections between double-tee flanges or between a double-tee flange and lateral load resisting element in a typical roof of a precast concrete structure. The analytical study consisted of two parts: linear finite element analysis of the connection to determine the test specimen geometry and to define its boundary conditions, and non-linear finite element analysis, using the NONLACS program, to predict the complete responses of the connections subjected to monotonically increasing loads. The experimental results were compared with the predictions made using theoretical calculations, the CPCI design method and non-linear finite element analysis. It is noted that the CPCI design method gives conservative predictions for the ultimate strength of the connection reinforced with a bent deformed bar anchor and a 90 $ sp circ$ hook, and the one with two deformed bars oriented at 45 $ sp circ$ and headed <b>studs,</b> both <b>welded</b> to a steel plate. The predicted ultimate strength of the connection with a bent deformed bar anchor welded to a steel plate and one with two straight deformed bar, oriented at 90 $ sp circ$ and welded to an embedded steel angle, {{are close to the}} experimental results.

40|$|The thermal {{conduction}} of {{a portion of}} an enhanced surface heat exchanger for a gas fired heat pipe solar receiver was modeled using the boundary element and finite element methods (BEM and FEM) {{to determine the effect}} of weld fillet size on performance of a <b>stud</b> <b>welded</b> pin fin. A process that could be utilized by others for designing the surface mesh on an object of interest, performing a conversion from the mesh into the input format utilized by the BEM code, obtaining output {{on the surface of the}} object, and displaying visual results was developed. It was determined that the weld fillet on the pin fin significantly enhanced the heat performance, improving the operating margin of the heat exchanger. The performance of the BEM program on the pin fin was measured (as computational time) and used as a performance comparison with the FEM model. Given similar surface element densities, the BEM method took longer to get a solution than the FEM method.

40|$|The {{failure modes}} of K-joints of Concrete Filled Steel Tubular (CFST) truss {{structures}} were investigated through laboratory tests. CFST K-joint specimens {{consisted of a}} tubular chord filled with concrete and two braces inclined at the same angle {{with respect to the}} chord. Their size was chosen of the same scale as that of joints of real tubular structures currently used in bridges. The results were compared with those obtained by testing K-joint specimens of Circular Hollow Section (CHS) truss structures with the same size. Contrary to CHS K-joints, where a chord face failure mode occurred, in CFST K-joints no failure mode with inward deformation of the chord section can occur. Hence, punching shear failure was shown to be the typical failure mode of CFST K-joints, if no brace failure mode occurred before. Resistance of CFST K-joints to punching shear was then compared with the resistance values calculated through the Eurocode 3 and the AWS code formulae on CHS K-joints. The values provided by the former formula were quite close to (although always lower than) the actual resistance to punching shear of CFST K-joints. Finally, the favourable effect on joint resistance due to additional <b>studs</b> <b>welded</b> to the interior surface of the chord tube of CFST K-joint was also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|Friction <b>stud</b> <b>welding</b> {{has been}} used to attach grating to {{offshore}} oil platforms in areas where arc welding is not permitted because of the risk of causing a fire or explosion.

40|$|A {{reinforced}} concrete ductile flexural wall requires {{the placement of}} well-detailed concentrated reinforcement {{at the ends of}} the wall. This often results in congestion in these heavily reinforced regions, resulting in labourious construction. Two flexural wall specimens, containing structural steel boundary elements, were constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading to evaluate the performance of this new construction technique. For comparison, a third wall specimen meeting the requirements of a standard {{reinforced concrete}} ductile flexural wall was constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading. One of the composite walls used rectangular hollow structural sections (HSS) as boundary elements which were connected to the wall by welding the transverse bars directly to both HSS elements. The second wall used steel channels connected to the wall with headed <b>studs</b> <b>welded</b> to the channels. These studs overlapped with the transverse reinforcing bars, which had headed ends. The details of these three walls were chosen such that all of the walls had approximately the same flexural capacity. The reversed cyclic responses of the three walls showed that each wall had similar hysteretic properties. Following significant yielding of the structural steel, local buckling of the steel boundary elements in the composite walls was observed. The design used for ductile flexural walls was modified to enable comparable design of reinforced walls with steel boundary elements...|$|R
40|$|Near to its {{official}} publication, Eurocode 2 part 4 (EN 1992 - 4) {{does not account}} for design of anchor plates under seismic action. Anchor plates, with cast in place fasteners, are commonly used in nuclear power plants to connect equipment to reinforced concrete structures. Such solutions provide a flat surface where the support of equipment may be welded, furthermore cast in place fasteners require no drilling holes thus avoiding additional sealing operations. Classic anchor plates typically use at least four fasteners, thus complicating the installation when high density of reinforcement is expected. New specific solutions with only one headed anchor are investigated in this paper: a more classic solution made with a single <b>stud</b> <b>welded</b> in the centre of the steel plate, and a more innovative one made with a piece of an IPE profile, welded in the centre of the steel plate. An experimental campaign was carried out by adapting existing European protocols for the assessment of post-installed anchors under seismic action. Static tests, pulsating tension load tests and tests with constant tension load and varying crack width were carried out in unconfined condition and in cracked concrete under different load conditions.
