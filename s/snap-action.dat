2500|$|A {{miniature}} <b>snap-action</b> switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature <b>snap-action</b> switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|A {{pressure}} switch for sensing fluid pressure contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} switch contacts. Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature <b>snap-action</b> switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of {{pressure switch}} uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|Miniature <b>snap-action</b> switch may be {{used for}} example as {{components}} of such devices as photocopiers, computer printers, convertible tops or microwave ovens to ensure internal components are in the correct position for operation and to prevent operation when access doors are opened. A set of adjustable limit switches are installed on a garage door opener to shut off the motor when the door has reached the fully raised or fully lowered position. A numerical control machine such as a lathe will have limit switches to identify maximum limits for machine parts or to provide a known reference point for incremental motions.|$|E
50|$|A common {{modification}} was {{to replace}} the switches with miniature <b>snap-action</b> switches (microswitches). Some of these, however, have the problem that their actuation is non-linear; they require considerable force to start moving compared to the force needed to complete the motion. When used in an otherwise unmodified CX40, this caused it {{to be more difficult}} to move along the diagonals, as one of the two switches being pushed would normally reach the threshold first, causing motion in that direction while the other was not yet pressed. In games that required fine control, like Jumpman, these solutions were generally unsuitable. Newer switches improve this action.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "toggle" [...] is a {{reference}} to a kind of mechanism or joint consisting of two arms, which are almost in line with each other, connected with an elbow-like pivot. However, the phrase [...] "toggle switch" [...] is applied to a switch with a short handle and a positive <b>snap-action,</b> whether it actually contains a toggle mechanism or not. Similarly, a switch where a definitive click is heard, is called a [...] "positive on-off switch". A very common use of this type of switch is to switch lights or other electrical equipment on or off. Multiple toggle switches may be mechanically interlocked to prevent forbidden combinations.|$|E

5000|$|Thermostats {{are used}} to {{regulate}} the griddle surface around a temperature set point established by the operator.

This is due to the nature of the temperature control mechanism, which consists of a fluid-filled bulb (typically an oil) connected to the thermostat control via a long narrow capillary tube. The fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature, activating a control response from the thermostat. There is a time lag between sensing the temperature change from the surface of the griddle plate to the response of the fluid within the bulb, to the thermostat control and turning the heat source on or off, up or down. This lag is referred to as hysteresis, and is a primary aspect of recovery time - an important griddle performance metric.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Snap-action</b> {{bistable}} mechanisms have {{a practical}} use in applications when very few but well defined states of a micro-mechanism are required. Conventionally, the switching be-tween bistable states is done statically, utilizing either electrostatic or thermal actuation. This paper explores a paradigm utilizing structural resonance phenomena to switch dynamically between states. We reports a detailed mathematical model governing the non-linear {{response of the}} buckled beams in their bistable equilibrium; analytical and FEA results describing non-linear dynamics of the mechanism near its equilibrium state and transient dynamics of switching between bistable states; and design, fabrication, and initial characterization results of a micro-machined double-beam test structure.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration {{in which only}} upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, <b>snap-action</b> switch that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, {{making it possible to}} study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase- 8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl- 2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partne...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{are made of}} small <b>snap-action</b> switches designed for use in thermostatic controls operating on a. c. at 240 volts r. m. s., 50 Hz. The performance of the silver cadmium oxide contacts (Ag. CdO, 85 / 15 %) is evaluated over a range of currents from 1 to 10 amps, for make and break operations. The arc at break {{is found to be}} the predominant factor contributing to the erosion of the contacts for the range of currents used. Tests using a high speed camera show that the energy dissipated in the arc between the contacts can be evaluated from equations describing the arc in terms of its voltage, current and length as functions of time. Subsequently work is carried out to develop the relation between arc energy and contact erosion, with specific regard to the distribution of energy between the two contact surfaces and the arc column. This is related to the power dissipation in the two electrode fall regions, and the resulting direction of net material transfer is thought to be influenced by the length achieved by the arc before extinction. Erosion is generally in the form of anodic loss and cathodic gain and the reasons for the directional bias in this type of switch are suggested. Ways of reducing the amount of erosion per operation by changing the switch opening characteristic are discussed and supported with experimental results. PETER J...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{are made of}} a typical <b>snap-action</b> rocker switch, to establish the wear mechanisms in the pivoting contact. The rocker switch, used extensively in consumer goods, operates in the medium duty current range, (1 - 30 Amps). Highspeed photographic {{studies have shown that}} the main cause of wear is arcing, occurring during separation and bounce at the pivot contacts. To reduce the bounce a computer-based mathematical model of the system dynamics is developed and optimised; this results in recommended design changes. These changes are tested under full current endurance conditions, and show significant improvements in wear. The model of the switch dynamics relates the mathematics of motion to the bounce occuring at the pivot contact, without the influence of current. To show the effect of current and arcing, an automatic test system is developed for the controlled testing of electrical contacts. The system has the ability to evaluate arc energy, bounce times, and contact resistance. The results presented detail the influence of d. c current on contact bounce time, and identify the importance of the subsequent bounce time; which is defined for a single make operation, as the total duration of the bounces occurring after the first bounce. To compare the erosion profiles of the switch and test system, the system is operated under full load current endurance conditions, to evaluate wear. This comparison shows that the wear in the real switch contacts is greater, as result of the additional contact movement of slip and rolling. Arrow-Hart (Europe) Ltd, Plymouth, Devo...|$|E
