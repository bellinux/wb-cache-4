40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of wireless input systems and corresponding interaction techniques. We investigate the use of wireless input systems for immersive interaction {{in a large scale}} virtual environment displayed on a 6. 4 m× 2 m stereoscopic projection system. The system is used to present a complete car body at full scale, allowing users to walk up to 6 m in front of the vim object. The working volume needed for immersive interaction in this scenario is much larger than that typically realized by a HMD or CAVE making the use of cable bound devices problematic. Interactions realized in this environment include: Accurate head tracking to allow high quality undistorted stereoscopic rendering at natural <b>scale.</b> <b>Head</b> tracking for navigation as intuitive interaction by walking around. Positioning the car on the ground. Menu selection for different preselected models, assemblies or environments. Control of the virtual lighting situation. For head tracking a cluster of comm ercially available optical trackers with a single passive reflective target is used. For manual interaction wireless button devices with inertial sensors for acceleration and spin have been built. The application of these devices and the combination of input channels in different interactions is presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{testing of}} the ability to set a {{luminous}} line to the direction of gravity in passively-tilted subjects, in darkness, has revealed a remarkable pattern of systematic errors at tilts beyond 60 °, as if body tilt is undercompensated or underestimated (Aubert or A-effect). We investigated whether these consistent deviations from orientation constancy can be avoided during active body tilt, where more potential cues about body tilt (e. g. proprioception and efference copy) are available. The effects of active body tilt on the subjective vertical and on the perception of self tilt were studied in six subjects. After adopting a laterally-tilted posture, while standing in a dark room, they indicated the subjective vertical by adjusting a visual line and gave their verbal estimate of head orientation, expressed on a clock <b>scale.</b> <b>Head</b> roll tilts covered the range from − 150 ° to + 150 °. The subjective vertical results showed no sign of improvement. Actively-tilted subjects still exhibited the same pattern of systematic errors that characterised their performance during passive tilt. Random errors in this task showed a steep monotonic increase with tilt angle, as in earlier passive tilt experiments. By contrast, verbal head-tilt estimates in the active experiments showed a clear improvement and were now almost devoid of systematic errors, but the noise level remained high. Various models are discussed in an attempt to clarify how these task-related differences and the selective improvement of the self-tilt estimates in the active experiments may have come about...|$|E

40|$|Background: Computed {{tomography}} (CT) {{can facilitate}} {{the diagnosis of}} life-threatening injuries in polytrauma patients. Reported times to imaging vary widely, {{but it has been}} suggested that rapid whole body scanning improves mortality rates. The aim of this study was to determine the time to CT for severe polytrauma patients presenting to a level I trauma centre in Australia. Methods: Retrospective audit of prospectively collected trauma registry data combined with electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria were trauma patients with injury severity score ≥ 16 who underwent CT scanning over a 12 -month period. Exclusion criteria were scans performed at regional centres or greater than 5 h after arrival. Time to commencement of CT was defined as time from arrival to the first CT image being recorded, and time to completion of CT as the time from arrival to recording the final CT image. Time in CT was defined as minutes between acquisition of the first and final images. Results: Two hundred thirty-three eligible patients were admitted over the study period. CT acquisition times were median 76 min (interquartile range (IQR) 52 – 115) to commencement, 93 min (IQR 71 – 129) to completion and time in CT 14 min (IQR 6 – 24). Time to completion was faster for isolated head scans, abbreviated injury <b>scale</b> <b>head</b> > 3, intubated patients and those with subsequent fatal outcome. Conclusions: Although 93 min to completion of trauma CT scans is comparable with some international reports, it falls well behind centres who have demonstrated improved outcomes with CT scanning. Our results serve as a baseline to our and potentially other Australasian trauma centres to improve on this surrogate measure of trauma team efficacy...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{advantages}} of unicondylar arthroplasty (UKA) over total knee arthroplasty in patients presenting osteoarthritis {{in only a}} single compartment {{have been identified in}} the literature. However, accurate implant positioning and alignment targets, which have been shown to significantly affect outcomes, are routinely missed by conventional techniques. Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) has demonstrated its ability to improve implant accuracy, reducing outliers. Despite this, existing commercial systems have seen extremely limited adoption. Survey indicates the bulk, cost, and complexity of existing systems as inhibitive characteristics. We present a concept system based upon small <b>scale</b> <b>head</b> mounted tracking and augmented reality guidance intended to mitigate these factors. A visible-spectrum stereoscopic system, able to track multiple fiducial markers to 6 DoF via photogrammetry and perform semi-active speed constrained resection, was combined with a head mounted display, to provide a video-see-through augmented reality system. The accuracy of this system was investigated by probing 180 points upon a 110 × 110 × 50 mm known geometry and performing controlled resection upon a 60 × 60 × 15 mm bone phantom guided by an overlaid augmented resection guide that updated in real-time. The system produced an RMS probing accuracy and precision of 0. 55 ± 0. 04 and 0. 10 ± 0. 01 mm, respectively. Controlled resection resulted in an absolute resection error of 0. 34 ± 0. 04 mm with a general trend of over-resection of 0. 10 ± 0. 07 mm. The system was able to achieve the sub-millimetre accuracy considered necessary to successfully position unicondylar knee implants. Several refinements of the system, such as pose filtering, are expected to increase the functional volume over which this accuracy is obtained. The presented system improves upon several objections to existing commercial CAOS UKA systems, and shows great potential both within surgery itself and its training. Furthermore, it is suggested the system could be readily extended to additional orthopaedic procedures requiring accurate and intuitive guidance...|$|E
40|$|Although {{patients}} with severe multiple injuries may have {{other reasons for}} unconsciousness, traumatic brain injury (TBI) in these patients is frequently defined by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Nevertheless, the diag-nostic value of GCS for severe TBI in the multiple-injured patient is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the diagnostic value of GCS to identify severe TBI in multiple-injured patients. The records of 18, 002 severely injured adult (ISS> 16) patients from the Trauma Register of the German Society for Trauma Surgery were analyzed and initial GCS and Abbreviated Injury <b>Scale</b> <b>head</b> (AIShead) were recorded. A severe TBI was defined by an AIShead ‡ 3. On the other hand, unconsciousness was defined by an initial GCS £ 8. By these criteria, 6546 patients (36. 3 %) were unconscious, and 8746 patients (48. 6 %) had severe TBI. Nine percent of all cases (n = 1643) had a GCS £ 8 without severe TBI. Only 56. 1 % of {{patients with}} severe TBI (n = 4903) had been unconscious. Decreasing levels of unconsciousness (as defined by GCS) showed consistent rising prevalence of severe TBI (correlation coefficient r =- 0. 52). Approximately 20 % of all multiple-injured patients arriving in the emergency department with an initial GCS of 15 had severe TBI (AIShead ‡ 3). The diagnostic value of GCS £ 8 for severe TBI in patients with multiple injuries has low sensitivity (56. 1 %) but higher specificity (82. 2 %). Our study indicates that the GCS (as defined £ 8) in unconsciousness patients with multiple injuries shows only a moderate cor-relation with the diagnosis of severe TBI. Nevertheless, {{the main reason for}} unconsciousness in patients with multiple injuries is TBI, since only 9 % of these patients had another reason for unconsciousness. However, due to the poor sensitivity of GCS, we suggest the use of the anatomical scoring system with AIShead ‡ 3 to define severe TBI in patients with multiple injuries...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION:: Early {{prediction}} of massive transfusion (MT) {{is critical in}} the management of severely injured trauma patients. Variables available early after injury including physiologic, laboratory, and rotation thromboelastometric (ROTEM) parameters were evaluated as predictors for the need of MT. METHODS:: After Institutional Review Board approval, we retrospectively reviewed a cohort of severely injured trauma patients (Injury Severity Score ≥ 16) admitted to a Level I trauma center with available ROTEM measurements on hospital admission during a 1 -year study period. Patients with isolated head injury (Abbreviated Injury <b>Scale</b> <b>head</b> ≥ 3 and Abbreviated Injury Scale chest, abdomen, and extremity < 3) and patients with a penetrating mechanism of injury were excluded. Patients who received a MT (≥ 10 units packed red blood cell within 24 hours of admission) were compared with patients who did not. Variables independently associated with MT were identified using stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS:: A total of 53 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 18 patients (34. 0 %) received a MT and 35 patients (66. 0 %) did not. Massively transfused patients had significantly lower baseline hemoglobin values (7. 9 g/dL ± 0. 4 g/dL vs. 11. 4 g/dL ± 0. 4 g/dL; p < 0. 001) and a trend toward higher lactate (4. 8 mmol/L ± 0. 8 mmol/L vs. 3. 0 mmol/L ± 0. 3 mmol/L; p = 0. 056) and base deficit values (5. 9 mmol/L ± 1. 1 mmol/L vs. 3. 6 mmol/L ± 0. 6 mmol/L; p = 0. 052). Mean international normalized ratio (1. 46 ± 0. 07 vs. 1. 22 ± 0. 05; p = 0. 001) and partial thromboplastin times (42. 4 seconds ± 5. 0 seconds vs. 29. 7 seconds ± 1. 8 seconds; p < 0. 001) were significantly higher in MT patients. Patients receiving a MT had significantly altered ROTEM values on admission compared with non-MT patients. An increase in the clot formation time (471. 3 seconds ± 169. 9 seconds vs. 178. 1 seconds ± 19. 9 seconds; p = 0. 001), a shortening of the maximum clot firmness (37. 5 mm ± 2. 9 mm vs. 50. 7 mm ± 1. 4 mm; p < 0. 001), and a shortening of the clot amplitude at all time points (10 / 20 / 30 minutes) were observed in massively transfused trauma patients. Variables independently associated with MT included a hemoglobin level ≤ 10 g/dL and an abnormal maximum clot firmness value (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve: 0. 831 [95 % confidence interval: 0. 719 - 0. 942; p < 0. 001]). CONCLUSION:: Hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL and an abnormal maximum cloth firmness measured by rotation thromboelastometry on admission reliably predict the need for MT. Prospective validation of the effectiveness of thromboelastometry to guide the transfusion practice after trauma is warranted...|$|E
