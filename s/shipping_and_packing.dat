His great grandfather, William Smith Muir, served in the Mormon Battalion during the War with Mexico and as a sergeant in the U.S. Army raised the first American flag over San Diego, California. William Smith later settled in Bountiful, Utah where he began to farm in 1852. His descendants used the farm in Bountiful as the nucleus for a <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> business for fresh produce from Utah, Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada. Muir's father, Edward Wallace Muir Sr., was the long-serving president of the company, then known as Muir-Roberts, Co., Inc. Muir's brother, Phillip R. Muir, serves as the fifth-generation president of the company, now known as Muir Copper Canyon Farms, which is a food service provider for restaurants and institutions in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Muir's maternal grandfather, Samuel Morgan, was the Superintendent of Schools in Davis County, Utah. Muir's mother, Mary Margaret Muir, is an art historian who taught at the University of Utah and {{is an expert on}} the noted western landscape painter, LeConte Stewart.|$|E

40|$|The Army’s current {{chemical}} weapons (CW) disposal program involves robotic, machine disassembly {{of the chemical}} weapon as appropriate for each specific munition. The various waste materials from disassembly are incinerated separately. These include the chemical agent, explosives and propellants, empty munitions and nonexplosive (storage) containers, and <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> materials (dunnage). Preliminary separation produces individual waste streams that are relatively homogeneous, which makes it feasible to optimize conditions for the incineration of each. To handle the various waste streams produced by disassembly, four different furnace systems are required: Incinerator for the liquid chemical agent and process liquid waste; Rotary kiln furnace {{for the destruction of}} explosives and propellants, with an accompanying heated discharge conveyer to remove leftover materials; Metal parts furnace to decontaminate by incineration the empty bulk containers, shells, and bombs; and Dunnage incinerator for the combustion of waste packaging. The resulting gases and other products of incineration are treated with a variety of modern pollution abatement equipment, including a quench tower, venturi scrubber, scrubber tower, demister, and for the dunnage furnace, a baghouse for removal of particulate. Brine produced by the scrubbers is evaporated, and the resulting salts are packed in drums for eventual landfill. The final products that will require disposal such as landfill are scrap metal, drums of salt, and ash (l). The time required to dispose of the stockpiles at the eight continental U. S. sites after the incinerators begin to work was estimated in the 1988 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to be from 11 months (at Lexington-Blue Grass Arm...|$|E

50|$|In the 1930s {{scouting}} in {{the council}} experienced some growing pains. One of the greatest disasters to ever hit north Mississippi occurred on April 5, 1936. A tornado hit Tupelo cutting a path almost a mile wide. As {{a result of the}} disaster the Council Office was moved to New Albany. In the fall, it was returned to Tupelo {{at the request of the}} Regional Office in Memphis. The new office was in the Knox Building on West Main. In February 1939, the Council was unable to financially retain a full-time professional largely due to the effects of the Great Depression. The Council Office was kept open under the direction of one office secretary until February 1940. Despite the effects of the 1930s, scouting remained viable {{in the council}} with the formation of the first Sea Scout <b>Ship</b> <b>and</b> Cub <b>Pack</b> as well as contingents to the National Jamboree and the wilderness camp Philturn (now known as Philmont) in New Mexico. The early 1940s were defined by World War II, but scouting continued throughout the war. In 1941 advanced scouts attending Camp Yocona were given the rare privilege of participating in the initiation ceremonies of the establishment of Chicksa Lodge 202. Chicksa Lodge became the local lodge of the Order of the Arrow, a service society of Honor Campers.|$|R

30|$|This {{category}} {{is the least}} explored in warehousing literature during the last decade, and practitioners also found very low interest in this area. One reason can be its low contribution in deriving costs for the warehouse in comparison with other operations (i.e., storage and picking). Papers on managing the receiving <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> operations are very scarce, {{and most of the}} literature in this category focuses on resource assignment (e.g., truck and dock) independent from other operations in the warehouse. Receiving <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> operations have the potential to be investigated more, independent from other operations and in integration with them. Before <b>shipping,</b> the picked <b>and</b> <b>packed</b> items are usually required to wait in the buffer zone until delivery time. Planning the shipping schedule in integration with picking can help save the required space for in-process items. This is particularly important for warehouses with severe space problems, as this was observed by one of the interviewees. Furthermore, integrated schedule planning of storage/picking and receiving/shipping operations can provide the opportunity to assign staff more efficiently. Another potential opportunity for research is integration of dock assignment and receiving/shipping schedule. Number of docks is limited, and if the transportation is not planned accordingly, the transport operators should wait until a vacant dock is available for loading/unloading. Integration of these two problems can make a considerable contribution to reducing the transport cost, because the transport operators charge companies for the waiting time as well as the operation. This integrated problem can be explored under setups of both separate and common docks for receiving <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> operations.|$|R
