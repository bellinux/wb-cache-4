40|$|Advocacy for Inclusion is a not-for-profit non-government {{community}} organisation in the Australian Capital Territory. This <b>submission</b> <b>centres</b> on our direct practice experience {{with people with}} disabilities, including individual advocacy support, self-advocacy support, and consultations undertaken during previous projects, as well as draws from peer reviewed research literature. We highlight consumer insights into institutional settings, and their direct experiences of violence, including two in-depth personal stories of people with disabilities, shared with their permission. These are perspectives rarely heard by the broader community.   The term ‘violence’ {{is used as a}} broad term in this submission to encompass abuse, neglect, and restrictive practices, because they all stem from misuse of power against people with disabilities, whether deliberate acts or otherwise. Violence against people with disabilities can manifest in unique ways compared to violence against non-disabled people, and for this reason it often goes unrecognised. This submission explores a wide range of violence against people with disabilities, from the use of generic institutional practices that deny real choice and control, to overt acts of violence that are recognised in criminal law.   Our key message is that institutional models for disability support are inherently flawed, violent by design, and must be phased out, particularly with the opportunities brought by the National Disability Insurance Scheme...|$|E
40|$|The PhD <b>submission</b> <b>centres</b> {{primarily}} on the book Testing the Limits of Foster Care, which reports {{on a piece of}} applied social work research, and the paper Critical Times: a critical realist approach to understanding services for looked after children which examines key theoretical issues relevant to the study. Two other book chapters ‘Changing Perceptions of Children and Childhood’ and ‘Risk and Opportunity in Leaving Care’ are included as supplementary examples of the applicant’s work. In common with Testing the Limits of Foster Care, these seek to understand aspects of child welfare practice in light of wider changes in society and social policy and so are consistent with a critical realist perspective. The study reported in the book Testing the Limits of Foster Care was an evaluation of a foster care project set up to provide an alternative to secure accommodation (Community Alternative Placement Scheme). The research was concerned with how the scheme developed, the nature of the service and its capacity to help young people have good experiences and outcomes. Its purpose was to assess the potential and limitations of this form of care provision. The book outlines the development of the service, and the needs, experiences and outcomes for the first twenty young people placed within the scheme. These are compared with similar young people placed in secure accommodation during the same period. In most respects outcomes were similar for both samples. However outcomes were not viewed as directly resulting from one particular placement, but rather influenced by a host of considerations relating to the young person’s own circumstances and nature of services offered. Foster care and secure accommodation offered young people {{a very different kind of}} experience, whilst access to other services such as education and support to independent living were equally important in determining how they fared.

SUBJECTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS In October 2001 13 people were exposed to packages suspected of containing anthrax spores in two separate incidents in government offices in South Wales. The manage-ment of both incidents was based on the local health authori-ty’s major incident procedure and emergency response plan for chemical incidents.

A detailed <b>submission</b> for the <b>centre</b> was made in 1977 by T.S.

40|$|My 26 June <b>submission</b> and {{presentation}} <b>centred</b> on evaluating whether the proposed project {{may make a}} positive contribution to sustainability. Two matters addressed briefly in the presentation and associated discussion were • how to approach induced and cumulative effects {{in the context of}} considering the project’s lasting effects and legacy, and • how to construct an overall framework for evaluating contribution to sustainability. This addendum provides further comment on these two topics, plus an additional note on monitoring, in the event that the project is approved and implemented. Induced and cumulative effects and project legacy The most straightforward and simple approach to an evaluation of the proposed project’s lasting effects is to focus only on the project itself. As proposed, the quarry has a life expectancy of roughly 50 years. The proponents anticipate no expansions or extensions and no inducement of further similar projects in the area. If that scenario is accepted as the only possibility worthy of attention, then the evaluatio...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} and growing worldwide interest in emissions trading as an economy-wide policy measure that effectively creates {{a competitive market}} for greenhouse emissions to efficiently deliver the reductions necessary to minimise climate change. Internationally, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) began operation in January 2005, while the Kyoto Protocol’s Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are also built around emissions trading. In Australia, NSW has introduced a state-based ETS, and while the Federal Government has expressed opposition to national emissions trading, Australian State and Territory Governments have begun exploring options for a multi-jurisdictional ETS. As part of this latter work, an Inter-Jurisdictional Working Group on Emissions Trading is conducting an inquiry of stakeholders on their design options for a national emissions trading scheme.

40|$|We present eight {{computer}} programs {{written in the}} C programming language {{that are designed to}} analyze genotypic data and to support existing software used to construct genetic linkage maps. Although each program has a unique purpose, they all share the common goals of affording a greater understanding of genetic linkage data and of automating tasks to make computers more effective tools for map building. The PIC/HET and FAMINFO programs automate calculation of relevant quantities such as heterozygosity, PIC, allele frequencies, and informativeness of markers and pedigrees. PREINPUT simplifies data <b>submissions</b> to the <b>Centre</b> d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) data base by creating a file with genotype assignments that CEPH's INPUT program would otherwise require to be input manually. INHERIT is a program written specifically for mapping the X chromosome: by assigning a dummy allele to males, in the nonpseudoautosomal region, it eliminates falsely perceived noninheritances in the data set. The remaining four programs complement the previously published genetic linkage mapping software CRI-MAP and LINKAGE. TWOTABLE produces a more readable format for the output of CRI-MAP two-point calculations; UNMERGE is the converse to CRI-MAP's merge option; and GENLINK and LINKGEN automatically convert between the genotypic data file formats required by these packages. All eight applications read input from the same types of data files that are used by CRI-MAP and LINKAGE. Their use has simplified the management of data, has increased knowledge of the content of information in pedigrees, and has reduced the amount of time needed to construct genetic linkage maps of chromosomes...|$|R

Communications Law <b>Centre</b> <b>submission</b> to the inquiry The CLC recommends that the government waits until the digital roll-out takes place before reforming ownership laws. Campaign for Australian Media Diversity submission to the inquiry CAMD argues that any changes to Australia’s media ownership laws should achieve greater diversity of media ownership in Australia. THE GOVERNMENT’S MARCH 2006 PROPOSALS Meeting the digital challenge: reforming Australia’s media in the digital age The government’s media discussion paper cavassed options for increasing and diversifying digital services and lifting foreign ownership restrictions and cross-media controls. According to communications minister Coonan, “These reform options marry the government’s longstanding policy of changes to cross media laws in Australia and relaxation of the foreign ownership restrictions with reforms to ensure Australia will not be left behind as the world converts to digital. ” Unlocking the potential: an action agenda for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s digital content industry This Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts report deals {{with some of the}} same issues as the media regulation discussion paper. COMMENTARY What on earth is datacasting? The Productivity Commission is right, says Margaret Simons. Datacasting {{is no more than a}} "a regulatory artifice" Stop tiptoeing around TV’s future The introduction of free-to-air digital TV has been an utter failure, writes Jock Given Should we rely on the regulators? What 2 ̆ 7 s not in the government’s media Bills might be as important as what is, writes Jock Given Will viewers like the digital challenge? More diversity is needed to encourage the uptake of digital TV, according to Jason Bosland, Andrew Kenyon and Robin Wright from the Centre for Media and Communications Law at the the University of Melbourne. Local content lost in policy Only real competition, and funding for local content, will secure the future of Australian TV, writes Stuart Cunningham from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries & Innovation. The signal is clear: do not adjust your sets The federal government’s media policy fails to unlock TV’s full potential, writes Jock Given. Media ownership laws relaxed but government control increased (Word document) Media independence, local content and diversity will be the ultimate losers, according to the Communications Law Centre FROM THE APO ARCHIVE Cross-media reform: a setback for media diversity Franco Papandrea, director of the Communication and Media Policy Institute at the University of Canberra, examines the likely impact of relaxed media ownership laws on a number of capital cities and regional centres. The new rules, he argues, will lead to “a substantial reduction in the number of independent media owners in local markets” and consequently to a decline in diversity of views in those regions. Media regulation and the media revolution In this speech to the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s annual conference in late 2005, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Graeme Samuel, discusses the question of whether technological change is making many of our existing concerns about media regulation irrelevant.
