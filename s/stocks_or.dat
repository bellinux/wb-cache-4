5|$|The terms {{cultigen}} and cultivar may {{be confused}} with each other. Cultigen is a general-purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category. Cultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group. The Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are: deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated <b>stocks,</b> <b>or</b> from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation. Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants, plants with binomial Latin names that {{are the result of}} ancient human selection, and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names. In practice most cultigens are cultivars.|$|E

25|$|Value {{investing}} {{has proven}} to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate its success. One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio <b>stocks,</b> <b>or</b> low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The EMH was {{developed}} by Professor Eugene Fama who argued that stocks always trade at their fair value, {{making it impossible for}} investors to either purchase undervalued <b>stocks</b> <b>or</b> sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments. His 2012 study with Kenneth French confirmed this view, showing that the distribution of abnormal returns of US mutual funds is very similar to what would be expected if no fund managers had any skill—a necessary condition for the EMH to hold.|$|E

The mixture is specified in terms of gas fractions of the component gases, and the convention is to specify the type, (nitrox, trimix or heliox) and composition as percentage by volume of oxygen, helium if present, and nitrogen. The remainder of nitrogen is not always specifically stated, and is assumed to be the balance.|$|E
25|$|Rectals are {{a risk to}} the practitioner, and {{the horse}} is ideally {{examined}} either in <b>stocks</b> <b>or</b> over a stall door to prevent kicking, with the horse twitched, and possibly sedated if extremely painful and likely {{to try to go}} down. Buscopan is sometimes used to facilitate rectal examination and reduce the risk of tears, because it decreases the smooth muscle tone of the gastrointestinal tract, but can be contraindicated and will produce a very rapid heart rate. Because the rectum is relatively fragile, the risk of rectal tears is always present whenever an examination is performed. Severe rectal tears often result in death or euthanasia. However, the diagnostic benefits of a rectal examination almost always outweigh these risks.|$|E
25|$|All real {{property}} and personal property {{is subject to}} tax unless specifically exempted by law. Personal property also is taxed, although most personal property owned by individuals is exempt. Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts, <b>stocks</b> <b>or</b> bonds. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes; however, the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{considers}} a general class of twodimensional, discrete population models where each per capita transition function (fitness) {{depends on a}} linear combination of the densities of the interacting populations. The fitness functions are either monotone decreasing functions (pioneer fitnesses) or one-humped functions (climax fitnesses). Conditions are derived which guarantee that an equilibrium loses stability through a period-doubling bifurcation {{with respect to the}} pioneer self-crowding parameter. A constant term which represents <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting of the pioneer population is introduced into the system. Conditions are determined under which this <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting will reverse the bifurcation and restabilize the equilibrium, and comparisons are made with the effects of density dependent <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting. Examples illustrate the importance of the concavity of the pioneer fitness in determining whether <b>stocking</b> <b>or</b> harvesting has a stabilizing effect. 1. Introduction. System...|$|R

25|$|For centuries {{large numbers}} of lead bars have been found on the Mediterranean seabed, and there was debate over whether they were anchor <b>stocks</b> <b>or</b> not. It was argued by some that iron tipped wooden anchors secured by ropes were not heavy enough to be {{effective}} {{so they had to}} have metal stocks and there was considerable academic controversy over the issue. The Nemi ships, constructed during the transition period when iron anchors were replacing wooden ones, were the first Roman wrecks found to have intact anchors, and confirmed that the lead bars were indeed anchor stocks. Two types of anchor were found, one of oak with iron-tipped flukes and a stock of lead while the other was of iron with a folding timber stock that closely matched the design of the Admiralty pattern anchor re-invented in 1841. In the 1960s, a similar anchor was found in Pompeii and in 1974 another was found buried near Aberdarewllyn in Gwynedd, Wales. These further discoveries confirmed that these technologically advanced anchors were a standard Roman design.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Finnlines {{decided to}} further simplify {{the myriad of}} names under which it {{operated}} ships, merging Finnlink and Nordö-Link into the parent company. Finnlines also ordered five new large ro-pax ferries from the Italian shipyard Fincantieri. After numerous delays, the first vessel, MS Finnstar was delivered in August 2006 for the Helsinki–Travemünde service, MS Finnmaid followed later in the same year, while MS Finnlady, MS Europalink and MS Nordlink were delivered in February, March and July 2007, respectively. Coinciding with the delivery of MS Nordlink the old MS Malmö Link was sold. In August 2007 {{it was reported that}} Finnlines has ordered six new ice classed roro vessels from the Jinling Shipyard in China, with planned delivery dates in 2010 for the first two vessels and 2011 for the remaining four. In January 2007 the Italian Grimaldi Group became the largest owner of Finnlines and expressed interest in purchasing the entire company. However, a public tender offer made to the other owners in November 2006 resulted in Grimaldi gaining only 85,029 <b>stocks,</b> <b>or</b> 0.18% of the total. On 25 August 2016, the Grimaldi Group completed the acquisition of Finnlines, getting the control of 100 per cent of the company.|$|E
500|$|Population {{growth and}} {{economic}} dislocation {{from the second}} half of the sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy. The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation in 1574, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief and justices of the peace were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1574 act was modelled on the English act passed two years earlier and limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of [...] "masterful beggars", including jugglers, palmisters and unlicensed tutors. Parish deacons, elders or other overseers were to draw up lists of deserving poor and each would be assessed. Those not belonging to the parish were to be sent back to their place of birth and might be put in the <b>stocks</b> <b>or</b> otherwise punished, probably actually increasing the level of vagrancy. Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor. In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship.|$|E

500|$|In the Middle Ages Scotland {{had much}} more limited {{organisation}} for poor relief than England, lacking the religious confraternities of the major English cities. It possessed a few hospitals, bede houses and leper houses, which offered confinement rather than treatment. Because so many Scottish parishes had been impropriated for some religious foundation, {{perhaps as many as}} 87 per cent, funds were not available for local causes such as poor relief. Protestant reformers in the Book of Discipline (1560) proposed that part of the patrimony of the Catholic Church be used to support the poor, but this aim was never realised. Population growth and economic dislocation from {{the second half of the}} sixteenth century led to a growing problem of vagrancy. The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation on poverty and vagrancy in 1574, 1579 and 1592.

Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor. In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship. Poor rates were very slow to be set up in the burghs, with Edinburgh the first as a result of the outbreak of plague in 1584. It was then gradually introduced in other cities, such as St Andrews in 1597, Perth in 1599, Aberdeen in 1619, and Glasgow and Dundee in 1636.|$|E
