40|$|We design {{modified}} value investing {{strategies in}} emerging equity markets by comparing a country's value weight with its market capitalization weight {{among a group}} of emerging countries. These strategies can be easily tested and implemented by using various country index funds. Our proposed strategy calculates the delta weight, the difference of a country's weight based on value (Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Earning-Price (EP) ratio or Dividend Yield (DY)) and its capitalization weight, for each country. If the delta weight is positive, the country's index fund is considered undervalued and the strategy is to buy delta shares of that country's equity. Conversely, if delta weight is negative, the country's index fund is deemed as overvalued and the strategy is to <b>short</b> <b>delta</b> shares of that country's equity. These market neutral delta strategies can generate annualized returns of 14. 25 - 16. 89 % even with the presence of over-weighting constraints which limit the over-investment in small financial markets. ...|$|E

40|$|Current-based {{tests are}} the most {{effective}} methods available to detect resistive <b>shorts.</b> <b>Delta</b> I DDQ testing is the most sensitive variant and can handle off-state currents of 10 - 100 mA of a single core. Nevertheless this {{is not sufficient to}} handle the next generations of very deep sub-micron technologies. Moreover delay-fault testing and very-low voltage testing are not a real alternative for the detection of resistive shorts. The main limitation of ΔI DDQ testing is the intra-die variation of the threshold voltage which results in variations in the off-state current. Two methods are investigated that improve the detection capabilities of ΔI DDQ testing. The first method reduces the impact of intra-die variation by reducing the amount of logic that switches states. This method can handle very large off-state currents although at the cost of a substantial increase in test time. The second method investigates the correct scaling of the intra-die variations as a function of temperature. We show that both methods improve the detection capabilities of ΔI DDQ testing. ...|$|R

Using a double-chamber tissue bath and standard microelectrode technique, {{the occurrence of}} spontaneous repetitive responses was investigated during simulated ischemia (occlusion) and after reperfusing the previously ischemic superfused tissue with normal Tyrode's solution (reperfusion). In 62 experiments (42 animals) the effects of: (1) duration of simulated ischemia (1321 +/- 435 s), (2) stimulation rate (1002 +/- 549 ms) and (3) number of successive simulated ischemic periods (occlusions) (1. 58 +/- 0. 92) on: (1) resting membrane potential, (2) action potential amplitude, (3) duration of 50 and 90 % action potentials and (4) maximal upstroke velocity of action potential were studied. All variables were considered as gradients (delta) between normal and ischemic tissue. Both during occlusion and upon reperfusion, spontaneous repetitive responses were coded as single, couplets, salvos (three to nine and > 10) or total spontaneous repetitive responses (coded present when {{at least one of}} the above-mentioned types was seen). The incidence of total spontaneous repetitive responses was 31 % (19 / 62) on occlusion and 85 % (53 / 62) upon reperfusion. Cox's models (forced and stepwise) were used to predict multivariately the occurrence of arrhythmic events considered as both total spontaneous repetitive responses and as separate entities. These models were applicable since continuous monitoring of the experiments enabled exact timing of spontaneous repetitive response onset during both occlusion and reperfusion. In predicting reperfusion spontaneous repetitive responses, total spontaneous repetitive responses and blocks observed during the occlusion period were also considered. Total occlusion spontaneous repetitive responses were predicted by: (1) longer delta 50 % action potential duration (t = 2. 68), (2) <b>shorter</b> <b>delta</b> 90 % action potential duration (t = - 2. 17) and (3) fewer occlusive periods (t = - 2. 46). Total reperfusion spontaneous repetitive responses were predicted by a longer delta action potential amplitude (t = 2. 18). Due to few events during occlusion, prediction of individual arrhythmic entities was not possible. Upon reperfusion single spontaneous repetitive responses were predicted by longer delta maximal upstroke velocity of action potential (t = 2. 59) and <b>shorter</b> <b>delta</b> 90 % action potential duration (t = - 2. 55); couplets were predicted by longer delta 50 % action potential duration (t = 3. 26); longer delta action potential amplitude predicted salvos (> 10) (t = 3. 26).

40|$|Background An {{increasing}} number of candidemia episodes {{has been reported in}} patients cared for in internal medicine wards. These usually older and frail patients may not be suspected as having candidemia because they lack fever {{at the onset of the}} episode. To identify the risk factors associated with the lack of fever at the onset of candidemia (ie, the collection of the first positive blood culture for Candida spp.) in patients cared for in internal medicine wards, we compared 2 group of patients with or without fever. Methods We retrospectively review data charts from 3 tertiary care, university hospitals in Italy, comparing patients with or without fever at onset of candidemia. Consecutive candidemic episodes in afebrile patients and matched febrile controls were identified during the 3 -year study period. Patient baseline characteristics and several infection-related variables were examined. Random forest analysis was used, given the number of predictors to be considered and the potential complexity of their relations with the onset of fever. Results We identified 147 candidemic episodes without fever at onset and 147 febrile candidemia episodes. Factors associated with the lack of fever at onset of candidemia were diabetes, Clostridium difficile infection, and a <b>shorter</b> <b>delta</b> time from internal medicine wards admission to the onset of candidemia. The only variable associated with fever was the use of intravascular devices. Quite unexpectedly, antifungal therapy was administered more frequently to patients without fever, and no differences on 30 -day mortality rate were documented in the 2 study groups. Conclusions Clinicians should be aware that an {{increasing number}} of patients with invasive candidiasis cared for in internal medicine wards may lack fever at onset, especially those with diabetes and C. difficile infection.

40|$|The {{suppression}} of turbulent transport by large scale mean shear flows and uniform magnetic fields is investigated in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence {{driven by a}} small-scale forcing with finite correlation time.

While fluctuating kinetic and magnetic energies are unaffected by the magnetic field just as in the case of a delta correlated forcing, they are much more severely quenched by flow shear than in that of a delta correlated forcing.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{emergence}} of electronic non-trivial topological flat bands in time-periodically driven strained graphene within a tight binding approach based on the Floquet formalism. In particular, we focus on uniaxial spatially periodic strain since it can be mapped onto an effective one-dimensional system. Also, two kinds of time-periodic driving are considered: a <b>short</b> pulse (<b>delta</b> kicking) and a sinusoidal variation (harmonic driving). We prove that for special strain wavelengths, the system is described by a two level Dirac Hamiltonian. Even though the study case is gapless, we find that topologically non-trivial flat bands emerge not only at zero-quasienergy but also at ±π quasienergy, the latter being {{a direct consequence of}} the periodicity of the Floquet space. Both kind of flat bands are thus understood as dispersionless bands joining two inequivalent touching band points with opposite Berry phase. This is confirmed by explicit evaluation of the Berry phase in the touching band points' neighborhood. Using that information, the topological phase diagram of the system is built. Additionally, the experimental feasibility of the model is discussed and two methods for the experimental realization of our model are proposed.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the flecainide plasma concentrations capable to inhibit the abnormal Kent's pathways, 9 patients affected by a Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome were studied. One of them (a female 21 years old) previously received 200 mg oral flecainide "una tantum", 8 received 100 mg bid for at least 2 weeks. They had a short PR interval and an evident delta wave on the surface ECG, diagnostic for pre-excitation syndrome. The flecainide plasma half-life calculated in 6 patients chronically treated correlated directly and strictly with age. In all patients the flecainide treatment blocked the conduction through the bundle of Kent (normal PR, no delta wave), then the treatment was stopped and the elimination kinetics of flecainide were studied while a Holter 24 h ECG monitoring was performed; thus we could extrapolate the flecainide plasma concentrations at which, during the elimination phase, the PR interval became <b>short</b> and the <b>delta</b> wave reappeared. Since <b>short</b> PR and <b>delta</b> wave are the expression of pre-excitation, {{we were able to}} determine the minimum concentrations capable to inhibit conduction through the abnormal bundles (290. 0 ng ml- 1 in the acutely treated patient and average 275. 0 ng ml- 1 in the chronically treated patients). These plasma levels are near to the lower therapeutic range accepted for ventricular ectopic arrhythmias (200 divided by 800 ng ml- 1). Only larger studies will indicate if a relationship exists between the blockade of abnormal pathways and the preventive effect of flecainide on arrhythmias of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Another open question is whether a simple, non-invasive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic procedure like that one described in the present paper can be used to predict the efficacy of treatment in patients with cardiac pre-excitation...|$|R
