50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1895, Johnson was {{recommended}} to the Berliner Gramophone company as a potential developer of a <b>spring-driven</b> <b>motor.</b> While cylinder phonographs had been equipped with clockwork motors for some time, the disc playing gramophone presented a number of design challenges in this regard. Foremost was the drag that the needle and soundbox created when applied to {{the outer edge of}} the disc. This required that the motor provide sufficient torque at start up while retaining a constant speed. Representatives of the Berliner company were satisfied with Johnsonâ€™s design, and within a year Johnson had begun producing motors for Berliner.|$|E

The resulting design featured precise repeatability, permitted the passing of a large electrical cable directly through each knuckle, and used a constant-speed <b>spring-driven</b> <b>motor</b> to operate the knuckles {{by means of a}} cable. The entire assembly, including the spring motor, is completely nonmagnetic and is ideally suited for placing a magnetometer experiment a considerable distance from the spacecraft structure. It can also place many other instruments, such as antennas and solar-celled paddle systems, away from the structure. "Report date January 1964.
