5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E
25|$|Nobb {{suggests}} {{the only way}} the rebels can withstand Griffon is by rebuilding Paznos, a massive mobile fortress. Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the origin point of the Gundorada Workshop. As they go about rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he is just like them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father died when he was a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is proud that he found <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> protecting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} questioning, {{it comes to}} light that the {{previous}} owner of the house, Sellon, {{was found dead in}} his shop, supposedly from a fall down the stairs, but it might have been more nefarious than that. There were suspicions of involvement in drugs and Sellon also left a note to the effect that he had come across <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> fourteen thousand pounds but no one has yet found out what the item was.|$|E

The thief could not give restitution to the victim's son or agent, but the thief could give it to an agent of the court. If the victim died, the thief had to restore it to the victim's heirs..|$|E
25|$|As a result, Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, {{established}} the Bow River Water Quality Council as a provincial advisory body. The Council was to promote {{awareness of the}} river's water quality and try to improve it through fact-finding and aiding inter-institutional coordination. It was composed of representatives from diverse interests such as First Nations, agriculture, and municipalities. Recreational groups represented on the council, such as Ducks Unlimited and Bow Waters Canoe Club, expressed concern for the river's environment. Their attitudes were not strictly human-centric, but, like those favoring a park system in Calgary, they defined the Bow River's environment as <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> preserving for human use.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} making the same {{migration}} {{from north to south}} and vice versa, an adult Scowler becomes the herd's new leader, and chooses Juniper to be his mate, much to Patchi's disappointment. Scowler recklessly leads the herd onto a thinly frozen pond, and Patchi is able to lead the majority of the herd to safety. Enraged and believing Patchi to be usurping him and also trying to take Juniper from him, Scowler goads Patchi into a battle for leadership of the herd. Scowler quickly wins and disowns Patchi, ordering Juniper {{and the rest of the}} herd to leave him behind. Despondent and heartbroken, Patchi tries to allow predators to eat him, but Alex convinces him to die for <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> dying for as Bulldust did.|$|E

[...] Conversely, a review by Simon Price for that publication's sister edition, The Independent on Sunday, gave the album their top score of five stars, saying that it [...] "features some of his finest lyrics yet and, musically, it often approaches the heyday of Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals. It is, then, something approaching the 'stunning return to form' of rock-crit cliché." ...|$|E

Matt Hinrichs at DVD Talk felt the video made a clean transfer from digital to Blu-ray, the atmospheric sound effects were [...] "carefully crafted", and that the dialog in the center channel was clear. Dan Rhodes at UK Anime Network gave the DVD by Anime Limited a 9 out of 10, calling it a [...] "barebones release", though praising its reversible insert.|$|E

500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, pushed Eliot {{further into the}} belief that there was <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> defending in society and that Germany had to be stopped. There is little mention {{of the war in}} Eliot's writing except in a few pieces, like [...] "Defence of the Islands". The war became central to Little Gidding as Eliot added in aspects of his own experience while serving as a watchman at the Faber building during the London blitz. The Four Quartets were favoured as giving hope during the war and also for a later religious revival movement. By Little Gidding, WWII is not just the present time but connected also to the English Civil War.|$|E
500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Princess Monster Wife" [...] was {{developed}} by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Ward revealed that with [...] "Princess Monster Wife" [...] he was hoping to craft a story that was both [...] "super sad and intense, [...] tickles your funny bone at the same time." [...] Ward further explained that the eponymous character was analogous to himself, noting, [...] "I'm made out of broken parts … but you can turn [...] into <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> displaying." [...] To voice Princess Monster Wife, Ward, Walch, and Little had to record each of their lines in tandem, mimicking the tones of one another.|$|E
500|$|The {{power of}} Saruman's voice is noted {{throughout}} the book. Jonathan Evans calls {{the characterization of}} Saruman in the chapter The Voice of Saruman a [...] "tour de force". Roger Sale says of the same chapter that [...] "Tolkien valiantly tried to do <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> doing which he simply cannot bring off." [...] Tom Shippey writes that [...] "Saruman talks like a politician ... No other character in Middle-earth has Saruman's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that incompatibles are resolved, and none comes out with words as empty as 'deploring', 'ultimate', worst of all, 'real'. What is 'real change'?" [...] Shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with the archaic stoicism and directness that Tolkien employs for other characters such as the Dwarven King Dáin, which Shippey believes represent Tolkien's view of heroism in the mould of Beowulf.|$|E

500|$|The Manchester Evening News later {{described}} the [...] "Say Say Say" [...] video as an [...] "anarchic caper" [...] that [...] "plays out like an Emir Kusturica feature". PopMatters {{stated that the}} music videos of [...] "Say Say Say" [...] and [...] "Goodnight Tonight" [...] turned [...] "a pair of otherwise forgettable songs into <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> watching". Steven Greenlee of The Boston Globe reflected that the video was both [...] "horrifying and compelling", and stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating somebody at arm wrestling. He added, [...] "It's even harder {{to believe that the}} two of them didn't get the pulp beaten out of them in that bar for dressing like a pair of Chess King employees". The [...] "Say Say Say" [...] video was later included on the DVDs The McCartney Years and Michael Jackson's Vision.|$|E
500|$|Chris Harris from MTV {{reviewed}} {{the show at}} Roseland Ballroom, New York, and commented [...] that [...] "It was an event better-suited for Madison Square Garden and one that these fans— many of whom probably had to call a sitter for the evening— won't soon forget." [...] Ben Sisario from The New York Times commented [...] "for Madonna's fans, [...] proved that seeing her for free in a 2,200-capacity hall— minuscule by her usual touring standards— was <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> waiting for. And waiting {{for a very long}} time." [...] Silvio Pietrolungo from Billboard felt that [...] "The crowd of 2,200 was certainly dedicated." [...] The April 30, 2008, New York set was shown live via MSN in association with Control Room and Live Nation. It was broadcast internationally on May 15, 2008. The Maidstone show faced problems with the organisers due to Madonna's use of swearing, causing complaints to be made to the BBC when the show was aired on Radio 1.|$|E

In his [...] "A" [...] grade review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said that the episode was a [...] "great piece of televised art", describing the script as [...] "witty, warm, and soulful". He wrote, [...] "David Slade's direction conveys the emotional world of the show so well that you could watch it on mute and grasp most of what's going on," [...] "At {{the end of the}} episode, you'll leave feeling like you've seen something unique and wonderful, <b>something</b> <b>worth</b> watching every week in an increasingly crowded television landscape." [...] "Pilot" [...] was highly anticipated by Los Angeles Times journalist Robert Lloyd, who observed that [...] "it promised {{to be one of the}} year's best and most interesting new series." [...] In a pre-broadcast review, Matt Fowler from IGN gave the pilot a [...] "10 out of 10" [...] classifying it as a [...] "masterpiece". Some commentators were less enthusiastic than the general consensus. Writing for The Washington Post, Hank Stuever felt that despite having high ambitions, the pilot episode was slow and drowsy.|$|E
