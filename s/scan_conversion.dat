25|$|Dr. David R. Williams (NASA {{archivist}} at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 {{flight director}} Eugene F. Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a <b>scan</b> <b>conversion</b> had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing. A crude, real-time <b>scan</b> <b>conversion</b> of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.|$|E
500|$|At a minimum, all digital {{television}} broadcasters in Australia provide a 576i [...] standard-definition service, {{in addition to}} high definition. The 576p50 format is also considered a HDTV format, as it has higher vertical resolution {{through the use of}} progressive scanning. When Australia started DVB-T in 2001 several networks broadcast high-definition in a 576p format as this could give better quality on 50Hz scanning CRT TVs and was not as demanding on MPEG-2-bit-rate. Since many modern television sets have an interlace to progressive <b>scan</b> <b>conversion</b> there is little difference in picture quality. MPEG-2 encoders have also improved so the more conventional 720p and 1080i formats are now used.|$|E

40|$|Motion {{estimation}} {{is a key}} {{function in}} <b>scan</b> rate <b>conversion,</b> advanced picture quality improvement, 2 D-to- 3 D content conversion, and many other video processing steps. For hardware efficiency reasons, most motion estimation implementations are block-based. As object boundaries commonly do not coincide with block boundaries, artifacts may be visible at object boundaries using the blockbased approach. Motion estimation for irregular shapes, such as image segments, can accurately track motion boundaries, but a straightforward translation of block-based motion estimation algorithms to segment-based ones leads to inefficient hardware implementations. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified segmentbased motion estimation algorithm utilizing the efficiency of blockbased processing. We demonstrates an efficient very large instruction word (VLIW) application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) implementation of this algorithm. 1...|$|R
