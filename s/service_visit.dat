40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we explore}} {{trade-offs}} between operational flexibility and operational complexity in periodic distribution problems. We consider the gains from operational flexibility {{in terms of}} vehicle routing costs and customer service benefits, {{as well as the}} costs of operational complexity in terms of modeling, solution methods, and implementation challenges for drivers and customers. The period vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a variation of the classic vehicle routing problem in which delivery routes are constructed for a period of time; the PVRP with service choice (PVRP-SC) extends the PVRP to allow <b>service</b> (<b>visit)</b> frequency to become a decision of the model. For the periodic distribution problems represented by PVRP and PVRP-SC, we introduce operational flexibility levers and a set of quantitative measures to evaluate the trade-offs between flexibility and complexity. We develop a Tabu Search heuristic to incorporate a range of operational flexibility options. We analyze the potential value and th...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{trade-offs}} between operational flexibility and operational complex-ity in periodic distribution problems. We consider the gains from operational flexibility {{in terms of}} vehicle routing costs and customer service benefits, {{and the costs of}} operational complexity in terms of implementation difficulty. Periodic distribution problems arise in a number of in-dustries, including food distribution, waste management and mail services. The period vehicle routing problem (PVRP) is a variation of the classic vehicle routing problem in which driver routes are constructed for a period of time; the PVRP with service choice (PVRP-SC) extends the PVRP to allow <b>service</b> (<b>visit)</b> frequency to become a decision of the model. While intro-ducing operational flexibility in periodic distribution systems can increase efficiency, it poses three challenges: the difficulty of modeling this flexibility accurately; the computational effort required to solve the problem as modeled with such flexibility; and the complexity of opera-tionally implementing the resulting solution. This paper considers these trade-offs between the system performance improvements due to operational flexibility and the resulting increases in operational and computational complexity as they relate to periodic vehicle routing problems...|$|E

40|$|Death and {{disability}} associated with breast and cervical cancer and hypertension {{can be reduced}} by early detection and treatment. The authors examined the rates for having obtained a Papanicolaou (Pap) test or pelvic examination, a breast physical examination, and a blood pressure test within the last 12 months among women of reproductive age in the United States in 1988, {{as reported by the}} 8, 450 women interviewed for the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. Overall, the annual rates of screening for women ages 15 - 44 years for those tests were 67 percent for a Pap test or pelvic examination, 67 percent for a breast examination, and 82 percent for a blood pressure test. Standard recommendations for the frequency of screening and survey data were examined to see whether actual screening practice was consistent with those recommendations. More than 90 percent of women who had a family planning <b>service</b> <b>visit</b> within 12 months received each of the tests, regardless of who provided the service or who paid for the visit. Women who were not sexually active, women with little education or low income, American Indian women, Hispanic women, and women of Asian or Pacific Islander descent had lower rates of screening than others, regardless of their risk status. These findings strongly suggest that the likelihood of having obtained screening among women 15 - 44 years old is determined primarily by how often a woman uses health care, rather than by her risk of disease...|$|E
40|$|The Friant-Kern {{irrigation}} canal is located along {{the foothills of}} the Sierra Nevada, southeast of Fresno, California. It has a length of approximately 240 km, and was designed for a maximum waterflow of 150 m/s. It was built in the late 1940 ’s using highly expansive clay; the earth-lined sections have 2 : 1 slopes, a bottom of 17. 7 m width, and a top width of 45 m. Since the construction period, the earthen banks have suffered periodic damage from cracks, slips and slides. Concrete –lined sections also show failures due to the swelling of expansive soils. In the 1970 ’s, the Bureau of Reclamation decided to repair approximately 13. 5 km of failed sections using lime treatment of clays taken from the banks of the canal. The methodology and devices used for the quicklime treatment are explained in the paper. The treated clay was replaced and compacted by a sheep-foot roller, to achieve a typical thickness between 60 cm (top and bottom of the canal) to 1. 2 m (slopes). The observed performance after 12 years [Gutschick, 1985] and 35 years of <b>service</b> (<b>visit</b> in 2010, and testimonial of maintenance department) is very relevant. No new slips or slides have been observed since the rehabilitation works in the 70 ’s. Despite the fact that the lime-treated soil has been in constant direct contact with the waterflow, without protective cover, only minor erosion was observed along the waterline. The small holes in the surface of the banks were caused at the construction stage by the loss of “clay balls”...|$|E
40|$|Objective and Relevance: A {{practical}} {{limitation of}} many automated molecular diagnostic platforms is the poor reliability of systems {{that rely on}} components like syringe pumps, hydraulic tubing, and multiple robots. In contrast, the BD Viper ™ System was designed {{with a focus on}} components that feature higher expected reliability. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the reliability of the BD Viper System, operating in extracted mode, 1 which is a fully automated instrument for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in urogenital specimens. The system provides for walk-away processing of the extraction, amplification, and detection of target nucleic acids, with a capacity of 184 assay results per run. Methodology: The reliability estimates for the BD Viper System, operating in extracted mode, were derived using the Systems Engineering ‘roll-up ’ approach, in which failure rates for system components were compiled into an overall reliability calculation. Potential failures were broken into two categories that define distinct measurements of reliability: • Mean Runs Between Failures (MRBF) : associated with “hard” failures of hardware that require replacement or repair by a Field Service Engineer, and • Mean Runs Between Interventions (MRBI) : associated with “soft ” failures that potentially lead to the loss of a run but do not require hardware replacement or <b>service</b> <b>visit.</b> The failure rates for system components were derived from a variety of sources, including supplier failure rate specifications, historical field data on failure rates from BD Viper Systems, operating in non-extracted mode, failure modes and effects analyses, empirical accelerated life testing, and the FRACAS (“Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action”) approach, a closed-loop technique for reliability improvement...|$|E
