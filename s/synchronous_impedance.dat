40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of a system consisting of a variable-speed synchronous generator that supplies an active dc load (inverter) through a three-phase diode rectifier requires adequate modeling in both time and frequency domain. In particular, the system's control-loops, responsible for stability and proper impedance matching between generator and load, are difficult to design without an accurate small-signal model. A particularity of the described system is strong non-ideal operation of the diode rectifier, {{a consequence of the}} large value of generator's <b>synchronous</b> <b>impedance.</b> This non-ideal behavior influences both steady state and transient performance. This thesis presents a new, average model of the system. The average model accounts, in a detailed manner, for dynamics of generator and load, and for effects of the non-ideal operation of diode rectifier. The model is non-linear, but time continuous, and can be used for large- and small-signal analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the representation of}} the wound rotor asynchronous generators by an equivalent synchronous generator, valid for short circuit current calculations. Modern wind power plants are required and designed to ride through faults in the network, subjected to fault clearing. Accurate knowledge of the wind turbine short circuit current contribution is needed for component sizing and protection relay settings during faults within the wind power plant collector system or in the external networks. When studying fault currents and protection settings for wind power installations, the industry standard is to employ software packages where generators are represented by their equivalent <b>synchronous</b> generator operational <b>impedances.</b> Hence, it is of importance to represent non-synchronous wind generators by an equivalent synchronous generator.

40|$|This {{research}} addresses some of {{the difficulties}} faced when operating voltage controlled inverters with synchronous generators in microgrids. First, an overview of microgrid value propositions is provided, and the problems faced when attempting to use microgrids to provide improved power quality are discussed. Design considerations for different types of microgrids are provided to enable microgrids to deliver the desired functionality without adding unnecessary cost. The main body of this research investigates the poor transient load sharing encountered between voltage controlled inverters and synchronous generators in islanded operation. Poor transient load sharing results in high peak inverter rating requirements and high cost. The tradeoff between power quality and power sharing is highlighted, and methods to improve transient load sharing are proposed. The use of current limiting to protect inverters during faults and overloads is also investigated. Stability problems are identified when using simple inverter current limiting methods when operating in parallel with <b>synchronous</b> generators. Virtual <b>impedance</b> current limiting is proposed to improve transient stability during current limiting. The methods proposed in this thesis for mitigating inverter overloads and faults will allow for more reliable and cost effective application of inverter based distributed energy resources with synchronous generators in microgrids.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} project {{is to develop a}} model of the whole power system of Gotland in the power system {{simulation}} software PSS/E. A model of the whole power system of Gotland has earlier been used in the power system simulation software Simpow but now {{there is a need to}} develop a model in PSS/E. In the power system of Gotland there are several components that need to be modelled such as lines, loads, transformers, shunt <b>impedances,</b> <b>synchronous</b> machines, asynchronous machines, an HVDC Classic link and an HVDC Light link. These components are modelled in the Simpow model and needs to be converted to the PSS/E model. The aim is to develop a model in PSS/E that is as equal as possible to the model in Simpow. Especially the HVDC Light link at Gotland has been investigated in the project. A problem with converting data from Simpow to PSS/E is that the models of several components differ in Simpow and PSS/E. Lines and shunt impedances can be modelled in the same way but the models for loads, transformers, synchronous machines, asynchronous machines, the HVDC Classic link, and the HVDC Light link differ in Simpow and PSS/E. The models in Simpow are converted to the models in PSS/E in an as equal way as possible. The results in PSS/E are analyzed and compared with the Simpow model. In the project we have also made a test of fault simulations in time-domain simulations in PSS/E. The aim with this test is to verify the PSS/E calculations when a three-phase or a single-phase fault is applied. The reason for that is that PSS/E only calculates using positivesequence components and therefore only is able to calculate exact during circumstances of symmetrical loads and faults. The result shows that the calculations for both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in PSS/E are correct concerning the positive-sequence components. A drawback in PSS/E is, however, that we do not have any information concerning the negativeand zero-sequence Â components, which results in that we cannot calculate the three phasequantities. ...|$|R
