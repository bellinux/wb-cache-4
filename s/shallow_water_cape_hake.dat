40|$|The hake {{fishery is}} South Africa's most {{valuable}} and harvests two morphologically similar species, the shallow- <b>water</b> <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius capensis and the deep-water <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> M. paradoxus. Since 1948, annual catches have exceeded 50 000 tons {{and the current}} total allowable catch (TAC) is about 150 000 tons, a quantity informed by assessments of the hake resource. Current assessments on which management is based use single-stock models that ignore food-web effects. Usually including such interactions in assessments is problematic because {{of the complexity of}} food webs. In the case of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake,</b> however, cannibalism and inter-species predation form a very large component of hake mortality and food consumption, thus making a multi-species model not only more feasible but also likely more reliable. A comprehensive multi-species model incorporating these interactions was last investigated in 1995. Since then, substantially more data have become available, and hake single-species assessments have developed considerably, inter alia now including the ability to take careful account of species differentiation. Additionally, with increased computer processing power, more sophisticated modelling can now be attempted than was possible 20 years ago, rendering an update and refinement of the 1995 analyses timeous. The thesis uses mathematical methods to model hake-on-hake predation and cannibalism in hake populations explicitly by incorporating an additional mortality term to account for these interactions. Information from stomach samples obtained on hake research surveys on predator and prey lengths, {{as well as on the}} proportion of hake in the diet of hake predators, is then included when fitting the model to data. Chapter 1 contains a brief introduction to the work. Chapter 2 provides background information on the <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> fishery and its management, as well as pertinent information on the biology and diet of the hake (and related fish) from the literature that is relevant to the development of the model constructed in this thesis. Chapter 3 lays out the data available for assessing the <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> populations: abundance indices together with catch and catch-at-size data for the standard non-predation model, and hake stomach content data for the years 1999 - 2013 to inform the predation component of multi-species model developed. Chapter 4 provides the details for the standard hake assessment model used at present to inform management of the stocks. This model forms the basis for the multi-species model developed incorporating predation, which is presented in Chapter 5. The remaining Chapters of the thesis present the results and discussions (Chapter 6), possible future development of this model (Chapter 7) and a brief summary of the main findings of the thesis (Chapter 8) ...|$|R

Tsunami simulation results indicate that a small first wave at Urakawa is caused by large <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> off <b>Cape</b> Erimo. The tsunami generated from the source area off Kushiro circumvents the shallow area off the cape, propagates through the deep sea, and arrives at Urakawa as a small first wave. Larger tsunamis are propagated through the shallow region slowly and arrive at Urakawa as a later tsunami. These results suggest that a tsunami from a future large Nemuro-oki earthquake will also arrive at the west coast of Hidaka with a small first wave and large later phases.|$|R

The {{two species}} of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius capensis (shallow-water hake) and M paradoxus (deepwater hake), fomi the {{mainstay}} of the bottom trawl industry off South Africa and constitute the country's most valuable fishery. It is therefore important that the status of this resource be assessed regularly to ensure that exploitation is at a sustainable level. The two <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> species are morphologically similar and no distinction is made between them in commercial catch statistics. Consequently, for assessment purposes, the <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes</b> are treated as a single species. It is assumed that two stocks of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> exist, one off the West Coast and another off the South Coast of South Africa. Central to the assessments of these stocks are the catch per unit effort (CPUE) data because it assumed that CPUE is proportional to abundance. The nominal CPUE (hake catch divided by actual time trawled) for both the West and South Coast stocks has shown a steady growth over the period 1978 - 1994, increasing {{at a rate of}} 3. 8 % per annum on the West Coast and 4. 2 % per annum on the South Coast. The bulk of this thesis is concerned with determining whether these increases in CPUE are the result of an increasing biomass, or are rather, in part, the result of improved vessel efficiency due to technological advancement or of changes in fishing strategy. The existing CPUE time series had previously been standardised by means of applying power factors which were crudely estimated in the early 1970 s and which are likely inappropriate for the current fishing fleets. These CPUE series have therefore been re-standardised by applying the internationally accepted approach of General Linear Modelling (GLM) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Spawning {{times and}} {{spawning}} intensity {{during the life}} cycles of some fish species found off South Africa and Norway were synthesized using data collected from the literature. The comparison of temporal patterns in spawning of South African fish species showed variable spawning times and intensity depending on the environmental conditions within that spawning habitat. Their spawning migration durations were suggested to be short since they inhabit a dynamic coastal upwelling ecosystem with intra-seasonal differences caused by changes in upwelling strength enhanced by south-easterly winds, nutrient-limited waters on the spawning grounds and stable thermal conditions. This contrasts with Norwegian fish species, which showed patterns of spawning times and durations that are restricted and confined to spring (February – May), probably due to strong, consistent seasonality, depending on primary production. This explains the inter-annual differences observed in their spawning periods, where strong south-westerly winds (downwelling), light intensity and salinity stratification could influence long spawning migrations. For <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes,</b> environmental variability influencing recruitment was further investigated {{on the west coast}} nursery grounds of the southern Benguela, particularly for deep-water <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius paradoxus). Biophysical characteristics of the west coast nursery grounds were assessed in relation to distribution of deep-water <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> juveniles (< 15 cm) using physical data (CTD, alongshore wind speed anomalies) and biological data (abundance/density of hake juveniles, recruitment estimates). Distinct spatial patterns of hake distribution were evident in relation to near-bottom environmental factors (temperature, salinity and oxygen). Nansen surveys conducted from 2003 – 2013 during summer (January – February) showed greater abundance of hake juveniles over the Orange Banks than in other nursery areas. The hake juveniles occurred in mid-shelf waters with oxygen depletion (2 – 3 mL O₂. L⁻¹) and hypoxic conditions (< 2 mL O₂. L⁻¹) and temperature ranges of 7 – 11 ⁰C. Salinity appeared to have less influence on hake juveniles' distribution. During spring surveys, hake catches were reduced on all nursery grounds except near Cape Columbine. There was a strong positive correlation between deep-water <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> recruitment indices and summer wind speed anomalies for the same year (Lag = 0 year) and with autumn wind speed anomalies of the previous year (Lag = 1 year).
