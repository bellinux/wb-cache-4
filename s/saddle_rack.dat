25|$|A saddle {{should be}} cleaned {{regularly}} if it used for work. It is usually easiest to clean a saddle when {{placed on a}} moveable <b>saddle</b> <b>rack.</b> Ideally, a rider should quickly wipe down the saddle after every ride with a slightly damp, but not wet, sponge or cloth, in order to remove any dirt and sweat. Once a week, or after every 5–7 rides, a more thorough cleaning should be performed.|$|E

50|$|They are simple, {{relative}} to other bicycles. They are all-steel single speed with 28 in wheels, fenders, fully covered chain, sprung leather <b>saddle,</b> rear <b>rack</b> and rod brakes (a handlebar lever connects directly to the brake pads), double stand (PA02 and PA06) or side stand (PB13). Like the Ford Model T, they are only available in one colour, black, except for the flare of vanilla at the fender tips. They can be equipped with a dynamo lighting set.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{pack saddle}} {{is usually not}} {{intended}} to support a human rider. The upper side of the pack <b>saddle</b> resembles a <b>rack</b> to let its load rest on and be tied on with ropes, straps, a surcingle or other devices. One historical exception was a pack saddle used in feudal Japan by non-samurai class commoners who {{were not allowed to}} use riding saddles (kura) for transportation.|$|R

5000|$|County Rider (France, 1993): Intended {{to appeal}} to equestrians, the County Rider was {{equipped}} with a rear floor liner, rub-strips and wheel-arch protectors, mudflaps, floor mats, an adjustable tow hitch, and a <b>saddle</b> <b>rack.</b> Available as either a three- or five-door, all were painted green with special decals.|$|E
5000|$|The framesets {{were made}} from True Temper 4130 CrMo Steel with Reynolds 531 chainstays, and CBC’s own CrMo fork. The frames were powdercoated to any color to order, or {{to any of the}} several {{predetermined}} models. CBC offered Sachs 3,5, and 7 speed hubs, with Sun M25 rims. A selection of handlebars, <b>saddles,</b> mudguards, <b>racks,</b> were added per customer’s specs. The headbadge was made in Middlebury, Vermont by Danforth Pewterers, by lost-wax casting method. These badges cost $10 each to produce, and were hand fitted to every frame. The factory in Chicago had a second floor loft style sales room where fabrication took place in front of customers and had a test track that customers could try the bikes out indoors.|$|R
5|$|The TWHNC {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of classes in both in-hand and performance, including divisions for youth, amateurs, and professionals. Horses may be shod with keg shoes or performance stacks; flat-shod classes are particularly popular among amateur owners who train their own horses. Leadline classes, for children under six, are a crowd favorite. All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted <b>Saddle</b> Horse and <b>Racking</b> Horse associations as well. Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.|$|R
500|$|Two {{organizations}} have formed {{to promote the}} exhibition of flat-shod horses. The NWHA promotes only naturally-gaited horses in its sanctioned horse shows, has its own rule book, and is the official USEF affiliate organization for the breed. The NWHA sanctions horse shows and licenses judges, and is an authorized HIO. The NWHA {{was in the process}} of building its own [...] "tracking registry" [...] to document both pedigree and performance achievements of horses recorded there. These included the Spotted <b>Saddle</b> Horse and <b>Racking</b> Horse breeds as well as the Tennessee Walker. However, the NWHA was sued by the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders & Exhibitors Association (TWHBEA), which eventually won some concessions regarding the use of the TWHBEA’s copyrighted registry certificates by the NWHA. While the judgment did not prohibit the NWHA from continuing its registry service, it is no longer actively advertised on the NWHA website.|$|R

Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.The only exception to this rule are ponies competing in lead line classes. Over 20 World Championships are awarded in different classes throughout the course of the Celebration, including the Lead Line Ponies World Championship, Park Performance, Four-Year-Old, Three-Year-Old, Two-Year-Old, Weanling, Trail Pleasure, Show Pleasure, and Lite Shod. The most anticipated class, however, is the World Grand Championship, the largest honor in the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. [...] Competition at the Celebration is traditionally opened each night by a white or gray Tennessee Walking Horse and rider carrying the American flag, during the singing of the American national anthem. The same flag horse often serves for years and is not allowed to compete in the Celebration itself or any other horse show during their tenure. [...] Over the course of the Celebration, over $650,000 in prizes is given out. The Celebration also includes attractions such as a dog show, barbecue cookout, and barn decorating contest.|$|R
