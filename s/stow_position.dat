50|$|The {{system is}} capable of firing two {{missiles}} without reloading and carries ten TOW rounds in the missile rack. Reloading is performed under armor protection and is accomplished by tilting the launching apparatus back so that the crew can reach the turret through the carrier's rear roof hatch. The missile launcher targeting head {{is at the end}} of a pivoting arm which raises the launcher assembly for firing. When stowed, the turret is aimed down and to the rear of the vehicle. A major limitation of the M901 is that it is practically unable to move while the turret is in firing position, and unable to fire while it is in the stowed position. A common work-around is to move the vehicle while the turret is in the loading position, thereby reducing the amount of time to get the turret in a fire position as opposed to the <b>stow</b> <b>position.</b> Moving from the firing to the stowed position is a procedure that takes several seconds and some skill on the part of the operator.|$|E
40|$|Wind loads on heliostats {{are usually}} {{determined}} at boundary layer, low-speed wind tunnels {{at which the}} design full-scale Reynolds number cannot be reached. In doing so, it is supposed the wind load coefficients are Reynolds number independent, which {{is known to be}} the case for sharp edged bodies. But for the <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> the usually round torque tube is directly exposed to the wind and could influence the wind loads. By measurements in a high-pressure wind tunnel, it can be demonstrated that the design-relevant wind load coefficients are not Reynolds number dependent. However, the inclination of the mirror plane in <b>stow</b> <b>position,</b> due to the deflection of the heliostats structure at high Reynolds number, leads to increased wind loads and must be considered. The results are also valid for photovoltaic trackers of similar shape...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} past two years of {{collaboration}} between the different actors on the ALMA nutator. Building on previous developments, the nutator has seen changes in much of the design. A high-modulus carbon fiber structure has been added {{on the back of the}} mirror in order to transfer the voice coils forces with less deformation, thus reducing delay problems due to flexing. The controller is now an off-the-shelf National Instrument NI-cRIO, and the amplifier a class D servo drive from Advanced Motion Controls, with high peak power able to drive the coils at 300 Volts DC. The stow mechanism has been totally redesigned to improve on the repeatability and precision of the <b>stow</b> <b>position,</b> which is also the reference for the 26 bits Heidenhain encoders. This also improves on the accuracy of the <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> with wind loading. Finally, the software, written largely with National Instrument's LabView, has been developed. We will discuss these changes and the preliminary performances achieved to date. Keywords: ALMA, nutator, class D, high-modulus carbon fiber. Comment: Published: 23 August 2012; 12 page...|$|E

40|$|A design {{requirement}} of a heliostat {{is the ability}} to withstand storm loads in the <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> and operational wind loads in any position. To design a heliostat, therefore, one must be able to predict the wind loading on the heliostat for all elevation angles of the heliostat and all wind directions relative to the heliostat coordinate system. Fortunately, experimental wind tunnel force and moment coefficient data in the x, y and z directions exist in tabular format for an isolated heliostat, and are in the public domain, but still require interpolation between different points in a large dataset. This paper shows that the data points fit definable patterns, allowing the use of Fourier analysis to fit a small number of correlations to describe the entire dataset to high accuracy. Correlations for the lift and drag forces are presented. A companion paper presents correlations for the side forces and correlations for moments about the three principal axes, and discusses the behavior of the correlations...|$|E

The secondary wing system includes a mechanism that allows the canard to be retracted within the contour of the aircraft fuselage from an operational <b>position</b> to a <b>stowed</b> <b>position.</b> The top surface of the canard is exposed to air flow in the <b>stowed</b> <b>position,</b> and is contoured to integrate aerodynamically and smoothly within the contour of the fuselage when the canard is retracted for high speed flight.

The canard can be positioned between a range of sweep angles during flight and a <b>stowed</b> <b>position</b> in which its span is substantially parallel to the aircraft fuselage. The canard can be deployed and retracted during flight. The deployment mechanism includes a circular mounting ring and drive mechanism that connects the canard with the fuselage and permits it to rotate and to change incidence.

40|$|At SolarPACES 2012 conference a new {{heliostat}} {{concept was}} presented. It {{is equipped with}} wireless communication, sandwich facets, wind protection devices for wind load reduction, rim drives with winch wheels and ground anchor foundation. Crucial {{for the development of}} the light-weight structures is the precise determination of the maximum loads. By full scale wind load measurements the duration of the peak loads could be determined. They are caused by gusts with such short duration that their energy can be dissipated by shock absorbers protecting the structure. Furthermore, the wind loads can be reduced by wind protection devices. For the design-relevant <b>stow</b> <b>position,</b> a reduction in structural loading of 40 % can be achieved by the wind protection devices as wind tunnel tests have shown. The reduced loading has a significant impact on the dimensioning and cost of the structure and foundation of the heliostat.

40|$|Reliable and {{cost-effective}} heliostats with high accuracy are {{a prerequisite for}} the successful market introduction of solar tower systems. The advantages of hydraulic drives are high positioning precision, no backlash, ability to go to <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> at electrical power loss and optional overload protection. Initial cost calculations indicated that a cost-competitive solution could be provided. The design of a heliostat with 30 m² mirror area is described. The oil reservoir with pump, the valve bloc and the cylinders for the azimuth drive {{are located in the}} cross bar. The results of wind tunnel measurements with heliostat models of various aspect ratios led to an aspect ratio of 1. 2. A wind fence was not assumed because in the rear part of usual heliostat fields it has no significant advantage as wind tunnel measurements showed. For the canting an automatic procedure will be applied at which the deflectometry method is used for the determination of the shape and orientation of the mirror facets. The first six prototypes will be erected at the Jülich solar tower site, Germany and one at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain. Extensive testing will be carried out to verify the design goals with respect to mechanical properties, optical performance, system functionality and power consumption. Based on the results a cost-benefit-based optimization of the construction and the drives will be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWind loads on sun tracking solar reflector panels {{exposed to the}} atmospheric boundary layer were established through surface static pressure measurements to determine how wind affects them, specifically {{at the request of}} SPAWAR-Pacific, which has developed a custom design. A 1 : 8 scale model of a four-panel array was studied in the Naval Postgraduate School wind tunnel. Wind velocity, wind angle orientation, and individual panel positions, at which the highest pressure coefficient cases were anticipated, were varied. The pressure coefficients were measured by an array of Scanivalve pressure transducers with 16 pressure taps drilled into the top and bottom surfaces of each panel. Oil flow and smoke flow visualization techniques were performed to better understand the flow features that led to the greatest pressure coefficients. A parapet was included to observe the wind effects of various positions. Additionally, pressure measurements were observed using a rounded edge installed on the lead panel edges. This notion was to assist in not only minimizing wind loads, but also in determining a safe <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> of the array during high wind events. The measurements and the flow visualization studies both provided a cohesive and constructive picture of the flow. The windward panel was found to be subjected to the thrust of the wind loads in most cases, with a maximum recorded differential pressure coefficient of 3. 25. However, when in combination with attaching the rounded edge to the windward panel and setting it negative five degrees, pressure coefficients were decreased by more than 70 %. Parapets of the appropriate help also reduced the measured loads significantly. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{solar panels}} and {{trackers}} represent {{one of the}} most common renewable energy technology which converts sunlight radiation into electrical energy. The solar trackers specifically are more complex structures because they involve mechanical devices, a supporting slender structure, and photovoltaic modules mounted and positioned on top of the supporting structure. Solar trackers are mounted on mobile supports or racks, in order to enable the rotation and tilt of the PV which thus maintains their optimum exposure to the incident sunlight. Solar trackers support structures should be designed for wind resistance during the operation and at <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> for its life span and this became a concern considering the new tendency of installing the solar trackers on the rooftop of low-rise or medium-rise buildings. The current research focused on performing site measurements of the wind-induced displacement for a dual-axis solar tracking system installed on the roof of the Mann Parking building of the University of Ottawa, for different azimuth, elevations. The supporting structure of the solar tracker was instrumented with 16 strain gauges and the strains developed in the metal truss members were measured during the months February 2015 and March 2015. The tracker was rotated and tilted at different angles through the duration of the experiment and the strains observed on each structural element were recorded. In order to estimate deflections of the supporting structure for wind speeds higher than the ones measured, a finite element (FE) model of the solar tracker was created and static analysis was performed for different inclinations using the SAP 2000 structural software. The experimental results were in agreement with the FE simulation results as the stresses obtained ranged between 1. 02 × 107 Pa and 7. 88 × 107 Pa. Lower attack angles between 45 ° and 60 ° were found to have significant effect on the elements of the solar tracker irrespective of the wind load magnitude. Operational attack angles between 65 ° and 75 ° were found to be safer positions as obtained displacements and stress analysis result showed that the supporting structure of the solar tracker was stable for wind speeds between 0 m/s and 33 m/s in Ottawa regio...|$|E
