5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide {{family planning and}} contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that {{a wide variety of}} safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E

25|$|The Emperor's {{opinion was}} that the gap in opinion could most likely be bridged. An initial set of demands was drafted during the Council meeting. Over the next few days, the demands were reinforced, {{possibly}} {{with the help of}} the German Foreign Office to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was a war, and made more iron-clad and difficult for Serbia to accept.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, the Calderone clan developed a relationship with the construction entrepreneur Carmelo Costanzo – one of the four Cavalieri del Lavoro (Knights of Labour), together with Francesco Finocchiaro, Mario Rendo and Gaetano Graci – who needed the mafiosi for protection. Construction sites of rival companies were bombed and at least one rival of Costanzo was assassinated. They made <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> would be no problems for Costanzo’s companies when they worked elsewhere in Sicily.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sure,</b> <b>there</b> {{have been}} controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, {{thanks to the}} Madhubala episode.

So we took Vyjayanthimala for the role and her father filed a suit against us.|$|E

25|$|Sega was {{supportive}} of the team's rewriting of the plot, sending over quality assurance and cohesion strike teams to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> were no issues with the in-game reactivity or plot holes, but they didn't have much involvement {{in regards to the}} narrative itself, with the publisher mainly focusing on the game and combat design. However, Urquhart said {{that one of the reasons}} for the game's development problems was due to indecision on Sega's part, particularly in regards to budgeting; he gave an example of one long segment of the game that cost around US$500,000 to produce, which was eventually cut because Sega thought it wasn't a good fit for the game.|$|E
25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was something new to see in Shrek 2 by putting more human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set up for all the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle his fur, belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E
25|$|Janet van Dyne {{once more}} takes up {{leadership}} of the Avengers and continues to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is a strong female presence on the team. Under her leadership, {{the number of women}} on the team outnumbers the number of men {{for the first time in}} Avengers history. Though her relationship with Hank Pym remains strong for some time, she turns down his proposal of remarrying, saying she wouldn't marry him again. During the Lionheart of Avalon storyline, Janet is shown fighting the Wrecking Crew while at giant size, a power she had rarely, if ever, used prior. She is shown to be powerful enough at this size to take down a jet. She has a brief fling with fellow team member Hawkeye.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} also secured $200 million {{of funding for}} Ottawa's O-Train expansion project after Treasury Board President John Baird reviewed the project to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> were no cost overruns. The money was secured after Ottawa's new council voted on the project. However, in November, Nepean-Carleton MP Pierre Poilievre announced that, despite opposition from most of Ottawa City Council, $35 million of the transit funding was to be diverted for a new Rideau River bridge crossings between the two Ottawa growing suburban communities, Barrhaven and Riverside South. Poilievre had stated that if the city of Ottawa would present a transit plan, a request to the government for new money for public transit projects will be granted. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated that no provincial money {{will be given to}} the bridge project if no rapid transit corridor is included.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox synagogues, {{the dancing}} is mainly {{carried out by}} men and boys; {{children}} (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers. Women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the Torah scrolls, or look on {{from the other side}} of a mechitza (partition), in accordance with the value of tzniut (modesty). In 2014, an Israeli modern Orthodox rabbinical organization called Beit Hillel ruled that women are permitted to dance with a Torah scroll on Simchat Torah. They also recommended in their ruling designating a woman as the kallah Torah, or bride of the Torah, just as a man is designated as the chatan Torah, or groom of the Torah, and making <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is enough dance space for the women, as well as consulting with the women on the songs that will be sung.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Treasury {{was nearly}} out {{of gold in}} 1895, at {{the depths of the}} Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal {{government}} to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.|$|E

25|$|Scrubbing tubes: Water {{before and}} after the animal chamber must be removed. One {{arrangement}} would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry incurrent airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10-20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is a small amount of cotton {{at either end of the}} tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. Pour the Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench to pack the grains tightly (to increase surface area - air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] {{before and after}} the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on your skin and keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the tube end, filling one-third of the way with 10-20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added to pack the grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.|$|E
