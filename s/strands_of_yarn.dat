25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|E

40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> due to unavailability {{of a mass}} <b>of</b> consecutive <b>yarns.</b> While multispectral imaging systems can capture images <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest. Finally, colors <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> specified by the proposed methods were compared with spectrophotometric colors <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> windings using 12 pairs <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> and yarn windings. Experimental results show the MA method yields the smallest lightness and chroma difference compared with spectrophotometric colors <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> windings. The average color difference between spectrophotometric colors <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> windings and multispectral imaging colors <b>of</b> single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> specified by the AA, AC, MA, and LW methods is 3. 45, 2. 72, 2. 37, and 3. 33 CMC(2 : 1) units.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} multispectral {{imaging system}} can directly acquire the reflectance <b>of</b> a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that {{is impossible for}} traditional spectrophotometers. Instead, the spectrophotometric reflectance <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> winding, which is constituted by yarns wound on a background card, {{is regarded as the}} yarn reflectance in textile. While multispectral imaging systems and spectrophotometers can be separately used to acquire the reflectance <b>of</b> a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> and corresponding yarn winding, the quantitative relationship between them is not yet known. In this paper, the relationship is established based on models that describe the spectral response of a spectrophotometer to a yarn winding and that of a multispectral imaging system to a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> The reflectance matching function from a single <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to corresponding yarn winding is derived to be a second degree polynomial function, which coefficients are the solutions of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Experiments on 100 pairs of samples show that the proposed approach can reduce the color difference between yarn windings and single <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> from 2. 449 to 1. 082 CIEDE 2000 units. The coefficients of the optimal reflection matching function imply that the reflectance <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> winding measured by a spectrophotometer consists of not only the intrinsic reflectance <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> but also the nonignorable interreflection component between <b>yarns.</b> Institute <b>of</b> Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
50|$|Knitting is a {{technique}} of producing fabric from a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> or wool. Unlike weaving, knitting {{does not require a}} loom or other large equipment, making it a valuable technique for nomadic and non-agrarian peoples.|$|R

5000|$|The {{speed of}} a horn gear braider {{is limited by the}} effort needed to force bobbin {{carriers}} to follow a serpentine path. In 1922, Simon W. Wardwell solved this problem by moving the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn,</b> instead of the carriers. [...] The carriers follow a simple circular path, while lever arms driven by a cam guide the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to their correct places. Because a lever arm has much less mass than a bobbin and carrier, the machine can run faster.|$|E

50|$|Since warp {{knitting}} {{requires that the}} number of separate <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> ("ends") equals the number of stitches in a row, {{warp knitting}} is almost always done by machine rather than by hand.|$|E
50|$|Flammé yarns are a kind <b>of</b> novelty <b>yarn.</b> It is {{generally}} a loose or untwisted core wrapped {{by at least}} one other strand. The extra element can be a metallic thread, or a much-thicker or much-narrower <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn,</b> or yarn that varies between thick and thin. Some companies have come to put twin yarns on the market to show off combinations <b>of</b> one regular <b>yarn</b> and novelty yarns in assorted colors or even two different types <b>of</b> novelty <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Column of Increases -- A second <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> or roving {{is passed}} up the piece.

5000|$|In {{textiles}}, pile is {{the raised}} surface or nap of a fabric, {{which is made}} of upright loops or <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Examples of pile textiles are carpets, corduroy, velvet, plush, and Turkish towels. The word is derived from Latin pilus for [...] "hair" ...|$|E
50|$|It {{traditionally}} has nine thongs {{as a result}} of the manner in which rope is plaited. Thinner rope is made from three <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> plaited together, and thicker rope from three strands of thinner rope plaited together. To make a cat o' nine tails, a rope is unravelled into three small ropes, each of which is unravelled again.|$|E
5000|$|Thread remains dormant in inner-system {{space as}} a small, icy ovoid (a Zebedee), but is {{reactivated}} by {{passage through the}} atmosphere.

50|$|The Human Spiderweb: The {{facilitator}} {{begins with}} a ball <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> He/she keeps one end and passes the ball to a participant. Each participant introduces him/herself and role in the organization then, keeping hold <b>of</b> the <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn,</b> unrolls enough to hand the ball to another person in the group, describing how they are dependent on that person (or role). The process continues, often with multiple dependencies until everyone is introduced. The facilitator then pulls on the starting thread and asks the group if anyone's hand failed to move. The facilitator then uses the yarn {{as a metaphor for}} the interdependencies of the group or the process which they will be discussing.|$|R
50|$|Only natural fibers {{are used}} in {{handmade}} rugs. The most common materials used for the pile are wool, silk and cotton. Sometimes, goat and camel hair are also used by nomadic and village weavers. Traditionally, spinning is done by hand. Several <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> are then plied together so that the resulting yarn {{is strong enough to}} be used for weaving.|$|E
50|$|Braiding {{creates a}} {{composite}} rope that is thicker {{and stronger than}} the non-interlaced <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Braided ropes are preferred by arborists, rock climbers, and in sport sailing {{because they do not}} twist under load, as does an ordinary twisted-strand rope. These ropes consist of one or more concentric tubular braided jackets surrounding either several small twisted fibre cords, or a single untwisted yarn of straight fibres, and are known as Kernmantle ropes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use for the}} {{technique}} is when working stranded color patterns, in which two yarns are alternated to certain of the stitches to create patterns. Weaving is used to attach the horizontal <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that pass unused behind stitches formed with the other yarn {{to the inside of}} the fabric. This is usually done to prevent overlong [...] "floats" [...] on the inside to prevent snags and create an even tension in the fabric.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the fiber to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be spun (or twisted) into a strand known as yarn. When the yarn is ready and dyed for use {{it can be made}} into cloth in a number of ways. Knitting and crochet are common methods of {{twisting}} and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric. The most common use <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to make cloth is weaving. In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a loom and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the warp. Then another <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp. This wrapped yarn is called the weft. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is common}} for lace knitters to insert a [...] "lifeline", a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> {{contrasting}} <b>yarn</b> threaded through stitches on the needle, {{at the end of}} every pattern repeat or after a certain number of rows. This allows the knitter to rip out a controlled number of rows if a mistake is discovered.|$|R
5000|$|Nålebinding (Danish: {{literally}} [...] "binding with a needle" [...] or [...] "needle-binding", also naalbinding, nålbinding, nålbindning or naalebinding) is {{a fabric}} creation technique predating both knitting and crochet. Also known in English as [...] "knotless netting," [...] "knotless knitting," [...] or [...] "single needle knitting," [...] {{the technique is}} distinct from crochet in that it involves passing {{the full length of}} the working thread through each loop, unlike crochet where the work is formed only of loops, never involving the free end. It also differs from knitting in that lengths must be pieced together during the process of nålebinding, rather than a continuous <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that can easily be pulled out. Archaeological specimens of fabric made by nålebinding can be difficult to distinguish from knitted fabric.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the textile}} arts, plying {{is a process}} {{used to create a}} strong, {{balanced}} yarn. It is done by taking two or more <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that each have a twist to them and putting them together. The strands are twisted together, in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. When {{just the right amount of}} twist is added, this creates a balanced yarn, one which has no tendency to twist upon itself. Almost all store-bought yarns are balanced, plied yarns. The word ply derives from the French verb plier, [...] "to fold", from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb πλέκω.|$|E
5000|$|Yarn is {{composed}} of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> are twisted together (plied) {{in the opposite direction}} to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either s&#8209;twist (the threads appear to go [...] "up" [...] to the left) or z&#8209;twist (to the right). For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.|$|E

5000|$|Basic two-colour Fair Isle {{requires}} no new techniques beyond the basic knit stitch. (The purl stitch {{is not used}} if circular knitting needles or 3 double-pointed needles are used.) At each knit stitch, there are two available [...] "active" [...] colours of yarn; one is drawn through to make the knit stitch, {{and the other is}} simply held behind the piece, carried as a loose <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> behind the just-made stitch. To avoid [...] "loose" [...] strands larger than 3-5 stitches, the yarn not in use can be [...] "caught" [...] by the yarn in use without this being seen {{on the front of the}} work - see below. Knitters who are comfortable with both English style and Continental style knitting can carry one colour with their right hand and one with their left, although it is also possible to simply use two different fingers for the two colours <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> and knit both using the same style.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} methods known to {{manufacture}} electrically conductive textiles. The simplest {{way is to}} incorporate metal wires or wire meshes into fabrics.
