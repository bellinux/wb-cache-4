In this work, a design algorithm for the condensation of a multi-component vapour mixture in shell side of a <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> vertical <b>condenser</b> has been developed using Bell and Ghaly’s method. Based on this algorithm, an in-house computer code has been developed.

A code was also developed for the Kern’s method for the condenser design. It was found that Kern’s method provides a lesser heat transfer area because Kern’s method does not consider the mass transfer resistance, nor does it take care of handling the sensible heat transfer during condensation. These facts have been incorporated in Bell and Ghaly’s method by taking the one-phase heat transfer coefficient during vapour sensible heat transfer.

Using a three-phase direct contact heat exchanger {{instead of a}} surface type exchanger, such as a shell and tube heat exchanger, potentially makes the process more efficient and economic. This is because {{of its ability to}} work with a very low temperature driving force, as well as its low cost of construction. In this study, an experimental investigation of the heat transfer efficiency, and hence cost, of a three-phase direct contact condenser has been carried out utilising a short Perspex tube of 70 cm total height and 4 cm internal diameter. Only 48 cm was used for the direct contact condensation. Pentane vapour with three different initial temperatures (40 ℃, 43. 5 ℃ and 47. 5 ℃) was contacted with water with an inlet temperature of 19 ℃. In line with previous studies, the ratio of the fluid flow rates was shown to have a controlling effect on the exchanger. Specifically, the heat transfer efficiency increased virtually linearly with this ratio, with higher efficiencies also being observed with higher flow 2 rates of the continuous phase. The effect of the initial temperature of the dispersed phase was shown to have a lower order impact than flow rate ratio. The capital cost of the direct contact condenser was estimated and it was found to be less than the corresponding surface condenser (<b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>condenser)</b> by 30 times.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Condensers are {{important}} class of equipment in process industry. Condensation {{is the process}} of changing vapour into liquid. Design of heat exchanger to partially or totally condense a vapour mixture is frequently necessary in the process industry. The term vapour mixture actually comprehends an entire spectrum of situation. The limit of the spectrum is a mixture in which all the component present have boiling point above the maximum coolant temperature; in this case the mixture is totally condensed. (Bell & Ghaly et al). In the present work, vertical <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>condenser</b> has been designed for the condensation of hydrocarbon vapour mixture containing Propane, Butane, Hexane,Heptanes and Octane in the mole composition of 0. 15, 0. 25, 0. 05, 0. 30 & 0. 25 with the help of MATLAB using Bell & Ghaly. Heat transfer area has been calculated for the different heat load by Bell and Ghaly and Kern’s design method. It is found that heat transfer surface area obtained by Kern’s method is always lesser than that obtained by Bell & Ghaly’s method. The {{reason for this is that}} Kern’s method omits the mass transfer resistance in the vapour phase. Further, the developed code has been used to study the effect of operating variable on heat transfer area, overall heat transfer co-efficient, tube side and shell side pressure drops. The overall heat transfer coefficient was found to increase with coolant flow rate and decrease with an increase in coolant inlet temperature, vapour inlet temperature and vapour flow rate. The shell-side pressure drop was found to increase with vapour flow rate where as other variables have nominal effects. Validation of the developed code has been done using the work of S. Bandyopadhyay et al. and is be to be found in good agreement. Therefore, it may be concluded that the developed code may be used for the design of a multi-component condenser where all the components can be totally condensed.

40|$|Steam {{condensation}} {{plays an}} essential role in supplying and removing heat in many industrial applications, including the energy sector. It therefore is a phenomena of significance that requires deep understanding. This thesis presents effective vacuum steam condensation on the shell-side of vertical <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>condenser</b> (VSTC) accompanying steam desuperheating. It describes a fundamental study of heat transfer in VSTC with considerations of several factors; explicitly degree of superheat related with each vacuum steam pressure, temperature waviness in desuperheating section, and steam condensation in absence of non-condensable gas (NCG). Experiments performed on the VSTC are: Steam desuperheating and condensation in the shell-side VSTC at a variety of vacuum steam pressures and respective steam flowrates, vacuum steam desuperheating and condensation in the shell-side of VSTC at reduced steam flowrates, and vacuum steam desuperheating and condensation at tube wall temperatures up to steam saturation temperature (T₂ ≥ Tsat) to analyse dry heat transfer in the desuperheating section. To examine the stated aim, test facility was built in the laboratory of the University of Waikato. By generating desuperheating and condensation models for each test pressure, this investigation proves that vacuum steam condensation best occurs without involvement of superheat. About 60 % of the VSTC occupied with desuperheating, and the heat transfer involved in desuperheating is minor approximately 1 kW, whereas, the condensation section of VSTC has heat transfer about 10 kW. By reducing the steam flowrate, 10 % reduction in the desuperheating section and 20 % to 50 % reduction in the Reynolds number was observed. After raising the tube wall temperature up to the steam saturation temperature, a smooth temperature profile across the desuperheating the section was seen with significant sensible heat transfer. Obstruction linked with superheated steam condensation in the dairy industrial leads to poor heat transfer area utilization by the desuperheating section and therefore, reduction of the evaporator rating or oversizing of the heat exchangers to attain appropriate duty...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{pyrolysis}} is {{a promising}} method for producing advanced biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. The process will however require further optimization to produce fuels and chemicals {{at a price}} competitive to conventional fossil fuel-derived products. Research in this dissertation focuses on both pre- and post-processes for optimizing fast pyrolysis to produce increased yields of valuable anhydrosugars and phenolic monomers. The concept of alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) passivation using sulfuric acid had only previously been demonstrated in batch micropyrolyzer trials. A bench-scale, continuous-flow auger pyrolyzer {{was used in this}} work to demonstrate AAEM passivation on both woody and herbaceous feedstocks. Alkali and alkaline earth metal passivation of red oak and switchgrass increased total sugars by more than 105 % and 260 %, respectively. Light oxygenates simultaneously decreased by nearly 50 % from each feedstock. The synchronous increase in sugars and decrease in light oxygenates provides evidence of the hypothesis that AAEM passivation prevents pyranose ring fragmentation and promotes glycosidic bond cleavage in holocellulose. An undesirable consequence of AAEM passivation was an increase in biochar from both lignin and carbohydrates. Demonstration of the enhanced production of sugars from AAEM passivated feedstocks in a continuous auger pyrolyzer at the kilogram scale is an important step in determining the feasibility of using fast pyrolysis to produce sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. Lignin-derived biochar increased from AAEM passivated feedstocks which led to suspicions that thermally active AAEMs catalyze lignin pyrolysis. Effect of thermally active AAEMs on lignin pyrolysis was therefore investigated in more detail. Experimental results indicated that sodium was the most active AAEM on lignin pyrolysis in which it increased overall volatile aromatic monomers by over 16 % compared to the control. Alkali metals as a group both increased char and decreased alkenyl side chains amongst volatile aromatics. Alkenyl side chains are known to result from the cleavage of certain bonds within the lignin structure. Therefore AAEMs are predicted to catalyze the cleavage of linkages within the lignin structure during pyrolysis. The rate at which pyrolysis vapors are cooled in bio-oil collection equipment has been noted to have an influence on bio-oil composition, however prior to this research has never been quantified. A novel cold-gas quench system was developed that utilizes liquid nitrogen to quickly quench pyrolysis products, which produced a more than seven fold increase in cooling rate compared to a conventional <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>condenser.</b> The increased cooling rate and elimination of radial temperature gradients in the quench system increased levoglucosan yield from cellulose by 23 % compared to the conventional system...|$|E
