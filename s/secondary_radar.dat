At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, <b>secondary</b> <b>radar</b> contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

5|$|On 8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 {{disappeared}} {{en route}} from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China with 239 persons aboard; a search in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand was promptly initiated near the aircraft's last voice contact with air traffic control and final contact with <b>secondary</b> <b>radar</b> (the type of radar used by air traffic control). A week after the disappearance, Malaysia announced that military radar determined that the aircraft had traveled west across the Malay Peninsula after being lost by air traffic control. They also announced that communications with a satellite indicated that the aircraft continued to fly for several hours and was last located along one of two corridors—arcing northwest and southwest from Malaysia.|$|E

At 01:21:13, Flight 370 disappeared from the radar screen at Kuala Lumpur ACC and was lost {{about the same time}} on radar at Ho Chi Minh ACC, which reported that the aircraft was at the nearby waypoint BITOD. Air traffic control uses <b>secondary</b> <b>radar,</b> which relies on a signal emitted by a transponder on each aircraft; therefore, the transponder was no longer functioning on Flight 370 after 01:21. The final transponder data indicated that the aircraft was flying at its assigned cruise altitude of flight level 350 and was travelling at [...] true airspeed. There were few clouds around this point, and no rain or lightning nearby. Later analysis estimated that Flight 370 had [...] of fuel when it disappeared from <b>secondary</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The P-19 shares {{many of the}} {{physical}} features of the previous P-15 radar, the P-19 is a high mobility radar and with the antenna mounted on the single truck (Zil-131) with the electronic equipment contained in a second truck. The P-19 uses two open frame elliptical parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, each antenna being fed by a single antenna feed {{in a similar fashion}} to the P-15. The radar can rapidly shift its frequency to one of four pre-set frequencies to avoid active interference with passive interference being removed by a coherent doppler filter. Azimuth was determined by mechanical scanning with an associated accompanying PRV-11 (NATO reporting name [...] "Side Net") used to determine elevation. A <b>secondary</b> <b>radar</b> for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-15, generally the 1L22 [...] "Parol". The armed forces of the Czech Republic described the P-19 as having [...] "outstanding mechanical parameters, simple maintenance, overall reliability and multifunctionality". This evaluation was mirrored by a French evaluation of a radar captured in Chad in 1987 during the Chadian–Libyan conflict, describing the P-19 as sturdy, with good low altitude detection and high resistance to countermeasures.|$|E
