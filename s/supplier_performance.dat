40|$|Abstract Focal {{companies}} (hereafter called buyers) adopt outsourcing practices from {{a supply}} chain management strategy to be competitive. Buyers face the bridge transfer after outsourcing contracts, and the monitoring practices {{would be the only}} control mechanism left to prevent losing control over the suppliers. This study suggests the set of monitoring practices (i. e., capability, activity and outcome monitoring) as the independent variables to enhance the buyer-supplier collaboration and <b>supplier’s</b> <b>performance.</b> In addition the buyer’s efforts of monitoring are assumed to influence the buyer’s shop floor productivity mediated by the <b>supplier’s</b> <b>performance</b> and buyer-supplier collaboration. The results showed that the monitoring practices are meaningful antecedents to the <b>supplier’s</b> <b>performance</b> and buyer-supplier collaboration, which fully mediates between the monitoring practices and buyer’s shop floor productivity. The mediating role of the buyer-supplier collaboration between activity monitoring and shop floor productive has been rejected, because the negative effect of activity monitoring on buyer-supplier collaboratio...|$|R

This study is undertaken to specify the interaction and mutual movement among the three groups in the supply chain "Supplier-Manufacturer-Customer" and to integrate the results of four factors: incoming inspection, performance of line reject, service quality of supplier, and product reliability. It will attempt to transform these factors into measurable, quantitative, JIT (Just-In-Time) parameters, that are utilized in planning and establishing a rating system of <b>supplier's</b> <b>performance</b> focused on satisfying customers, both internal and external, which leads to the best value for money in acquiring materials and services...|$|R

Success of the customer partly depends on <b>supplier's</b> quality <b>performance.</b> Key criteria as quality, cost, delivery, technology support and customer service are categorized as main factors in contributing to <b>supplier's</b> quality <b>performance.</b> 18 suppliers' who were manufacturing automotive application parts evaluated in year 2010 using weight point system. There were few suppliers with common rating which led to common ranking observed by few suppliers'.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine how governance mechanisms impact on <b>supplier</b> delivery <b>performance</b> intermediated by buyer-supplier trust and supplier opportunism. The study focuses on Uganda’s public sector as a case of a less developed country. The research was prompted by frequent reports which indicate that outsourcing contracts fail to deliver on schedule, budget, specifications, and quality and do not deliver expected value to the public. This could be attributed to poor governance mechanisms, lack of buyer-supplier trust and high levels of supplier opportunism. While it has been assumed that governance mechanisms result in better <b>supplier</b> delivery <b>performance,</b> empirical research to corroborate these claims in less developed countries context is very sparse. A theoretical model and hypotheses are developed from literature review. A cross sectional data set collected from 632 Uganda’s public sector staff is used to validate the model. Hierarchical regression results reveal that governance mechanisms are significant predictors of <b>supplier</b> delivery <b>performance.</b> The results also suggest that the impact of governance mechanisms on <b>supplier</b> delivery <b>performance</b> is intermediated by buyer-supplier trust and supplier opportunism. Managers of public sector need to design well outsourced contracts and create mutual trust with their suppliers to improve <b>supplier</b> delivery <b>performance.</b> Similarly, {{there is a need to}} deliberately mitigate supplier opportunism that appears to significantly diminish <b>supplier</b> delivery <b>performance...</b>|$|R

The methodology chosen is a case study conducted in an IT company that outsourced part of its supply chain function to a third party logistics provider.

However, suppliers too often lack the capability to perform adequately.

5000|$|Some {{confusion}} {{may exist}} over {{the difference between}} <b>supplier</b> <b>performance</b> management (SPM) and SRM. SPM is a subset of SRM. A simple way of expressing the difference between SPM and SRM is that the former is about ensuring the supplier delivers what has been promised in the contract, which suggests a narrow, one-way process. SRM, in contrast, is about collaboratively driving value for both parties, resulting in lower costs, reduced risk, greater efficiency, better quality, and access to innovation. [...] This requires a focus on both negotiating the contract and managing the resulting relationship throughout implementation, as well as systematic joint value-discovery efforts.|$|E
50|$|Performance-based {{contracting}} (PBC), {{also known}} as performance-based logistics (PBL) or performance-based acquisition, is a product support strategy used to achieve measurable <b>supplier</b> <b>performance.</b> A PBC approach focuses on developing strategic performance metrics and directly relating contracting payment to performance against these metrics. Common metrics include availability, reliability, maintainability, supportability and total cost of ownership. The primary means of accomplishing this are through incentivized, long-term contracts with specific and measurable levels of operational performance defined by the customer and agreed on by contracting parties. This stands {{in contrast to the}} conventional transaction-based, or waterfall approach, where payment is related to completion of milestones and project deliverables.|$|E

It includes the management of actual performance, identification of performance gaps and agreement of actions to achieve desired performance levels. SPM not only ensures that those benefits identified in the contracting stage are delivered, but that value delivery continues {{for the life of}} the contract. [...] As companies increasingly focus on their core competencies and outsource a greater percentage of work, their success becomes ever more dependent on the performance of strategic suppliers. Ultimately, the objective of SPM is to improve the performance of all parties involved in the contract and Service Level Agreement.|$|E
5000|$|This {{includes}} {{not just the}} outsourcing of the procurement of materials and components, but also the outsourcing of services that traditionally have been provided in-house. The logic of this trend is that the company will increasingly focus on those activities in the value chain {{in which it has}} a distinctive advantage and outsource everything else. This movement has been particularly evident in logistics, where the provision of transport, storage, and inventory control is increasingly subcontracted to specialists or logistics partners. Also, managing and controlling this network of partners and suppliers requires a blend of central and local involvement: strategic decisions are taken centrally, while the monitoring and control of <b>supplier</b> <b>performance</b> and day-to-day liaison with logistics partners are best managed locally.|$|E
50|$|A global {{supply chain}} manager needs to {{recognize}} that <b>supplier</b> <b>performance</b> is a crucial component of their business' success. A manager must recognize all the key components to building and maintaining a successful relationship which are: trust, communication, human asset specificity, and personal relationships. Trust {{is the basis of}} all business-supplier relationships and must be built over time. In order for the business and it's supplier to run successfully, there must be a mutual trust as success is dependent on both the business and the supplier. Communication is also a critical success factor. The flow of information between business and supplier is key in building a relationship and being successful. Businesses who implement the human asset specificity between themselves and their supplier have the benefits of higher levels of trust, better cost, quality and delivery performance. The human asset specificity is the communication and interaction of specific human assets within the business and the supplier. This means opening up communication between individuals in both the business and supplier who are link minded (e.g. engineer to engineer)7.|$|E
