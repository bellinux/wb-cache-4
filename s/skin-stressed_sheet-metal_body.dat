50|$|Hemming presses {{are widely}} used in {{automotive}} manufacturing for hemming of <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> components. The process uses traditional hydraulically operated ‘stamping presses’ to hem closure parts and being the last forming process in stamping, it determines the external quality of automotive outer parts such as doors, hood and trunk-lid.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} auto rickshaw types, designs, and variations. The most common type {{is characterized by a}} <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> or open frame resting on three wheels, a canvas roof with drop-down side curtains, a small cabin at the front for the driver (sometimes known as an auto-wallah) with handlebar controls, and a cargo, passenger, or dual purpose space at the rear.|$|R
50|$|They {{usually have}} a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> or open frame that rests on three wheels, a canvas roof with {{drop-down}} sides, a small cabin {{in the front of}} the vehicle for the driver, an air-cooled scooter version of a two-stroke engine, with handlebar controls instead of a steering wheel.The smaller motorized trikes are used as delivery vehicles for lighter loads. The larger trikes, with more powerful engines, have larger cargo bays, and they can carry freight within a city.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 39 Eihandgranate (or Eierhandgranate, [...] "egg {{hand grenade}}") was a German hand grenade {{introduced}} in 1939 and produced {{until the end}} of World War II. The Eihandgranate used the same fuse assembly (the BZE 39) as the Model 43 Stielhandgranate ("Stick Grenade"), which was screwed into the top of the <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body.</b> To activate, the domed cap was unscrewed, and the pull-cord that had been coiled inside it was tugged sharply before throwing at the target.|$|R
50|$|The early slab-sided steel AK-47 30-round {{detachable}} box magazines had 1 mm <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>bodies</b> {{and weigh}} 0.43 kg empty. The later steel AKM 30-round magazines had lighter <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>bodies</b> with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing 0.33 kg empty. To further reduce weight, a light weight magazine with an aluminum {{body with a}} prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing 0.19 kg empty was developed for the AKM {{that proved to be}} too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines were quickly withdrawn from service. As a replacement steel-reinforced 30-round plastic 7.62×39mm box magazines were introduced. These rust-colored magazines weigh 0.24 kg empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of Bakelite (a phenolic resin), but were actually fabricated from two-parts of AG-S4 molding compound (a glass-reinforced phenol-formaldehyde binder impregnated composite), assembled using an epoxy resin adhesive. Noted for their durability, these magazines did however compromise the rifle's camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations. A second generation steel-reinforced dark-brown (color shades vary from maroon to plum to near black) 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine was introduced in the early 1980s, fabricated from ABS plastic. The third generation steel-reinforced 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine is similar to the second generation, but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish. The current issue steel-reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished 7.62×39mm 30-round magazines, fabricated from ABS plastic weigh 0.25 kg empty.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} (commercial production) 4-AT {{had three}} air-cooled Wright radial engines. It carried {{a crew of}} three: a pilot, a copilot, and a stewardess, as well as eight or nine passengers [...] [...] The later 5-AT had more powerful Pratt & Whitney engines. All models had an aluminum corrugated <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> and wings. Unlike many aircraft of this era, extending through World War II, its control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, and rudders) were not fabric-covered, but were also made of corrugated metal. As was common for the time, its rudder and elevators were actuated by wires that were strung along the external surface of the aircraft. Engine gauges were also mounted externally, on the engines, to be read by the pilot while looking through the aircraft windshield. Another interesting feature {{was the use of}} the hand-operated [...] "Johnny brake." ...|$|R
5000|$|The WC54 was {{designed}} to replace the WC9, WC18 and the WC27 Truck, 1/2 ton, 4×4 Dodge Ambulance (G505).Based on the 3/4 Ton [...] "Beep" [...] Dodge chassis, it featured a longer wheelbase and adjusted suspension to make its ride softer. The closed <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> was made by Wayne Body works. It had room for a driver and four to seven patients plus a medic. If the fold-away bunk stretchers were used, four patients could be transported lying down.Because of its intended role, the WC54 featured a large matrix cab heater fitted on the firewall, providing comfort for patients and crew. It was fitted with a foldaway step to its rear to allow easier access for stretcher bearers and injured personnel. Early models featured a stuck out fuel filler cap which was changed to a recessed one in the later model, a modification that was retrofitted to some early model trucks.|$|R
5000|$|The AK-47’s 30-round {{magazines}} have {{a pronounced}} curve {{that allows them}} to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with [...] "feed-lips" [...] (the surfaces {{at the top of the}} magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that [...] "Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers." [...] This makes the AK-47 magazine more reliable, although heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines. The early slab-sided steel AK-47 magazines weigh 0.43 kg empty. [...] The later steel AKM magazines had lighter <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>bodies</b> with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing 0.33 kg empty. The current issue steel-reinforced plastic magazines are even lighter, weighing 0.25 kg empty. Early steel AK-47 magazines are 9.75 inches long, and the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic magazines are about an inch shorter.|$|R
50|$|The mani wheel, or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, {{generally}} <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> (often beautifully embossed) {{mounted on}} a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of Turbinella (conch) shell. The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a metal weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist. The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case. The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras (Tib. mani) rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan ‘khor-lo than is “wheel” since {{it is thought that}} the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit. The Tibetan name of this device is mani-chos-'khor (མ་ནི་ཆོས་འཁོར་).|$|R
50|$|The AP5 Valiant was {{released}} in May 1963, replacing the SV1 Valiant. It was the first Valiant model to be manufactured in Australia rather than just assembled there. The AP5 featured entirely new <b>sheet-metal,</b> with most <b>body</b> panels produced in Australia. It differed from the US Plymouth Valiant in having a six-bar grille, a larger boot with a different rear deck and a flat rear window. The 225 cid slant six engine was carried over from the SV1 model and remained fully imported. Suspension was substantially unchanged but employed softer rear springs.|$|R
40|$|Motor vehicle related {{pedestrian}} {{road traffic}} collisions {{are a major}} road safety challenge, since they are {{a leading cause of}} death and serious injury worldwide, contributing to a third of the global disease burden. The auto rickshaw, which is a common form of urban transport in many developing countries, plays a major transport role, both as a vehicle for hire and for private use. The most common auto rickshaws are quite unlike ‘typical’ four-wheel motor vehicle, being typically characterised by three wheels, a non-tilting <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>body</b> or open frame construction, a canvas roof and side curtains, a small drivers’ cabin, handlebar controls and a passenger space at the rear. Given the propensity, in developing countries, for auto rickshaws to be used in mixed cityscapes, where pedestrians and vehicles share the roadway, the potential for auto rickshaw impacts with pedestrians is relatively high. Whilst auto rickshaws are used in some Western countries, their limited number and spatial separation from pedestrian walkways, as a result of city planning, has not resulted in significant accident statistics. Thus, auto rickshaws have not been subject to the vehicle impact related pedestrian crash kinematic analyses and/or injury mechanics assessment, typically associated with motor vehicle development in Western Europe, North America and Japan. This study presents a parametric analysis of auto rickshaw related pedestrian impacts by computational simulation, using a Finite Element model of an auto rickshaw and an LS-DYNA 50 th percentile male Hybrid III Anthropometric Test Device (dummy). Parametric variables include auto rickshaw impact velocity, auto rickshaw impact region (front, centre or offset) and relative pedestrian impact position (front, side and rear). The output data of each impact simulation was correlated against reported injury metrics, Head Injury Criterion (front, side and rear), Neck injury Criterion (front, side and rear), Abbreviated Injury Scale and reported risk level and adds greater understanding to the issue of auto rickshaw related pedestrian injury risk. The parametric analyses suggest that pedestrians are subject to a relatively high risk of injury during impacts with an auto rickshaw at velocities of 20 km/h or greater, which during some of the impact simulations may even risk fatalities. The present study provides valuable evidence for informing a series of recommendations and guidelines for making the auto rickshaw safer during collisions with pedestrians. Whilst it is acknowledged that the present research findings are based in the field of safety engineering and may over represent injury risk, compared to “Real World” accidents, many of the simulated interactions produced injury response values significantly greater than current threshold curves and thus, justify their inclusion in the study. To reduce the injury risk level and increase the safety of the auto rickshaw, there should be a reduction in the velocity of the auto rickshaw and, or, consideration of engineering solutions, such as retro fitting injury mitigation technologies to those auto rickshaw contact regions which are the subject of the greatest risk of producing pedestrian injury...|$|R
