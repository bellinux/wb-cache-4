5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
25|$|The Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded Ball a Golden Globe {{nomination}} (Arthur {{received one}} as well) but, disheartened by its reception, she swore <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> {{appear on the}} big screen again, and the film proved to be her last theatrical film (not counting Stone Pillow, her 1985 made-for-TV film).|$|E
25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E
60|$|Having once acceded to {{the truth}} of Lady Fawn's views, she {{abandoned}} all hope. Everybody said so, and it was so. There was no word from any side to encourage her. The thing was done and over, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> mention his name again. She would simply beg of all the Fawns that no allusion might be made to him in her presence. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> blame him, and certainly <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> praise him. As far as she could rule her tongue, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have his name upon her lips again.|$|R

50|$|Switters' Grandmother. Although <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> let him {{call her}} that.|$|R
25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E
500|$|Buffy's {{numbers are}} the most complex, {{changing}} key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would.</b> This appears specifically in [...] "Something to Sing About", which starts with uptempo platitudes: [...] "We'll sing a happy song / And you can sing along: / Where there's life, there's hope / Every day's a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work..." [...] While singing, she kills Sweet's minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not {{to give her a}} song, but [...] "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as [...] "rock ballad to punk polka to hymn" [...] that indicates Buffy's turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals [...] "I live in hell / 'Cause I've been expelled from heaven / I think I was in heaven" [...] with the chord changing from B minor to B diminished, each time she repeats [...] "heaven". When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time he repeats the word [...] "living." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake." ...|$|E
60|$|Gudrun flushed deeply. It {{was these}} attacks <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> forgive.|$|R
60|$|MRS BUILDER. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> stand that. Even wives object, nowadays.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see him again--never! He {{had left}} the room without even {{answering}} the question which she had asked him. He would not even say that he trusted her. It was manifest {{that he did not}} trust her, and that he believed at this moment that she was endeavouring to rob him in this matter of the deed. He had asked her if she had it in her desk or among her clothes, and her very soul revolted from the suspicion so implied. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> speak to him again. It was all over. No; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> willingly speak to him again.|$|R
2500|$|By July 1904, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Crosby's publishers had {{issued a statement}} denying {{that she was in}} need of funds, indicating that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> be, [...] "as they have provided abundantly for her during her entire life", and stating that [...] "Bishop McCabe â€¦ has been grossly deceived by somebody".|$|E
2500|$|Walker's mother {{explained}} {{her attitude}} towards her son's killers, saying [...] "I have to forgive them. [...] I can't feel anger and hatred, {{because that is}} what killed my son". However, Walker's girlfriend Louise, who was present on the night of his murder, said <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> forgive them adding, [...] "I hate them for what they have done. Anthony and I shared something special. Now he has been taken away from me by those two evil young men. I still feel that he (Anthony Walker) is around. Yesterday, I sent Anthony a text and just told him he (Barton) had been found guilty. It seemed the natural thing to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very dreadful of Dodo, though," [...] said Celia, {{wishing to}} justify her husband. [...] "She said <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> marry again--not anybody at all." ...|$|E
60|$|The broad {{fact that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> forgive him {{was for a}} while her only {{coherent}} thought. To this succeeded the determination that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> forgive herself. And having thus placed beyond the pale the only two friends she had in New York, she was free to devote herself without hindrance {{to the task of}} feeling thoroughly lonely and wretched.|$|R
60|$|The {{delightful}} {{simplicity and}} happiness of the ensuing hour was something Carley believed <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> forget.|$|R

6000|$|Amabel {{was lying}} on her bed, her Bible open by her; not exactly reading, but {{as if she was}} now and then finding a verse and {{dwelling}} on it. Gentle and serene she looked; but <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> weep? <b>would</b> those quiet blue eyes be always sleepless and tearless? ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{had very}} little to live on, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have dreamed of taking what was not hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I like it immensely, and {{do believe}} it now only it rather takes {{my breath away}} to think of Aunty's going, when <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> hear of it before." ...|$|E
60|$|Her voice {{died away}} with the last notes, and she fell into a slumber, from which the {{experienced}} attendant assured them that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> awake at all, or only in the death agony.|$|E
6000|$|... "So she is; as lovely as ever she can stand. But {{she does}} not seem to have much to say for herself. I {{remember}} when she was a little girl <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> speak." ...|$|E
60|$|El-Soo made no sound. She sat {{and looked}} at her {{shattered}} ankles, on which <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> walk again.|$|R

50|$|Eighteen {{months before}} this second Olympic appearance, Stone {{sustained}} a career-threatening spinal injury in which doctors believed <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> jump again.|$|R
60|$|Sir John laughed, {{but with}} some emotion, and Phoebe hastily turned her still more {{blushing}} face away. Certainly, if Phoebe had had any prevision of her present state of mind, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have bought that chiffonier.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not half so good as yours, Mother. Here it is, and {{we never}} can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done," [...] cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> outgrow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Miss Ada, I {{told her}} she must be mistaken, but she stuck to it, though she said <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have breathed a word if Miss Gillian had not come back again, but she thought you should know it.' ...|$|E
60|$|And then remorse, self-reproach, despair,--almost as {{terrible to}} contemplate. <b>She</b> swore <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see Mr. Bentley again, she couldn't face him.|$|R
