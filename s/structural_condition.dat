5|$|Although the {{original}} invasion threat passed, Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century. A 1616 survey nonetheless {{reported that a}} range of repairs were needed, at an estimated total cost of £437, while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at £1,243 was required. In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable <b>structural</b> <b>condition,</b> but antiquated in design. A report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional sea defences.|$|E
5|$|The current bridge along Grand Avenue {{over the}} Colorado River and I-70 {{just east of}} the highway's western {{terminus}} dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane in either direction. By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor <b>structural</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the RAAF has {{implemented}} several {{measures to}} keep the Hornets in service. These include a structural refurbishment program, increased monitoring of fatigue-related issues as well as repainting the aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce the risks posed by corrosion. In 2015 the Defence Science and Technology Group conducted new statistical analysis of the Hornets' <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> which found that the airframes were less fatigued than previously believed, and so able to remain in service {{for a longer period}} than planned if necessary. This finding was accepted by the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness – Australian Defence Force. As of September 2017, none of the RAAF Hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue. However, the cost of maintaining the ageing aircraft in service has been increasing.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} support the {{mainline}} operation of Tornado, the Trust purchased a support coach, a British Railways Mark 1 Brake First Composite (BCK) type, No. 21249, built at Swindon in 1961. It was purchased from being in storage at the northern half of the GCR at Ruddington. It was described as being in good <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> despite being out of use for some time, with overhaul estimated to require additional funding of £50,000. It was to be moved to Darlington works in October 2008. It had previously been used on Steam Locomotive Operators' Association (SLOA) pullman trains in the 1980s, and was also at the Telford Steam Railway and Lavender Line heritage railways.|$|E

[...] As Patcham developed into a suburb in the 20th century, more churches opened {{in the area and}} were administered from All Saints Church.

500|$|Having {{stood for}} more than 600 years with little alteration, the church was {{completely}} changed by four reconstructions and restorations in a 74-year period in the 19th century. [...] The last of these, in 1898, was the most substantial: it added a north aisle, much larger and taller {{than the rest of}} the building, and a vestry. [...] In the early 19th century, the building had been in better <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> than many in Sussex—a survey in 1825 by Sir Stephen Glynn of the Ecclesiological Society noted that it was [...] "decently fitted up"—but rebuilding ancient churches was fashionable in the Victorian era, and the condition of a surviving medieval corbel suggests that the exterior walls were in poor condition. [...] The three earlier periods of restoration were 1824–25, 1856 and 1880–83. [...] During the third of these, a 13th-century wall painting of Christ in Judgement was discovered above the chancel arch, hidden under 30 layers of whitewash and the remains of two later paintings; it may be one of the oldest such murals in England, but it was repainted after its rediscovery. [...] In 1898, at the same time as the north-side extension, the outside walls of the west, east and south sides were coated with grey cement, probably to improve their structural condition; although this has been described as [...] "unsightly" [...] and [...] "kill the exterior stone dead", one historian has argued that because many medieval churches were rendered in this way, rather than having uncovered flint walls, it gives the impression of what a typical church of that era may look like.|$|E
2500|$|By 1724, {{when the}} Bishop of Chichester Thomas Bowers {{commissioned}} {{a survey of}} all churches in his diocese, St Peter's Church was in poor <b>structural</b> <b>condition,</b> but repairs were carried out soon afterwards. [...] A new bell, cast in 1719 in nearby Horsham, was installed in the tower at the same time. [...] Another, cast in London and {{paid for by the}} congregation, was added in 1766. [...] Around this time, the Lydell family—owners of the Wakehurst Place estate and patrons of the church—built a burial vault in the church and turned the south aisle into their private chapel.|$|E
40|$|Generalizing the {{dynamics}} implied by power transition theory, we characterize the <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> that lead nations to initiate conflict or choose to integrate. The relationship between changes in relative power, hierarchical structures, and joint satisfaction {{are used to}} identify the <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> for conflict and cooperation. Empirical tests {{for the last two}} centuries confirm the strength and robustness of this characterization. In addition, long term assessments of Pax Britannica, the Cold War, and China’s potential challenge to the United States in this century are used to illustrate the precision of these findings. The fundamental implication is that <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> provide the pre-conditions for conflict and cooperation, but decision makers have leeway in advancing policies that eventually lead to either war or peace. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{church has}} a [...] "typically 18th-century" [...] {{interior}} despite its mostly 13th-century exterior.

[...] Also described by one historian as {{the best in the}} county is the rare three-deck pulpit, also of the 18th century. [...] The pine screen between the nave and chancel has a [...] "splendid" [...] and [...] "wonderfully naïve" [...] painted plasterwork Royal Arms in its tympanum, repainted in 1845.

2500|$|The only {{church in}} the area was St Alban's, an Anglican church built between 1910 and 1914 at the {{junction}} of Coombe Road and Buller Road. [...] Architect Lacy W. Ridge was responsible for its red-brick Early English Gothic Revival design. [...] It had its own parish until 15 May 1974, when the new Parish of the Resurrection—consisting of St Martin's Church on Lewes Road, St Wilfrid's Church on Elm Grove and St Alban's—was formed. [...] Its deteriorating <b>structural</b> <b>condition</b> led to its closure in 2006, and the Diocese of Chichester declared it redundant on 22 November of that year. [...] Planning permission was granted in 2010 for its demolition and replacement with nine houses. [...] Demolition was authorised in February 2013 and took place later that year. [...] The former parish hall, built in 1902–03 {{at the corner of}} Riley Road and Bear Road, still stands. [...] By 1990 it had been acquired by Brighton Polytechnic, and it is now a nursery school. [...] Adjacent to the former church is Coombe Road Primary School, which opened in April 1912 and took infants from 1915. [...] As of 2012 it had 317 pupils between the ages of 4 and 11.|$|E

This paper argues that global information management researchers should not lose sight of <b>structural</b> <b>conditions</b> related to business-to-business and business-to-consumer ecommerce activity. <b>Structural</b> <b>conditions</b> are physical, social and economic arrangements that shape e-commerce business models and influence individual and organizational use of the Internet.

Therefore, valid explanations of global differences in e-commerce activity require a careful assessment of relevant structural factors. ...|$|R
