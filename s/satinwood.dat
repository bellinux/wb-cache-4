5|$|The Tree Streets is {{a network}} of streets in the Mount Pleasant portion of the village. Several of the streets are named after {{regional}} trees, including <b>Satinwood</b> Lane, Larch Road, and Oak Road. A number of houses in the neighborhood were constructed during a 1930s building boom, circling Jackson Park and near Todd Elementary School. The Crossroads {{is a group of}} 84 houses on streets named after local World War II veterans, including Schrade Road, Hazelton Circle, Matthes Road, and Dunn Lane. It was constructed at the end of World War II to provide affordable housing to returning veterans, and was completed in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and <b>satinwood</b> paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages {{people usually}} brought their own cutlery {{with them when}} eating away from home, and the more {{expensive}} types came with their own custom-made leather cases, stamped and embossed in various designs. Later, as cutlery became provided by the host, decorative cases, especially for the knives, were often left {{on display in the}} dining-room.Some of the most elegant and often ornate were in the styles of Robert Adam, George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. Occasionally flat-topped containers, they were most frequently either rod-shaped, or tall and narrow with a sloping top necessitated by a series of raised veins for exhibiting the handles of knives and the bowls of spoons. Mahogany and <b>satinwoods</b> were most common, occasionally inlaid with marquetry, or edged with boxwood which was resistant to chipping. These receptacles, often made in pairs, still exist in large numbers; they are often converted into stationery cabinets. Another version is an open tray or rack, usually with a handle, also for the storage of table cutlery.|$|R
25|$|Flowering acacias {{flourish}} on {{the arid}} Jaffna Peninsula. Among the {{trees of the}} dry-land forests are valuable species such as <b>satinwood,</b> ebony, ironwood, mahogany and teak. The wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes.|$|E
25|$|In the Blocks III, IV, and V, {{forests are}} more widespread. The canopy {{of the forest}} mainly {{contains}} Drypetes sepiaria and Manilkara hexandra plant species. The Pitiya grasslands are important for grazing animals. The Cynodon barberi is the common grass in Pitiya grasslands while Zoysia matrella becomes dominant near the beach. Among 300 odd floral species are Manilkara hexandra, Drypetes sepiaria, Ceylon <b>Satinwood,</b> Terminalia arjuna, limonia, Berrya cordifolia, Randia dumetorum, Pleurostylia opposita, Gymnema sylvestre, Bell mimosa, Neem, Banyan, Toothbrush tree, Schleichera oleosa, Vitex pinnata, Indian blackberry, Gmelina asiatica, Carissa spinarum, Euphorbia antiquorum, and Acacia eburnea. In the seasonally flooded areas of Block II, a wild species of rice (Oryza sp.) is found. The Glenniea unijuga is an endemic plant species found around the wetlands of the park. The Munronia pumila, Salacia reticulata, and Asparagus racemosus are the medicinal plants.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Baltic was {{initially}} {{designed to accommodate}} 200 first-class passengers in about 150 separate berths, including several large [...] "honeymoon" [...] berths. All the berths were spacious and included two washbasins and a sofa {{in addition to the}} beds, which were finished in <b>satinwood</b> and draped with damask curtains. Two innovations were also introduced—a bell-rope system for summoning the steward, and steam heating.|$|E
2500|$|Rare or {{threatened}} plant species of record include wiry bossiaea (Bossiaea cordigera), matted flax-lily (Dianella amoena), Brooker’s gum (Eucalyptus brookeriana), Fryerstown grevillea [...] (Grevillea obtecta), creeping grevillea (G. repens), hairy beard-heath (Leucopogon microphyllus var. pilibundus), <b>satinwood</b> (Nematolepis squamea subsp. squamea), small sickle greenhood (Pterostylis lustra), scented bush-pea (Pultenaea graveolens) {{as well as}} two endemic species Wombat leafless bossiaea (Bossiaea vombata) and Wombat bush-pea (Pultenaea reflexifolia).|$|E
2500|$|All the {{first-class}} public rooms, and the en-suite staterooms of {{the upper}} deck, were generally heavily panelled, in oak, <b>satinwood</b> or mahogany; and thickly carpeted. Velvet curtains hung aside the windows and portholes, while the furniture was richly upholstered in matching design. The predominant style was Art Nouveau, although other styles were also in use, such as [...] "French Renaissance" [...] which {{was applied to the}} forward first-class entrance hall, whilst the 1st class smoking room was in [...] "Elizabethan style", comprising heavy oak panels surrounding the first open fireplace ever to be used aboard a passenger liner.|$|E
2500|$|His only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, {{whose members}} dined {{together}} before weekly meetings. Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries. However his shyness made those who [...] "sought his views... speak as if into vacancy. If their remarks were...worthy, they might receive a mumbled reply, {{but more often}} than not they would hear a peeved squeak (his voice appears to have been high-pitched) and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing to find a more peaceful corner". Cavendish's religious views were also considered eccentric for his time. He was considered to be agnostic. As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, [...] "As to Cavendish's religion, he was nothing at all." [...] He also enjoyed collecting fine furniture exemplified by his purchase of a set of [...] "ten inlaid <b>satinwood</b> chairs with matching cabriole legged sofa".|$|E
2500|$|Entering {{the family}} wing from the hall, the first {{room on the}} left, beyond the garden entrance, is the Yellow Drawing Room. [...] This has a more {{intimate}} atmosphere and contains a collection of <b>satinwood</b> furniture made by Gillows. [...] This includes a bookcase dated 1795 {{and a pair of}} cabinets {{on each side of the}} fireplace. [...] The paintings are family portraits. [...] Opposite this room is the Family Entrance and opposite the garden entrance is the Oak Staircase which was moved here from Hough End Hall. [...] The Servants' Quarters occupy two floors, the ground floor and basement. [...] These contain the usual rooms required to service a mansion and many of these are furnished with the equipment and utensils formerly in use in the house. [...] One room, known as the Maurice Egerton Exhibition Room, houses a collection of items from around the world which were collected by Maurice Egerton on his travels.|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{population}} of Lomatia tasmanica consists of around 300 plants in an area less than 1.2 km long in southwestern Tasmania. The climate is wet, receiving 1700 mm of rain a year, and all plants grow within 25 m of a river or creek. It mainly grows in a rainforest or mixed forest made up of trees 8–15 m high and such species as myrtle beech Lophozonia cunninghamii, celery-top pine (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius), southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), leatherwood (Eucryphia lucida), <b>satinwood</b> (Nematolepis squamea), blue-green tea tree (Leptospermum glaucescens) and (Anodopetalum biglandulosum), and understory species such as thyme archeria ( [...] Archeria serpyllifolia), native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida), sweet-scented trochocarpa (Trochocarpa gunnii), Raukaua gunnii, white waratah (Agastachys odorata) and Prionotes cerinthoides, hard water fern (Blechnum wattsii) and brickmaker's sedge ( [...] Gahnia grandis). Scattered Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida) tower over the canopy. Profuse moss and fern growth highlights the wetness of the habitat. Lomatia tasmanica extends into neighbouring dry sclerophyll forest composed of Smithton peppermint over an understory of blue-green tea tree on more elevated areas. Finally, it grows in a dense riverbank scrubland with species such as silver banksia (Banksia marginata), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), prickly-leaved wattle (Acacia verticillata), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), scented paperbark (M. squarrosa), Anodopetalum biglandulosum and Smithton peppermint over a dense low understory of Bauera rubioides, Gahnia grandis, Epacris aff. heteronema, scrambling coral fern (Gleichenia microphylla), Calorophus erostris, lesser wire rush (Empodisma minus) and button grass (Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus).|$|E

60|$|The hot air vibrated {{with the}} {{constant}} babel of voices, the frou-frou of silk paniers, and brocaded skirts, {{mingled with the}} clink of swords and the rattle of dice in <b>satinwood</b> boxes.|$|E

6000|$|That {{evening after}} dinner--in the room he had {{furnished}} for her mother, where the <b>satinwood</b> chairs, the little Jacobean bureau, the old brass candelabra were still {{much as they}} had been just on thirty years ago--she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Beatrice Lady Cullumpton {{entered the}} long, dimly-lit drawing-room, her eyes blazing with {{a hope that}} she guessed to be groundless, her lips {{trembling}} with a fear {{that she could not}} disguise. In her hand she carried a small fan, a fragile toy of lace and <b>satinwood.</b> Something snapped as she entered the room; she had crushed the fan into a dozen pieces.’ ...|$|E
60|$|The old serang {{coming in}} noiselessly saw his Captain {{as he had}} seen him many times before, sitting under the gilt thunderbolts, {{apparently}} as strong in his body, in his wealth, and in his knowledge of secret words that have a power over men and elements, as ever. The old Malay squatted down {{within a couple of}} feet from Lingard, leaned his back against the <b>satinwood</b> panel of the bulkhead, then raising his old eyes with a watchful and benevolent expression to the white man's face, clasped his hands between his knees.|$|E
6000|$|Soames walked in. He noted {{mechanically}} {{that all}} was still silvery, and that the upright piano was of <b>satinwood.</b> She had risen and stood recoiled against it; her hand, placed on the keys as if groping for support, had struck a sudden discord, held for a moment, and released. The light from the shaded piano-candle fell on her neck, leaving her face rather in shadow. She was in a black evening dress, {{with a sort of}} mantilla over her shoulders--he did not remember ever having seen her in black, and the thought passed through him: 'She dresses even when she's alone.' ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the affairs}} of M. le Maréchal de Coigni the present chronicle hath no further concern; {{but we know that}} some ten minutes later on this same August 13, 1746, he succeeded in being present at the petit lever of M. le Contrôleur-Général des Finances. Once within the secret precincts of the bedchamber he, like so many other petitioners and courtiers, was duly confronted by the stony stare of M. Achille, and found himself face to face with an {{enormous}} bedstead of delicately painted <b>satinwood</b> and ormulu mounts, draped with heavy azure silk curtains which hung down from a gilded baldachin, the whole a masterpiece of the furniture-maker's art.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've got her,' thought Soames, 'if I want her. But do I want her?' She was graceful, she was pretty--very pretty; she was fresh, she had {{taste of}} a kind. His eyes {{travelled}} round the little room; but {{the eyes of}} his mind went another journey--a half-light, and silvery walls, a <b>satinwood</b> piano, a woman standing against it, reined back as it were from him--a woman with white shoulders that he knew, and dark eyes that he had sought to know, and hair like dull dark amber. And as in an artist who strives for the unrealisable and is ever thirsty, so there rose in him at that moment the thirst of the old passion he had never satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was gone}} for above a year, and was quite restored. When he came back, he sent me the tale I'm going to show you.--Oh, here it is!" [...] said she, as the page put in her hands a {{beautiful}} box of <b>satinwood.</b> She unlocked it, and from among several parcels of notes on embossed paper, cards of charades, and copies of verses, she drew out a crimson velvet case, that smelt very much of perfumes. From this she took a manuscript, daintily written on gilt-edged vellum paper, and stitched a light blue riband. This she handed to the captain, who read the following tale, which I have procured for the entertainment of the reader.|$|E
6000|$|When these adventures were over, {{when he had}} had a shave and a shine, {{and washed}} his hands, and looked into a department-store window that {{contained}} ten billion yards of silk draped against polished <b>satinwood,</b> when he had felt unhappy over a movie theater large enough to contain ten times the population of Schoenstrom, and been cursed by a policeman for jaywalking, and had passed a hotel entirely full of diplomats and marble and caviare--then he could no longer put off telephoning to Claire, and humbly, in a booth meant for an umbrella-stand, he got the Eugene Gilson house, and to a female who said [...] "Yes?" [...] in a tone which made it mean [...] "No!" [...] he ventured, [...] "May I speak to Miss Boltwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was {{reclining}} in {{a luxurious}} arm-chair, {{in the little}} library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair. It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high-panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plaster-work, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny <b>satinwood</b> table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of [...] "Les Cent Nouvelles," [...] bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve, and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantel-shelf, and through the small leaded panels of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London.|$|E
60|$|Francis stepped {{across the}} deck towards where Lady Cynthia had been sitting by her host's side. They had passed {{into the mouth of}} a tree-hung strip of the river. The engine was {{suddenly}} shut off. A gong was sounded. There was a murmur, almost a sob of relief, as the little sprinkling of men and women rose hastily to their feet and made their way towards the companion-way. Downstairs, in the saloon, with its white <b>satinwood</b> panels and rows of swing chairs, heavy curtains were drawn across the portholes, all outside light was shut out from the place. At the further end, raised slightly from the floor, was a sanded circle. Sir Timothy made his way to one of the pillars by its side and turned around to face the little company of his guests. His voice, though it seemed scarcely raised above a whisper, was extraordinarily clear and distinct. Even Francis, who, with Lady Cynthia, had found seats only just inside the door, could hear every word he said.|$|E
60|$|Giving the stout {{shoulders}} a hug, Gyp {{seized the}} black devils, {{and ran up}} the path under the trellis, while the Scotch-terrier pups, squeezed against her breast, made confused small noises and licked her nose and ears. Through the square hall she ran into the drawing-room, which opened out on to the lawn; and there, in the French window, stood spying back at the spick-and-span room, where everything was, of course, placed just wrong. The colouring, white, ebony, and <b>satinwood,</b> looked nicer even than she had hoped. Out in the garden--her own garden--the pear-trees were thickening, but not in blossom yet; a few daffodils were in bloom along the walls, and a magnolia had one bud opened. And all the time she kept squeezing the puppies to her, enjoying their young, warm, fluffy savour, and letting them kiss her. She {{ran out of the}} drawing-room, up the stairs. Her bedroom, the dressing-room, the spare room, the bathroom--she dashed into them all. Oh, it was nice to be in your own place, to be--Suddenly she felt herself lifted off the ground from behind, and in that undignified position, her eyes flying, she turned her face till he could reach her lips.|$|E
6000|$|He had not {{entered the}} place {{for more than four}} years--not, indeed, since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then as a study when he grew {{somewhat}} older. It was a large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord Kelso {{for the use of the}} little grandson whom, for his strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little changed. There was the huge Italian cassone, with its fantastically-painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy. There the <b>satinwood</b> bookcase filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry, where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store for him! ...|$|E
60|$|To {{this very}} room {{he had come}} back after hearing she was dead; this very room which he had refurnished to her taste, so that even now, with its <b>satinwood</b> chairs, little dainty Jacobean bureau, shaded old brass candelabra, divan, it still had an air exotic to bachelordom. There, on the table, had been a letter recalling him to his regiment, ordered on active service. If he had {{realized}} what he would go through before he had the chance of trying to lose his life out there, he would undoubtedly have taken that life, sitting in this very chair before the fire--the chair sacred to her and memory. He had not the luck he wished for in that little war--men who don't care whether they live or die seldom have. He secured nothing but distinction. When it was over, he went on, with a few more lines in his face, a few more wrinkles in his heart, soldiering, shooting tigers, pig-sticking, playing polo, riding to hounds harder than ever; giving nothing away to the world; winning steadily the curious, uneasy admiration that men feel for those who combine reckless daring with an ice-cool manner. Since he was less of a talker even than most of his kind, and had never in his life talked of women, he did not gain the reputation of a woman-hater, though he so manifestly avoided them. After six years' service in India and Egypt, he lost his right hand in a charge against dervishes, and had, perforce, to retire, with the rank of major, aged thirty-four. For a long time he had hated {{the very thought of}} the child--his child, in giving birth to whom the woman he loved had died. Then came a curious change of feeling; and for three years before his return to England, {{he had been in the}} habit of sending home odds and ends picked up in the bazaars, to serve as toys. In return, he had received, twice annually at least, a letter from the man who thought himself Gyp's father. These letters he read and answered. The squire was likable, and had been fond of HER; and though never once had it seemed possible to Winton to have acted otherwise than he did, he had all the time preserved a just and formal sense of the wrong he had done this man. He did not experience remorse, but he had always an irksome feeling as of a debt unpaid, mitigated by knowledge that no one had ever suspected, and discounted by memory of the awful torture he had endured to make sure against suspicion.|$|E
