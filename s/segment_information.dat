In a multi-period setting, an earnings announcement functions as a source of both predictive and confirmatory information. Therefore, an increase in market reactions around earnings announcements caused by predictive value may be totally offset by a decrease associated with confirmatory information. However, this ongoing shift can be observable if the magnitude of increase in market reactions associated with the first use of interim <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> is more than that associated with predictive value of each subsequent earnings announcement. ^ This dissertation compares market reactions measured by standard deviation of the market model residual around earnings announcements for consecutive four paired quarters distinguished by disclosure of interim <b>segment</b> <b>information.</b> Reduction in market reactions is observed only around the second quarter earnings announcement; thus, it provides partial evidence of the ongoing shift. This ongoing shift can be fully supported if the corresponding increase in market reactions is detected at some point early in the transition period. ^ Because interim <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> represents a finer set of information, its economic consequence is examined in terms of changes in firms 2 ̆ 7 costs of capital, as measured by their respective Beta values. ^ Although disclosure of interim <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> is associated with changes in Beta values of reporting firms, no statistical conclusion can be made as to the direction of change in their respective costs of capital. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} {{examination of the}} relationship between six firm characteristics, namely: firm size, industry membership, minority interest, financial leverage, firm diversification, ownership diffusion, and voluntary disclosure of <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> in a regulated environment. This study provides empirical evidence that there are incentives for Australian companies with specific firm characteristics to voluntarily disclose <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> in a regulated setting. The theoretical frameworks employed in this research study are agency theory and contracting theory. Compensation contracts are employed to resolve the potential conflicts of interest between the shareholders and managers giving rise to agency cost of equity. Debt contracts are employed to resolve the bondholders and shareholders/managers conflict giving rise to agency cost of debt. Management may voluntarily disclose additional <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> to reduce these agency costs. Compensation contracts and debt contracts align the interests of management with those of shareholders and debtholders. Managers are directly rewarded using a variety of compensation plans, such as stock option grants and stock appreciation rights. Managers have incentives to maximise firm value under these compensation plans as they may be rewarded with an increase in bonus payments and an increase in the value of their share options. In information costs (or proprietary costs), there are two forces influencing voluntary disclosure: (i) the cost of providing information and (ii) the corresponding associated benefits. Where there is a demand for private information by shareholders, debtholders and investors, its non-disclosure is likely to be interpreted as bad news and hence adversely affect firm value. Managers have incentives to voluntarily disclose additional <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> if there is a net benefit in disclosure. Certain industries may attract a disproportionate share of scrutiny from government agencies and special interest groups. These companies are more likely to voluntarily disclose additional <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> to reduce the likelihood of political costs. Political considerations include managers 2 ̆ 7 concern about attracting explicit and implicit taxes, or regulatory actions. The six hypotheses in this thesis focus on a test of the contracting theory and agency theory. The firm size and firm diversification hypotheses are used as a test of the contracting theory, information costs. The industry membership hypothesis is employed to test the contracting theory, political costs. The minority interest, financial leverage and ownership diffusion hypotheses are used as a test of the agency theory. This study is based on a sample of 185 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange top 300 shares. Univariate and multivariate tests were performed on the six hypotheses in this thesis. The univariate test results provide evidence to support voluntary segment disclosure is significantly related to firm diversification, minority interest and financial leverage but no support was found for firm size, ownership diffusion and industry membership. The bivariate logistic regression test results found statistically significant support that voluntary disclosure of <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> in a regulated environment is related to firm diversification and firm size. No support was found for minority interest, financial leverage, ownership diffusion and industry membership...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of firms’ {{adoption}} of AASB 8 segment disclosure rules on analysts’ earnings forecasts. It examines whether providing more disaggregated <b>segment</b> <b>information</b> following the adoption of AASB 8 is associated {{with an increase in}} analysts’ ability to forecast earnings. We find that analysts’ earnings forecasts have not improved significantly after adopting AASB 8 in Australia, regardless of whether firms disclosed more disaggregated <b>segment</b> <b>information.</b> Our use of control firms provides assurance that the results are due to AASB 8 and not to some other events concurrent with the adoption of AASB 8. Overall, our results imply that the benefits associated with the management approach as experienced by financial analysts in the United States have not been realised by financial analysts in Australia. This suggests that the successful adoption of an accounting standard in one country should not be the justification for recommending adoption in other countries. Further, our results raise questions about whether the enhanced disclosures required in the new standard are more for the other users of financial statements, such as investors, rather than analysts. 11 page(s...|$|E
