5|$|President Garfield {{came to the}} Sixth Street Station {{on his way to}} {{his alma}} mater, Williams College, where he was {{scheduled}} to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, James and Harry, and Secretary of State Blaine. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln waited at the station to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> off. Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, early U.S. presidents never used any guards.|$|E
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E
50|$|Midterm {{elections}} usually generate lower {{voter turnout}} than presidential elections. While the latter have had turnouts of about 50-60% {{over the past}} 60 years, only about 40 percent of those eligible to vote actually {{go to the polls}} in midterm elections. Midterm elections usually <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> party lose seats in Congress, and also frequently <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> intraparty opponents gain power.|$|R

25|$|The next day's {{election}} was not postponed, as Taiwanese law only allows for suspension {{of an election}} {{on the death of}} a candidate. Chen's opponent, Lien Chan, and Lien's campaign manager Wang Jin-ping tried to visit Chen {{on the night of the}} incident, but were unable to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> because he was resting. Chen appeared in public the next day when he turned out to cast his vote.|$|E

25|$|At his arrival, Stanton {{was told}} that Lincoln had in fact been attacked. Stanton ordered that the homes of {{all members of the}} cabinet and the Vice President be put under guard. Stanton pushed through a crowd at the Secretary's home to find an {{unconscious}} Seward being attended to by a doctor in a bloody third-floor room. Seward's son, Frederick, was left paralyzed by the attack. Stanton and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, who had come to Seward's home moments before, decided to go to Ford's Theatre to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> The two secretaries went by carriage, accompanied by Quartermaster General Meigs and David K.

500|$|The {{letter was}} signed by Einstein and posted back to Szilárd, who {{received}} it on August 9. Szilárd gave both the short and long letters, along with a letter of his own, to Sachs on August 15. Sachs asked the White House staff for an appointment to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> but before one could be set up, the administration became embroiled in a crisis due to Germany's invasion of Poland, which started World War II. Sachs delayed his appointment until October so that the President would give the letter due attention, securing an appointment on October 11. On that date {{he met with the}} President, the President's secretary, Brigadier General Edwin [...] "Pa" [...] Watson, and two ordnance experts, Army Lieutenant Colonel Keith F. Adamson and Navy Commander Gilbert C. Hoover. Roosevelt summed up the conversation as: [...] "Alex, what you are after is to see that the Nazis don't blow us up." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, September 6, 1901, McKinley dressed {{formally}} as usual, then departed the Milburn House for a stroll through the neighborhood. [...] The President nearly slipped away unguarded; when the police and soldiers noticed him leaving, they hurried after him. Czolgosz also rose early {{with the intent of}} lining up for the public reception at the Temple of Music; he reached the Exposition gates at 8:30a.m., in time to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> pass in his carriage en route to the train station for the visit to Niagara Falls. [...] The McKinleys traveled by train to Lewiston, where they switched to trolleys to view the Niagara Gorge. [...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] It was a hot day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long. [...] As it was only 3:30p.m., McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, wanting to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> {{even if they}} could not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

Additionally, despite people's claims that they saw Ruby upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he wasn't; On Friday night TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at Police Headquarters and reported that Ruby [...] "appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing". Announcer Glen Duncan also testified that Ruby [...] "was not grieving" [...] and if anything, was [...] "happy that evidence was piling up against Oswald".|$|E
2500|$|On 9 July, it was {{announced}} in the media that when the insurgents first started shooting towards Lesok, a police unit came to the villagers and armed them with firearms and ammunition to defend themselves, because the police {{were not allowed to}} intervene. The armed villagers organised a village militia, took up defensive positions, and repelled the NLA's attempts to enter the village for two days. On the same day, groups of Tetovo Macedonians went to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to demand that the army be ordered to enter Tetovo and expel the insurgents from the ethnic Macedonian villages of Setole, Otunje, Jadoarce, Brezno, Varvara and Jeloshnik so that civilians could be returned to their homes. They claimed that the NLA attacked the remaining Macedonian villages in the region in order to ethnically cleanse the region of Macedonians. They also stated that they thought that the General Ceasefire Agreement was [...] "an unthought-of act which may, and already is, very harmful to the Macedonian population in the Tetovo region".|$|E

Connally, like the President, was a World War II military veteran but unlike him, a longtime hunter. Connally {{testified that he}} immediately recognized {{the sound of a}} high-powered rifle, then he turned his head and torso rightward, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him. Governor Connally testified he could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> so he then started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left). Connally also testified that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was hit in his upper right back by a bullet he did not hear fired.

50|$|The Austrian presidential {{elections}} of 1951 {{marked the first}} time that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Austria was elected by popular vote.

After the suspension of the constitution in 1934 and Austria ceasing to exist in 1938, the first {{presidential elections}} by popular vote were to be held in 1945. Because the Allied council did not approve on the constitutional law passed by the National Council, the election was again held by the Federal Council of Austria. With no candidate achieving a majority of the votes, a second round was held on 27 May 1951. It saw socialist Theodor Körner, mayor of Vienna, defeating the governor of Upper Austria, Heinrich Gleißner of the Austrian People's Party.|$|R
