5|$|Bonsecours is a commune on {{a plateau}} to the {{southwest}} of Rouen. Until 1890 only an infrequent bus service linked it to Rouen. However, it attracted many hikers, with its splendid panoramas over the meandering Seine, and pilgrims visiting the <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the Virgin Mary.|$|E

5|$|The shrine was {{adorned with}} gold, silver and {{precious}} stones. In 1339, three London goldsmiths were employed {{for a whole}} year to rebuild the <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> a higher standard. William Dugdale records that the shrine was pyramidal in shape with an altar table placed in front for offerings.|$|E
5|$|The temple faces north, {{unlike most}} Hindu temples. Artefacts from two phases, the Sangam phase {{as well as}} the Pallava phase, have been found. The temple is Tamil Nadu's oldest <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> Murugan.

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|On {{reaching}} Jejuri, Khandoba {{was greeted}} by Mhalsa's fury and her strong protest of his second marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} the hill to Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> Banai is situated halfway down the hill.|$|E

She also spent 20million rupees for a slot on a leading channel for a promotion for the film.

Kumar, Sinha, Khan, Kapoor {{and most of}} the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif (a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer) on Monday morning, 5 August, to pray for the film's success and the well-being of all involved.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.|$|E
5|$|The priory church {{housed a}} <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the Virgin Mary {{which one of}} the most {{significant}} Marian shrines in the north, along with others at Walsingham, Lincoln, Scarborough, Jesmond and Carlisle. Although it was destroyed during the Reformation along with the priory, it was revived in 1949 by Father Arthur Mercer, Guisborough's first Roman Catholic parish priest for 400 years, and is housed in the town's St Paulinus Church.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{the monastery}} was of {{substantial}} size but following its destruction by the Chinese in 1959 it was drastically reduced {{and only a}} section rebuilt. Sera Utsé has a two-storied chapel and monks' quarters with magnificent views over the city of Lhasa. There is a protector <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> Pehar and Shridevi. A small assembly hall remains, which was once believed to contain a large metal statue of Vajrabhairava (Rdo rje ’jigs byed), a great statue of Yamāntaka Ekavīra, statues of the Buddha and the Sixteen Arhats, a speaking Tārā (Sgrol ma) statue, large images of Tsongkhapa and his two disciples, and statues of the bla mas of the Drupkhang incarnation (Sgrub khang sprul sku) lineage. Today the hall is inhabited by three monks but is not in use for central worship.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Haifa became {{important}} to the Bahá'í Faith when {{the remains of the}} Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of Bahá'u'lláh in the Bahá'í Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Bahá'ís consider the <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bahá'u'lláh himself to his eldest son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, in 1891. `Abdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of `Abdu'l-Bahá were buried in November 1921.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus died on 24 April 624, and {{was buried}} at St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury that same day. He became revered as a saint after his death, and was allotted the feast day of24 April. In the ninth century, Mellitus' feast day was {{mentioned}} in the Stowe Missal, along with Laurence and Justus. He was still venerated at St Augustine's in 1120, along {{with a number of}} other local saints. There was also a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> him at Old St Paul's Cathedral in London. Shortly after the Norman Conquest, Goscelin wrote a life of Mellitus, the first of several to appear around that time, but none contain any information not included in Bede's earlier works. These later medieval lives do, however, reveal that during Goscelin's lifetime persons suffering from gout were urged to pray at Mellitus' tomb. Goscelin records that Mellitus' shrine flanked that of Augustine, along with Laurence, in the eastern central chapel of the presbytery.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, the London {{terminus}} was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable. Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the quarry are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in the quarry for protection, perhaps by the quarry workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
