25|$|The gulls are generalist feeders. Indeed, {{they are}} the least {{specialised}} of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and walking.

The walking gait of gulls includes a slight side to <b>side</b> <b>motion,</b> something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.|$|E
2500|$|The angular {{deflection}} also {{follows a}} simple harmonic motion, which lags behind {{the side to}} <b>side</b> <b>motion</b> by {{a quarter of a}} cycle. In many systems which are characterised by harmonic motion involving two different states (in this case the axle yaw deflection and the lateral displacement), the quarter cycle lag between the two motions endows the system with the ability to extract energy from the forward motion. [...] This effect is observed in [...] "flutter" [...] of aircraft wings and [...] "shimmy" [...] of road vehicles, as well as hunting of railway vehicles.

This <b>side</b> alternating <b>motion</b> {{is supposed to}} mimic human gait in order to utilize nearly physiological motion patterns close to the side alternating human gait. The side alternation causes the hip to tilt which requires the contra lateral muscles of the back to be activated - while one leg is lifted the other drops. Compared to vertically vibrating devices the <b>side</b> alternating <b>motion</b> results in very low acceleration acting on the centre of gravity of the upper body and the head.|$|R

60|$|But this {{difficulty}} {{of changing the}} situation of the sensible parts amongst themselves, or of the figure of the whole, gives no more solidity to the hardest body in the world than to the softest; nor is an adamant one jot more solid than water. For, though the two flat sides of two pieces of marble will more easily approach each other, between which there is nothing but water or air, than if there be a diamond between them; yet it is not that the parts of the diamond are more solid than those of water, or resist more; but because the parts of water, being more easily separable from each other, they will, by a <b>side</b> <b>motion,</b> be more easily removed, and give way to the approach of the two pieces of marble. But if they could be kept from making place by that <b>side</b> <b>motion,</b> they would eternally hinder the approach of these two pieces of marble, as much as the diamond; and it would be as impossible by any force to surmount their resistance, as to surmount the resistance of the parts of a diamond. The softest body in the world will as invincibly resist the coming together of any other two bodies, if it be not put out of the way, but remain between them, as the hardest that can be found or imagined. He that shall fill a yielding soft body well with air or water, will quickly find its resistance. And he that thinks that nothing but bodies that are hard can keep his hands from approaching one another, may be pleased to make a trial, with the air inclosed in a football. The experiment, I have been told, was made at Florence, with a hollow globe of gold filled with water, and exactly closed; which further shows the solidity of so soft a body as water. For the golden globe thus filled, being put into a press, which was driven by the extreme force of screws, the water made itself way through the pores of that very close metal, and finding no room for a nearer approach of its particles within, got to the outside, where it rose like a dew, and so fell in drops, before the sides of the globe could be made to yield to the violent compression of the engine that squeezed it.|$|E

50|$|Varial Flip - Consists {{of doing}} an ollie and then {{flicking}} then leading {{foot in the}} front right of the board which if done right will generate a flipping and spinning motion that will spin the board in a 180 or 360 {{depending on how much}} power was generated from the foot and transferred from the foot and will flip the board also in a <b>side</b> <b>motion</b> that will eventually make and end product of a varial flip.|$|E
50|$|A {{plain bearing}} is simply two {{surfaces}} sliding against each other. Typically, a circular {{step on the}} platform mates snugly with a circular depression in the base allowing free rotation while minimizing side to <b>side</b> <b>motion.</b> A rotary stage built {{with this type of}} bearing is usually only used for coarse positioning and is adjusted manually simply by turning the platform. Index marks on either the base or the platform are often provided, allowing for somewhat repeatable positioning of the platform relative to the base.|$|E

50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to <b>side</b> <b>motion).</b> This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the hisashi is {{reinforcing}} the building's structure against <b>side</b> <b>motion.</b> Japanese traditional architecture {{was based on the}} post and lintel system, which is intrinsically not very strong. To strengthen it, therefore, an extra row of pillars and relative lintels are added, supporting the moya's walls. The hisashi can be present on just one or all four walls, and is counted with the suffix men (surface). A building can for example be said to be a 3 x 3 ken, 4 men butsuden if it is surrounded by a hisashi on all sides.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a set of}} techniques whereby absolute position and velocity of a moving target can be obtained {{with the aid of}} a position controlled visual sensor. We investigate how the sensor trajectory can be optimized to reduce the sensitivity of the target parameter estimates to noise in the measurements. We present a discrete time technique for obtaining the depth and motion of a moving target from target bearing measurements obtained at four viewpoints. We also present a recursive estimation scheme for obtaining the target position and motion parameters from a time-sequence of target bearing measurements. We present a technique for locally optimizing the camera position and orientation by moving the camera in the direction of the gradient of the trace of the estimation error covariance matrix. The algorithm produces trajectories which generally move toward the target with small oscillatory <b>side</b> to <b>side</b> <b>motions</b> superimposed. If we assume a foveal sensor model, the algorithm causes fix [...] ...|$|R
40|$|VT CPMAS NMR {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} {{for a series of}} poly(alkyl L-glutamate) s (PALG) which have n-alkyl side chains with carbon numbers ranging from 2 to 12 in order to investigate the structure and mobility of the main and the side chains. From the temperature dependencies of the peak intensities for the PALGs, the relative mobilities of the main and side chains are discussed. For PG- 2 and PG- 4, the molecular motions of both the main and side chains are not very fast. From the amount ratio between the main and side chains, the main chain dominates the entire mobility of the polymer. As the side chain length increases, the <b>side</b> chain <b>motion</b> is drastically activated by a temperature change. In addition, the main chain motion is induced by the <b>side</b> chain <b>motion.</b> For PALGs with long alkyl side chains, the mobilities of the polymers are governed by the structure and mobility of the side chain...|$|R

5000|$|A jab step, {{also known}} as side step, is {{performed}} when a player holds onto the ball before dribbling while his non-pivot leg performs a jabbing forward or <b>side</b> <b>motion.</b> This move is used to test defender's defensive weaknesses and stance. A combination of the pump fake, the drive, the shot and the crossover drive can be performed along with the jab step to lure the opponent out of his defense. New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony {{is well known for}} taking the jab step, as was 13-year pro Kiki Vandeweghe.

5000|$|Adding {{a trailer}} hook or [...] "stinger" [...] hook (either a single or treble hook) behind the main spinnerbait hook {{is also a}} {{personal}} preference and may ensure a better hookup as well preventing fish that jump from throwing the bait. Some anglers prefer the single hook to be rigged so that the point is down, especially in open-water situations. Others prefer it rigged point-up. In either case the hook must be prevented from coming off the main hook or grabbing weeds. One way to accomplish this is to use rubber or silicone tubing cut to 1/8", inserting {{the eye of the}} trailer hook and forcing the main hook through the tube-covered eye. The trailer hook is now fixed stationary behind the main hook. Another way allows the hook more side to <b>side</b> <b>motion</b> and consists of stops above and below the eye placed on the main hook. These stops can be 1/8-inch cut silicone tubing or disks hole-punched from the plastic lid of a coffee can or wide rubber bands and placed above and below the trailer hook eye encircling the main hook.|$|E
40|$|Background: Since the {{introduction}} of full field digital mammography (FFDM) {{a large number of}} UK breast cancer screening centers have reported blurred images, which can be caused by movement at the compression paddle during image acquisition. Purpose: To propose and investigate the use of position feedback from the breast side of the compression paddle to reduce the settling time of breast <b>side</b> <b>motion.</b> Method: Movement at the breast side of the paddle was measured using two calibrated linear potentiometers. A mathematical model for the compression paddle, machine drive and breast was developed using the paddle movement data. Simulation software was used to optimize the position feedback controller parameters for different machine drive time constants and simulate the potential performance of the proposed system. Results: The results obtained are based on simulation alone and indicate that closed-loop control of breast side paddle position dramatically reduced the settling time from over 90 seconds to less than 4 seconds. The effect of different machine drive time constants on the open-loop response is insignificant. With closed-loop control, the larger the time constant the longer the time required for the breast <b>side</b> <b>motion</b> to settle. Conclusions: Paddle motion induced blur could be significantly reduced by implementing the proposed closed-loop control...|$|E
