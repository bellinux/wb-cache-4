5|$|The enzymes trypsin and {{chymotrypsin}} {{were first}} purified in the 1930s. A serine {{in each of}} trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing {{the orientation of the}} catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and <b>subtilisin</b> proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s. Of particular contention during the 1990s and early 2000s was the contribution of low-barrier hydrogen bonding to catalysis; however, current thinking is that ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.|$|E

500|$|On December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards {{performed}} a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's {{view of the}} physical nature of protein molecules. Using a particular protease (<b>Subtilisin),</b> RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (...) [...] Richards had developed that cleavage system as a postdoc at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers. Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube. In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that [...] "this discovery {{came as a surprise}} to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement." [...] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information is inherent in the protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins, a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships. [...] Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.|$|E

40|$|The convertases are a {{recently}} discovered family of mammalian serine proteases related in structure to the bacterial <b>subtilisins</b> {{and to the}} yeast enzyme kexin. These proteases share with the <b>subtilisins</b> the presence within their protein structure of a signal peptide, a prosegment, and a conserved catalytic region. However, they also possess additional P and COOH-terminal domains, which are not observed in <b>subtilisins,</b> but are present in their eucaryotic yeast counterpart, kexin. While {{the function of the}} P domain has been investigated, that of the COOH-terminal domain, excepting transmembrane and cytosolic tail structures of some convertases, remains unresolved. In the present manuscript, the convertases' COOH-terminal domain function was investigated through the studies of two models of multiple convertase isoforms. These isoforms, which arise through differential splicing, are structurally identical, except within their COOH-terminal region. Studies by protein overexpression in cultured mammalian cells of multiple Drosophila furin isoforms and analysis of the cleavage products generated by these enzymes in coexpression with different substrates permitted to demonstrate that structural modifications of the COOH-terminal domain do not affect the cleavage specificity of the adjoined protease. However, particular COOH-terminal assemblages may affect the processing efficiency displayed by these enzymes. Further cellular localization studies by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of two PC 5 isoforms demonstrated that specific structural motives present in the COOH-terminal domain of these proteins are indeed implicated in the subcellular localization of these endoproteases, a fact which may ultimately affect their cleavage efficiency and substrate selectivity. In conclusion, in some convertases' COOH-terminal domains, distinctive structural motives are involved in the sorting of these endoproteases to the appropriate subcellular compartment(s), and likely influence the trafficking of these proteins through the secretory pathway...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular Bacillus proteases {{are used}} as {{additives}} in detergent powders. We identified a Bacillus strain that produces a protease with an extremely alkaline pH optimum; this protease is suitable for use in modern alkaline detergent powders. The alkalophilic strain Bacillus alcalophilus PB 92 gene encoding this high-alkaline serine protease was cloned and characterized. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 380 amino acids composed of a signal peptide (27 amino acids), a prosequence (84 amino acids), and a mature protein of 269 amino acids. Amino acid comparison with other serine proteases shows good homology with protease YaB, which is also produced by an alkalophilic Bacillus strain. Both show moderate homology with <b>subtilisins</b> but show some remarkable differences from <b>subtilisins</b> produced by neutrophilic bacilli. The prosequence of PB 92 protease has no significant homology with prosequences of <b>subtilisins.</b> The abundance of negatively charged residues in the prosequences of PB 92 protease is especially remarkable. The cloned gene was used to increase the production level of the protease. For this purpose the strategy of gene amplification in the original alkalophilic Bacillus strain was chosen. When introduced on a multicopy plasmid, the recombinant strain was unstable; under production conditions, plasmid segregation occurred. More stable ways of gene amplification were obtained by chromosomal integration. This was achieved by (i) homologous recombination, resulting in a strain with two tandemly arranged genes, and (ii) illegitimate recombination, resulting in a strain with a second copy of the protease gene on a locus not adjacent to the originally present gene. Both strains showed increased production and were more stable than the plasmid-containing strain. Absolute stability was only found when nontandem duplication occurred. This method of gene amplification circumvents stability problems often encountered in gene amplification in Bacillus species when plasmids or tandemly arranged genes in the chromosome are used...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} human {{erythrocyte}} invasion by Plasmodium falciparum parasites involves a calcium-dependent serine protease with properties {{consistent with a}} subtilisin-like activity. This enzyme achieves the last crucial maturation step of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP 1) necessary for parasite entry into the host erythrocyte. In eukaryotic cells, such processing steps are performed by subtilisin-like maturases, known as proprotein convertases. In an attempt to characterize the MSP 1 maturase, we have identified a gene that encodes a P. falciparum subtilisin-like protease (PfSUB 2) whose deduced active site sequence resembles more bacterial <b>subtilisins.</b> Therefore, we propose that PfSUB 2 belongs to a subclass of eukaryotic <b>subtilisins</b> different from proprotein convertases. Pfsub 2 is expressed during merozoite differentiation and encodes an integral membrane protein localized in the merozoite dense granules, a secretory organelle whose contents are believed {{to participate in a}} late step of the erythrocyte invasion.

New proteases with improved performance at extreme temperatures and {{in the presence of}} chemical additives may have great economical potential. The increasing availability of genetic sequences from different environments makes homology-based screening an attractive strategy for discovery of new proteases. A prerequisite for large-scale screening of protease-encoding sequences is an efficient screening procedure. We have developed and implemented a screening procedure that encompasses cloning of candidate sequences into multiple expression vectors, cytoplasmic expression in E. coli, and a casein-based functional screen. The procedure is plate-format compatible and can be completed in only four days, starting from the gene of interest in a suitable cloning vector. The expression vector suite includes six vectors with combinations of maltose-binding protein (MBP) or the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) for increased solubility, and polyhistidine tags for downstream purification. We used enhanced green fluorescent protein and four Bacilli <b>subtilisins</b> to validate the screening procedure and our results show that proteins were expressed, soluble and active. Interestingly, the highest activities were consistently achieved with either MBP or SUMO fusions, thus demonstrating the merit of including solubility tags. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that our approach can be used to efficiently screen for new <b>subtilisins,</b> and suggest that the approach may also be used to screen for proteins with other activities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Exported proteases are {{commonly}} associated with virulence in bacterial pathogens, {{yet there is a}} paucity of information regarding their role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There are five genes (mycP 1 - 5) present within the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv that encode a family of secreted, subtilisin-like serine proteases (the mycosins). The gene mycP 1 (encoding mycosin- 1) was found to be situated 3700 bp (four ORF's) from the RD 1 deletion region in the genome of the attenuated vaccine strain M. bovis BCG (bacille de Calmette et Guérin) and was selected for further analyses due to the absence of expression in this organism. Results Full-length, 50 kDa mycosin- 1 was observed in M. tuberculosis cellular lysates, whereas lower-molecular-weight species were detected in culture filtrates. A similar lower-molecular-weight species was also observed during growth in macrophages. Mycosin- 1 was localized to the membrane and cell wall fractions in M. tuberculosis by Western blotting, and to the cell envelope by electron microscopy. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis culture filtrates were shown to contain a proteolytic activity inhibited by mixed serine/cysteine protease inhibitors and activated by Ca 2 +, features typical of the <b>subtilisins.</b> Conclusions Mycosin- 1 is an extracellular protein that is membrane- and cell wall-associated, and is shed into the culture supernatant.

40|$|Microsporum canis is a {{pathogenic}} fungus {{that causes}} a superficial skin infection called dermatophytosis mainly in cats, dogs and humans. Like other dermatophytoses, the physiopathology of this dermatosis remains largely unknown. From a fungal perspective, the infection {{process can be}} divided in three steps: adhesion of M. canis arthroconidia to corneocytes, conidial germination, and fungal invasion of the keratin network. The mechanisms involved in adherence of M. canis to epidermis have never been investigated. However, several previously characterized secreted fungal endoproteases like <b>subtilisins</b> (Sub), including the keratinolytic protease Sub 3, are secreted in vivo and could {{be involved in the}} first pathogenic steps. The objective of this study were (1) to develop an in vitro model to study M. canis adherence to feline corneocytes and (2) to assess whether the Sub are involved in fungal adhesion. An arthroconidial suspension was spread over the surface of reconstituted feline epidermis (RFE). Co-cultures were incubated for varying lengths of time and adherent conidia were labelled using Calcofluor white and counted. In subsequent assays arthroconidia were exposed to the serine protease inhibitor chymostatin or a mixture of two anti-Sub 3 monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) one hour prior to the adherence assay. In our model, adherence of M. canis arthroconidia to RFE is time-dependent, beginning within two hours and still increasing after six hours.
