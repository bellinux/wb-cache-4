25|$|<b>Slacklining</b> {{refers to}} the act of walking or {{balancing}} along a suspended length of flat webbing that is tensioned between two anchors. <b>Slacklining</b> is similar to slack rope walking and tightrope walking. <b>Slacklines</b> differ from tightwires and tightropes {{in the type of}} material used and the amount of tension applied during use. <b>Slacklines</b> are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires {{in order to create a}} dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. <b>Slacklining</b> is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.|$|R

40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>slacklining</b> as a supplementary therapy for elderly stroke patients who are functionally non-progressing. This case study involved an 18 -mo prospective observation of the management of an 87 -year-old female stroke-patient of the left hemisphere with reduced balance, reduced lower limb muscular activation, hypertonia, and concurrent postural deficits. This entailed the initial acute care phase through to discharge to home and 18 -mo final status in her original independent living setting. The introduction of <b>slacklining</b> as an adjunct therapy was made 12 mo post incident. <b>Slacklining</b> involves balance retention on a tightened band where external environmental changes cause a whole-body dynamic response to retain equilibrium. It is a complex neuromechanical task enabling individualized self-developed response strategies to be learned and adapted. This facilitates the innate process of balance retention, lower-limb and core muscle activation, and stable posture {{through a combination of}} learned motor skills and neurological system down regulation. Individuals adopt and follow established sequential motor learning stages where the acquired balance skills are achieved in a challenging composite-chain activity. <b>Slacklining</b> could be considered an adjunct therapy for lower limb stroke rehabilitation where function is compromised due to decreased muscle recruitment, decreased postural control and compromised balance. Initial inpatient rehabilitation involved one-month acute-care, one-month rehabilitation, and one-month transitional care prior to home discharge. A further six months of intensive outpatient rehabilitation was provided with five hourly sessions per week including:supervised and self-managed hydrotherapy, plus one individual and two group falls 2 ̆ 7 prevention sessions. These were supported by daily home exercises. At 12 mo post incident, recovery plateaued, then regressed following three falls. Rehabilitation was subsequently modified with the hydrotherapy retained and the group sessions replaced with an additional individual session supplemented with <b>slacklining.</b> The <b>slacklining</b> followed stages one and two of a standardized five-stage protocol. Self-reported functional progression resumed with improvement by 14 mo which further increased and was sustained 18 mo (Students 2 ̆ 7 t test P 3 ̆c 0. 05). <b>Slacklining</b> 2 ̆ 7 s external stimulations activate global-body responses through innate balance, optimal postural and potentially down-regulated reflex control. Incorporated into stroke rehabilitation programs, <b>slacklining</b> can provide measurable functional gains...|$|R

25|$|One type of urbanlining is timelining, {{where one}} tries {{to stay on}} a <b>slackline</b> {{for as long as}} {{possible}} without falling down. This takes tremendous concentration and focus of will, and is a great endurance training for postural muscles.|$|E
25|$|Waterlining is slacklining over water. This is {{an ideal}} way to learn new tricks, or to just have more fun. Common places to set up waterlines are over pools, lakes, rivers, creeks, between pier or {{railroad}} track pillars, and boat docks. The <b>slackline</b> {{can be set up}} high over the surface of the water, close to the surface or even underneath the surface. It is important, however, that the water be deep enough, free from obstacles, and that the area should not be travelled by boats.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns from}} Outward Bound manager training—where {{he became more}} [...] "decisive and confident"—hoping for revenge on Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for commandeering his job during the {{previous}} spring. To do this, Andy sets up a <b>slackline</b> {{in the parking lot}} and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the affect of <b>slacklining</b> on core {{strength}} and balance in college age students. Subjects consisted of students enrolled in two activity classes at a Midwest Division III university campus. Students enrolled in the circus arts class formed the experimental group, which consisted of a four-week <b>slacklining</b> treatment; and students in the indoor rock climbing class acted as the control group and did no <b>slacklining</b> during the training period. The researchers administered core strength and balance tests on both groups before and after the four-week training protocol using the Biering-Sorenson (BST), right and left lateral bridge (RLB and LLB), trunk flexor (TF) test and the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Upon examining the results of a MANOVA and a repeated measures ANOVA test, there are no significant differences between the experimental and control groups with regard to mean core strength at a 5 % level of significance (p= 0. 140). However repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in the normalized mean balance scores between the experimental and control group at a 5 % level of significance (p= 0. 004).

2500|$|Tricklining {{has become}} {{the most common form of}} slacklining because of the easy setup of [...] <b>slackline</b> kits. Tricklining is often done low to the ground but can be done on highlines as well. A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and because the sport is fairly new, there is plenty of room for new tricks. Some of the basic tricks done today are walking, walking backwards, turns, drop knee, running and jumping onto the <b>slackline</b> to start walking, and bounce walking. Some {{intermediate}} tricks include: Buddha sit, sitting down, lying down, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or [...] "180s." [...] Some of the advanced tricks are: jumps, tree plants, jumping from line-to-line, 360s, butt bounces, and chest bounces. With advancements in webbing technology & tensioning systems, the limits for what can be done on a <b>slackline</b> are being pushed constantly. It is not uncommon to see expert slackliners incorporating flips and twists into <b>slackline</b> trick combinations.|$|E

2500|$|A special {{characteristic}} of slacklining is {{the ease with}} which the dynamics of the practice can be altered. Using narrow (...) webbing will result in a stretchier <b>slackline.</b> This allows for more sway in the line and can make a short line feel substantially longer. Wider webbing (...) is much more rigid, often creating a bouncier <b>slackline</b> optimal for aerial tricks. The tension of the line will also increase or decrease the sway of the line. Weight due to the different methods of tensioning will also vary the performance of a <b>slackline.</b> A comealong and a ratchet will both add enough weight to allow the feedback from quick movements on shorter slacklines to be felt.|$|E
2500|$|Freestyle slacklining (a.k.a. “rodeo slacklining") {{is the art}} and {{practice}} of cultivating balance {{on a piece of}} rope or webbing draped slack between two anchor points, typically about [...] apart and [...] off the ground in the center. This type of very [...] "slack" [...] <b>slackline</b> provides a wide array of opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A freestyle <b>slackline</b> has no tension in it, while both traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This slackness in the rope or webbing allows it to swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into popularity in 1999, through a group of students from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. It was first written about on a website called the [...] "Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo <b>Slackline</b> Research" [...] in 2004.

Also see the other sections of <b>slackline</b> styles below.|$|E
2500|$|Highlining is slacklining at {{elevation}} {{above the}} ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations {{that have been used}} or are still used for Tyrolean traverse. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either climbing rope or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is low tension (less than [...] ), or rigged with high quality webbing like [...] or [...] It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which might come in contact with abrasive surfaces.
