50|$|Because the toroid is a {{closed-loop}} core it {{will have}} a higher magnetic field and thus higher inductance and Q factor than an inductor of the same value with a straight core (<b>solenoid</b> <b>coils).</b> This is because most of the magnetic field is contained within the core.

5000|$|It {{is worth}} noting here that the {{refrigerator}} cost in all cases is so small that {{there is very little}} percentage savings associated with reduced refrigeration demands at high temperature. This means that if a HTSC, BSCCO for instance, works better at a low temperature, say 20K, it will certainly be operated there. For very small SMES, the reduced refrigerator cost will have a more significant positive impact. [...] Clearly, the volume of superconducting coils increases with the stored energy. Also, we can see that the LTSC torus maximum diameter is always smaller for a HTSC magnet than LTSC due to higher magnetic field operation. In the case of <b>solenoid</b> <b>coils,</b> the height or length is also smaller for HTSC coils, but still much higher than in a toroidal geometry (due to low external magnetic field).|$|E

50|$|Is the {{classical}} geometry {{to create a}} magnetic field with an electric current. Even for {{a limited number of}} windings this geometry provides a reasonable homogeneous B1 field and a good filling factor is possible by winding the coil directly onto a holder containing the sample. Miniaturization to a scale of several hundred micrometers (µm) is not very difficult although the wire diameter (typically 20 to 50 µm) becomes very small and a freestanding coil is a very delicate object.A reduction to below 100 µm diameter is possible but the machining and handling of such coils will be rather tedious. For this reason other microsystem fabrication technology such as bulk micromachining, LIGA and micro-injection molding should be applied.For <b>solenoid</b> <b>coils</b> adding more turns to the coil will enhance the B1/i ratio and thus both the inductance and the signal response. At the same time the coil resistance will increase linearly, so the improvement in sensitivity will be proportional to the square root of the number of turns (n).
