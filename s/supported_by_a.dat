5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado.

The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E
