40|$|The {{stability}} of embankment over soft soil {{is influenced by}} several factors such as subsoil and filling material properties, embankment geometry, ground water level and working load. This paper will present the analysis of influencing of soft soil thickness and embankment geometry to the {{stability of}} embankment. The analysis will be conducted using Slope/W by varying the thickness of soft soil and embankment geometry with certain embankment height and soft soil and fill material properties. The thickness of soft soil is varies in range of 2 m to 15 m, whereas the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> is varies in 4 condition i. e. 1 : 1 (vertical : horizontal), 1 : 1. 5, 1 : 2, and 1 : 2. 5, {{as well as the}} top width of embankment from 10 m to 40 m, with the output is factor of safety of embankment.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyze the {{characteristic}} of lateral displacement of soft soil foundation under embankment, a typical embankment is studied systemically with nonlinear finite element method, {{and the location of}} maximal lateral displacement and its measuring method is also discussed. It is pointed that lateral displacement would be reduced possibly at consolidation stage with strong dry crust and thick soft soil layer, which happened synchronously with vertical settlement increased rapidly. This phenomena could not be measured conveniently with inclinometer pipe, for there are many shortcomings within this technique, although which has been used in engineering widely. It is also shown that the location of the maximal lateral displacement is changeable at different construction stages, which more likely lies in the vertical surface between the toe and the middle of <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>embankment.</b> In order to get the maximal lateral displacement reasonably, it is suggested that the inclinometer pipes should be placed in that area of embankment...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of exterior deformation {{is one of}} the most important measuring items for safety management <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> dams. By using targets installed on the crest and <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> dams, their exterior deformation has been measured by conventional surveying methods. According to the Japanese dam safety management standard, the measurement frequency of exterior deformation <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> dams is set as once a week at the period of the first filling of reservoir, that is, the first term of dam management, and once every three months in the third term that is the final management stage when behavior of the dam and its foundation come to be stable. But, because the surveying work is relatively time consuming one, rapidly responding after a large earthquake or in other emergencies is a big challenge. The global positioning system (GPS) is a system that can perform surveys quickly in relatively low cost. GPS is a weather-proof positioning system using satellites that is well known for its role in car navigation and in surveying applications. The results of our previous research made it clear that we should investigate how to install GPS sensors on the crest in order to fully introduce GPS sensors as the method of measuring exterior deformation <b>of</b> <b>embankment</b> dams.

These aeration systems are modifications of standard wastewater aeration equipment. Aeration-performance testing has been important in selecting design features to provide cost-effective yet efficient aquaculture pond aerators.

Amounts of aeration vary from as little as 1 – 2 kW ha− 1 in some types of fish culture {{to as much as}} 15 or 20 kW ha− 1 in intensive culture of marine shrimp.

40|$|The {{structures}} {{constructed on}} unsaturated soils are {{damaged by the}} movement of the soil underneath. The movement is basically due to the flow of moisture {{in and out of the}} soil. This change in moisture also affects the strength of the soil, thus resulting in failure <b>of</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>embankments</b> constructed with these soils. Therefore, it is very important to study the diffusion properties of unsaturated soils. Study of the diffusion properties requires the determination of the diffusion coefficient (/). In this thesis improvements in the drying test, originally proposed by Mitchell (1979), have been discussed. The study also involves defining the evaporation coefficient (he) which has been ill-defined in previous research work. The flow through unsaturated soils is non-linear but due to the complexity involved it has been simplified to a linear problem. The nonlinear behavior has been studied during this research. Therefore, certain refinements have been applied in the determination of the diffusion coefficient. The laboratory procedure followed involves measuring the soil suction along the length of the sample and at different times using thermocouple psychrometers.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies on dam breaching that {{have been carried out}} for a long time, but this area still needs further investigation. Dams which have failed due to breach mechanism have caused disastrous effects to the downstream area, such as loss of lives, property damages, economic and environmental damages. This is due to the complex process of breaching which involves many factors such as cohesiveness <b>of</b> the <b>embankment</b> material, the height of the dam and the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embankment</b> dam. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the breach patterns and breach grows when breaching takes place. Besides, this study is also focused on the breach hydrograph that is produced after the failure <b>of</b> <b>embankment.</b> The <b>embankment</b> dam <b>of</b> 0. 1 m was tested in 11 m length and 0. 6 m width channel. The equation used to measure the outflow discharge was Q = 8 / 15 (Cd) (2 g) 0. 5 tan (θ/ 2) (h) 2. 5. Different embankment parameters were considered, i. e. the embankment materials (coarse and medium sand), the inflow rates (Q 1 = 0. 6 m 3 /s, Q 2 = 0. 9 m 3 /s and Q 3 = 1. 2 m 3 /s) and the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embankment</b> dam (1 V: 2 H and 1 V: 3 H). Most <b>of</b> the <b>embankment</b> dam tested showed that vertical erosion occurred first until a certain point before lateral action took place. Higher inflow rate produced higher peak outflow and shorter peak time. Besides, higher inflow rate flushed away all the embankment materials towards downstream and formed a wedge shape at the end of the process, as observed from the side view. For different embankment slopes used, the flatter slopes prolonged the erosion process about 7. 7 % and also reduced the peak outflow value of about 15. 8 %. Different grain sizes of soil were also used in the tests and it proved that the smaller grain size of soil reduced the peak outflow value (6. 5 %) and prolonged the peak time about 13. 3 %.

40|$|The {{reported}} incidences of shallow failures on the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> highway earthworks {{have increased}} in recent years. This Thesis includes {{a study of the}} extent of this problem, the likely factors contributing to failure, and presents the results of empirical design and the analysis of the likely mechanism of failure. A survey was conducted, covering a total length of 570 km of selected lengths of motorway in England and Wales, which included the principal geologies encountered on the British motorway system, in particular, areas where over-consolidated clays predominate. From the survey, the basic factors that have contributed to shallow failures on the side <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>embankments</b> and cuttings can be deduced, and attempts are made to quantify any long-term problems. The results show a high incidence of failure associated with the major influences of geology, age of earthworks and geometry <b>of</b> <b>slope,</b> with many more failures occurring on embankments than on cuttings. The slope angles recommended are empirically derived and can be used both in the design of new earthwork side slopes and to identify <b>slopes</b> at risk <b>of</b> failure in existing earthworks. An estimate is made of the extent of failures in the future which suggests that three times as many slopes are likely to fail than have failed so far. To study the mechanisms of failure and the behaviour of over- consolidated clays at extremely low effective stresses, an analytical method is developed which includes a detailed study of non-linear failure envelopes and the fitting of the most representative curve to peak strength data. Also a new rigorous slope stability analysis method is developed which incorporates this type of failure envelope. Back-analyses are conducted for several embankment slopes from which samples have been tested in the laboratory. Results indicate that the critical state strength rather than the peak strength governs the formation of shallow failures...|$|R

As an illustrative outcome, a reinforced grass revetments showed a high score and therefore this system seems to be adoptable as a feasible system for strengthening of the crest and inner <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> overtopped defences. Other types of protection systems have been presented as well and are briefly indicated in the Fact Sheets attached to this report. Prior to further elaboration of the most appropriate strengthening systems in subsequent phases of WP 3, the development of an overall judgement framework is recommended as a follow-up of the present methodology. This framework should not be limited to the stability of the protection system only, but should also include other failure mechanisms for overtopped embankments, with special emphasis on critical soil mechanical failure mechanisms.
