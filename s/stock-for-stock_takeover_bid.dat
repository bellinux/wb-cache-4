40|$|Takeovers play an {{important}} role in the economy as they serve to reallocate economic resources to more efficient uses and replace inefficient management. Unregulated <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> pose a threat to the interests of the target company shareholders. The legislature pays special attention to <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> to make sure that the bona fide interests of the target company shareholders are duly protected. This is the primary purpose of the <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> regulation in Ontario. The regulation is also aimed at ensuring the horizontal equity among target shareholders and the efficient functioning of the capital market. This thesis analyzes the present regulation of <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> in Ontario and argues that while the whole system of <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> regulation is consistent with the proclaimed purposes, there are two issues that fall out of the coherent structure. The restriction on free transferability of shares and the adoption by boards of directors of shareholder rights plans do not enhance the protection of target company shareholders and do not correspond to the proclaimed purposes...|$|R

40|$|Using the Delaware Supreme Court's Time-Warner {{decision}} of July 1989 as a focal point, we study defeated <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> {{before and after}} July 1989 to assess the direct effects of stronger takeover impediments on takeover defense tactics used to defeat bids and the resulting shareholder wealth outcomes and managerial turnover. We find that firms that defeated <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> after July 1989 shifted away {{from the use of}} active takeover defenses (repurchases, special dividends, greenmail, and leverage increases). Nevertheless, shareholders of firms that defeat a takeover experienced slightly better wealth outcomes in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s. We also find increased managerial turnover rates after defeating a <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> post Time-Warner, suggesting that managers that defeat hostile <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> did not become more entrenched due to greater takeover impediments relative to prior years.
