25|$|Normally the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{connected}} to the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The {{more complex}} double {{differential}} system {{is similar to}} the controlled differential in basic concept, in that it controls the speed of the tracks by controlling the rotation of the idlers. However, in this case two complete differentials are used, one for each track, and the idlers are controlled not by a brake, but a second power shaft, the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} fully regenerative, {{all of the}} engine's power reaches the track either through the main {{driveshaft}} or the steering system, none of the energy is being lost to brakes or clutches. Additionally, since power is fed around the transmission to the steering system, in some designs the tank can be turned even when the main gearbox is not engaged. The limitation on this feature is {{the strength of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>shaft,</b> which has to be strong enough to move the tank if this feature is desired, but otherwise can be made lighter if this is not needed.|$|E

30|$|In this study, a novel step {{climbing}} {{method for}} a five-wheeled wheelchair, {{composed of a}} manual wheelchair and an active-caster drive system, has been proposed. Because the active-caster has the same configuration as a passive caster, an arbitrary velocity can be generated by controlling its wheel and <b>steering</b> <b>shafts.</b> Thus, {{the motion of the}} proposed wheelchair can be controlled in 2 DOF (two degrees of freedom) despite the single-wheel drive system. Moreover, by changing the number of points of contact between the wheelchair and the ground using a linear actuator, two types of motion can be accomplished, similar to front and rear drive modes.|$|R
25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the steering clutches {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft,</b> compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|E
25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} Minicars, the Mark C was improved and developed over time with numerous minor changes. Most notably, Villiers replaced the 6E engine with the 8E version in June 1953. This {{had the same}} overall capacity, but slightly increased performance, now [...] In October 1953 a new Triplex windscreen and surround was introduced, the dashboard glove box was removed, a two-roll seat replaced the earlier round top variety and the old gearchange and <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> u/j's were eliminated. Steel was sometimes used for rear wings when supplies of aluminium became difficult to obtain. The following October's updates redesigned the braking system, introduced rear bumpers on the Tourer models and front bumpers for all Deluxes. Several more minor changes in October 1955 were marked by a much more notable change {{to the shape of}} the front grille from the familiar oval to a more angular design (designated Type II).|$|E
50|$|Continued {{expansion}} in the steering product market followed with the introduction in 1995 of the Pailton Mitre box or Bevel box, a device to allow 90 degree changes in direction of the <b>steering</b> input <b>shaft</b> with low backlash and no universal joint phasing allowing the steering box to be positioned in a place more favourable to the steering gear for actuation, while still placing the steering column {{in the best position}} for the driver.|$|R
5000|$|The joint {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} doughnut shaped rubber with reinforcing cords vulcanized in it, similar to a tire. This disc is bolted or riveted to flanges mounted on the ends of the shafts to connect the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>shaft</b> to the <b>steering</b> gear. The ragged cords can be seen on the edge of this piece of rubber, hence the term [...] "rag joint". The bolt holes themselves are often reinforced by steel tubes moulded into the doughnut.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist {{grip on the}} handlebars which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for <b>steering</b> linkage <b>shafts</b> that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the twist grip or gear linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|R
2500|$|In response, Stewart campaigned with Louis Stanley (BRM team boss) for {{improved}} emergency services and better safety barriers around race tracks. [...] "We were racing at circuits {{where there were}} no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous." [...] As a stop-gap measure, Stewart hired a private doctor to be at all his races, and taped a spanner to the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> of his BRM in case it would be needed again. Stewart pressed for mandatory seat belt usage and full-face helmets for drivers, which have become unthinkable omissions for modern races. Likewise, he pressed track owners to modernize their tracks, including organizing driver boycotts of races at Spa-Francorchamps in 1969, the Nürburgring in 1970, and Zandvoort in 1972 until barriers, run-off areas, fire crews, and medical facilities were improved.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with these}} chassis refinements, Sport package {{equipped}} models came with firmer rear shocks, bigger front brake calipers, and larger [...] rotors all around (up from 12.6/12.1-inch front/rear). Sport package equipped cars {{also get a}} viscous limited slip differential. An all-new Active Steering package can be ordered for sport package equipped models. It features a planetary gearset on the <b>steering</b> <b>shaft</b> (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. A rear-wheel steering system that induces up to one degree of rear steer is also included in this package. The Active Steering package includes even stiffer shocks than the sport package at all four corners and the ride has been repeatedly reported as being too stiff for most customers except the most [...] "enthusiastic" [...] drivers.

40|$|Cyclic {{stick-slip}} friction is {{a well-known}} phenomenon in which the relative motion between two parts involved is intermittent. The relative motion due to external excitation, support compliance of the parts in contact, {{and the difference between}} the static and kinetic friction coefficients contribute to this cyclic stick-slip motion. This paper presents a study on how various vehicle parameters affect the stick-slip vibration in the slider joint between <b>steering</b> intermediate <b>shafts.</b> The vibration was simulated using a full vehicle ADAMS model for a maneuver where the vehicle is braking while negotiating a sharp corner. The steering subsystem, which was elaborated in ADAMS/PRE templates for this particular issue, consists of the steering wheel, the steering column, the pinion input shafts, the upper and lower intermediate shafts. The cornering and braking event generates the relative velocity and the torque between the intermediate shafts, which are the most important contributing factors leading to the cyclic friction. The simulation was able to duplicate the stick-slip vibration observed in road tests...|$|R

500|$|Around 4:00, Indefatigable was hit {{around the}} rear turret {{by two or}} three shells from Von der Tann.

Her magazines exploded at 4:03 after more hits, one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret. Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part {{of the ship and}} large pieces were thrown [...] into the air. The most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the <b>steering</b> control <b>shafts,</b> followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. Von der Tann fired only fifty-two [...] shells at Indefatigable before she exploded. Of her crew of 1,019, only three survived. While still in the water, two survivors found Indefatigable's captain, C. F. Sowerby, who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued.

5|$|The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 prototype, which {{rolled out}} of the factory door on 1 August 1945. After a short and {{intensive}} testing period, serial production began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage of materials and component quality problems, the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946. The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes, <b>steering</b> components, drive <b>shafts</b> and electrical systems until domestic companies could {{set up their own}} production. The Finnish suppliers were unable to meet the requirements with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems. Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far below the target of 2,000 vehicles.

40|$|Unmanned ground {{vehicles}} {{have significant}} {{role to play}} in the fields of military, space exploration, accessing dangerous terrain, operating in hazardous industries and process stations. Control of the heading of the vehicle is critical to its safety and stability. Modelling the parameters and process is critical to developing a control strategy for it. There are multiple factors that are responsible for the heading of the vehicle which can lead to a complicated process model. However, the model has been simplified by suitable approximations. The objective of this research is to control the heading of a vehicle in the real world environment under the unpredictable and unstructured surroundings. The change of heading direction and the speed of the vehicle influence to the motion of a vehicle. The vehicle model that was assumed was a four wheeled electric motor driven car, whose steering system is modified to be controlled by a DC servo motor mounted at the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>shaft,</b> and is fitted with a compass sensor to measure the current heading direction of the vehicle. Various control strategies were simulated in Simulink to converge at the most appropriate one.

5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies.

There were two saloon models in the range, the basic [...] "Safety" [...] model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no opening front quarterlights, and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening quarterlights, extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half <b>shafts,</b> <b>steering</b> box, and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.|$|R
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the <b>steering</b> gear output <b>shaft</b> which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
