5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} the T48 along the Eastern Front, mainly in Operation Bagration. The Soviet 16th Separate Tank Destroyer Brigade used {{a large number}} of T48s in 1943 during the offensive across the Dnieper River, and with the 19th Brigade during the Baranow bridgehead battle in August 1944. The T48 also served with the Soviet 22nd <b>Self-Propelled</b> <b>Artillery</b> Brigade. Some of these units also took part in the Berlin and Prague offensives. The Polish People's Army used T48s assigned to the 7th <b>Self-Propelled</b> <b>Artillery</b> Battery to support Soviet attacks into Germany and Poland.|$|E
5|$|After a {{stubborn}} defence, {{in which a}} number of Commandos, including Pooley, were killed, they took the battery, however, shortly afterwards they were counterattacked by German force supported by <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery.</b> Casualties during this attack were high and eventually the Commandos were forced to withdraw back to La Plein.|$|E
5|$|The Panzerbeobachtungswagen IV (Pz.Beob.Wg.IV) was an {{artillery}} observation vehicle {{built on the}} Panzer IV chassis. This, too, received new radio equipment and an electrical generator, installed in the left rear corner of the fighting compartment.

5|$|Holt also {{produced}} a 75mm self-propelled gun that could travel at , exceeding the military requirement of , and climb a 45-degree slope. Before the work could be completed, the Armistice was signed {{and the war}} ended. <b>Self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> however did not garner attention again {{until the end of}} the 1930s, just before World War II.|$|E
5|$|The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage (MMC) was a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> mount on a {{half-track}} chassis {{used by the}} United States Army during World War II. It {{was equipped}} with an 81mm M1 mortar and an air-cooled M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced.|$|E
5|$|From {{within the}} pocket, German {{formations}} seeking an escape route were filtering through {{gaps in the}} Allied lines between Trun and Chambois, heading towards the ridge from the west. The Poles could see the road from Chambois choked with troops and vehicles attempting to pass along the Dives valley. A number of columns moving down from the northeast that included tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> were subjected to an hour-long bombardment from the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron, breaking them up and scattering their infantry.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, the 395th Guards Heavy <b>Self-Propelled</b> <b>Artillery</b> Regiment was {{transferred}} to the Far East for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, an urgent need for <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> arose. Although a full-track chassis was preferred, the {{situation}} required the use of whatever vehicles were immediately available. The M3 Half-track was selected to carry a 105mm M2A1 howitzer. Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the urgency of the requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E
5|$|The M3 Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) was a United States Army tank {{destroyer}} {{equipped with}} one 75mm gun and {{was produced by}} Autocar. After the fall of France, the U.S. Army {{decided to make a}} <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> piece from the M1897A4 gun on the M3 chassis, which was designated the T12. After some improvement, it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage. However, the supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient for production needs, so a new gun shield was used. This was designated the M3A1 GMC.|$|E

5|$|Mortar and {{artillery}} exchange between the South Ossetian and Georgian forces {{erupted in the}} afternoon of 6 August along almost the entire line of contact, which lasted until the dawn of 7 August. Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity announced that {{the armed forces of}} South Ossetia were ready to go on the offensive in the next few hours. At 14:00 on 7 August, two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122mm howitzers and 203mm <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. During the afternoon, OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori. In the afternoon, Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali.|$|E
5|$|Snetkov {{fought in}} World War II as a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> officer {{and during the}} Cold War rose to command positions. He {{commanded}} the 1st Guards Tank Army and served as first deputy commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany during the 1970s. Snetkov led the Siberian Military District and the Leningrad Military District in the 1980s and in 1987 became commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG), which in 1989 became the Western Group of Forces as the Cold War wound down. Snetkov was removed from command of the group in December 1990 and transferred to the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, before retiring in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, his {{regiment}} {{was withdrawn}} from the front and converted into the 395th Guards Heavy <b>Self-Propelled</b> <b>Artillery</b> Regiment. It was also reequipped with the updated ISU-152 self-propelled gun, one of which Snetkov became commander of. Snetkov and his regiment {{did not return to}} the front until June 1944, where they became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. He was promoted to lieutenant around this time, and from late June, he fought in Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive that recaptured Belarus and eastern Poland. Between 22 and 27 June, during fighting in the Bogushevsk area, Snetkov's crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a self-propelled gun, two bunkers, and two anti-tank guns. For this he received a second Order of the Red Star on 10 July. The regiment, as part of the front, fought in the Baltic Offensive and the Gumbinnen Operation during the fall.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Baltic Front {{launched}} an artillery barrage at {{the positions of}} the 2nd Battalion, 45 Waffen SS Grenadier Regiment (1st Estonian) covering the German right flank in the village of Nõo southeast of Tartu on 23 August. The Soviet 282nd Rifle Division backed by the 16th Single Tank Brigade and two <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> regiments bypassed the defence on the west side and captured the Kärevere Bridge across the Emajõgi River west of Tartu. Being one of only four bridges across the 100 kilometres long marshy floodplains of the river, it was of high strategic importance. After sappers failed to destroy the bridge, Sturmbannführer Leon Degrelle improvised a defence line of the 5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien, avoiding a Soviet breakthrough to Tartu. As a result, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves.|$|E
5|$|Snetkov {{was born}} on 27 February 1925 in Saratov, and {{graduated}} from Pugachyov's School No. 2. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1942 and in October 1943 graduated from accelerated courses at the 2nd Kiev <b>Self-Propelled</b> <b>Artillery</b> School as a junior lieutenant. As commander of an SU-152 self-propelled gun in the 9th Separate Guards Breakthrough Tank Regiment of the 1st Ukrainian Front's 38th Army, Snetkov saw his first combat west of Rozhiv in the Battle of Kiev on 25 November, during which his crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a Tiger tank and two guns. For his actions, Snetkov received the Order of the Red Star on 12 December. As the advance westwards across Ukraine continued into the winter, he and his regiment fought in the Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive and the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive {{as part of the}} 38th Army. During the latter operation, on 26 January, his crew was reported by a superior to have engaged a German tank column of about 20 tanks and destroyed three, one of which was a Tiger, on the LipovetsRososhe road. For this action, Snetkov received the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Verdeja program's end {{came with}} the arrival of {{military}} equipment from the United States, beginning in 1953. From 1954, the Spanish Army received 389 M47 Patton Tanks, replacing the T-26s, Panzer Is and Panzer IVs then in service. The Verdeja had become completely obsolete when compared to larger, more potent tanks such as the German Panther, the Soviet T-54 and the US M47. The T-54 had 200millimetre of steel armor on the turret mantlet, far greater than the Verdeja 2's maximum armor thickness of 40millimetres. The Soviet 45millimetre model 1932 gun was replaced by the T-34's 76.2millimetre gun, while the Germans adopted the 75millimetre L/70 tank gun on the Panther. By 1950, Soviet tanks such as the T-54 were armed with the D-10T 100millimetre tank gun, and American tanks adopted the 90millimetre main gun. Although the Verdeja was Spain's most successful indigenous design, it was outclassed as foreign countries produced superior products. Furthermore, the need for <b>self-propelled</b> <b>artillery</b> was soon eliminated as the United States offered Spain M37 and M44 self-propelled howitzers. As a result, interest in the Verdeja dried up after 1954. Spain would not attempt another indigenous tank until the advent of the Lince main battle tank in the late 1980s.|$|E
