He is credited with being the first physician to differentiate between hemotogenous and hepatogenous icterus. His name is associated with [...] "Millard-Gubler syndrome", a condition characterized by <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> <b>brain</b> tissue that is caused by blockage of blood vessels of the pons. The disease is named in conjunction with Auguste Louis Jules Millard (1830-1915), who initially described the disorder in 1855. The eponymous [...] "Gubler's line" [...] is a line of superficial origin of the trigeminal nerve on the pons, a lesion below which results in the aforementioned Millard-Gubler syndrome.|$|E

50|$|In medicine, {{cerebral}} softening (encephalomalacia) is a localized <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain</b> substance, due to hemorrhage or inflammation.

50|$|Yellow {{softening}} is {{the third}} type <b>of</b> cerebral <b>softening.</b> As its name implies, the affected <b>softened</b> areas <b>of</b> the <b>brain</b> have a yellow appearance.

60|$|It may {{be added}} that the same blank and {{bankruptcy}} {{can be observed in}} all fierce and terrible types of literature, especially in satire. Satire may be mad and anarchic, but it presupposes an admitted superiority in certain things over others; it presupposes a standard. When little boys in the street laugh at the fatness of some distinguished journalist, they are unconsciously assuming a standard of Greek sculpture. They are appealing to the marble Apollo. And the curious disappearance of satire from our literature is an instance of the fierce things fading for want of any principle to be fierce about. Nietzsche had some natural talent for sarcasm: he could sneer, though he could not laugh; but there is always something bodiless and without weight in his satire, simply because it has not any mass of common morality behind it. He is himself more preposterous than anything he denounces. But, indeed, Nietzsche will stand very well as the type of the whole of this failure of abstract violence. The <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain</b> which ultimately overtook him was not a physical accident. If Nietzsche had not ended in imbecility, Nietzscheism would end in imbecility. Thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot. Every man who will not have <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the heart must at last have <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain.</b>|$|R

25|$|O'Connell died <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain</b> (cerebral <b>softening)</b> in 1847 in Genoa, Italy, {{while on}} a pilgrimage to Rome at the age of 71; his term in prison had seriously {{weakened}} him, and the appallingly cold weather he had to endure on his journey was probably the final blow. According to his dying wish, his heart was buried in Rome (at Sant'Agata dei Goti, then the chapel of the Irish College), and the remainder of his body in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin, beneath a round tower. His sons are buried in his crypt.|$|R

50|$|He {{began the}} study of {{medicine}} with Dr. Chester Hunt, of Windham, and after taking his degree at Yale Medical School in 1827 established himself in practice in Greenfield Hill, Conn., but not finding a good opening there removed about 1832 to Trumbull, Conn., where he continued in active practice for forty years. He was attacked about five years before his death with <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain,</b> and failed gradually in mental and physical strength. He {{took an interest in}} local politics, and once represented Trumbull in the Connecticut State Legislature. He died in Trumbull, Conn., May 8, 1878, aged 75 years.

50|$|In 1841 Fuero was {{promoted}} major and resigned the vice-presidency {{of the military}} college. In 1843 he was appointed {{chief of staff of}} the army of operations in Tamaulipas, and as such designed all the plans of the campaign. During the war with the United States, Fuero took part in all the battles, till the defeat at Padierna, after which he protected the retreat of the army at the head of a small force, and received a wound that ultimately caused his death. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo he was retired as an invalid on full pay, with the rank of colonel, and opened a private college, but during the latter years of his life he had to abandon this pursuit, as his wound caused a gradual <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Annexation to Piedmont {{having been}} voted by {{plebiscite}} {{and the opposition}} of Napoleon III having been overcome, Farini returned to Turin, where the king conferred on him {{the order of the}} Annunziata and Cavour appointed him minister of the interior (June 1860), and subsequently viceroy of Naples; but he soon resigned on the score of ill-health. Cavour died in 1861, and the following year, Farini succeeded Rattazzi as premier, in which office he endeavoured to carry out Cavour's policy. Over-exertion, however, brought on <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain,</b> which compelled him to resign office on 24 March 1863, and ultimately resulted in his death in poverty at Quarto dei Mille in Genoa. He was buried at Turin, but in 1878 his remains were removed to his native village of Russi.|$|R
5000|$|For {{many years}} Bache kept a school. In 1859 {{he took a}} leading part with the Rev. Dr. Miller, rector of St. Martin's, in the {{establishment}} of Hospital Sunday, an institution originated in Birmingham. He was visitor of Manchester New College, London, 1861-65. In 1862 the New Meeting, Moor Street, was sold to Roman Catholics, the congregation removing to a handsome structure in Broad Street, called the Church of the Messiah, Birmingham (foundation laid 11 August 1860). Mr. Bache had as colleague in 1863-7 the Rev. Henry Enfield Dowson. In 1868 he resigned the ministry from failing health, and, being afflicted with <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain,</b> he resided {{for the last two years}} of his life in the house of a physician at Gloucester, where he died on 7 January 1876 aged 71.|$|R

Under President Pierce he held the office of U. S. District Attorney for the district of Michigan. In later life he relinquished active practice, and was occupied with the care of his large property in real estate —until symptoms <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain</b> appeared about 1884. In 1885 he was taken to his early home in Madison, where he died on August 30, 1889, at the age of 80. He was never married.|$|R
50|$|Isolated lesions of the VI nerve nucleus {{will not}} give rise to an {{isolated}} VIth nerve palsy because paramedian pontine reticular formation fibers pass through the nucleus to the opposite IIIrd nerve nucleus. Thus, a nuclear lesion will give rise to an ipsilateral gaze palsy. In addition, fibers of the seventh cranial nerve wrap around the VIth nerve nucleus, and, if this is also affected, a VIth nerve palsy with ipsilateral facial palsy will result. In Millard-Gubler syndrome, a unilateral <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brain</b> tissue arising from obstruction of the blood vessels of the pons involving sixth and seventh cranial nerves and the corticospinal tract, the VIth nerve palsy and ipsilateral facial paresis occur with a contralateral hemiparesis.
