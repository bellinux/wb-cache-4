Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols.

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{interpretation}} of Tari Srimpi through the analysis <b>of</b> <b>symbols,</b> according to Hinduism. The interpretation focuses on a discussion of how aesthetic power is established through the <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> four dancers in Tari Srimpi. Usually discussions about the four Tari Srimpi dancers (referred to as: batak, gulu, dhadha, buncit) are about keblat papat lima pancer (four points and a centre), and four human characteristics (amarah, aluamah, supiyah, and mutmainah). This article attempts to discuss the <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the four dancers from another angle, formulated through Hinduism, which describes four human potentials through the figure of Panca Pandawa. Although Pandawa consists of five brothers, it is actually a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> four human potentials: (1) Puntadewa as a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> spirituality, (2) Werkudara as a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> attitude, (3) Arjuna as a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> science, and (4) the twins Nakula-Sadewa as a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> skill.
