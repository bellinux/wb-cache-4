As Thomson reminds, the house belongs to the mother; similarly, the body which holds a fetus also belongs to the mother.|$|E
25|$|Francis <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{must say}} “no to a {{financial}} system which rules rather than serves. Behind this attitude lurks {{a rejection of}} ethics and a rejection of God” (EG 57). He calls it “increasingly intolerable that financial markets are shaping the destiny of peoples rather than serving their needs, or that the few derive immense wealth from financial speculation while the many are deeply burdened by the consequences”. He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food {{on the part of}} the poorest members of our human family”.|$|E

To <b>say</b> <b>that</b> an assertion is unjustified, on the other hand, is merely to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not have such grounds; {{and that is not}} the same thing as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have grounds for denying it.” ...|$|R

25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
2500|$|The view {{of reality}} as {{accessible}} only through models was called model-dependent realism by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent [...] realism <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can know only an approximation of it {{provided by the}} intermediary of models.|$|E

[...] Gestalt psychologists attempt to discover refinements of the law of prägnanz, and this involves writing down laws that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called [...] "gestalt laws".|$|E
2500|$|It goes on {{to comment}} that on a general level the {{reasoning}} used by the atheists for denying the existence of God is based {{in the fact that}} [...] "we ascribe to God affections that are human, or we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds" [...] that we presume to understand that which God can and ought to do. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have to consider God as incomprehensible and infinite, and our minds as limited and finite.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{discussion}} of miracles, Hume argues {{that we should not}} believe that miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think that God exists. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as [...] "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent". Hume <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur. Hume wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Empiricism {{is a form}} {{of realism}} that denies that {{mathematics}} can be known a priori at all. It <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> discover mathematical facts by empirical research, just like facts in any of the other sciences. It {{is not one of the}} classical three positions advocated in the early 20thcentury, but primarily arose in the middle of the century. However, an important early proponent of a view like this was John Stuart Mill. Mill's view was widely criticized, because, according to critics, such as A.J. Ayer, it makes statements like [...] come out as uncertain, contingent truths, which we can only learn by observing instances of two pairs coming together and forming a quartet.|$|E
2500|$|Basel {{had become}} a {{turbulent}} city in Holbein's absence. Reformers, swayed by the ideas of Zwingli, carried out acts of iconoclasm and banned imagery in churches. In April 1529, the free-thinking Erasmus felt obliged to leave his former haven for Freiburg im Breisgau. The iconoclasts probably destroyed some of Holbein's religious artwork, but details are unknown. Evidence for Holbein's religious views is fragmentary and inconclusive. [...] "The religious side of his paintings had always been ambiguous," [...] suggests art historian John North, [...] "and so it remained". According to a register compiled {{to ensure that all}} major citizens subscribed to the new doctrines: [...] "Master Hans Holbein, the painter, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must be better informed about the [...] table before approaching it". In 1530, the authorities called Holbein to account for failing to attend the reformed communion. Shortly afterwards, however, he was listed among those [...] "who have no serious objections and wish to go along with other Christians".|$|E

2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} in western nations {{has a history}} of construction delays, cost overruns, plant cancellations, and nuclear safety issues despite significant government subsidies and support. [...] In December 2013, Forbes magazine cited a report which concluded that, in western countries, [...] "reactors are not a viable source of new power". Even where they make economic sense, they are not feasible because nuclear’s [...] "enormous costs, political and popular opposition, and regulatory uncertainty". This view echoes the statement of former Exelon CEO John Rowe, who said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the United States [...] "don’t make any sense right now" [...] and won’t be economically viable in the foreseeable future. John Quiggin, economics professor, also says the main problem with the nuclear option {{is that it is not}} economically-viable. Quiggin <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialization. Former NRC member Peter Bradford and Professor Ian Lowe made similar statements in 2011. However, some [...] "nuclear cheerleaders" [...] and lobbyists in the West continue to champion reactors, often with proposed new but largely untested designs, as a source of new power.|$|E
