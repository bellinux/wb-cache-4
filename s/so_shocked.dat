5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for getting rid of the hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E
5|$|As {{an escaped}} POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, {{conforming}} to Stalin's Order No. 270 {{and was sent}} to the front to fight German forces in some of the toughest engagements of the war. Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and speak to the Commission of Inquiry of the Crimes of Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony. This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> Britten that he refused {{to talk about it}} until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

5|$|Abu Qatada Ansari, a {{companion}} of Muhammad, who accompanied Khalid from Medina was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> at Malik's murder by Khalid that he immediately returned to Medina, and told Abu Bakr that {{he refused to}} serve under a commander who had killed a Muslim. The death of Malik and Khalid's taking of his wife Layla created controversy. Some officers of his army—including Abu Qatadah—believed that Khalid killed Malik to take his wife. After the pressure exerted by Umar—Khalid's cousin and one of Caliph Abu Bakr's main advisors—Abu Bakr called Khalid back to Medina to explain himself. Although Khalid had declared Malik an apostate, in Medina, ‘Umar told Khâlid: “You enemy of Allâh! You killed a Muslim man and then leap upon his wife. By Allâh, I will stone you". Some have argued that Umar later dismissed him from army service over this.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{the physics}} {{department}} at Cornell {{was looking for}} a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with Nevill Mott at the University of Bristol for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935. Before leaving for the United States, he visited the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen in September 1934, where he proposed to Hilde Levi, who accepted. However, the match was opposed by Bethe's mother, who did not want him marrying a Jewish girl, despite being Jewish herself, and Bethe broke off their engagement a few days before their wedding date in December. Niels Bohr and James Franck were <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> by Bethe's behavior that he was not invited to the Institute again until after World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E

25|$|Powell's {{ambition}} to be Viceroy of India crumbled in February 1947, when Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that Indian independence was imminent. Powell was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> {{by the change}} of policy that he spent the whole night after it was announced walking the streets of London. He came {{to terms with it}} by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later indifference to the Suez crisis, his contempt for the Commonwealth and his urging that Britain should end any remaining pretence that it was a world power.|$|E

25|$|Daoxin {{eventually}} {{settled at}} East Mountain Temple on Shuangfeng ("Twin Peaks") where he taught Chan Buddhism {{for thirty years}} and attracted large numbers of practitioners, some records say five hundred laypeople and monks. In 643 the emperor Tai Zong invited Daoxin to the capital city but Daoxin refused to appear. Three times the emperor sent emissaries and three times Daoxin refused the invitation. The third time the emperor instructed to either bring back Daoxin or his head. When the emissary related this instruction to Daoxin, Daoxin exposed and stretched out his neck to allow the emissary to chop off his head. The envoy was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> he reported this event to the emperor, who then honored Daoxin as an exemplary Buddhist monk.|$|E
25|$|The {{arbitration}} {{began in}} the Belvedere Palace, in Vienna, at noon on November 2, 1938. The Czechoslovak and Hungarian delegations were allowed to present their arguments. Chvalkovský was brief and left the task of presenting the Czechoslovak case to Krno. Although it was explicitly demanded by Czechoslovak representatives, both arbiters refused to let Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and Subcarpathian Prime Minister Voloshyn participate. Ribbentrop and Ciano reasoned that only {{the representatives of the}} central governments could participate (namely Czechoslovakia in this case rather than the partially autonomous Slovakia or Carpatho-Ruthenia). They assumed that Chvalkovský would be more submissive and Tiso would complicate the negotiations. The negotiation was a formality and a new border was drawn after half a day. When the award was announced by Ribbentrop around 7 p.m., the Czechoslovak delegation was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> that Jozef Tiso actually had to be talked by Ribbentrop and Chvalkovský into signing the document.|$|E
25|$|Gillian {{tells her}} lover, {{reporter}} Ben Caxton, about her experience with Smith. Ben explains that as {{heir to the}} entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself. His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and then publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents vanish, then is <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia. Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author {{who is also a}} physician and a lawyer.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December, a message was intercepted by Indian Intelligence {{concerning}} a high-level meeting of the civilian administration in East Pakistan. A decision was then made to mount an attack. Within 15 minutes of the interception of the message, a strike was launched against Dhaka. Armed with tourist guide maps of the city, four Mig 21s of No. 28 Squadron became airborne. Only a few minutes had passed after the meeting had started when the IAF aircraft blasted the Governors House with 57mm. rockets, ripping the massive roof off the main hall and turning the building into a smoldering wreck. The Governor of East Pakistan, Mr. A. H. Malik, was <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> after the incident that he resigned on the spot by writing his resignation {{on a piece of}} paper, thereby renouncing all ties with the West Pakistani administration. He then took refuge at the InterContinental Hotel in Dhaka under UN flag.|$|E
25|$|Christopher's father, Ed, {{discovers the}} book and confiscates it after a brief fight with the boy. While searching for the confiscated book, Christopher uncovers a trove of letters which his mother wrote to him, dated after her {{supposed}} death, which his father has also hidden. He is <b>so</b> <b>shocked</b> by his father lying about his mother's death that {{he is unable to}} move, curls up on the bed, vomits and groans for several hours until his father returns home. Ed realizes that Christopher has read the letters and cleans him up. He then confesses that he had indeed lied about Judy's death and also that it was he who killed Wellington, stating that it was a mistake resulting from his anger after a heated argument with Mrs Shears. Christopher, having lost all trust in his father and fearing that Ed might try to kill him since he had already killed the dog, decides to live with his mother and runs away. He remembers his mother's address from the letters and embarks on an adventurous trip to London, where his mother lives with Mr Shears.|$|E

50|$|This {{transfer}} to the rival club, caused him a lack of form, perhaps due to depression.
