40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to compare the course of agro-ecological {{indicators}} according to the internationally acknowledged parameters – the balance <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry balance, the weight <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry weight in 7 varieties <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> in three resistant white varieties Merzling, Malverina and Hibernal and in one blue variety – Medina, then in classical varieties Aurelius, Chardonnay and Muscat Moravian in two locations Perna (sub-region Mikulovice) and Sadek (sub-region Znojmo). The evaluation of the grape quality {{was carried out in}} accordance with common standards used in the Czech Republic. The following parameters were monitored The agro-ecological indicators were compared according to the internationally acknowledged parameters in the work – the balance <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry balance, the weight <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> bunches, the berry weight for 7 varieties <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> in three resistant white varieties Merzling, Malverina and Hibernal and one blue – Medina, then in classical varieties Aurelius, Chardonnay and Muscat Moravian in two locations Perna (sub-region Mikulovice) and Sadek (sub-region Znojmo).
