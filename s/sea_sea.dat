After the typhoon entered the South China <b>Sea,</b> <b>sea</b> warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh moved closer to the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 on August23, which was upgraded to a Strong Wind Signal No.3 at around noon the following day. All warning signals in Hong Kong were discontinued on August25. In Guangzhou, 15flights were cancelled in anticipation of Krovanh, stranding 500passengers.|$|E

2500|$|A {{sea breeze}} or onshore breeze is any wind that blows {{from a large}} body of water toward or onto a landmass; it {{develops}} due to differences in air pressure created by the differing heat capacities of water and dry land. As such, sea breezes are more localised than prevailing winds. Because land absorbs solar radiation far more quickly than water, a sea breeze is a common occurrence along coasts after sunrise. By contrast, a land breeze or offshore breeze is the reverse effect: dry land also cools more quickly than water and, after sunset, a sea breeze dissipates and the wind instead flows from the land towards the <b>sea.</b> <b>Sea</b> breezes and land breezes are both important factors in coastal regions' prevailing winds. The term offshore wind may refer to any wind over open water.|$|E
2500|$|The Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system, also {{sometimes}} referred to as the Dead Sea Rift, is a series of faults that run from the Maras Triple Junction (a junction with the East Anatolian Fault in southeastern Turkey) to the northern end of the Red Sea Rift (just offshore of the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula). [...] The fault system forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east. [...] It is a zone of left lateral displacement, signifying the relative motions of the two plates. [...] Both plates are moving in a general north-northeast direction, but the Arabian Plate is moving faster, resulting in the observed left lateral motions along the fault of approximately 107km. [...] A component of extension is also present {{in the southern part of}} the transform, which has contributed to a series of depressions, or pull-apart basins, forming the Gulf of Aqaba, Dead <b>Sea,</b> <b>Sea</b> of Galilee and Hula basins.|$|E

6000|$|After Davy {{had cried}} a great deal, and wished very often {{that he had}} not been so {{determined}} to leave home, he dried his eyes and began to take great interest in the curious things he saw around him. What surprised him most of all was, that although he actually was at sea, he could not see the sea at all! This was because the sides of the ship, which are called [...] "bulwarks," [...] were so high that they quite prevented the little boy from seeing overboard. Davy soon found an opening in the bulwarks, however, which his friend Ben called the [...] "gang-way," [...] through which he could see the water and the ships and boats that were sailing there. And when he mounted the high part of the deck in front of the ship, which is called the [...] "forecastle," [...] or when he went upon the high deck at the stern of the ship, which is called the [...] "poop," [...] then he could see all round. And what a wonderful and new sight it was to Davy! His cottage was gone! The beach, and the pier where the nets used to hang, were gone. The trees and fields were all gone, and there was nothing but <b>sea,</b> <b>sea,</b> <b>sea,</b> all round, so that the Fair Nancy seemed the only solid thing in the whole wide world! But poor Davy did not look or wonder long at this, for the breeze freshened, and the waves rose, and the ship plunged, and Davy felt very queer about the stomach! There is a man in every ship called the [...] "steward," [...] and everybody loves that man, because he goes about from morning till night trying to do people good and to make them happy. He looks after breakfasts, dinners, teas, and suppers. He answers every one who calls, and gets for everybody anything that they want. He is never ill, never in a hurry, never in a bad temper; in fact, he is a very charming man.|$|E
