40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that sound sequence discrimination learning requires cholinergic inputs to the auditory cortex (AC) in rats. In that study, reward {{was used for}} motivating discrimination behavior in rats. Therefore, dopaminergic inputs mediating reward signals may {{have an important role}} in the learning. We tested the possibility in the present study. Rats were trained to discriminate sequences of two <b>sound</b> <b>components,</b> and licking behavior in response to one of the two sequences was rewarded with water. To identify the dopaminergic inputs responsible for the learning, dopaminergic afferents to the AC were lesioned with local injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA). The injection attenuated sound sequence discrimination learning, while it had no effect on discrimination between the <b>sound</b> <b>components</b> of the sequence stimuli. Local injection of 6 -OHDA into the nucleus accumbens attenuated sound discrimination learning. However, not only discrimination learning of sound sequence but also that of the <b>sound</b> <b>components</b> were impaired. SCH 23390 (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p.), a D 1 receptor antagonist, had no effect on sound sequence discrimination learning, while it attenuated the licking behavior to unfamiliar stimuli. Haloperidol (0. 5 mg/kg, i. p.), a D 2 family antagonist, attenuated sound sequence discrimination learning, while it had no clear suppressive effect on discrimination of two different <b>sound</b> <b>components</b> and licking. These results suggest that D 2 family receptors activated by dopaminergic inputs to the AC are required for sound sequence discrimination learning...|$|R

40|$|Respiratory {{sounds are}} always {{contaminated}} by heart sound interference. An essential preprocessing step {{in some of}} the heart sound cancellation methods is localizing primary heart <b>sound</b> <b>components.</b> Singular spectrum analysis (SSA), a powerful time series analysis technique, is used in this paper. Despite the frequency overlap of the heart and lung <b>sound</b> <b>components,</b> two different trends in the eigenvalue spectra are recognizable, which leads to find a subspace that contains more information about the underlying heart sound. Artificially mixed and real respiratory signals are used for evaluating the performance of the method. Selecting the appropriate length for the SSA window results in good decomposition quality and low computational cost for the algorithm. The results of the proposed method are compared with those of well-established methods, which use the wavelet transform and entropy of the signal to detect the heart <b>sound</b> <b>components.</b> The proposed method outperforms the wavelet-based method in terms of false detection and also correlation with the underlying heart sounds. Performance of the proposed method is slightly better than that of the entropy-based method. Moreover, the execution time of the former is significantly lower than that of the latter. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Auscultation {{is widely}} applied in {{clinical}} activity, nonetheless sound interpretation {{is dependent on}} clinician training and experience. Heart sound features such as spatial loudness, relative amplitude, murmurs, and localization of each component may be indicative of pathology. In this study we propose a segmentation algorithm to extract heart <b>sound</b> <b>components</b> (S 1 and S 2) based on it’s time and frequency char-acteristics. This algorithm {{takes advantage of the}} knowledge of the heart cycle times (systolic and diastolic periods) and of the spectral characteristics of each component, through wavelet analysis. Data collected in a clinical environment, and annotated by a clinician was used to assess algorithm’s performance. Heart <b>sound</b> <b>components</b> were correctly identified in 99. 5 % of the annotated events. S 1 and S 2 detection rates were 90. 9 % and 93. 3 % respectively.

50|$|Acousmatic {{compositions}} {{are sometimes}} presented to audiences in concert settings {{that are often}} indistinguishable from acoustic recitals, albeit without performers. In an acousmatic concert the <b>sound</b> <b>component</b> is produced using pre-recorded media, or generated in real-time using a computer. The sound material will then be distributed spatially, via multiple loudspeakers, using a practice known as diffusion. The work is often diffused by the composer (if present) but the role of interpreter can also be assumed by another practitioner of the art. To provide a guideline for spatialisation of the work by an interpreter, many composers provide a diffusion score; in its simplest form {{this might be a}} graphic representation of the acousmatic work with indications for spatial manipulations, relative to a time-line.|$|E
