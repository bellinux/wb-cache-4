5|$|Following {{the sale}} of Mike Flanagan to Crystal Palace, new manager Mike Bailey played Walsh in a strike {{partnership}} with Derek Hales in the 1980–81 campaign. Due to a League Cup draw the season opened with three matches against Brentford, and Walsh scored his first senior goal at Griffin Park in a 3–1 defeat before scoring a hat-trick in the return fixture at The Valley, a 5–0 victory; this made him the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the club's history. He ended the campaign with 18 goals in all competitions, whilst Hales was named in the division's PFA Team of the Year. Charlton were top of the table {{for most of the}} season but a loss of form from February cost them the title, though promotion was still <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> a third-place finish.|$|E

Stollery was sacked and upon Lawton's suggestion the club appointed Eric Houghton as manager after Lawton {{turned down the}} role as player-manager. Lawton and Sewell's understanding grew throughout the 1949–50 campaign, and Lawton finished as the division's top-scorer with 31 goals in 37 league games as County won promotion as champions, seven points ahead of second-placed Northampton Town.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{protocols}} for distributed, fault-tolerant computation, or multi-party computation (MPC), {{provide security}} guarantees in an all-or-nothing fashion: If {{the number of}} corrupted parties is below a certain threshold, these protocols provide all specified security guarantees. Beyond this threshold, they provide no security guarantees at all. Furthermore, most previous protocols achieve either information-theoretic (IT) security, in which case this threshold is low, or they achieve only computational security, in which case this threshold is high. In contrast, a hybrid-secure proto-col provides different security guarantees depending {{on the set of}} corrupted parties and the com-putational power of the adversary, without being aware of the actual adversarial setting. Thus, hybrid-secure MPC protocols allow for graceful degradation of security. We present a hybrid-secure MPC protocol that provides an optimal trade-off between IT robustness and computational privacy: For any robustness parameter ρ < n 2, we obtain one MPC protocol that is simultaneously IT <b>secure</b> <b>with</b> robustness for up to t ≤ ρ actively corrupted parties, IT <b>secure</b> <b>with</b> fairness (no robustness) for up to t < n 2, and computationally <b>secure</b> <b>with</b> agreement on abor...|$|R

He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution.

5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{third in}} the 1996 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Atlético Mineiro qualified for the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL. Their opponent {{in the first stage}} was Série A runner-up Portuguesa, which had eliminated Atlético in the semi-finals of the national championship. This time, Atlético eliminated Portuguesa with a 41 aggregate score. In the quarter-finals, the team faced and eliminated América de Cali for a second time in its history. The opposition in the semi-finals was Peru's Universitario, defeated by Atlético with a 60 aggregate score. Atlético then faced an Argentine team in a continental final for the third time. With title holders Lanús as the opponent, Atlético took the lead in the series with a 41 away win at La Fortaleza in Lanús. After the match, Atlético players and staff were trapped against the fence surrounding the pitch and attacked by Lanús players and supporters. Among the players and staff injured in the confrontation, Atlético head coach Emerson Leão had to undergo surgery after being hit in the face. The second leg was played at the Mineirão, and this time the team's advantage was <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> a 11 draw, and Atlético won its second international title undefeated. Atlético forward Valdir was the top scorer of the competition with seven goals.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of designing cryptographic schemes which are secure even if an arbitrary function f(sk) of the secret key is leaked, {{as long as the}} secret key sk is still (exponentially) hard to compute from this auxiliary input. This setting of auxiliary input is more general than the more traditional setting, which assumes that some of information about the secret key sk may be leaked, but sk still has high min-entropy left. In particular, we deal with situations where f(sk) information-theoretically determines the entire secret key sk. As our main result, we construct CPA/CCA secure symmetric encryption schemes that remain <b>secure</b> <b>with</b> exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input. We give several applications of such schemes. • We construct an average-case obfuscator for the class of point functions, which remains <b>secure</b> <b>with</b> exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input, and is reusable. • We construct a reusable and robust extractor that remains <b>secure</b> <b>with</b> exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input.

5|$|Denis Smith, {{who played}} {{on loan from}} Stoke City the {{previous}} season, was appointed player-manager in May 1982. After leading York to seventh place in 1982–83, Smith retired from playing. York won their first major title in 1983–84, when the Fourth Division championship was <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> 101 points. This meant York became {{the first team to}} achieve a three-figure points total in a Football League season. In the next two seasons they finished eighth and seventh in the Third Division, and took Liverpool to FA Cup fifth round replays. York narrowly avoided relegation in 1986–87, and Smith left to take over at Sunderland in May 1987. Former Blackburn Rovers manager Bobby Saxton was appointed in June 1987; he was tasked with rebuilding the team in a matter of weeks, and York were relegated to the Fourth Division in 1987–88. With York bottom of the table, Saxton resigned in September 1988, and was succeeded by former Hartlepool United manager John Bird in October. York ranked 11th in 1988–89, and having looked like mounting a promotion challenge, finished 13th the following season. York were bottom of the Fourth Division by the time of Bird's dismissal in October 1991.|$|E
5|$|Ferreira {{stepped down}} at the end of the 2009–10 season and was {{replaced}} by André Villas-Boas, a former assistant of Mourinho at Porto, Chelsea, and Internazionale. In a single season, Villas-Boas guided the team to a record-matching four titles, including victory in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Their triumphant campaign started in the play-off round, where they overcame Belgian side Genk to reach the group stage. Porto topped their group undefeated, only dropping points against Beşiktaş. In the round of 32, despite a second-leg home loss, they eliminated the 2005–06 and 2006–07 UEFA Cup winners Sevilla, setting up a tie with CSKA Moscow. Porto defeated the Russians in both legs and advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were paired against another Muscovite club, this time Spartak Moscow. Two prolific displays, which included a hat-trick by Radamel Falcao, sealed a 10–3 aggregate win for Porto. In the semi-finals, Falcao went one better and scored four goals in a first-leg 5–1 win against Villarreal, which all but confirmed the club's fourth major European final. The Dublin final was an all-Portuguese affair between Porto and Primeira Liga rivals Braga. Contrasting with previous matches in the tournament, Porto's performance was more contained and victory was <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> a single goal by Falcao, who became the competition's top scorer.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{played in}} every match of Australia's {{successful}} World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, {{with scores of}} 6, 14 and 0 {{in the first three}} matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.|$|E

5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> the help of sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia {{to the tip of}} the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E

The team's 10-match unbeaten run {{came to an end}} following a 1–0 away defeat by Salisbury, who scored with a penalty in the second-minute. Boyes rejoined the club on loan from Scunthorpe as cover for the injured Gash ahead of a 1–1 home draw with Oxford, who equalised after York had taken the lead through Rankine. Barrett gave them the lead away to Luton Town, before the home team equalised through Asa Hall, the match finishing a 1–1 draw. York played Bedworth United in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, and a 2–0 home win was <b>secured</b> <b>with</b> goals from Rankine and Brodie.
