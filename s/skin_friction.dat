5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low <b>skin</b> <b>friction,</b> which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> from induced turbulence.|$|E
5|$|The viscous {{nature of}} airflow reduces the local {{velocities}} on a surface and {{is responsible for}} <b>skin</b> <b>friction.</b> The layer of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer. There are {{two different types of}} boundary layer flow: laminar and turbulent.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

40|$|An {{unsteady}} three dimensional flow in an incompressible viscous, chemically reacting fluid mixture {{due to a}} permeable rotating heated disk is {{studied by}} {{taking into account the}} effects of magnetic field, ohmic heating, viscous dissipation, chemical reaction and suction or injection.

40|$|Steady non-similar laminar {{compressible}} {{boundary layer}} flows over yawed infinite cylinder with non-uniform multiple slot injection/suction and non-uniform wall enthalpy have been studied. The numerical difficulties are overcome {{by applying the}} method of quasi-linear implicit finite difference scheme with an appropriate selection of finer stepsize along the streamwise direction. Separation can be delayed more effectively by non-uniform multiple slot suction and also by moving the slots downstream {{as compared to the}} non-uniform single slot suction but the non-uniform multiple slot injection has the reverse effect. Increase of Mach number shifts the point of separation upstream due to the increase in the adverse pressure gradient. An increase of enthalpy at the wall causes separation to occur earlier while cooling delays it. Non-uniform total enthalpy at the wall has very little effect on the <b>skin</b> <b>frictions</b> or the point of separation. Also, the yaw angle has very little effect on the location of the point of separation...|$|R

25|$|In general, {{it is hard}} to {{determine}} the maximum speed of extinct sea creatures. For plesiosaurs, this is made more difficult by the lack of consensus about their flipper stroke and gait. There are no exact calculations of their Reynolds Number. Fossil impressions show that the skin was relatively smooth, not scaled, and this may have reduced form drag. Small wrinkles are present in the skin that may have prevented separation of the laminar flow in the boundary layer and thereby reduced <b>skin</b> <b>friction.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} magnetohydrodynamic flow of a {{viscous fluid}} over a constant wedge {{immersed in a}} porous medium is studied. The flow is induced by suction/injection and also by the mainstream flow that is assumed to vary in a power-law manner with coordinate distance along the boundary.

This equation has been solved analytically {{for a wide range of}} parameters involved in the study. Various results for the dimensionless velocity profiles and <b>skin</b> <b>frictions</b> are discussed for the pressure gradient parameter, Hartmann number, permeability parameter, and suction/injection. A far-field asymptotic solution is also obtained which has revealed oscillatory velocity profiles when the flow has an adverse pressure gradient. The results show that, for the positive pressure gradient and mass transfer parameters, the thickness of the boundary layer becomes thin and the flow is directed entirely towards the wedge surface whereas for negative values the solutions have very different characters.

500|$|The laminar {{boundary}} is a {{very smooth}} flow, while the turbulent boundary layer contains swirls or [...] "eddies." [...] The laminar flow creates less <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing surface begins as a smooth laminar flow.

500|$|In {{high-performance}} designs, such as gliders {{and commercial}} aircraft, much {{attention is paid}} to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to minimize drag.

2500|$|The {{extremely}} long necks of [...] "plesiosauromorphs" [...] {{have caused}} speculation {{as to their}} function from the very moment their special build became apparent. Conybeare had offered three possible explanations. The neck could have served to intercept fast-moving fish in a pursuit. Alternatively, plesiosaurs could have rested on the sea bottom, while the head was sent out to search for prey, {{which seemed to be}} confirmed by the fact the eyes were directed relatively upwards. Finally, Conybeare suggested the possibility that plesiosaurs swam on the surface, letting their necks plunge downwards to seek food at lower levels. All these interpretations assumed that the neck was very flexible. The modern insight that the neck was, in fact, rather rigid, with limited vertical movement, has necessitated new explanations. One hypothesis is that the length of the neck made it possible to surprise schools of fish, the head arriving before the sight or pressure wave of the trunk could alert them. [...] "Plesiosauromorphs" [...] hunted visually, as shown by their large eyes, and perhaps employed a directional sense of olfaction. Hard and soft-bodied cephalopods probably formed part of their diet. Their jaws were probably strong enough to bite through the hard shells of this prey type. Fossil specimens have been found with cephalopod shells still in their stomach. The bony fish (Osteichthyes), which further diversified during the Jurassic, were likely prey as well. A very different hypothesis claims that [...] "plesiosauromorphs" [...] were bottom feeders. The stiff necks would have been used to plough the sea bottom, eating the benthos. This would have been proven by long furrows present in ancients seabeds. Such a lifestyle has in 2017 been suggested for Morturneria. [...] "Plesiosauromorphs" [...] were not well adapted to catching large fast-moving prey, as their long necks, though seemingly streamlined, caused enormous <b>skin</b> <b>friction.</b> Sankar Chatterjee suggested in 1989 that some Cryptocleididae were suspension feeders, filtering plankton.

40|$|Abstract: Expansive soils {{cause more}} damage to {{structures}} annually than a combination of other major natural disasters. Because of the cost to our society, all means and methods need to be fully explored to mitigate {{the problems associated with}} expansive soils. This study will present a foundation design approach that is underutilized in this application, driven piles. The main objective of the study is to present pile test results and analysis from four driven pile project sites in three types of expansive soils found in central Texas: Del Rio formation, Taylor/Navarro formation, and expansive alluvium. High strain dynamic pile tests were conducted on each of the four studies with rigorous signal matching analysis from the CAse Pile Wave Analysis Program (CAPWAP). Ultimate pile capacities ranged from 73 to 311 kips with an average of 61 % of the total capacity coming from the pile shaft and were two to six times the structural capacity needed. Allowable loads calculated from Modified Gates dynamic formula best modeled allowable test results. Average unit <b>skin</b> <b>frictions</b> ranged from 0. 50 to 4. 71 ksf. Restrike pile tests of 1 to 17 days after initial driving reported 30 to 100 % shaft capacity gain. All open-ended pipe piles driven produced soil plugs ranging from 4 to 14 feet thick. Small diameter, thick-walled, open-ended pipe piles reached penetration of twice the depth of designated zone of seasonal moisture change without problem. The observed production rate of the driven piles was on average 8 minutes, which implied daily production of 15 to 40 piles.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of a turbine system operating under highly pulsating flow environment typically found in vehicular turbochargers is made to: identify the key operating parameters, enable the formulation of a reduced order model, delineate the sources of loss and suggest strategies for performance improvement. The turbine system consists of a scroll-volute followed by a turbine wheel and then a diffuser. The assessment includes calculating unsteady three-dimensional flow in the turbine system followed by in-depth interrogation complemented with flow modeling. The key findings are (1) The flow mechanisms behind the turbine wheel performance, the diffuser loss and the wastegate port loss appear locally quasi-steady such that we can characterize {{the performance of the}} components based on a series of steady calculations subjected to varying inlet conditions reflecting the inlet flow pulsation; (2) the operation of scroll-volute and the diffuser pressure recovery can be adequately determined using a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady flow model; (3) A significant fraction of the loss that is not from <b>skin</b> <b>frictions</b> occurs downstream of turbine wheel exit (18 %pts out of 34 %pts in Peak Torque and 20 %pts out of 56 %pts in Turbo Initial Transient based on cycle loss debit); (4) The condition of maximum power extraction on unsteady pulsating environment can be approximated with a simple modeling of volute storage effect. A physically consistent definition of ideal power that elucidates the role of unsteadiness in an unsteady turbine system is derived; it informs one on what the extractable power is compared to what it could be for an ideal system. Finally the findings are used to define the required attributes of methodology for estimating efficiency with a specified uncertainty bandwidth. by Jinwook Lee. Thesis: S.
