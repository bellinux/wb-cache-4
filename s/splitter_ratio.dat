40|$|Heightened {{concerns}} for cleaner air and increasingly more stringent regulations on sulphur content in transportation fuels will make desulphurization {{more and more}} important. The sulphur problem is becoming more serious in general, particularly for diesel fuels as the regulated sulphur content is getting {{an order of magnitude}} lower, while the sulphur contents of crude oils are becoming higher. This thesis aimed to develop a desulphurisation process (based on oxidation followed by extraction) with high efficiency, selectivity and minimum energy consumption leading to minimum environmental impact via laboratory batch experiments, mathematical modelling and optimisation. Deep desulphurization of model sulphur compounds (di-n-butyl sulphide, dimethyl sulfoxide and dibenzothiophene) and heavy gas oils (HGO) derived from Libyan crude oil were conducted. A series of batch experiments were carried out using a small reactor operating at various temperatures (40 - 100 °C) with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as oxidant and formic acid (HCOOH) as catalyst. Kinetic models for the oxidation process are then developed based on 'total sulphur approach'. Extraction of unoxidised and oxidised gas oils was also investigated using methanol, dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methyl pyrolidone (NMP) as solvents. For each solvent, the 'measures' such as: the partition coefficient (KP), effectiveness factor (Kf) and extractor factor (Ef) are used to select the best/effective solvent and to find the effective heavy gas oil/solvent ratios. A CSTR model is then developed for the process for evaluating viability of the large scale operation. It is noted that while the energy consumption and recovery issues could be ignored for batch experiments these could not be ignored for large scale operation. Large amount of heating is necessary even to carry out the reaction at 30 - 40 °C, the recovery of which is very important for maximising the profitability of operation and also to minimise environmental impact by reducing net CO 2 release. Here the heat integration of the oxidation process is considered to recover most of the external energy input. However, this leads to putting a number of heat exchangers in the oxidation process requiring capital investment. Optimisation problem is formulated using gPROMS modelling tool to optimise some of the design and operating parameters (such as reaction temperature, residence time and <b>splitter</b> <b>ratio)</b> of integrated process while minimising an objective function which is a coupled function of capital and operating costs involving design and operating parameters. Two cases are studied: where (i) HGO and catalyst are fed as one feed stream and (ii) HGO and catalyst are treated as two feed streams. A liquid-liquid extraction model is then developed for the extraction of sulphur compounds from the oxidised heavy gas oil. With the experimentally determined KP multi stage liquid-liquid extraction process is modelled using gPROMS software and the process is simulated for three different solvents at different oil/solvent ratios to select the best solvent, and to obtain the best heavy gas oil to solvent ratio and number of extraction stages to reduce the sulphur content to less than 10 ppm. Finally, an integrated oxidation and extraction steps of ODS process is developed based on the batch experiments and modelling. The recovery of oxidant, catalyst and solvent are considered and preliminary economic analysis for the integrated ODS process is presented.

40|$|Precise {{control of}} {{polarization}} behavior {{is necessary to}} obtain optimal performance from your optical components and systems. Characteristics such as reflectivity, insertion loss, and beam <b>splitter</b> <b>ratios</b> will be different for different polarizations. Such dependencies need to be carefully accounted for in any optical design. Polarization is also important {{because it can be}} used to transmit signals and make sensitive measurements. Even though the light intensity may be constant, valuable information can be conveyed in the polarization state of an optical beam. Deciphering its polarization will tell you how the beam has been modified by any of numerous material interactions (magnetic, chemical, mechanical, etc.). Sensors and measurement equipment can be designed to operate on such polarization changes. The goal of this application note is to explain how wave plates and compensators work to convert light of one polarization state to another. The first step towards understanding polarization is to think of light as an electromagnetic wave, composed of an electric E-field and a magnetic H-field that travel together at the same velocity and in the same direction, k. E and H are vector quantities, meaning they can be represented by arrows that have both a magnitude (length) and a direction of orientation. Maxwell’s wave equations tell us that E and H are connected; they are always 90 ° out of phase and mutually perpendicular to each other and to k. Once we know E we can easily determine H. Thus, we usually deal only with E and define a wave’s polarization as the orientation of its E-field. Types of Polarization There are basically three polarization states: linear, circular, and elliptical. These terms describe the path traced out by the tip of the electric-field vector as it propagates in space. The output light from a laser is typically highly polarized, that is, it consists almost entirely of one linear polarization. On the other hand, unpolarized light, such as light from a light bulb, an LED, or the sun, is a random superposition of all possible polarization states. y 1 wavelength...|$|R

40|$|Broadband shock noise (BBSN) {{has been}} studied in some detail in single-flow jets and {{recently}} in dual-stream jets with separate flow exhaust systems.

Dual-stream jets with internally mixed plume have some simplifying aspects relative to the separate flow jets, having a single shock structure given by the common nozzle pressure.

40|$|Prior {{stationary}} cylinder {{studies have}} continually demonstrated {{the effectiveness of}} attached splitter-plates in reducing drag and lift coefficients of cylinders in steady uniform flow. The use of attached splitter-plates has even {{been reported to be}} able to completely eliminate vortex shedding in fixed cylinder investigations. In the present study, the proposed utility of attached splitter-plate wake-stabilisation as a passive control mechanism for vortex-induced vibration (VIV) mitigation was investigated. A range of splitter-plate ratios from I/D=O to 4 were examined over a reduced velocity interval of Ur= 3 to 60. The addition of splitter-plates resulted in the desired effect of decreasing the maximum drag and lift coefficient values experienced by the bare cylinder. The amplitude response however was markedly increased at low splitter-plate lengths. A galloping type response was observed with the addition of even small splitter-plates to the cylinder. The response of the cylinders at low splitter-plate ratios appeared to be strongly influenced by vortex shedding. Key characteristics of the response such as the abrupt decrease in oscillation amplitude at higher reduced velocity aligned well with the bare cylinder vortex-induced vibration response. With increasing <b>splitter</b> plate <b>ratio,</b> {{there appears to be a}} smooth transition from pure vortex-induced vibration to a galloping type response strongly influenced by the vortex shedding at low reduced velocity and a predominantly galloping response at higher reduced velocity.

It is shown that the angle of intersection plays a decisive role in determining the splitting ratio of the fermion beam.

Optical splitter finds application in optical fiber networks pariicularly for broadcast optical signal distribution.

As basic materials SiO_ 2 and Al_ 2 O_ 3 were under evaluation which were deposited by flamehydrolysis deposition (FHD) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). For singlemode operation buried SiO_ 2 waveguides and strip loaded Al_ 2 O_ 3 waveguides were used. The material quality is mainly described by the optical loss which was optimised to < 0. 1 dB/cm for silica waveguides and to < 0. 2 dB/cm for Al_ 2 O_ 3 waveguides in the wavelength range for telecom applications (1, 3 #mu#m to 1, 5 #mu#m). Homogeneity and reproducibility of the silica process is well suited for the realisation of complex integrated components. <b>Splitters</b> with splitting <b>ratios</b> of 1 : 4 to 1 : 16 were realised with low insertion loss.
