5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens <b>slide</b> <b>down.</b> He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing the creatures, the only thing he is capable of doing.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} recognition {{of the extent to}} which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E

5|$|In both of God of War: Ascensions single-player and {{multiplayer}} elements, it {{is primarily}} a third-person video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. Some scenes in the single-player campaign feature a first-person camera view. In single-player mode, the player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle games. The enemies are an assortment of creatures, {{most of whom are}} drawn from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, cerberuses, empusas, Sirens, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, and centaurs. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, such as the juggernauts, wraiths, and manticores. Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer mode. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> walls to proceed through sections of the game. The game features a variety of puzzles, ranging from simple to complex.|$|E
5|$|Super Meat Boy is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy, who must save his cube-shaped, heavily bandaged girlfriend Bandage Girl from the evil scientist Dr. Fetus. The game is divided into chapters, which together contain over 300 levels. Players attempt to {{reach the end of}} each level, represented by Bandage Girl, while avoiding crumbling blocks, saw blades, and various other fatal obstacles. The player can jump and run on platforms, and can jump off or <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> walls. The core gameplay requires fine control and split-second timing, and was compared to, regarding both gameplay and level of difficulty, traditional platform games such as Super Mario Bros. and Ghosts 'n Goblins.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Brass was {{dismissed}} after a home defeat to Forest Green Rovers, which left York fourth {{from the bottom}} of the table. His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former Derby County coach Billy McEwan was appointed in February 2005. Under McEwan, York avoided relegation to the Conference North, with a 17th-place finish in 2004–05. One-third into 2005–06, York were in second place but poor midseason results saw them <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> the table. They pushed for the play-offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the run-in. With 22 goals, Andy Bishop was the Conference National top scorer in 2005–06. Financial problems arose again; a loss of £150,000 was reported for the season, and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £100,000 to the FSIF. McGill's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders, and would lend the club £650,000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan repayments for the next five years. ST members approved the proposal in June 2006, and JM Packaging became 75% shareholders, reducing the ST's previous 85% ownership to 25%. York made a good start to 2006–07, and were never out of the top five from early November 2006. They finished the season in fourth place and played Morecambe in the play-off semi-final; after drawing 0–0 at home in the first leg, they were beaten 2–1 at Christie Park in the second leg.|$|E
5|$|Kenseth {{remained}} the {{leader at the}} lap-149 restart; he was followed by Gordon. The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman, causing Carpentier to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> the track and hit the inside wall. Ken Schrader was close by the incident but swerved to avoid damaging his car. During the caution, the leading drivers, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap-165 restart. Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside {{each other in a}} battle for second place on lap 166, until Biffle escaped and ran onto the apron on the next lap. Mayfield burst his right-front tire on lap 171, but no debris came off his car, avoiding the need for a caution. Six laps later, Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place. Riggs experienced oversteer in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte; Franchitti ran into Riggs, causing the sixth caution on lap 179. All of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Earnhardt led the field on the lap-183 restart; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards. Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188. Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him.|$|E

25|$|Most {{children}} have been said to play with whatever they can find, such as sticks and rocks. Toys and games have been unearthed from the sites of ancient civilizations.

25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done. When made to be dismantled, the shaft of a mattock fits into the oval eye of the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the shaft against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, rock, or firm ground. The head end of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The mattock head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> and hit the user's hands. The mattock is meant for swinging between the user's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side. Tapping the handle end of the shaft while holding the head allows the handle to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> and be removed.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1981, Crawford {{starred in}} the {{original}} London production of Cy Coleman's Barnum (1981) as the illustrious American showman P.T. Barnum. He trained at the Big Apple Circus School in New York City {{to prepare for the}} ambitious stunts, learning to walk the tight-rope, juggle and <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> a rope from the rafters of the theatre. After further training for the second opening of Barnum, he was awarded a British Amateur Gymnastics Association badge and certificate as a qualified coach.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Premier League club Everton were {{beginning}} to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> the table. David Moyes, by then with Everton, remembered McBride's success with Preston and sought the forward's services. During McBride's three months with the club, he did not disappoint Moyes, scoring four goals in eight games, including his first game with the club, a 4–3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He made close friends during the short time with players such as Leon Osman (with whom he still plays soccer) and Richard Wright.|$|E
50|$|The {{area has}} been {{developed}} by the US Forest Service into a popular recreation area. Parking is available in a large lot above the rock and beside U.S. Highway 276. There are two viewing platforms, steps down to the pool and railings to help climb the rocks {{on the left side}} before <b>sliding</b> <b>down.</b> <b>Sliding</b> <b>down</b> is required in a sitting position only. A restroom and changing room is provided and a lifeguard is periodically on duty especially during summer weekends. At other times, <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> the waterfall is done at a visitor's own risk. Children must be of a certain size to slide alone, otherwise, they may slide in the lap of an adult.|$|R

25|$|Ramifications (1968–69), {{completed}} {{a year before}} the Chamber Concerto, is scored for an ensemble of strings in twelve parts—seven violins, two violas, two cellos and a double bass—each of which may be taken by one player or several. The twelve are divided into two numerically equal groups but with the instruments in the first group tuned approximately a quarter-tone higher (four violins, a viola and a cello). As the group play, the one tuned higher inevitably tends to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> toward the other, and both get nearer each other in pitch.|$|E
25|$|Among ship types, a roll-on-roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ship is {{more prone}} to {{capsizing}} as it has large open car decks near the waterline. If the watertight car-deck doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of , where the doors were accidentally left open), water entering the car-deck {{is subject to the}} free surface effect and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship's centre of gravity, accelerating the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.|$|E
25|$|Carrying a {{reindeer}} over a {{long distance}} in rugged mountainous terrain can be difficult and very strenuous. More than five kilometers each way is not uncommon. If the animal is very large, it may only be possible to transport one half at a time. In Greenland, reindeer meat is commonly carried over the shoulders, possibly tied to a backpack frame, or carried on the back with support from a headband, the last being a method preferred by the Inuit. Unskinned game may also be dragged on snow, or allowed to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> steep, snow-covered hillsides, thus saving much work and freeing the hands for support while climbing downhill.|$|E
