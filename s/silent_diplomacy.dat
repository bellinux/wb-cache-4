He spoke to reporters in the hall outside, commenting that “a quiet {{diplomacy}} is a <b>silent</b> <b>diplomacy</b> … Nations maintained a <b>silent</b> <b>diplomacy</b> with Hitler, and you see what happened.” He continued, discussing human rights and US foreign policy:Do you expect to change a government with a policy? No, if you want to change the government you have to send in the Marines. What a human rights foreign policy does is save lives. And Jimmy Carter's policy did. How many? I don't know. Two thousand? Is that enough? But that policy is even more important to you than to us. It builds up a democratic consciousness in the United States. It is more important for the United States that Lefever be defeated than for Argentina.I am very disappointed in President Reagan. A new administration is entitled to change an approach, to change a strategy, but not to change a policy. The policy of human rights belongs to United States history. This administration is not changing a strategy, but an ideology.Timerman's opposition is credited with ensuring the failure of the Lefever nomination. Conservative US critics, such as William Buckley, Norman Podhoretz, and Irving Kristol, criticized Timerman's comments and noted that he had a relationship with the indicted, late banker David Graiver, accused of laundering funds for leftist guerrillas. Kristol used the Graiver connection to explain the inaction of the Jewish community in Argentina, suggesting that it had “implicitly vindicated the Reagan administration's prudent policy on human rights”.|$|E

Andersson described Carlsson as: [...] "A man with a natural talent for the difficult art of <b>silent</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> In that art many are unsuccessful. But not Bernt. For Bernt was also {{a man with a}} soul as tough as steel as his friend Michael Harrington so nicely put it. We, his friends and colleagues, know that he was knowledgeable, with analytical acumen, single-minded and, most important of all, untiring in his fight for those most exposed, those most persecuted. At all times and in every post Bernt was always prepared in concrete action to make common cause with the weak and oppressed. In our country and the world." ...|$|E
