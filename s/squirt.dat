5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea <b>squirt,</b> whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to <b>squirt</b> a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E
5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single <b>squirt,</b> this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E

5000|$|Aplousobranchia is a {{suborder}} of sea <b>squirts</b> in {{the class}} Ascidiacea. They are colonial animals, and are distinguished from other sea <b>squirts</b> {{by the presence of}} relatively simple pharyngeal baskets. This provides the etymology of their name: in ancient greek, [...] means [...] "simple". The posterior part of the abdomen contains the heart and gonads, and is typically larger than in other sea <b>squirts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ultrasounds from a 2014 study, {{involving}} seven {{women who}} reported recurring massive fluid emission during sexual arousal, confirmed thorough bladder emptiness before stimulation, noticeable bladder filling before <b>squirting</b> and {{demonstrated that the}} bladder had again been emptied after <b>squirting.</b> Although small amounts of prostatic secretions {{are present in the}} emitted fluid the study suggests that <b>squirting</b> is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity.|$|R
5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as <b>Squirt</b> was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, <b>Squirt</b> and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The <b>Squirt</b> nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E
5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can <b>squirt</b> foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the <b>Squirts</b> master, Shlomo, {{wants to}} capture the bear the Broflovskis saw earlier in the episode, but only {{so he can get}} his chutzpah badge and {{therefore}} become a Scouts master instead of <b>Squirts.</b> One by one, the bear kidnaps the <b>Squirts</b> and Shlomo continues to devise plans that ultimately fail. Soon, the bear captures all the <b>Squirts</b> and Shlomo has to go to the Warden, but is shot in the shoulder by Garth, when he tries to release Moses from the conch shell in which he is trapped. Kenny gets captured by the bear only to find that the bear was not killing the <b>Squirts</b> but was finding friends for her cub, who was celebrating its birthday. Kenny gets the <b>Squirts</b> and they make their way back to Shlomo and they head back to camp to find everyone else in trouble. The <b>Squirts</b> stand {{on top of one another}} to reach the keys and unlock everyone from the cabin, as Kenny saves the day by smashing his head against the conch shell to free Moses, and Haman is defeated. Moses then kills Garth, and as everyone discovers Kenny died smashing open the conch shell, Moses declares they (the Jews) shall meet every year on that day to celebrate Kenny by making macaroni pictures and paper plate bean shakers decorated with glue and glitter.|$|R

5|$|Bogosian {{was born}} to Ike and Vicky Bogosian in Massena, New York, a town of 13,000 {{adjacent}} to the Saint Lawrence River. He is the first NHL player of Armenian descent; his great-grandfather, Stephen Bogosian, left Western Armenia in 1923 {{at the age of}} 16 {{as a result of the}} Armenian Genocide. At the age of 2½, Bogosian first began to skate. He joined the Massena Minor Hockey Association when he was 3, staying in the program until he was 14, when he left for Cushing Academy. Bogosian first began to play defense at the <b>Squirt</b> level (under-10); though he was smaller than most of his peers, he was a good skater. He alternated between forward and defense throughout minor hockey. When he began attending Cushing Academy he was a forward the first year, before he converted to a defender full-time. After leaving the school and moving to Canada with two years of high school to complete, Bogosian took courses on the internet.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone <b>squirt</b> lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, during Victoria's Women's Championship match, Wilson {{ran down}} and gave Victoria a facebuster costing her the victory. Later in the broadcast, it had {{appeared}} that Candice Michelle and Victoria {{may have gotten}} their revenge as Trish Stratus found an unconscious Wilson {{laid out in the}} Divas' Locker room with Candice's Playboy magazine lying across Wilson. At WrestleMania 22, Wilson gained revenge by defeating the evil Candice Michelle in a Playboy Pillow Fight match. On the June 12 episode of Raw, Wilson defeated Candice Michelle in the first ever Wet and Wild match, a wrestling match involving water balloons and <b>squirt</b> guns, in which the winner of the match would be {{on the cover of the}} WWE 2006 Summer Special magazine. After the match, the feuds and alliances between the women ended, and they continued to appear together in television segments with no mention of their time as former allies and enemies. On the July 17 episode of Raw, Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match of Stratus and Wilson against Victoria and Mickie. James entered the match without being tagged in, so Candice threw her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice, but she ducked out of the way, allowing Stratus to perform a Stratusfaction for the victory. As a result of her participation in the match, Candice became a face. Their allies between Candice and Victoria came to an end.|$|E
