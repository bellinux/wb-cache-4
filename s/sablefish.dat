5|$|Bowie Seamount {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, halibut and <b>sablefish.</b> Eight species of marine mammal {{have been found in}} the Bowie Seamount area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E
25|$|Many {{deep sea}} fish are at risk, such as orange roughy, Patagonian toothfish, and <b>sablefish.</b> The deep sea is almost {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|E
25|$|Deep sea corals {{together}} with other habitat-forming organisms host a rich fauna of associated organisms. Lophelia reefs can host up to 1,300 species of fish and invertebrates. Various fish aggregate on deep sea reefs. Deep sea corals, sponges and other habitat-forming animals provide protection from currents and predators, nurseries for young fish, and feeding, breeding and spawning areas for numerous fish and shellfish species. Rockfish, Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, <b>sablefish,</b> flatfish, crabs, and other economically important species in the North Pacific inhabit these areas. Eighty-three percent of the rockfish found in one study were associated with red tree coral. Flatfish, walleye pollock and Pacific cod {{appear to be more}} commonly caught around soft corals. Dense schools of female redfish heavy with young have been observed on Lophelia reefs off Norway, suggesting the reefs are breeding or nursery areas for some species. Oculina reefs are important spawning habitat for several grouper species, as well as other fishes.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{living in}} the depths of Barkley Canyon have evolved to be able to persist in areas with high pressure, no light, and low nutrients/food availability. The Barkley Canyon {{instruments}} span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized biological community. Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including <b>sablefish,</b> thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and eelpouts have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, sea pens, and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.|$|E
500|$|An older study, {{examining}} whales {{captured by}} the New Zealand whaling fleet in the Cook Strait region, found a 1.69:1 ratio of squid to fish by weight. Sperm whales sometimes take <b>sablefish</b> and toothfish from long lines. Long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska complain that sperm whales {{take advantage of their}} fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line, sparing the whales the need to hunt. However, the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day. Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale [...] "bouncing" [...] a long line, to gain the fish. Sperm whales are believed to prey on the megamouth shark, a rare and large deep-sea species discovered in the 1970s. In one case, three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth.|$|E

50|$|The {{white flesh}} of the <b>sablefish</b> is soft-textured and mildly flavored. It is {{considered}} a delicacy in many countries. When cooked, its flaky texture is similar to Patagonian toothfish (Chilean sea bass). The meat has a high fat content and can be prepared in many ways, including grilling, smoking, or frying, or served as sushi. <b>Sablefish</b> flesh is high in long-chain omega 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. It contains {{about as much as}} wild salmon.|$|E

50|$|The Bering Sea {{supports}} {{many species}} of fish. Some species of fish support large and valuable commercial fisheries. Commercial fish species include 6 species of Pacific salmon, Alaska pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, yellowfin sole, Pacific ocean perch and <b>sablefish.</b> Shellfish include red king crab and Chionoecetes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sablefish</b> (Anoplopoma fimbria) {{is one of}} {{two members}} of the fish family Anoplopomatidae and the only species in the Anoplopoma genus. In English, common names for it include sable (USA), {{butterfish}} (USA), black cod (USA, UK, Canada), blue cod (UK), bluefish (UK), candlefish (UK), coal cod (UK), coalfish (Canada), beshow, and skil(fish) (Canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. In the USA, the FDA accepts only [...] "sablefish" [...] as the Acceptable Market Name; [...] "black cod" [...] is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a Statement of Identity for this species. The <b>sablefish</b> is found in muddy sea beds in the North Pacific at depths of 300 to 2,700 m and is commercially important to Japan.|$|E
50|$|In May 1967, <b>Sablefish</b> again headed east {{across the}} Atlantic; but this time, instead of transiting the Straits of Gibraltar for {{service in the}} 6th Fleet, she visited ports in the British Isles and along the Atlantic coast in France, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden.

There also exhibits of Alaska's most important food fish such as salmon, halibut, king crab, and <b>sablefish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Longlines {{can be set}} to hang {{near the}} surface (pelagic longline) to catch fish such as tuna and {{swordfish}} or along the sea floor (demersal longline) for groundfish such as halibut or cod. Longliners fishing for <b>sablefish,</b> {{also referred to as}} black cod, occasionally set gear on the sea floor at depths exceeding 1100 m using relatively simple equipment. Longlines with traps attached rather than hooks can be used for crab fishing in deep waters.|$|E
50|$|Moss Landing Harbor District berths over 600 boats: {{including}} 350 fishing boats, 200 pleasure craft, 30 research vessels, and a {{half dozen}} tour and charter boats. The harbor's commercial boats land dungeness crab, halibut, king salmon, albacore, rockfish, <b>sablefish,</b> anchovies, sardines, squid, black cod, red snapper, covina, prawns, mackrel, and others. Several maritime businesses support harbor users including a fuel dock. The harbor district also provides two public boat launches and a community park.|$|E
50|$|The sablefishes are a family, Anoplopomatidae, of scorpaeniform fishes. They {{are found}} in coastal waters of the north Pacific from Japan to California, where they live near the sea floor in deep water: the <b>sablefish,</b> Anoplopoma fimbria, has been found down to 1830 m. They are large fish, with the skilfish being up to 180 cm in length. They are commercially {{important}} fishes, and are often given the market name black cod.|$|E
5000|$|Longlining - is a {{commercial}} technique {{that uses a}} long heavy fishing line {{with a series of}} hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Longlines are usually operated from specialised boats called longliners. They use a special winch to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting pelagic species such as swordfish, tuna, halibut and <b>sablefish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Meat staples include chicken, pork, beef, and fish. Seafood {{is popular}} {{as a result}} of the bodies of water {{surrounding}} the archipelago.

50|$|In July 1999, DSV Alvin {{was used}} to explore the {{biodiversity}} at the Patton Seamount. The Shallow water community mostly consisted of rockfish, flatfish, sea stars and attached suspension feeders. The community at mid-depths consist of attached suspension feeding organisms like corals, sponges, crinoids, sea anemones and sea cucumbers. The common fish species were the <b>sablefish</b> and the giant grenadier. The deep water community consists of fewer attached suspension feeders and more highly mobile species like Pacific grenadier, popeye grenadier, Pacific flatnose and large mobile crabs.|$|E
50|$|The {{salmon shark}} (Lamna ditropis) is {{a species of}} {{mackerel}} shark found in the northern Pacific ocean. As an apex predator, the salmon shark feeds on salmon, squid, <b>sablefish,</b> and herring. Salmon sharks {{are known for their}} ability to maintain stomach temperature (homeothermy), which is unusual among fish. The salmon shark has not been demonstrated to maintain a constant body temperature. The salmon shark is also known for an unexplained variability in the sex ratio between eastern and western populations in the northern Pacific.|$|E
50|$|Excursion Inlet was {{originally}} an Alaska Native village. Excursion Inlet {{has had a}} fishing cannery since 1891. The current plant, constructed in 1918, still functions to this day.
