50|$|Other notable {{feature of}} the square is the {{monument}} to Gediminas, {{one of the first}} rulers of Lithuania, by Vytautas Ka≈°uba, uncovered in 1996. Interestingly, the bronze used for the monument was donated by Lithuanian border guards who confiscated it on the border. The marble <b>sockle</b> was a gift of the government of Ukraine, while the sculpture itself was cast free of charge in Tallinn. Nearby is a magical place, a small stone marking the place where, according to a local urban legend, the human chain of Baltic Way was started linking Vilnius with Riga and Tallinn, an event that marked the beginning of national liberation of the Baltic States. It is said that if a person steps on this stone and turns around three times, his or her wish will be granted.|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} antisickling {{activity}} of pyridoxal, {{we compared the}} oxygen affinity and the percent sickling at low PO 2 of untreated erythrocytes with values for cells from the same blood sample incubated with pyridoxal, glyceraldehyde, or pyridoxine. Pyridoxal increased oxygen affinity much more than glyceraldehyde. 20 mM pyridoxal and glyceraldehyde had equivalent antisickling activity. At PO 2 levels above 20 mm Hg, both agents reduced sickling to less than 2 %. In samples examined by electron microscopy, pyridoxal reduced the percent sickled cells and the percent cells that contain hemoglobin S fibers by the same amount (from 74 to 3 %). Pyridoxine {{had no effect on}} oxygen affinity or <b>sockling.</b> Pyridoxal reacts with intracellular hemoglobin to increase oxygen affinity, which inhibits hemoglobin S polymerization and sickling...|$|R
