5|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) is trapped in a prison from which escape is impossible, the TARDIS has blown up with River Song (Alex Kingston) inside, and the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) has been shot and killed by an Auton replica of her fiancé Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). As the universe is collapsing, the Doctor uses time travel to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> and ultimately reboot the universe.|$|E
5|$|To <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> Michael Palaeologus began {{consolidating}} his rule; he had {{the younger}} co-emperor John IV blinded, which resulted in much resentment. To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanus III, ordering him to lift an excommunication that had been placed against him by the former Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos and {{to submit to the}} authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.|$|E
5|$|One can <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{professional}} play {{became increasingly}} common, {{and with it}} came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, {{as well as the}} illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team. By 1922, the NFL had established itself as the premier professional football league.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E

Population. street systems, traffic control, parking, and land use as well as street appearance are considered. Problems of congested traffic, shabby, out-of -date and even dilapidated store fronts, as well as pollution, street construction, parking availability are all very real problems in city centers. Contemporary concepts, approaches, ideas of landscape architects and city planners are examined and applied to <b>solving</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> The commercial district of Logan, Utah is considered, the problems are identified, and the methodology for <b>solving</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> is applied to this particular situation...|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} {{existing}} proofs of impossibility, some persist {{in trying to}} <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> Many of these problems are easily solvable provided that other geometric transformations are allowed: for example, doubling the cube is possible using geometric constructions, but not possible using straightedge and compass alone.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to prove something is impossible. A more rigorous proof would be to demarcate the limit of the possible, and show that to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> one must transgress that limit.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} developmental differences in event-related potentials between second graders and adults in arithmetic. Consistent with previous literature in adults, multiplication for {{both children and}} adults produced a greater left anterior negativity from 400 to 900 ms, whereas addition produced a greater right posterior negativity from 400 to 900 ms. Adults showed larger left anterior negativities in the time window suggesting that adults rely more than children on a verbal processing system for <b>solving</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> Children showed larger right posterior negativities in the time window suggesting that they rely more on quantitative manipulation for <b>solving</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

25|$|Therefore, {{translations}} into modern Japanese {{and other}} languages <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> by modernizing the language, unfortunately losing {{some of the}} meaning, and by giving names to the characters, usually the traditional names used by academics.

25|$|MacGyver employs his resourcefulness and his {{knowledge}} of chemistry, physics, technology, and sportsmanship to resolve what are often life-or-death crises. He creates inventions from simple items to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b> These inventions became synonymous with the character and were called MacGyverisms by fans. MacGyver was unlike secret agents in other television series and films because, instead of relying on high-tech weapons and tools, he carried only a Swiss Army knife and duct tape but never a gun.|$|E
25|$|The engines were unusually quiet {{because the}} {{exhausts}} were muffled by the General Electric turbo-superchargers on the twin Allison V12s. There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too {{hot in the}} tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as {{the distance of the}} engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E

They also need to teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s once {{electromagnetism}} {{was better}} understood, interest turned {{again to the}} problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow. At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as Maxwell, Heaviside and Hertz unsuccessfully attempted to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws.|$|E
