2500|$|Moroccan {{women have}} also been active in {{lobbying}} for reforms to the personal <b>status</b> <b>code</b> laws (Mudawana). The Mudawana was initially codified following Morocco's independence from France and {{was used as a}} tool for the state's immediate consolidation of power. Following Mohammed VI's accession to the throne in 1999, reforming the Mudawana was a major platform that guided the early years of his reign. Various women's organizations supported these measures, such as l’Union de l’Action Féminine (UAF) and Association Marocaine pour les Droits des Femmes (ADFM). In 2004, some of the reforms included stricter measures for men wanting to marry additional wives, greater leniency for a divorce initiated by the wife, more equitable inheritance rights for women, and the increase in the legal age of marriage for women. The reception of these reforms to the Mudawana varied across class lines and the political spectrum. While members of the aforementioned UAF and ADFM championed these measures, various groups, such as the Islamist Al Adl Wa Al Ihsanne opposed these measures, claiming the reforms were [...] "Western-inspired" [...] and rooted in the neoliberal feminist measures of the World Bank.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of serious or life-limiting illness, {{pediatric}} {{patients and their families}} are faced with difficult decisions surrounding appropriate resuscitation efforts {{in the event of a}} cardiopulmonary arrest. <b>Code</b> <b>status</b> orders are one way to inform end-of-life medical decision making. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the extent to which pediatric providers have knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options and explore the association of provider role with (1) knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options, (2) perception of timing of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions, (3) perception of family receptivity to <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions, and (4) comfort carrying out <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions. Nurses, trainees (residents and fellows), and attending physicians from pediatric units where <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions typically occur completed a short survey questionnaire regarding their knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options and perceptions surrounding <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions. Single center, quaternary care children's hospital. 203 nurses, 31 trainees, and 29 attending physicians in 4 high-acuity pediatric units responded to the survey (N = 263, 90 % response rate). Based on an objective knowledge measure, providers demonstrate poor understanding of available <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options, with only 22 % of providers able to enumerate more than two of four available <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options. In contrast, provider groups self-report high levels of familiarity with available <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options, with attending physicians reporting significantly higher levels than nurses and trainees (p = 0. 0125). Nurses and attending physicians show significantly different perception of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion timing, with majority of nurses (63. 4 %) perceiving discussions as occurring "too late" or "much too late" and majority of attending physicians (55. 6 %) perceiving the timing as "about right" (p< 0. 0001). Attending physicians report significantly higher comfort having <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions with families than do nurses or trainees (p≤ 0. 0001). Attending physicians and trainees perceive families as more receptive to <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions than nurses (p< 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0018, respectively). Providers have poor understanding of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options and differ significantly in their comfort having <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions and their perceptions of these discussions. These findings may reflect inherent differences among providers, but may also reflect discordant visions of appropriate care and function as a potential source of moral distress.
