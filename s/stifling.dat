40|$|Craniocaudal <b>stifle</b> joint laxity in dogs {{affected}} by various <b>stifle</b> disorders was determined using mediolateral X-ray {{projections of the}} <b>stifle</b> joint in neutral and tibial compression stress position. In all, 129 <b>stifle</b> joints of 80 dogs {{were included in the}} study. Patients were classified into following groups characterised by: 1) total cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture, 2) total CCL rupture and medial meniscus lesion, 3) partial CCL rupture, 4) partial CCL rupture and medial meniscus lesion, 5) clinically evident CCL rupture only, 6) normal <b>stifle</b> joints, 7) normal <b>stifle</b> joint on the contralateral joint to the one {{affected by}} the CCL rupture, 8) radiographically abnormal and clinically stable <b>stifle</b> contralateral to the joint affected by the CCL rupture, and 9) other <b>stifle</b> disorders.

This study tested {{the hypothesis that the}} degree of <b>stifle</b> synovitis and cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) matrix damage in dogs with CR is correlated with non-invasive diagnostic tests, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 29 client-owned dogs with an unstable <b>stifle</b> due to complete CR and stable contralateral <b>stifle</b> with partial CR. We evaluated correlation of <b>stifle</b> synovitis and CrCL fiber damage with diagnostic tests including bilateral <b>stifle</b> radiographs, 3. 0 Tesla MR imaging, and bilateral <b>stifle</b> arthroscopy. Histologic grading and immunohistochemical staining for CD 3 + T lymphocytes, TRAP+ activated macrophages and Factor VIII+ blood vessels in bilateral <b>stifle</b> synovial biopsies were also performed. Serum and synovial fluid concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), and synovial total nucleated cell count were determined. Synovitis was increased in complete CR <b>stifles</b> relative to partial CR <b>stifles</b> (P< 0. 0001), although total nucleated cell count in synovial fluid was increased in partial CR <b>stifles</b> (P< 0. 01). In partial CR <b>stifles,</b> we found that 3 D Fast Spin Echo Cube CrCL signal intensity was correlated with histologic synovitis (SR = 0. 50, P< 0. 01) and that radiographic OA was correlated with CrCL fiber damage assessed arthroscopically (SR = 0. 61, P< 0. 001). Taken together, results of this study show that clinical diagnostic tests predict severity of <b>stifle</b> synovitis and cruciate ligament matrix damage in stable partial CR <b>stifles.</b> These data support use of client-owned dogs with unilateral complete CR and contralateral partial CR as a clinical trial model for investigation of disease-modifying therapy for partial CR...|$|R

40|$|Grade II patellar luxations in {{dogs were}} {{repaired}} by trochlear wedge recession in 5 <b>stifles</b> (group 1) and by proximal tube realignment in 5 <b>stifles</b> (group 2). A {{combination of the}} two techniques was used to correct grade II luxation in 10 <b>stifles</b> (group 3) and grade III luxation in 5 <b>stifles</b> (group 4). The position of the patella, weight bearing, and animal gait were postoperatively examined for 12 weeks. Satisfactory results were observed in 1 (20 %), 3 (60 %), and 9 (90 %) <b>stifles</b> with grade II luxation in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Good recovery from grade III luxation was observed in 2 (40 %) <b>stifles</b> from group 4. The luxations recurred in 4 (80 %), 2 (40 %), and 2 (40 %) <b>stifles</b> from groups 1, 2, and 4, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{in vitro}} study compares the {{femorotibial}} shear in canine <b>stifles</b> with intact and transected cranial cruciate ligaments (CrCL), {{before and after}} tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) by measuring the distance between origin and insertion of the cruciate ligaments. METHODS: Radiodense markers were inserted into bones at the attachment sites of the cruciate ligaments in sixteen cadaveric <b>stifles</b> of adult dogs. Each <b>stifle</b> was then mounted in a testing apparatus. The distances between the markers were measured on mediolateral radiographs, performed on each <b>stifle</b> under three different situations: intact, after CrCL transection, and after performing a TTA. <b>Stifles</b> were loaded to create a constant tibiofemoral reaction force by maintaining the load parallel to the patellar ligament. Radiographs were taken in a preloaded and loaded state in the intact <b>stifle</b> and only in a loaded state after CrCL transection, and after performing a TTA. RESULTS: Loading the <b>stifle</b> joints after transection of the CrCL resulted in a mean lengthening of the CrCL marker distance of 22. 4 %. Loading the transected CrCL <b>stifles</b> after performing a TTA resulted in a mean shortening of the CrCL marker distance by 3. 0 % compared to the loaded intact condition. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that, in loaded <b>stifles</b> with transected CrCLs, TTA causes a caudal shift in the cranial shear force, counteracting cranial subluxation of the tibia...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral medial patellar {{luxation}} {{was diagnosed}} in 10, and bilateral medial patellar luxation in six, large and giant-breed dogs (22 <b>stifles).</b> Lameness occurred in five dogs after trauma or surgery, and 11 dogs had no known predisposing history. The mean age at presentation was 25 months, {{and the mean}} time from initial onset of clinical signs to diagnosis was 13 weeks. All traumatic or iatrogenic luxations (five dogs) were unilateral. Luxations presumed to be congenital were unilateral in five dogs and bilateral in six. The grades of medial patellar luxation were I (1 <b>stifle),</b> II (11 <b>stifles),</b> III (9 <b>stifles),</b> and IV (1 <b>stifle).</b> Preoperative function was good (1 dog), fair (9 dogs), and poor (6 dogs). Surgical correction was performed in dogs with grades II, III, and IV luxations (21 <b>stifles).</b> Complications included one wound dehiscence and trochlear wedge migration, one pin loosening, and one persistent lameness caused by lymphoplasmacytic synovitis.

40|$|Mid-substance rupture of the canine cranial {{cruciate}} ligament rupture (CR) and associated <b>stifle</b> osteoarthritis (OA) {{is an important}} veterinary health problem. CR causes <b>stifle</b> joint instability and contralateral CR often develops. The dog is an important model for human anterior {{cruciate ligament}} (ACL) rupture, where rupture of graft repair or the contralateral ACL is also common. This suggests that both genetic and environmental factors may increase ligament rupture risk. We investigated use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to reduce systemic and <b>stifle</b> joint inflammatory responses in dogs with CR. Twelve dogs with unilateral CR and contralateral stable partial CR were enrolled prospectively. BM-MSCs were collected during surgical treatment of the unstable CR <b>stifle</b> and culture-expanded. BM-MSCs were subsequently injected at a dose of 2 x 106 BM-MSCs/kg intravenously and 5 x 106 BM-MSCs by intra-articular injection of the partial CR <b>stifle.</b> Blood (entry, 4 and 8 weeks) and <b>stifle</b> synovial fluid (entry and 8 weeks) were obtained after BM-MSC injection. No adverse events after BM-MSC treatment were detected. Circulating CD 8 + T lymphocytes were lower after BM-MSC injection. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was decreased at 4 weeks and serum CXCL 8 was increased at 8 weeks. Synovial CRP in the complete CR <b>stifle</b> was decreased at 8 weeks. Synovial IFNγ was also lower in both <b>stifles</b> after BM-MSC injection. Synovial/serum CRP ratio at diagnosis in the partial CR <b>stifle</b> was significantly correlated with development of a second CR. Systemic and intra-articular injection of autologous BM-MSCs in dogs with partial CR suppresses systemic and <b>stifle</b> joint inflammation, including CRP concentrations.

40|$|Introduction: The equine <b>stifle</b> is {{a complex}} joint {{that may be the}} site of equine lameness, but {{diagnosis}} of pain can be frustrating using standard imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the equine distal limb has led to improvements in understanding of lameness pathogenesis. Until recently, MR imaging has been limited to the distal limb, but recently the use of MRI for clinical evaluation of the equine <b>stifle</b> has been reported. However there is little published information regarding the normal variation in MR anatomy of the equine <b>stifle</b> with which to compare horses with <b>stifle</b> lameness. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe normal MRI anatomy and variation in immature and adult equine <b>stifles</b> using comparison between anatomical cross-sectional slices and MR images. Materials and Methods: Post-mortem <b>stifles</b> from 9 immature ponies and 9 adult horses without hind limb lameness underwent MRI using a 1. 5 Tesla GE Signa Echospeed MRI system with spoiled gradient echo, T 2 * gradient echo, short Tau inversion recovery, proton density, and fast dual echo sequences in 3 planes. <b>Stifles</b> were then sectioned in sagittal, dorsal or transverse planes, to obtain anatomical slices for comparison with MR images. MR images from different sequences and planes were described and compared with digital photographs of the anatomical sections. Results:Soft and osseous tissues of the immature and adult equine <b>stifle</b> could be clearly defined on MR images and corresponded well with macroscopic anatomy of the cadaver sections and the anatomy described in literature. Incidental findings included small lesions in cartilage, subchondral, cortical and cancellous bone, and ligamentar tissues likely indicative of normal variation. Conclusions: This study provides an atlas of normal anatomy of the equine <b>stifle,</b> which could assist in future clinical evaluation and as a reference for improving understanding of <b>stifle</b> anatomy...|$|R
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Lindwall's fitness regime ripened {{in the early}} Shield matches of the 1958–59 season and he {{sent a message to}} the {{selectors}} when England arrived in Brisbane for a tour match before the First Test. Lindwall took 5/57 in the first innings, dismissing Watson, Milton, Colin Cowdrey, Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker. He removed both openers for seven in the second innings before rain curtailed the match, leaving Lindwall with match figures of 7/73. Unfortunately from his point of view, none of the selection committee attended the match. Lindwall was overlooked as the selectors persisted with the winning combination that toured South Africa. His prospects of a recall appeared even more remote after Australia won both of the first two Tests, with Davidson and Meckiff skittling England for 87 in the second innings of the Second Test, taking nine wickets each for the match. Meckiff was injured during the Third Test, leaving him in doubt for the Fourth Test. In the meantime, Lindwall had a Shield match away against South Australia to make a final claim for a recall. The hosts batted first in <b>stifling</b> heat around 42 degrees on a batting pitch, and Lindwall delivered 41 eight-ball overs to take 7/92. Lindwall received a standing ovation for his performances in unfavourable conditions and was greeted by Bradman, the chairman of selectors.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Studies examining {{the effect of}} <b>stifle</b> joint angle on tibial rotation, adduction–abduction angle and articular contact area are lacking. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that tibial rotation, adduction–abduction angle and articular contact area change with <b>stifle</b> joint angle. Study design: Descriptive study of normal kinematics and articular contact patterns of the equine <b>stifle</b> through the functional range of motion using 3 dimensional (3 D) radiosteriometric analysis (RSA) and equine cadaver <b>stifles.</b> Methods:Multiple, radiopaque markers were embedded in the distal femur and proximal tibia and sequential, biplanar x-rays captured as the <b>stifle</b> was passively extended from 110 ° to full extension. Computer-programmed RSAwas used to determine changes in abduction–adduction and internal–external rotation angles of the tibia during <b>stifle</b> extension as well as articular contact patterns (total area and areas of high contact) through the range of motion. Results: The tibia rotated externally (P< 0. 001) as the <b>stifle</b> was extended. Tibial abduction occurred from 110 – 135 ° of extension (P< 0. 001) and tibial adduction occurred from 135 ° through full extension (P = 0. 009). The centre of joint contact moved cranially on both tibial condyles during extension with the lateral moving a greater distance than the medial (P = 0. 003).
