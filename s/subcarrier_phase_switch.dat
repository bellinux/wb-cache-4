40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} OFDM-based {{transmission}} scheme which {{is suitable for}} robust transmission in fast fading environments, where a reliable channel estimate is impossible or very difficult to obtain. Our scheme {{is based on the}} combination of noncoherently detected MFSK (M-ary frequency shift keying) and OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing). Noncoherent detection of OFDM-MFSK allows an arbitrary phase choice for all subcarriers in the transmitter. One possibility to exploit this degree of freedom is to choose the <b>subcarrier</b> <b>phases</b> such, that the PAPR (peak-to-average power ratio) is reduced. A second possibility is to use the <b>subcarrier</b> <b>phases</b> to transmit additional data. This can be done by differentially modulating the subcarriers that are occupied by the OFDM-MFSK scheme. Both possibilities do not affect the robustness of the underlying noncoherently detected OFDM-MFSK modulation. I...|$|R

The inaccuracy of the sampling clock frequency causes slow drift of the FFT window giving rise to ICI and <b>subcarrier</b> <b>phase</b> rotation. Both signal distortions, but not their sources, may be removed by a frequency-domain channel equaliser. However, the time shift of the FFT window builds up, and eventually the FFT window shifts beyond the orthogonality window of the OFDM symbol giving rise to IBI. Therefore, the sampling clock synchronisation, performed by a resampling algorithm, should also be implemented in the OFDM receiver.|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 {{has been}} used as a {{probiotic}} against intestinal disorders for many decades. It is a good colonizer of the human gut and has been reported to be able to express type 1 fimbriae. Type 1 fimbriae are surface organelles which mediate α-d-mannose-sensitive binding to various host cell surfaces. The expression is phase variable, and two tyrosine recombinases, FimB and FimE, mediate the inversion of the fimbrial <b>phase</b> <b>switch.</b> Current evidence suggests that FimB can carry out recombination in both directions, whereas FimE-catalyzed switching is on to off only. We show here that under liquid shaking growth conditions, Nissle 1917 did not express type 1 fimbriae, due to a truncation of the fimB gene by an 1, 885 -bp insertion element. Despite its fimB null status, Nissle 1917 was still capable of off-to-on <b>switching</b> of the <b>phase</b> <b>switch</b> and expressing type 1 fimbriae when grown under static conditions.
