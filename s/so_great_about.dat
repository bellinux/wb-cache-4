5000|$|Consciousness {{requires}} {{a certain kind}} of informational organization that {{does not seem to be}} [...] "hard-wired" [...] in humans, but is instilled by human culture. Moreover, consciousness is not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing type of phenomenon, as is often assumed.

Many authors simply assume that an animal like a bat has a point of view, but there seems to be little interest in exploring the details involved.|$|R

He commented: [...] "I think [...] go hand-in-hand in terms of creating art. That's what's <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>about</b> them choosing LXD.

2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>about</b> that program." ...|$|E

When Lynsey manages to escape from Silas, he follows her and confuses Heidi with Lynsey as they are wearing identical Catwoman costumes. Silas hits Heidi, who he mistakes for Lynsey, {{over the head with}} a brick, before strangling her to death. Silas is devastated when he realises that he has killed Heidi. The Daily Star had previously reported that Silas would kill Heidi, but this was not confirmed by Hollyoaks producers. Tiddy called the storyline [...] "fantastic" [...] and said the twist of Silas killing Heidi was [...] "great". Tiddy opined that Heidi's death would affect Silas, saying [...] "I think we'll see some remorse from him, as killing Heidi was a genuine mistake, and that's what is <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>about</b> the storyline. I hope we see some remorse!" ...|$|E
