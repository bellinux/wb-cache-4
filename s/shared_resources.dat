5|$|In {{order to}} run safely on {{multiprocessor}} machines, access to <b>shared</b> <b>resources</b> (like files, data structures) must be serialized so that threads or processes do {{not attempt to}} modify the same resource at the same time. In order to prevent multiple threads from accessing or modifying a shared resource simultaneously, DragonFly employs critical sections, and serializing tokens to prevent concurrent access. While both Linux and FreeBSD 5 employ fine-grained mutex models to achieve higher performance on multiprocessor systems, DragonFly does not. Until recently, DragonFly also employed spls, but these were replaced with critical sections.|$|E

25|$|Organisms {{can compete}} indirectly, either via exploitative or {{apparent}} competition. Exploitative competition involves individuals depleting a <b>shared</b> <b>resource</b> and both suffering {{a loss in}} fitness as a result.

25|$|A {{distributed}} system {{may have a}} common goal, such as solving a large computational problem; the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit. Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, {{and the purpose of}} the {{distributed system}} is to coordinate the use of <b>shared</b> <b>resources</b> or provide communication services to the users.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{computational}} problems {{take the}} perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes {{the question for}} a while, and then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where {{we do not want}} the system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of <b>shared</b> <b>resources</b> so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.|$|E
25|$|GDLN Asia Pacific {{is built}} on the {{principle}} of <b>shared</b> <b>resources</b> among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand – Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem which}} mutual {{exclusion}} addresses {{is a problem}} of resource sharing: how can a software system control multiple processes' access to a <b>shared</b> <b>resource,</b> when each process needs exclusive control of that resource while doing its work? The mutual-exclusion solution to this problem makes the <b>shared</b> <b>resource</b> available only while the process is in a specific code segment called the critical section. It controls access to the <b>shared</b> <b>resource</b> by controlling each process' execution of that part of its program where the resource would be used.|$|R
40|$|Research on {{executive}} {{functioning and}} on self-regulation have each identified a critical resource that {{is central to}} that domain and is susceptible to depletion. In addition, {{studies have shown that}} self-regulation tasks and executive-functioning tasks interact with each other, suggesting that they may <b>share</b> <b>resources.</b> Other research has focused specifically on restoring what we propose is the <b>shared</b> <b>resource</b> between self-regulation and executive functioning. Utilizing a theory-based natural environment intervention, these studies have found improvements in executive-functioning performance and self-regulation effectiveness, suggesting that the natural environment intervention restores this <b>shared</b> <b>resource.</b> Keyword...|$|R

2500|$|There is a {{trend in}} academia for {{universities}} to be their own drug discovery enterprise. These facilities, which normally are found only in industry, are now increasingly found at universities as well. UCLA, for example, features an open access HTS laboratory Molecular Screening <b>Shared</b> <b>Resources</b> (MSSR, UCLA), which can screen more than 100,000 compounds a day on a routine basis. The open access policy ensures that researchers {{from all over the}} world can take advantage of this facility without lengthy intellectual property negotiations. With a compound library of over 200,000 small molecules, the MSSR has one of the largest compound deck of all universities on the west coast. Also, the MSSR features full functional genomics capabilities (genome wide siRNA, shRNA, cDNA and CRISPR) which are complementary to small molecule efforts: Functional genomics leverages HTS capabilities to execute genome wide screens which examine the function of each gene in the context of interest by either knocking each gene out or overexpressing it. Parallel access to high-throughput small molecule screen and a genome wide screen enables researcher to perform target identification and validation for given disease or the mode of action determination on a small molecule. The most accurate results can be obtained by use of [...] "arrayed" [...] functional genomics libraries, i.e. each library contains a single construct such as a single siRNA or cDNA. Functional genomics is typically paired with high content screening using e.g. epifluorescent miscroscopy or laser scanning cytometry.|$|E
