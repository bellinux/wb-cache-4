5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> via the handlebars.

5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a sailing ship. The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> in order to {{maintain}} a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{steering}} axis angle, also called caster angle or head angle, is the angle that the {{steering axis}} makes with the horizontal or vertical, depending on convention.

The steering axis angle usually matches {{the angle of}} the head tube.|$|E

Building on the experiences of other nations, the paper proposes both base formulas and non-base funding mechanisms that, combined, suggest that such policy-driven steering devices are not only possible, but also desirable in these times of rapid change and increasing instability for higher education.

25|$|Still under {{favourable}} conditions, Winston maintained intensity {{until early}} on 21 February, when upwelling of cooler waters beneath the decelerating cyclone {{caused it to}} weaken into a Category 4 cyclone. On 22 February, Winston sharply recurved south-southeastwards as the primary <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> shifted from a ridge retrograding westwards to a ridge building to the east; moreover, dry air hindered reintensification. Very strong vertical wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures resulted in steady weakening, and WInston dropped below severe tropical cyclone intensity on 23 February. Later, the low-level circulation center became fully exposed with shallow convection sheared to the south. As the system weakened, the relatively shallow subtropical ridge began to steer it southwestwards. Late on 24 February, when Winston entered TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, the JTWC issued the final warning and indicated subtropical characteristics, citing the weakening mid-level warm core and the expanding wind field.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was flown}} in early 1936 (according to newest research, earlier given date December 1935 is wrong). It won the contest over the Lublin R-XXI {{project and the}} PWS factory project, but factory trials showed that its performance was still not satisfactory. In 1937 two modified prototypes were built, designated RWD-14a, but both crashed during trials that year due to <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> faults (the pilots survived). Finally, in early 1938 the fourth improved prototype, designated RWD-14b, was built. After successful trials it was ordered by the Polish Air Force, receiving the name Czapla (Polish: heron), but due to a long development process, it was regarded as only an interim model, to replace the R-XIII until {{the advent of the}} more modern LWS-3 Mewa. In return for refunding the development costs, the DWL gave the rights to produce the RWD-14b to the state factory LWS (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów – Lublin Aircraft Works, a successor of the Plage i Laśkiewicz).|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of half-tracks over wheeled vehicles {{is that the}} tracks reduced the pressure on any given area of the ground by spreading the vehicle's weight over a larger area, which gives it greater mobility over soft terrain like mud and snow, while they do not require the complex <b>steering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of fully tracked vehicles, relying instead on their front wheels to direct the vehicle, augmented in some cases by track braking controlled by the steering wheel.|$|R

500|$|According to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith {{that he was}} {{attempting}} to [...] "hard-a-port around [...] ", suggesting that he {{was attempting}} a [...] "port around" [...] manoeuvre– to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that {{both ends of the}} ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> took up to 30seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned {{directly in front of the}} ship's rudder, were simply stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, Titanic might have missed the iceberg with feet to spare.|$|E
500|$|The two central {{boats in}} the German {{flotilla}}, S117 and [...] the flotilla leader S119, tried to hit Undaunted with torpedoes but Undaunted outmanoeuvred the German boats and remained unscathed. When Legion and Loyal had finished off S118, they came to Undaunteds aid and engaged the two attackers. Legion attacked S117, which fired its last three torpedoes and continued to engage with gunfire. Legion pulverised S117, damaging her <b>steering</b> <b>mechanism</b> which forced her to circle before she was sunk at 15:30. At the same time, Lance and Lennox had damaged S115 {{to the point where}} only one of the destroyers was needed. Lance joined Loyal in bombarding S119 with lyddite shells. S119 managed to fire a torpedo at Lance and hit the destroyer amidships but the torpedo failed to detonate. S119 was sunk at 15:35 by gunfire from Lance and Loyal, taking the German flotilla commander down with it. S115 stayed afloat despite constant attacks from Lennox, which sent a boarding party, who found a wreck with only one German on board who happily surrendered. Thirty members of the crew were eventually rescued from the sea by the British vessels. The action ended at 16:30, with gunfire from Undaunted finishing off the abandoned hulk of S115.|$|E
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion <b>steering</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> where the <b>steering</b> wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, {{converting}} circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion).

The <b>mechanism</b> was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common <b>steering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which involved reduction gearing. The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|R
