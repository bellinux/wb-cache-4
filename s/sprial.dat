The following matrix operations are considered: -Matrix-Matrix multiplication -Solving triangular matrix equations -L-U decomposition -Inverses of triangular and dense matrices All these algorithms are to be executed on a problem-size independent <b>sprial</b> systolic array processor. The array topology is fixed, and a simple feedback and control are needed. For all the algorithms that have been considered, the PE's utilization tends to the maximum possible value.

40|$|In {{incubation}} experiments {{of bacterial}} colonies of Proteus Mirabilis, macroscopic spatiotemporal patterns, such as turbulent and unidirectional spiral patterns, appear in colonies. Considering only kinetic propeties of rod-shaped bacteria, we propose a phenomenological {{model for the}} directional and positional distributions. As the average density increases, homogeneous states bifurcate sub-critically into nonuniform states exhibiting localized collective motion, and spiral patterns appear for sufficiently large density. These patterns result from interactions between the local bacteria densities and the order parameter representing collective motion. Our model can be described by reduced equations using a perturbative method for large density. The unidirectionality of <b>sprial</b> rotation is also discussed. In systems of self-propelled particles, {{it is known that}} collective motion appears spontaneously with an increase in population. Collective motion has been reported to be observed as macroscopic spatio-temporal patterns in incubation experiments of bacterial colonies employing Proteus Mirabilis. 1) – 3) We propose a mathematical model to investigate the mechanism of collective motion that causes such patterns...|$|E

40|$|Whole {{organ culture}} of the spiral {{ganglion}} region is a resourceful model system facilitating manipulation and analysis of live <b>sprial</b> ganglion neurons (SGNs). Three-dimensional (3 D) cultures have been demonstrated to have many biomedical applications, but the effect of 3 D culture in maintaining the SGNs structure and function in explant culture remains uninvestigated. In this study, we used the matrigel to encapsulate the spiral ganglion region isolated from neonatal mice. First, we optimized the matrigel concentration for the 3 D culture system and found the 3 D culture system protected the SGNs against apoptosis, preserved the structure of spiral ganglion region, and promoted the sprouting and outgrowth of SGNs neurites. Next, we found the 3 D culture system promoted growth cone growth as evidenced by a higher average number and a longer average length of filopodia and a larger growth cone area. 3 D culture system also significantly elevated the synapse density of SGNs. Last, {{we found that the}} 3 D culture system combined with neurotrophic factors had accumulated effects in promoting the neurites outgrowth compared with 3 D culture or NFs treatment only groups. Together, we conclude that the 3 D culture system preserves the structure and function of SGN in explant culture...|$|E
40|$|Spiral 2010 Residencies To {{celebrate}} 20 {{years of}} their residency programme, Camden Arts Centre invited 3 artists from their past programme {{to develop a new}} collaborative piece of work in their Artist’s Studio. Each of the projects took place over a week and formed the basis of the Spiral 2010 Festival programme. For this residency I invited the eco-electro girl-band - The Glut's to make a series of viral videos of our work. The Gluts are: Gina Birch, Kaffe Matthews & Hayley Newman. We formed in December 2009 to take work to the Copenhagen Climate Summit, for which we wrote a menu of songs about food, climate and other climate related issues. This cycle of songs was called Cafe Carbon. For our <b>Sprial</b> residency at Camden Arts Centre, we made a series of music videos/viral videos from a selection of songs from our Café Carbon cycle. These included the songs: GMNO, Passion Fruit Pie, Arctic Roll, OilY and Spaghetti Carbonorama. The pop videos were screened alongside selected videos of our performances at the Spiral festival, where we also performed live. During the residency we also hosted a work-in-progress screening of our film 'The Gluts go to Copenhagen' in the Artists Studio at Camden...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe NFS (Neutrons For Science) {{facility}} {{is part of}} the <b>SPRIAL</b> 2 project at GANIL, Caen, France. The {{facility is}} currently under construction and the first beam is expected in early 2013. NFS will have a white neutron source covering the 1 - 40 MeV energy range with a neutron flux higher than comparable facilities. A quasi-mono-energetic neutron beam will also be available. In these energy ranges, especially above 14 MeV, there is a large demand for neutron-induced data {{for a wide range of}} applications involving dosimetry, medical therapy, single-event upsets in electronics and nuclear energy. Today, there are a few or no cross section data on reactions such as (n, fission), (n, xn), (n, p), (n, d) and (n, alpha). We propose to install experimental equipment for measuring neutron-induced light-charged particle production and fission relative to the H(n, p) cross section. Both the H(n, p) cross section and the fission cross section for (238) U are important reference cross sections used as standards for many other experiments. Nuclear data for certain key elements, such as closed shell nuclei, are also of relevance for the development of nuclear reaction models. Our primary intention is to measure charged particle production (protons, deuterons and alphas) from (12) C, (16) O, (28) Si and (56) Fe and neutron-induced fission cross sections from (238) U and (232) Th...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} suite of 3 D multi-physics MHD {{simulations}} following star formation in isolated turbulent molecular gas disks ranging from 5 to 500 parsecs in radius. These simulations are designed to survey the range of surface densities between those typical of Milky Way GMCs (∼ 10 ^ 2 M_ pc^- 2) and extreme ULIRG environments (∼ 10 ^ 4 M_ pc^- 2) so as to map out the scaling of the cloud-scale star formation efficiency (SFE) between these two regimes. The simulations include prescriptions for supernova, stellar wind, and radiative feedback, which we find to be essential in determining both the instantaneous per-freefall (ϵ_ff) and integrated (ϵ_int) star formation efficiencies. In all simulations, the gas disks form stars until a critical stellar surface density has been reached and the remaining gas is blown out by stellar feedback. We find that surface density is a good predictor of ϵ_int, as suggested by analytic force balance arguments from previous works. SFE eventually saturates to ∼ 1 at high surface density. We also find a proportional relationship between ϵ_ff and ϵ_int, implying that star formation is feedback-moderated even over very short time-scales in isolated clouds. These results have implications for star formation in galactic disks, the nature and fate of nuclear starbursts, {{and the formation of}} bound star clusters. The scaling of ϵ_ff with surface density is not consistent with the notion that ϵ_ff is always ∼ 1 % on the scale of GMCs, but our predictions recover the ∼ 1 % value for GMC parameters similar to those found in <b>sprial</b> galaxies, including our own.
