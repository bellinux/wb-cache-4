2500|$|The Agriculture Act 1947 broadly revamped {{agricultural}} law. [...] It was {{a reaction}} to the privations of the Second World War, and was aimed at food security, so as {{to reduce the risk of}} a hostile foreign power being able to starve the UK into submission. [...] The Act guaranteed prices, markets and tenure, so that a farmer could be assured that his land would not be taken away and whatever he grew would be sold at a known price. [...] Yet another consolidating Agricultural Holdings Act followed it in 1948. [...] These Acts made it harder to evict tenant farmers. [...] With the new security tenants enjoyed, a system of rent reviews was necessary to take account of land price inflation. [...] There were many other changes in the law, and each of these Acts needed negotiations between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers Union (NFU) to fix the <b>support</b> <b>price</b> to be paid for each agricultural product. [...] They were enacted in a series of Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts in 1949, 1954, 1963, 1968 and 1972.|$|E

40|$|Trade-based market manipulation, {{which is}} usually {{described}} as trading shares to initiate a price change or to cause an artificial price, has received wide attention in policy and academic discussions, although the behavior is still poorly defined in both legal and economic literature. This Article contributes {{to an understanding of}} manipulation by providing a precise definition. A differentiation is made between <b>supported</b> and unsupported <b>price</b> pressure. <b>Supported</b> <b>price</b> pressure contributes to price efficiency, while unsupported price pressure creates societal costs. Trade-based market manipulation, thus, should be defined as exercising unsupported price pressure. The analysis sheds light on the long-standing debate about the possibility of formulating an objective definition of manipulation, refuting the assertion that a mens rea element is necessary. Existing prohibitions should be interpreted in line with the 'unsupported price pressure' -standard, that is allow <b>supported</b> <b>price</b> pressure but bar unsupported price pressure...|$|R
