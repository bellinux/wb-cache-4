40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{description of the}} phase dynamics and its corresponding electrodynamics in a stack of inductively coupled intrinsic Josephson junctions of layered high-$T_c$ superconductors {{in the absence of}} an external magnetic field. Depending on the spatial structure of the gauge invariant phase difference, the dynamic state is classified into: <b>state</b> <b>with</b> kink, <b>state</b> without kink, and <b>state</b> <b>with</b> solitons. It is revealed that in the <b>state</b> <b>with</b> phase kink, the plasma is coupled to the cavity and the plasma oscillation is enhanced. In contrast, in the state without kink, the plasma oscillation is weak. It points a way to enhance the radiation of electromagnetic from high-$T_c$ superconductors. We also perform numerical simulations to check the theory and a good agreement is achieved. The radiation pattern of the <b>state</b> <b>with</b> and without kink is calculated, which may serve as a fingerprint of the dynamic state realized by the system. At last, the power radiation of the <b>state</b> <b>with</b> solitons is calculated by simulations. The possible state realized in the recent experiments is discussed in the viewpoint of the theoretical description. The <b>state</b> <b>with</b> kink is important for applications including terahertz generators and amplifiers. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
