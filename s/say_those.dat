For instance, the filter room might be receiving 15 reports per minute from various CH sites, but these would be about formations that might cover the entire coast of Great Britain. Portions of these reports, <b>say</b> <b>those</b> over Kent, {{would be sent to}} 11 Group, while others, the attack on RAF Driffield for instance, would only be relayed to 13 Group. In turn, 11 Group's operations room would relay only those tracks of interest down to the sectors, filtering out tracks that were out of their range, or being handled by other sectors. Finally, the sector operators only had to relay information to the pilots that actually had an effect on their flight– data about other formations was not relayed, freeing the radio time.|$|E

He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't <b>say</b> <b>those</b> goddamn lines over and over and over again every night... At least every day is a new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E

Following the match Solo called her opponents [...] "a bunch of cowards" [...] in reference to their ultra-defensive tactics. The remark was made to Grant Wahl in the raw aftermath of the defeat. [...] The International Olympic Committee called Solo's comments [...] "disappointing" [...] but said she was unlikely to face formal disciplinary action adding [...] "People are free to <b>say</b> <b>those</b> things. We wouldn’t stop their right to express themselves, within boundaries, obviously." [...] Swedish coach Pia Sundhage was more blunt in her assessment: [...] "I don't give a crap.

500|$|Capitol Records {{executives}} {{were worried that}} the lyrics contained psychedelic overtones, and Brian was accused of having based the song's production on his LSD experiences. Brian clarified that the song was written {{under the influence of}} marijuana, not LSD. He explained: [...] "I made ‘Good Vibrations’ on drugs; I used drugs to make that. ... I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could <b>say</b> ... <b>those</b> are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the extrasensory perception that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside". According to Love, the lyric [...] "'she goes with me to a blossom world' was originally meant to be followed by the words 'we find'", but Brian elected to cut off the line to highlight the bass track linking into the chorus.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of [...] and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good {{foundation on which}} to base [...] "a new chapter" [...] in the Pirates series. Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, [...] "but whenever you <b>say</b> <b>those</b> words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." [...] However, they denied {{that it would be a}} straight version of the novel: [...] "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." [...] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, [...] "kind of a James Bond sort of thing", instead of the [...] "designed to be a trilogy" [...] structure of the previous installments. They hoped to [...] "design a story that would support new characters," [...] as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to [...] "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him <b>say</b> <b>those</b> words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Equivalents are {{sometimes}} {{recognized as the}} first intentionally abstract photographs, although this claim {{may be difficult to}} uphold given Alvin Langdon Coburn's Vortographs that were created almost a decade earlier. Nonetheless, it is difficult to look at them today and understand the impact that they had at the time. When they first appeared photography had been generally recognized as a distinct art form for no more than fifteen years, and until Stieglitz introduced his cloud photos there was no tradition of photographing something that was not recognizable in both form and content. Art critic Hilton Kramer said that Equivalents [...] "undoubtedly owe something to the American modernist painting (Dove's and O'Keeffe's especially) that Stieglitz felt particularly close to at the time. Yet they go distinctly beyond the pictorial conventions that governed avant-garde painting in this period by reaching for the kind of lyric abstraction that was not to enter American painting until the 40's and 50's. In the line that can be traced from the paintings of Albert Pinkham Ryder to, <b>say,</b> <b>those</b> of Clyfford Still, it is in Stieglitz's Equivalents – rather than in painting itself – that we find the strongest link." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{orthodox}} scholars often {{cite the}} poems in the First Folio as evidence for Shakespeare, such as Jonson's introductory poem describing the engraved portrait as having [...] "hit his face" [...] well, his eulogy that calls Shakespeare [...] "sweet Swan of Avon", and Digges's line {{that refers to}} when [...] "Time dissolves thy Stratford monument". Yet Marlovians <b>say</b> <b>those</b> can each be interpreted in quite different ways. The [...] "face", according to the Oxford English Dictionary (10.a) could mean an [...] "outward show; assumed or factitious appearance; disguise, pretence". When he writes of [...] "Swan of Avon" [...] we may choose to take it as meaning the Avon that runs through Stratford, or we may think of Daniel's Delia, addressed to {{the mother of the}} First Folio's two dedicatees, in which he refers to the Wiltshire one where they all lived:But Avon rich in fame, though poor in waters,Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat.And when Digges writes [...] "And Time dissolves thy Stratford monument", one Marlovian argument says that it is quite reasonable to assume that he is really saying that Time will eventually [...] "solve, resolve or explain" [...] it (O.E.D. 12), which becomes very relevant when we see that—whether the author intended it or not—it is possible to re-interpret the whole poem on Shakespeare's monument ("Stay Passenger...") as in fact inviting us to solve a puzzle revealing who is [...] "in" [...] the monument [...] "with" [...] Shakespeare. The apparent answer turns out to be [...] "Christofer Marley"—as Marlowe is known to have spelt his own name—who, it says, with Shakespeare's death no longer has a [...] "page" [...] to dish up his wit.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{explained}} that when Jews recite the Shema, they recite the words, [...] "blessed be {{the name of}} God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever," [...] quietly between the words, [...] "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one," [...] from [...] and the words, [...] "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might," [...] from [...] {{for the reason that}} Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish expounded when he explained what happened in [...] That verse reports, [...] "And Jacob called to his sons, and said: ‘Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what will befall you in the end of days.'" [...] According to Rabbi Simeon, Jacob wished to reveal to his sons what would happen in the end of the days, but just then, the Shechinah departed from him. So Jacob said that perhaps, Heaven forefend, he had fathered a son who was unworthy to hear the prophecy, just as Abraham had fathered Ishmael or Isaac had fathered Esau. But his sons answered him (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One," [...] explaining that just as there was only One in Jacob's heart, so there was only One in their hearts. And Jacob replied, [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever." [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might recite [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever" [...] aloud, but rejected that option, as Moses did not <b>say</b> <b>those</b> words in [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might not recite those words at all, but rejected that option, as Jacob did say the words.

Rabbi Isaac taught that the School of Rabbi Ammi said that one can compare this practice to that of a princess who smelled a spicy pudding. If she revealed her desire for the pudding, she would suffer disgrace; but if she concealed her desire, she would suffer deprivation. So her servants brought her pudding secretly. Rabbi Abbahu taught that the Sages ruled that Jews should recite the words aloud, so as not to allow heretics to claim that Jews were adding improper words to the Shema. But in Nehardea, where there were no heretics so far, they recited the words quietly.|$|E
