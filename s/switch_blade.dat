2500|$|Police {{encountered}} Freddie Gray on {{the morning}} of April 12, 2015, in the street near Baltimore's Gilmor Homes housing project, an area known to have high levels of home foreclosures, poverty, drug deals and violent crime. According to the charging documents submitted by the Baltimore police, at 8:39a.m Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Garrett E. Miller were patrolling on bicycles and made eye contact with Gray, who proceeded to flee on foot [...] "unprovoked upon noticing police presence". After a brief chase, Gray was apprehended and taken into custody [...] "without the use of force or incident", according to Officer Garret Miller, who wrote he [...] "noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his [...] front right pocket". In the formal statement of charges, Officer Miller stated that Gray [...] "did unlawfully carry, possess, and sell a knife commonly known as a <b>switch</b> <b>blade</b> knife, with an automatic spring or other device for opening and/or closing the blade within the limits of Baltimore City. The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted one hand operated knife." [...] According to the state's attorney for Baltimore City, the spring-assisted knife Gray was carrying was legal under Maryland law, while a police task force said the knife was a violation of the Baltimore code under which Gray was charged.|$|E

50|$|The Altix ICE 8200LX blade {{enclosure}} featured two 4x DDR IB <b>switch</b> <b>blade</b> and {{one high}} performing plane, while the Altix ICE 8200EX featured four 4x DDR IB switch blades, and two high performing planes. Both configurations supported either hypercube or fat tree topology, and 16 compute blades within an IRU.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tangential}} {{switch rail}} has less steel planed away, and the mid {{part of the}} switch [...] "scallops" [...] into the web of the stock rail for greater strength. The higher baseplate also supports the switch rail better. This makes a stronger switch which can be curved, reducing the jolt to the train and allowing higher speeds. However tangential turnouts still lack a smooth transition where the <b>switch</b> <b>blade</b> contacts the main rail, so {{there is still some}} jolt as the train passes over, though it is a much smaller jolt than with the old-style turnouts.|$|E

50|$|Turnouts were {{originally}} built with straight <b>switch</b> <b>blades,</b> which ended at the pointed {{end with a}} sharp angle. These switches cause a bump when the train traverses in the turnout direction. The <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> could be made with a curved point which meets the stockrail at a tangent, causing less of a bump, but the disadvantage is that the metal at the point is thin and necessarily weak. A solution to these conflicting requirements {{was found in the}} 1920s on the German Reichsbahn. The first step was to have different rail profile for the stock rails and switch rails, with the switch rails being about 25 mm less high, and stockier in the middle.|$|R
50|$|Catch points may {{consist of}} a full turnout or a single <b>switch</b> <b>blade.</b> In some cases, on a track that is only traversed by uphill traffic, {{trailing}} point blades are held {{in a position to}} derail any vehicle travelling downhill. However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the switch blades into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the catch points are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the catch points and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances.|$|E

50|$|On October 3 of 2000 US Customs {{seized a}} {{shipment}} of 80,000 CRKT folding knives worth more than $4.3 million. All 50 models seized had always passed every Customs test in prior situations. The shipment had cleared Customs on September 29 but on October 3 an inspector decided that the knives acted like switchblades {{despite the fact that}} none of them fit within the definition set forth by the U.S. <b>Switch</b> <b>Blade</b> Knife Act of 1958. On October 17 a letter was co-signed by Oregon U.S. Congresswoman Darlene Hooley and Senator Gordon Smith that petitioned the head of Customs to aid CRKT. Because of their action there was a Federal inquiry of the US Customs actions that had to be answered within thirty days. On October 20 the company was once again allowed to move their product. However this was not before losing over $1 million in sales and spending over $30,000 on legal fees.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{mathematical}} modelling {{work has been}} carried out to investigate the potential of the use of shear pins within London Underground Switch and Crossing electric point machine drives to protect against run-through derailments. The review is based on a need to minimise the risks of derailment and to better understand the risks associated with run-through. The study has been accomplished in two stages: analytical modelling to establish the stiffness of the <b>switch</b> <b>blade</b> followed by vehicle dynamics modelling to analyse the wheel climb-out events and the resultant loadings on the shear pins. A range of shear pin strengths and vehicle-track parameters has been considered. A post-processing routine has been developed to enable a thorough study on the relationship between vehicle-track parameters, strength of shear pins, failure rates and the risk of vehicle derailment. A good agreement between the modelling results and the current shear pinâ€™s ability to protect against derailments has been found. Ultimately, the potential to increase the strength of shear pins has been analysed {{in order to protect the}} vehicles against fatigue failure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for turnout design developed by VAE Aktiengesellschaft of Zeltweg, Austria and {{work done by}} BWG Butzbacher Weichenbau Ges. m. b. H., a company of the VAE Group. The traditional turnout design methods assume the vehicle to be a mass point travelling on a curve. Recognizing the shortcomings of this method VAE initiated a research and development effort to examine new methods for the design and evaluation of turnout geometries using the Association of American Railroads â€™ NUCARS vehicle dynamics model. The goal was {{to find out what}} sequence of diverging route curves and spirals would lead to optimal vehicle performance in a turnout. The results show that: Tangential geometries are superior to other types of entry geometries, turnouts incorporating clothoids are clearly superior to constant radius geometries and geometries with clothoids for the entry and the exit to the turnout are better than single clothoid geometries. With this method it is possible to reduce the forces created between wheel and rail by up to 30 %. BWG has developed a method to further reduce the forces that are created when a car makes the transition from stockrail to <b>switch</b> <b>blade.</b> The method is called â€˜â€˜Kinematic Gauge Optimization = KGOâ€™â€™. Making better use of the rolling radius difference it allows to further reduce the forces in a turnout by up to 50 %. Calculated results will be given. ...|$|E
50|$|Joints {{are used}} where the moving points meet the fixed rails of the switch. They allow the points to hinge easily between their positions. Originally the movable <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> were {{connected}} to the fixed closure rails with loose joints, but since steel rails are somewhat flexible {{it is possible to}} make this join by thinning a short section of the rail itself. This can be called a heelless switch.|$|R
50|$|The {{divergence}} {{and length}} of a switch {{is determined by the}} angle of the frog (the point in the switch where two rails cross, see below) and the angle or curvature of the <b>switch</b> <b>blades.</b> The length and placement of the other components are determined from this using established formulas and standards. This divergence is measured as the number of units of length for a single unit of separation.|$|R

40|$|Point {{machines}} {{are the key}} actuator used in railways to provide a means of moving a <b>switch</b> <b>blade</b> from one position to the other. Failure in the point actuator has {{a significant effect on}} train operations. Condition monitoring systems for point machines have been therefore implemented in some railways, but these condition monitoring systems have limitations for detecting incipient faults. Furthermore, the majority of condition monitoring systems which are currently in use cannot diagnose faults. The ability to diagnose faults is useful to maintenance staff who need to fix problems immediately. This thesis proposes a methodology to detect and diagnose incipient faults using an advanced algorithm. In the main body of this thesis the author considers a new approach using Wavelet Transforms and Support vector machines for fault detection and diagnosis for railway electrical AC point machines operated in Japan. The approach is further enhanced with more data sets collected from railway electrical DC point machines operated in Great Britain. Furthermore, a method to express the qualitative features of healthy and faulty waveforms was proposed to test the transferability of the specific algorithm parameters from one instance of a point machine to another, which is tested on railway electrical DC point machines used in Great Britain. Finally, an approach based on Wavelet Transforms and Neural networks is used to predict the drive force when the point machine is operating. The approach was tested using electrical DC point machines operated in Great Britain. It is shown through the use of laboratory experimentation that the proposed methods have potential to be used in a real railway system...|$|E
50|$|Host-based write {{splitting}} is done using {{a device}} driver that is {{installed on the}} server accessing the storage volumes. The usage of a host-based splitter allows replication of selected non-EMC storage. Available fabric-based splitters are for Brocade Communications Systems SAN switches and for Cisco Systems SANTap. This requires the investment in additional <b>switch</b> <b>blades.</b> This configuration allows splitting from all operating systems regardless of their version, and is agnostic to the storage array vendor.|$|R
50|$|The {{right-hand}} diagram shows a how a tangential turnout is made. A lower, more squat {{profile rail}} {{is used to}} make the <b>switch</b> <b>blades.</b> On the left is the profile of this squat switch rail. The centre diagram shows how the switch rail has to be planed, and on the right it is shown fitting against the stock rail. Note that a thicker base is used to raise the tops level with each other.|$|R
50|$|Such {{switches}} {{are usually}} implemented {{on the basis}} of increasing the safe crossing speed. Open blades impose a speed restriction, due to the potential of the crossing impact fracturing the rail as both wheels on each axle hit the crossing gaps almost simultaneously. <b>Switched</b> <b>blades,</b> as shown in the photograph, allow a much higher speed across the gap by providing an essentially continuous piece of rail across the gap on both sides.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{points and}} {{crossings}} using chaired bullhead rail would be referred to using a letter and number combination. The letter would define the length (and hence the radius) of the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> and the number would define {{the angle of the}} crossing (frog). Thus an A7 turnout would be very short and likely only to be found in tight places like dockyards whereas an E12 would be found as a fairly high speed turnout on a mainline.|$|R
50|$|For {{turnouts}} (BrE: points), {{the tips}} of the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> have to be planed down to fit snugly against the fixed or stock rail. The left-hand diagram shows this: on the left is the dotted outline of the rail, with the part remaining after planing-shown shown by a solid line in red. On the right is shown how the two rails fit together when the turnout is closed. The resulting thin pieces of steel are weak, and so old-style turnouts used to make a relatively sudden and sharp angle against the stock rail. With a sudden change in direction, trains were given a jolt and had to proceed slowly.|$|R
