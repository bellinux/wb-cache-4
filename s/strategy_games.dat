5|$|All {{the games}} in the main series are {{real-time}} <b>strategy</b> <b>games,</b> where the player views the events as a military commander {{for each of the}} three species. In addition, two spin-off titles have been released; these are authorized expansion packs to the original which focus on other characters and settings based at the same time as the main storyline. Like the main series, these two titles are also real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games.</b> A spin-off, , which was to be a third person action-stealth game was in development, but has been placed on indefinite hiatus.|$|E
5|$|Brütal Legend was {{generally}} well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and {{writing of the}} heavy metal-inspired world, and the performances of the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre.|$|E
5|$|The StarCraft {{series has}} been a {{commercial}} success. After its release, StarCraft became the best-selling PC game for that year, selling over 1.5million copies worldwide. In the next decade, StarCraft sold over 9.5million copies across the globe, with 4.5million of these being sold in South Korea. Since the initial release of StarCraft, Blizzard Entertainment reported that its Battle.net online multiplayer service grew by 800percent. StarCraft {{remains one of the}} most popular online games in the world. After its release, StarCraft rapidly grew in popularity in South Korea, establishing a successful pro-gaming scene. Pro-gamers in South Korea are niche media celebrities and StarCraft games broadcast over three television channels dedicated to gaming. StarCraft has won numerous Game of the Year awards, is often described as one of the best real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> made, and is widely credited with popularizing the use of distinct and unique sides—as opposed to sides of equal ability and strength—in real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{real-time}} <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, {{but the game}} fell short of commercial expectations. Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the excitement over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.|$|E
5|$|Military {{units are}} {{produced}} at specific buildings {{relevant to their}} area. All sea units are created at the docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications (Age of Empires {{was one of the}} first real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense). Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} 4X games borrowed {{ideas from}} board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X computer games {{were published in}} the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of <b>strategy</b> <b>games.</b> Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{game and}} its official expansion have been praised {{as one of}} the benchmark real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> of its time. The series has gathered a solid following around the world, particularly in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches. By June 2007, StarCraft and Brood War had sold nearly 10million copies combined. In addition, the series was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006, and holds four Guinness World Records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the main Halo trilogy spurred the {{creation}} of spin-off games. Halo Wars is a real-time strategy game developed by Ensemble Studios for the Xbox 360. Set in the year 2531, the game takes place 21 {{years prior to the}} events of Halo: Combat Evolved. Much effort was spent on developing a control scheme that was simple and intuitive, unlike other console <b>strategy</b> <b>games.</b> The game was announced at X06, and released in February and March 2009.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer <b>strategy</b> <b>games,</b> ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{arose from}} other genres. Players {{turned away from}} RPGs, flight {{simulators}} and adventure games in favor of action-oriented titles, such as first-person shooters and real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games.</b> Later RPGs would draw influences from action genres, but would face new challenges {{in the form of}} massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a late-1990s trend that may have siphoned players away from single-player RPGs. They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games,</b> a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E
5|$|Players {{begin with}} a {{constructed}} town center or a wagon that will build into such, an armed explorer, and a modest number of villagers. Players explore the map and begin gathering resources used to build additional units and buildings and to research upgrades or technologies. Actions such as training units, constructing buildings, killing enemy units etc., earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similar to most real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> until one side resigns.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Sid Meier, Robert T. Smith {{created the}} {{precursor}} of all 4X strategy video games: Armada 2525 (followed up by a version with enhanced graphics: Armada 2525 Deluxe). However, {{due to the}} financial problems of the publishing company Interstel Corporation, Armada 2525 never got enough marketing and attention from gamers. Future 4X space <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> such as Master of Orion {{would go on to}} adopt the gameplay and concepts found in Armada 2525. Armada 2526, the spiritual successor to Armada 2525 was released by Ntronium Games in 2009, 19 years after the release of the original in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires (under {{the working}} title Dawn of Man) {{was the first}} game {{developed}} by Ensemble Studios. Its historical setting was chosen to be more plausible and accessible, particularly to casual gamers, than existing games. At the time, other real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> had science fiction and fantasy settings, so the historical setting of Age of Empires enabled it to stand out. The designers received much of their inspiration from the game Civilization, with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive. Age of Empires was designed by Bruce Shelley, Tony Goodman (in charge of the game's artwork), and Dave Pottinger (in charge of the game's artificial intelligence). Stephen Rippy was the music director (a role he kept through the series), with occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in Age of Empires using sounds from actual instruments from the periods in the game, {{as well as their}} digital samples. The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.|$|E
5|$|Combat is an {{important}} part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.|$|E
50|$|Hoard is {{an action}} <b>strategy</b> <b>game</b> that {{combines}} {{elements of a}} dual-stick shooter with those of a real-time <b>strategy</b> <b>game.</b> Each player controls a dragon that {{has the ability to}} fly, breathe fire, and perform several special abilities with the help of powerups.|$|R
50|$|Travian is a persistent, browser-based, massively multiplayer, online {{real-time}} <b>strategy</b> <b>game</b> {{developed by}} the German software company Travian Games.

5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and resource management, that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, they realized that the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game Hearthstone, taking design cues from the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head of <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as impactful on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced resource management with individual unit combat.|$|E
5|$|The Majin Tensei {{titles are}} <b>strategy</b> <b>games</b> {{in which the}} player takes {{the role of a}} human {{character}} who battles against demons. They navigate a field – seen in a top-down perspective in Majin Tensei and in a three-quarters perspective starting in Majin Tensei II – with characters represented by small, stick figure-like sprites, and switch to scenes with large, detailed characters when engaging in battle; in the first Majin Tensei, only the opponent is shown in battle scenes, while Majin Tensei II uses a split-screen presentation to show both sides. Ronde is an exception, and instead uses 3D graphics with a scrolling camera. On the field, the player can access pools that regenerate their energy, and starting in Majin Tensei II, they can use the terrain to gain an advantage in battles, increasing their defense rating. The player can also use items, which are bought using money they earn from battles. To attack enemies or support allies, the player needs to move their units on the field so that they are adjacent to the target of the action.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{itself was}} inspired by older <b>strategy</b> <b>games,</b> in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For Brütal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend. This subsequently led {{to much of the}} action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.|$|E
