5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group <b>selection</b> <b>was</b> brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural <b>selection</b> <b>was</b> rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
5|$|Finally, <b>selection</b> can <b>be</b> {{classified}} {{according to}} the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> natural <b>selection</b> via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> considered a separate mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Lineage selection, {{occurs when}} the {{frequency}} of one biological lineage changes in frequency relative to another lineage. Lineage <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> a generalization of individual based natural selection; the stating that an allele is favored by natural <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to stating that the lineage bearing the allele is favored by natural selection. For alleles with simple positive or negative fitness effects, lineage and individual based <b>selection</b> <b>are</b> equivalent. However, lineage selection can accommodate a wider array of evolutionary phenomena, such as the adaptive evolution of evolvability, altruism, and recombination. Additionally, lineage <b>selection</b> <b>is</b> useful in determining the effects of mutations in highly structured environments such as tumors.|$|R
