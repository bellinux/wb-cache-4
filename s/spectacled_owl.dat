50|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl,</b> Pulsatrix perspicillata, {{is a large}} {{tropical}} owl {{native to}} the neotropics. It is a resident breeder in forests from southern Mexico and Trinidad, through Central America, south to southern Brazil, Paraguay and northwestern Argentina. There are six subspecies. One is occasionally treated as a separate species called the short-browed or brown <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> but {{the consensus is that}} it is still merely a race until more detailed analysis can be done.|$|E
5000|$|Pulsatrix is a genus of owl in {{the family}} Strigidae. They are called <b>spectacled</b> <b>owls</b> because of their {{prominent}} facial pattern. The genus contains the following species: ...|$|R
25|$|Near the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre is an aviary {{currently}} housing <b>spectacled</b> <b>owls</b> and formerly home to macaws and keas; {{the remainder}} of the zoo's owl collection are seen nearby. The owl aviaries were recently modified.|$|R

Four species of sea turtle (green, Pacific ridley, hawksbill, and leatherback) nest on the beaches.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{residents}} are Benito the hyacinth macaw and his roommate, Killer the green-winged macaw. Both are trained, and perform at occasional educational exhibitions. The aviary has also had success in breeding; its <b>spectacled</b> <b>owls</b> had their first chick, named Franklin (after Benjamin Franklin), who hatched in September 2006. Franklin {{can be seen in}} one of the aviary's exhibits.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> {{is found}} in Mexico, Central America (Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama), Trinidad and Tobago, and South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina). The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> is {{primarily}} a bird of tropical rain forests, being found mostly in areas where dense, old-growth forest is profuse. However, it may enter secondary habitats, such as forest edges, especially while hunting. On occasion, they {{have been found in}} dry forests, treed savanna plains, plantations and semi-open areas with trees. In areas such as Costa Rica, they may inhabit subtropical montane forests of up to 1500 m, although are generally associated with lowland forests.|$|E
5000|$|Pulsatrix perspicillata pulsatrix (Wied-Neuwied, 1820)- Or the [...] "Short-browed Owl"; {{native to}} southeastern Brazil from about Bahia south to Rio Grande do Sul {{in the area}} of Aparados da Serra National Park and also {{bordering}} over into northeastern Argentina. This species has creamy-buff instead of white on the spectacles of the face. P. p. pulsatrix is lighter brown than in any other <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl,</b> with no contrasting darker plumage on the crown and nape as in other races. The breast band is brown and distinctly broken in the center. Main proposed difference (leading to it being considered a full species) is that territorial song is not as ascelerated as in other races. Apparently, where the ranges of more typical spectacled owls overlap with the short-browed types, they do not seem to hybridize. This is the largest variety of <b>Spectacled</b> <b>Owl.</b> Wing is 363 to 384 mm long and tail is 211 to 226 mm. Weight of a single male and single female was 1050 g and 1250 g, conicidentally exactly the same of the maximum weight recorded for the nominate race of <b>Spectacled</b> <b>Owl.</b>|$|E
50|$|The zoo {{features}} {{several species}} of parrots, owls, and raptors, {{as well as a}} wetland aviary. Birds at the zoo include scarlet macaw, jabiru, great egret, wood stork, brown pelican, ornate hawk-eagle, harpy eagle, common black hawk, king vulture, <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl,</b> barn owl, mottled owl, yellow-headed amazon, white-fronted amazon, collared aracari, and great curassow.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, {{black-and-white}} hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles, and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although {{these are}} the main predators, two species of owls, crested <b>owls</b> and <b>spectacled</b> <b>owls,</b> are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, boa constrictor, tiger rat snake, and fer-de-lance.|$|R
50|$|In Costa Rica, {{eggs are}} laid {{variously}} {{in the dry}} season (November-May), or {{at the start of}} the wet season (June-July). This owl typically nests in an unlined tree cavity but may also use the crutch of a large tree. Like all owls, they do not build a nest so just lay their nest on the bare surface of the wood given, usually rotting wood in the case of tree cavities. <b>Spectacled</b> <b>owls</b> lay 1-2 eggs, which are incubated entirely or almost so by the female for about 5 weeks. If two eggs are hatched, often only one of the chicks will survive, the smaller chick usually perishing via starvation or by aggression from the larger nestling. Chicks leave the nest for surrounding branches at about 5-6 weeks but cannot usually fly well at this stage. However, they tend to depend on their parents for several months after leaving the nest and may be cared for and fed for up to a year once fledged, inhibiting the pair's ability to have young the following year. <b>Spectacled</b> <b>owls</b> may breed while still in immature plumage since it may take up to five years before full adult plumage is obtained.|$|R
50|$|Animals that {{visitors}} will {{see at the}} zoo include DeBrazza's monkey, kestrel, Russell's viper, jaguar, Jamaican fruit bat, Galapagos tortoise, Fly River turtle, bontebok, sulcata tortoise, ruddy duck, Malayan tapir, <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl,</b> Chilean flamingo, toco toucan, saki monkeys, cotton-top tamarin, American alligator, North American river otter, hippopotamus, Bali mynah, clouded leopard, Maasai giraffe, and white rhinoceros.|$|E

50|$|Most of the Valley {{was closed}} in 2002, {{and it was}} entirely closed by 2005. A {{flamingo}} pond borders the outside edge of the valley, and it remains in use. The old aviary row is now Beaks and Feet Boulevard, with exhibits for Indian peafowl, green iguana, military and green-winged macaws, <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl,</b> Swainson's toucan, black-billed magpie, golden lion tamarin, red-handed tamarin, and bobcat.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010, HawkQuest has 28 {{individual}} eagles, falcons, owls, and hawks. The 15 species represented are bald eagle, golden eagle, American kestrel, peregrine falcon, prairie falcon, barred owl, burrowing owl, barn owl, great horned owl, <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl,</b> Eurasian eagle owl, Eastern screech owl, ferruginous hawk, red-tailed hawk, and Harris's hawk. All {{of these}} birds are either injured {{or have been}} imprinted to humans {{and would not be}} able to survive in the wild.|$|E
5000|$|Pulsatrix perspicillata saturata (Ridgway, 1914)- Found from {{southern}} Mexico to northern Costa Rica. P. p. saturata {{differs from the}} typical <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> only {{in that it is}} black on the head and the back, with black barring on the sides. It {{is one of the more}} distinct and widely described subspecies. Wing is 314 to 370 mm and tail is 182 to 204 mm long. The bill from the cere is 27 to 32.5 mm. Weight is from 591 to 761 g in males and from 765 to 982 g in females.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> occurs over a {{very large}} range and is still a {{resident}} in much of its range. Due to this, it is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. However, being a large, slow-maturing bird of prey with {{a strong sense of}} territoriality, it as a rule occurs at low densities. In areas where prey populations are hunted by people and habitats are destroyed or compromised, they may decrease. This is the likely source of extinction for an entire race on Trinidad (P. p. trinitatis). Occasionally, when roads are cut into the forest, they are killed by automobile collisions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> {{can range}} from 41 to 52.3 cm in length. Mass in males {{can range from}} 453 to 1075 g, where as females can weigh from 680 to 1250 g. 10 males from the {{nominate}} subspecies (P. p. perspicillata) were found to average 767 g while 8 females averaged 908 g. It is unmistakable in most of its range (except with other Pulsatrix owls) with blackish brown upperparts, head and upper breast, white facial markings and whitish to yellowish-ochre underparts. The eyes are yellow, the only Pulsatrix with this eye color, and the beak is pale. The juvenile is even more distinctive than the adult, being completely white apart from a chocolate brown facial disc. The head is typically darker than the back and mantle but the shade of this area besides {{the composition of the}} breast band is the main distinguishing external feature of the subspecies. Compared to the band-bellied owl (P. melanota), it is of similar size, but that species has dark eyes, white eyebrows and a brown chest band broken by buffy-whitish barring the rest of broadly the underparts being whitish with reddish-brown barring. The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> is generally found at lower elevations than the band-bellied but their ranges overlap or abut from Colombia to northern Bolivia. The tawny-browed owl (P. koeniswaldiana), found from northeastern Argentina to eastern Brazil, is fairly similar in appearance to the spectacled but is marked smaller with ochraceous-tawny from the eyebrows down to the belly and dark chestnut eyes. Each of the three currently recognized species also has a distinct song.|$|E
5000|$|Vocal {{activity}} {{tends to}} be most prominent on calm, moonlit nights. The primary sound made by the <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> consists of guttural knocking or tapping sounds with a popping effect: PUP-pup-pup-pup-po, POK pok pok bog bog bog bobobo or BOO Boo boo boo boo. Each progressive note becomes weaker and lower in pitch but faster in pace as the call continues. The male is the primary singer to proclaim a territory, often singing from the upper third of a tall tree. However, females also sing, uttering the same song but with a higher pitch. Duets between pairs have been heard on moonlit nights. Females also make a hawk-like scream {{with an emphasis on}} the drawn-out second syllable, ker-WHEEER, which has often been compared to a steam-whistle. Young spectacled owls beg with a harsh, high-pitched keew call. In Colombia, an author noted that the song is similar to the tapping pattern of the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). In Brazil, spectacled owls are known locally as [...] "knocking owls".|$|E
50|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>owl</b> is {{typically}} {{the largest and}} most dominant owl in its range, with the larger great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) rarely venturing into true rainforest habitats. Most hunting starts with the owl perched on a branch and scanning the area, then dropping with a quick pounce when prey is located. It preys principally on a wide array of mammals, eating almost anything type that is nocturnally active. Various rodents may be primary but virtually any type of small mammal in its habitat is vulnerable. The primary food by far in Oaxaca, Mexico was the Peters's climbing rat (Tylomys nudicaudus) followed by mouse opossums (Marmosa ssp.) of unidentified species. Numerous bats, such as greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus) and broad-eared bats (Nyctinomops laticaudatus), are also rather vulnerable apparently. Smaller monkeys such as tamarins (Saguinus ssp.) may be vulnerable to predation. Prey species can be heavier than the preying owl, weigh over 1.5 kg, possibly up to 2 to 4 kg in Didelphis opossums, Mephitis skunks and agoutis (Dasyprocta ssp.). Even the three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) has been reported to have been killed, specifically an adult female estimated at 3.5 to 4.5 kg in weight or more than four times the weight of the owl itself. Invertebrates are eaten regularly as well, second only in importance to mammals, and may be comprised mainly by caterpillars, but also crabs, snails, large insects and spiders. Insects may be gleaned directly from foliage while the large owls actively forage. Frogs are also recorded amongst their prey. Birds are also taken, including mainly medium-sized species in the average weight range of 100 to 500 g, such as jays, oropendolas (Psarocolius ssp.), motmots (Momota ssp.), and pigeons (Patagioenas ssp.), which are taken off of their nocturnal perches and perhaps smaller types of owl. Little is known how spectacled owls interact with other owls but a study where playback of a number of owl species were played in Costa Rica, spectacled owls appeared to the least responsive, neither vocally stimulated by the calling of other owl species nor by playback of calls of their own species.|$|E
