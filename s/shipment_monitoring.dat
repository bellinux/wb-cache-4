40|$|Abstract. Recognition {{is growing}} {{for the need}} of richer {{semantic}} specifications of Web Services to support automated service selection and invocation, automated or semi-automated service composition, {{as well as more}} comprehensive approaches to service monitoring. In this paper, we combine [12] an approach for composing Web Services on the semantic web and [10] using OWL-S for explicitly describing the semantics to Web Services. We propose an OWL-S based approach for the automatic composition of Semantic Web Services and present a technique to generate composite services from high-level declarative descriptions. We discuss its implementation for the <b>shipment</b> <b>monitoring</b> application, an open, multimodal end-to-end tracking and tracing system in the Border Control domain based on Semantic Web Services as part of the SAP Auto-ID infrastructure. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{have become increasingly}} common in everyday applications due to decreasing technology costs and improved product reliability. An ideal application for wireless sensor networks is a biomedical patient telemetrymonitoring tool. Wireless patient monitoring systems improve {{quality of life for}} the subject by granting them more freedom to continue their daily routine, which would not be feasible if wired monitoring equipment were used. This paper explores an application of biomedical wireless sensor networks, which attempts to monitor patients for specific conditions in a completely non-invasive, non-intrusive manner. This noninvasive technique uses an accelerometer to determine if a person’s arm movement {{is similar to that of}} a person suffering from a seizure or acute brain injury causing loss of consciousness or coma. The results of the presented algorithms have been verified on test subjects and showed few occurrences of false positives. In future tests, automatic calibration based upon false positives will further reduce the occurrence of errors for a given test subject. The algorithm developed proved to be versatile enough that other applications such as fragile <b>shipment</b> <b>monitoring</b> required no major modifications. I...|$|E

50|$|A 1982 {{intelligence}} report {{shows that the}} US Intelligence Community was <b>monitoring</b> <b>shipments</b> of Soviet-manufactured arms to Nicaragua. Specifically, Nicaragua had received four Soviet amphibious ferries at the El Rama port facilities via Algeria. According to the military intelligence, other military equipment had been removed in Algeria, such as multiple rocket launchers and 12 cargo trucks. Whether this equipment was shipped elsewhere or would continue onto to Nicaragua later is unspecified, but as of {{the day of the}} report, none of these items had been seen in that Latin American nation.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2008, the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program sold over $ 36 billion dollars in defense articles and services to foreign governments. The Departments of State, Defense (DOD), and Homeland Security (DHS) all {{have a role in}} the FMS program. In 2003, GAO identified significant weaknesses in FMS control mechanisms for safeguarding defense articles transferred to foreign governments. In 2007, GAO designated the protection of technologies critical to U. S. national security a high-risk area. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate program changes State, DOD, and DHS have made since 2003 to ensure that unclassified defense articles transferred to foreign governments are authorized for <b>shipment</b> and <b>monitored</b> as required, and (2) determine what information DOD has to administer and oversee the FMS program. GAO conducted 16 case studies; analyzed U. S. port data and FMS agreements; reviewed program performance metrics; and interviewed cognizant officials. ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{material}} safeguards {{specialists and}} instrument developers at US Department of Energy (USDOE) National Laboratories in the United States, {{sponsored by the}} National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of NA- 24, have been developing devices to <b>monitor</b> <b>shipments</b> of UF 6 cylinders and other radioactive materials,. Tracking devices are being developed {{that are capable of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>shipments</b> of valuable radioactive materials in real time, using the Global Positioning System (GPS). We envision that such devices will be extremely useful, if not essential, for <b>monitoring</b> the <b>shipment</b> of these important cargoes of nuclear material, including highly-enriched uranium (HEU), mixed plutonium/uranium oxide (MOX), spent nuclear fuel, and, potentially, other large radioactive sources. To ensure nuclear material security and safeguards, it is extremely important to track these materials because they contain so-called “direct-use material” which is material that if diverted and processed could potentially be used to develop clandestine nuclear weapons. Large sources could be used for a dirty bomb also known as a radioactive dispersal device (RDD). For that matter, any interdiction by an adversary regardless of intent demands a rapid response. To make the fullest use of such tracking devices, we propose a National Tracking Center. This paper describes what the attributes of such a center would be and how it could ultimately be the prototype for an International Tracking Center, possibly to be based in Vienna, at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Blockade of Germany By the Royal Navy was {{a highly}} {{effective}} technique to prevent Germans from importing food, raw materials, and other supplies. It repeatedly violated neutral rights, and the United States repeatedly objected. British diplomacy {{had to deal with}} that crisis. The loophole in the blockade system was shipments to neutral countries, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, which then sold the supplies to Germany. To stop that the British closely <b>monitor</b> <b>shipments</b> to neutral countries, declared almost all commodities were contraband and would be seized, rationed imports to neutrals, and searched neutral merchant ships Allied ports. They also blacklisted American firms know to trade with Germany. [...] The United States protested but Wilson decided to tolerate Britain's policy.|$|R
40|$|Australian forest {{industries}} {{have a long}} history of export trade of a wide range of products from woodchips (for paper manufacturing), sandalwood (essential oils, carving and incense) to high value musical instruments, flooring and outdoor furniture. For the high value group, fluctuating environmental conditions brought on by changes in temperature and relative humidity, can lead to performance problems due to consequential swelling, shrinkage and/or distortion of the wood elements. A survey determined the types of value-added products exported, including species and dimensions packaging used and export markets. Data loggers were installed with <b>shipments</b> to <b>monitor</b> temperature and relative humidity conditions. These data were converted to timber equilibrium moisture content values to provide an indication of the environment that the wood elements would be acclimatising to. The results of the initial survey indicated that primary high value wood export products included guitars, flooring, decking and outdoor furniture. The destination markets were mainly located in the northern hemisphere, particularly the United States of America, China, Hong Kong, Europe (including the United Kingdom), Japan, Korea and the Middle East. Other regions importing Australian-made wooden articles were south-east Asia, New Zealand and South Africa. Different timber species have differing rates of swelling and shrinkage, so the types of timber were also recorded during the survey. Results from this work determined that the major species were ash-type eucalypts from south-eastern Australia (commonly referred to in the market as Tasmanian oak), jarrah from Western Australia, spotted gum, hoop pine, white cypress, black butt, brush box and Sydney blue gum from Queensland and New South Wales. The environmental conditions data indicated that microclimates in shipping containers can fluctuate extensively during shipping. Conditions at the time of manufacturing were usually between 10 and 12...|$|R
40|$|The Authenticated Tracking and Monitoring System (ATMS) {{answers the}} need for global {{monitoring}} of the status and location of sensitive items on a worldwide basis, 24 hours a day. ATMS uses wireless sensor packs to monitor {{the status of the}} items and environmental conditions. A receiver and processing unit collect a variety of sensor event data. The collected data are transmitted to the INMARSAT satellite communication system, which then sends the data to appropriate ground stations. Authentication and encryption algorithms secure the data during communication activities. A typical ATMS application would be to track and monitor the safety and security of a number of items in transit along a scheduled shipping route. The resulting tracking, timing, and status information could then be processed to ensure compliance with various agreements. Following discussions between the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO), the US Department of Energy (DOE), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in early 1995, the parties mutually agreed to conduct and evaluate a field trial prototype ATMS to track and <b>monitor</b> <b>shipments</b> of uranium ore concentrate (UOC) from an operating uranium mine in Australia to a final destination in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with numerous stops along the way. During the months of February and March 1998, the trial was conducted on a worldwide basis, with tracking and monitoring stations located at sites in both Australia and the US. This paper describes ATMS and the trial...|$|R
