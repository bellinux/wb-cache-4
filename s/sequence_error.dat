40|$|Automated DNA sequencers {{generate}} chromatograms {{that contain}} raw sequencing data. They also generate data that translates the chromatograms into molecular sequences of A, C, G, T, or N (undetermined) characters. Since chromatogram translation programs frequently introduce errors, a manual {{inspection of the}} generated sequence data is required. As sequence numbers and lengths increase, visual inspection and manual correction of chromatograms and corresponding sequences on a per-peak and per-nucleotide basis becomes an error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious process. Here, we introduce ChromatoGate (CG), an open-source software that accelerates and partially automates the inspection of chromatograms and the detection of <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> for bidirectional <b>sequencing</b> runs. To provide users full control over the error correction process, a fully automated error correction algorithm has not been implemented. Initially, the program scans a given multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for potential <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors,</b> assuming that each polymorphic site in the alignment {{may be attributed to}} a <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> with a certain probability. The guided MSA assembly procedure in ChromatoGate detects chromatogram peaks of all characters in an alignment that lead to polymorphic sites, given a user-defined threshold. The threshold value represents the sensitivity of the <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> detection mechanism. After this pre-filtering, the user only needs to inspect a small number of peaks in every chromatogram to correct <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors.</b> Finally, we show that correcting <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> is important, because population genetic and phylogenetic inferences can be misled by MSAs with uncorrected mis-calls.

30|$|There {{were marked}} {{performance}} {{differences between the}} mild and moderate groups that suggest {{that the level of}} handicap has a motor dimension rather than only an intellectual dimension which is the basis for handicap categorization. When one considers the mean total movement time and the mean overall <b>sequence</b> <b>error,</b> as indicators of measures of speed and accuracy, respectively, {{it can be argued that}} the moderate group while showing a gradual increase in accuracy to perform the sequence (decrease of the mean overall <b>sequence</b> <b>error)</b> has also shown an increase in speed (decrease in the mean total movement time) but up to a point, when the response duration starts to increase again. It is as if the individuals with Moderate DS reduce their speed in order to be more accurate in performing the sequence. The mild group did not show this speed-accuracy trade-off. Down syndrome individuals have problems to structure spatially motor sequences also due to limitations associated with memory problems and selective attention (Reid 1980; Horgan 1983; Inui et al. 1995; Lanfranchi et al. 2015). These difficulties would be associated not only with information storage but also with an inability to recognize stimuli and determine strategies for information storage. However, these problems may not be in the same dimension for all DS individuals. There is now a reasonable body of evidence indicating that the difficulties just described may be associated with the level of intellectual deficit (Conners et al. 2008; Frenkel and Bourdin 2010; Edgin et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the differences in the incidence of reversals and <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> in reading among Native students, male and female, aged 7, 8, 9, and 10 years old who spoke Cree and/or English. The students were in Grades 1 - 3 at the Roman Catholic School, Anglican Church of Canada School and Grade 4 at Chief Taylor School at Onion Lake Reserve, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan-Alberta. The dependent variable of the study was the number of reversal and <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> in reading. The former are defined as the inversion of single letters, such as "big" for "dig". The latter are the total or partial inversion of letters in words, such as "was" for "saw". The independent variables were gender, age, and linguality in Cree and/or English. All the students in the target population of 159 were rated for facility in Cree and English language utilizing rating scales. The language rating data was transferred onto bivariate matrices for the 7 / 8 and 9 / 10 year age groups. The target population of 159 students decreased to a sample of 55 Native students. Data were collected by the administration of a revised version of the Test of Directional Attack on Words. The test consisted of 60 monosyllable isolated isolated words. The students orally read the words and the exact pronunciations were transcribed onto the test response sheet. The three hypotheses, were analyzed by employing a three-way (2 x 2 x 2) analysis of variance. This three-way AN OVA measured the effects of gender, age, and linguality in Cree and/or English on the incidence of reversal and <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> in reading. No significant difference in reversal and <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> in reading was found between male and female Native students. A significant difference (p < 0. 05) was found between 7 / 8 year old Native students and 9 / 10 year old Native students.

No significant difference in reversal and <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> in reading was found between English dominant and bilingual Cree-English Native students. The study concluded that: 1. The gender of Native students did not relate to the incidence of reversal and <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> in reading. 2.

However, because these new technologies are error prone and yield uneven coverage of alleles in diploid individuals, they also introduce the need for novel methods for analyzing the raw read data. A maximum-likelihood method for the estimation of allele frequencies is developed, eliminating both the need to arbitrarily discard individuals with low coverage and the requirement for an extrinsic measure of the <b>sequence</b> <b>error</b> rate.

40|$|Many {{data sets}} one could use for {{population}} genetics contain artifactual sites, i. e., <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors.</b> Here, we first explore {{the impact of}} such errors on several common summary statistics, assuming that <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors</b> are mostly singletons.

We further show that even with a moderate number of <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors,</b> neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum reject neutrality. This implies that analyses of data sets with such errors will systematically lead to wrong inferences of evolutionary scenarios. To avoid to these errors, we propose two new estimators of Œ∏ that ignore singletons as well as two new tests Y and Y* {{that can be used to}} test neutrality despite <b>sequencing</b> <b>errors.</b> All in all, we show that even though singletons are ignored, these new tests show some power to detect deviations from a standard neutral model.

40|$|The recent {{release of}} twenty-two new genome {{sequences}} has dramatically increased the data available for mammalian comparative genomics, but twenty {{of these new}} sequences are currently limited to ~ 2 √ó coverage. Here we examine the extent of <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> in these 2 √ó assemblies, and its potential impact in downstream analyses. By comparing 2 √ó assemblies with high-quality sequences from the ENCODE regions, we estimate the rate of <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> to be 1 ‚Äì 4 errors per kilobase. While this error rate is fairly modest, <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> can still have surprising effects. For example, an apparent lineage-specific insertion in a coding region {{is more likely to}} reflect <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> than a true biological event, and the length distribution of coding indels is strongly distorted by error. We find that most errors are contributed by a small fraction of bases with low quality scores, in particular, by the ends of reads in regions of single-read coverage in the assembly. We explore several approaches for automatic <b>sequencing</b> <b>error</b> mitigation (SEM), making use of the localized nature of <b>sequencing</b> <b>error,</b> {{the fact that it is}} well predicted by quality scores, and information about errors that comes from comparisons across species. Our automatic methods for error mitigation cannot replace the need for additional sequencing, but they do allow substantial fractions of errors to be masked or eliminated at the cost of modest amounts of over-correction, and they can reduce the impact of error in downstream phylogenomic analyses.

40|$|PhD ThesisWireless {{channel is}} not very conducive towards {{error-free}} raw data transmission. On the other hand the tremendous growth in wireless services has made the channel bandwidth a scarce resource and effective utilization of this resource is mandatory. Thus it is instructive to know the limits of a wireless channel. Shannon√¢ s theorems on channel capacity have been used so far to find the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over any noisy channel. The theorem calculates the minimum {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) required to transmit data across a channel with zero probability of <b>sequence</b> <b>error.</b> However the result is practically inhibitive, as it requires encoding and decoding of infinite length code sequences. Practical finite codes never achieve this zero error limit. For practical code design bit-error-rate is often a preferred metric over <b>sequence</b> <b>error</b> rate. However there is no satisfactory method to compare the Shannon√¢ s capacity results with the bit error rate performance of the practical codes. We introduce the notion of distorted channel capacity to bridge this gap. This measure defines the capacity of a channel when a particular bit-error-rate is allowed. It can also be used as a benchmark to measure the √¢ goodness√¢ of a code. Our results show that most of the practical codes lie far beyond the capacity limit. We see that Turbo codes and the convolutional codes come close to this achievable at a prohibitively large computational cost. Specifically, for the convolutional codes the performance improves with large constraint length codes. However the optimal decoding complexity of the convolutional codes grow exponentially with this parameter. We propose a suboptimal decoding technique that has linear complexity {{in the size of the}} constraint length and provides close to optimal performance. We further extend our results to a multiuser environment. The optimal joint decoding complexity of multiple users data symbols is exponential in the number of users. Our proposed iterative joint interference cancellation and decoding technique provides computational gain without performance loss. Texas InstrumentsNokiaNational Science Foundatio...|$|E

The moderate group presented a less stable action program expressed in the variability in sequencing and timing. Their longer reaction times also suggest a heavy demand on central processing in accord with the one-target advantage hypothesis and also due to memory deficits to select and plan movements.|$|E

In this work, further analytic evidence for these observations is provided. A set of conditions is presented, for which Bayes decision rule with sentence and word error cost function leads to the same decisions. Furthermore, the case of word error cost is investigated and related to word posterior probabilities. The analytic results are verified experimentally on several large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. 1...|$|E
