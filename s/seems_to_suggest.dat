5|$|The Sharabha Upanishad {{mentions}} that shara means jiva ("soul") and Hari (Vishnu) is {{gleaming in the}} form of Sharabha, and that Hari has manifested as Sharabha who is capable of granting moksha (salvation). There is a reference to Sharabha in the Vishnu sahasranama, the 1000 names of Vishnu, and the literal meaning <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the praise of Sharabha (the lion-killing animal).|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, {{recorded}} by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037. This strike could have been undertaken {{in the context of}} the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at this point in his career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, {{which may be}} far older than {{was assumed to be}} the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the collection also served—at least partially—as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Ímar's {{probable}} uncle, Sitriuc, ruled Dublin {{for almost}} fifty years between 989 and 1036. There {{is reason to}} suspect that the latter's realm included Mann by the second or third decade of the eleventh century. His reign in Dublin was finally put to an end by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065), who drove Sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself. Previously, Sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with Knútr Sveinnsson (died 1035), ruler of the kingdoms of England, Denmark, and Norway. Knútr's apparent authority in the Irish Sea region, coupled with Sitriuc's seemingly close connections with him, could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by Sitriuc during Knútr's reign. It is possible that Echmarcach had been bound from taking action against Sitriuc whilst Knútr held power, and that the confusion caused by the latter's death in 1035 enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of the Irish Sea region. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann by this date, Sitriuc {{does not appear to have}} taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the island was outside Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Excessive {{measures}} {{of performance and}} constant reactivity to performance appraisals challenge the very purpose {{of the system of}} performance appraisals, but performance evaluations can still offer organizations feedback about their practices.

However, a phenomenon known as the performance paradox <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that performance evaluations may not be altogether futile.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{history of}} this 9th century CE Insular/Anglo-Saxon manuscript after its production is equally speculative. However, the existing evidence <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that at some point}} after its production in the later 9th and early 10th centuries this codex may have been subsequently relocated somewhere in unoccupied Mercia, presumably Worcester, or even Wessex. This evacuation, along with other ecclesiastical manuscripts, was to provide a safe environment or repository to protect the book from potential Viking raids and incursions.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} for the natural incline of the ground on which the market stands, its builders undertook significant earthworks. These earthworks have been dated as being amongst the oldest Roman constructions, and their orientation vis-à-vis the forum <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that they were not built on any earlier foundations. The modern-day location of the remains from the market near the forum should however not be misunderstood as indicating a link between the two. The market was almost completely destroyed during the construction of the Byzantine fort. It was excavated in 1918-1919.|$|E
25|$|Since Moses is {{described}} by the Bible as encountering Jethro, a Kenite who was a Midianite priest, shortly before encountering Sinai, this suggests that Sinai would be somewhere near their territory in Saudi Arabia; the Kenites and Midianites appear to have resided east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Additionally, the Song of Deborah, which some textual scholars consider {{one of the oldest}} parts of the Bible, portrays God as having dwelt at Mount Seir, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that this equates with Mount Sinai; Mount Seir designates the mountain range in the centre of Edom.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, {{as well as the}} division of days into twelve parts, came from the Babylonians. It is they, according to Herodotus' Histories (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the Suda <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest,</b> it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} trade, and the relationship, Zhongshan had with other states can be roughly ascertained from {{the amount of}} a {{currency}} {{was found in the}} ruins of Lingshou: the yan knife coins from Yan were plentiful, with some 374 being found, whereas the gandan, baihua, and lin coins of Zhao are rare, with only 100 of them, combined, found. This reflects the hostile relations Zhao had with Zhongshan, and the good relations Yan had with Zhongshan. Indeed, even the similarities of the yan and chengbo knife coins <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> their friendly relationship, as they were of similar size and of equal weight, with both weighing fifteen grams, meaning that they would be interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|Evaluation of {{numerous}} public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each individual component ordinarily attributed to poverty (for example, sanitation, health education and underlying nutrition status) often have minimal impact on transmission. For example, {{one study found}} that the introduction of latrines into a resource-limited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent. However, another study in Salvador, Brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact (p<0.0001) on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact at all on the intensity of hookworm infection. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms. It is imperative, therefore, that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education, sanitation, and treatment.|$|E
