5000|$|Sheet metal screws (sometimes called [...] "sheet-metal self-tappers", or P-K screws {{from the}} brand name Parker Kalon - who pioneered the {{manufacture}} of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of self-tapping screw despite the thread created in the sheet of metal being small.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an experimental evaluation {{pertaining to the}} influence of steel <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> on its twisting-in specimens made of various materials and its twisting-out process. Main principles of the investigation methodology including description of  technological scheme of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> electro-arc machining and specimens applied while executing the experiments and hardware measuring tools used for fixation of torque which has been applied to the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> during its twisting-in in the specimen  and its twisting-out process have been presented in the paper. It has been established that the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> electro-arc machining initiates formation of dimples (holes) which have solidified metal flows along their edges. The flows give a cutting ability to the screw and so they exert an influence on the conditions of screw’s interaction with the specimen during its twisting-in and twisting-out processes. The paper presents results of experimental investigations that demonstrate an impact of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> electro-arc machining on its twisting-in in the specimens made of various materials and twisting-out procedure. In particular, it has been ascertained that torque value applied to the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> with modified surface during twisting-in process is less in comparison with the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> having an initial state of its surface {{and in the case of}} its twisting-out process the value is higher. In this respect difference between the indicated torque values is increasing when material hardness of the specimen becomes higher.   </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{experimental}} {{study on the}} <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw’s</b> pullout resistance in the wood structure was conducted. Domestic ordinary screws were used together with imported or domestic wood to fabricate 6 screw connection specimens in wooden walls. Then monotonic loading tests were conducted {{and it can be}} concluded that, the common round screw connection strength mainly depends on the failure mode, the lack of cooperation effect significantly influences the strength of screw connections, and the dispersion of screw connection stiffness is high. So, to obtain formulae for the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> connection strength and stiffness by further experimental study will be very necessary...|$|R
50|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> can {{be divided}} into two classes; those that {{displace}} material (especially plastic and thin metal sheets) without removing it are termed thread-forming self-tapping screws; self-tappers with sharp cutting surfaces that remove the material as they are inserted are termed self-cutting.|$|E
5000|$|Wall {{thickness}} of boss: Wall thicknesses for bosses {{should be less}} than 60 percent of the nominal wall to minimize sinking. However, if the boss {{is not in a}} visible area, then the wall thickness can be increased to allow for increased stresses imposed by <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws.</b> It is recommended that wall {{thickness of}} boss should be around 0.6 times of nominal wall thickness depending on the material.|$|E
50|$|Drywall screws heads have {{a curved}} taper, which {{allows them to}} self-pilot and install rapidly without having to be punched through the paper cover. When {{finished}} driving, these screws are recessed slightly into the drywall. Screws for light-gauge steel framing have an acute point and finely spaced threads. If the steel framing is heavier than 20-gauge, <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> with finely spaced threads must be used.

30|$|In this study, the {{characteristic}} strength properties {{of a joint}} constructed with structural glulam members made of fast-grown Japanese cedar was evaluated.

50|$|Pocket-hole joinery, or pocket-screw joinery, {{involves}} {{drilling a hole}} at {{an angle}} — usually 15 degrees — into one workpiece, and then joining it to a second workpiece with a <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw.</b> The technique, in addition to doweling, {{is said to have}} its roots in ancient Egypt, although much doubt is thrown on this theory. Older woodworking reference books never mention the technique of pocket-hole joinery and contemporary woodworking references describe it as new and nontraditional.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> {{are also}} self-drilling, which means that, in {{addition}} to the tap-like flute in the leading threads, there is also a preliminary drill-like fluted tip that looks much like the tip of a center drill. These screws combine a thrilling-like action and the fastener installation itself into only one driving motion (instead of separate drilling, tapping, and installing motions); they are thus very efficient in a variety of hard-substrate applications, from assembly lines to roofing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> {{are widely}} used for driving into sheet metal or {{plastics}} and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into a pre-pierced hole. Self-drilling screws have some ability to cut a thread, as for a tap. Others work not by cutting, but rather by roll-forming the thread, pushing excess material {{out of the way}} by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} {{distinction is}} that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure {{to the opposite side}} of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of the thread fastenings have been known and used for decades {{with the purpose of}} joining one component to another. Threaded fastenings are popular because they permit easy disassembly for maintenance, repair, relocation and recycling. Screw insertions are typically carried out manually. It is a difficult problem to automat. As a result there is very little published research on automating threaded fastenings, and most research on automated assembly focus on the peg-in-hole assembly problem. This paper investigates the problem of automated monitoring of the screw insertion process. The monitoring problem deals with predicting integrity of a threaded insertion, based on the torque vs. insertion depth curve generated during the insertions. The authors have developed an analytical model to predict the torque signature signals during <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> insertions. However, the model requires parameters on the screw dimensions and plate material properties are difficult to measure. This paper presents a study on on-line identification during screw fastenings. An identification methodology for two unknown parameter estimation during a <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> insertion process is presented. It is shown that friction and screw properties required by the model can be reliably estimated on-line. Experimental results are presented to validate the identification procedure...|$|R

The aircraft was then sold to RKO in 1939. The transport ended its career as a non-flying film prop, appearing in ground roles (in the 1942 Flying Tigers, starring John Wayne, and in other features) before reportedly being scrapped around 1950, after having slowly become a back lot relic. Flying shots in Five Came Back used a XC-12 miniature, due to the aircraft having been permanently grounded by the studio's insurance company.|$|E
50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|E
30|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> {{of small}} sizes are {{commonly}} used in wood furniture and panel products {{on the assembly line}} or for do-it-yourself products applications. <b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> usually provide good holding ability and operation efficiency in wood working projects. In recent years, <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws,</b> especially medium and large sizes, have drawn attention in timber engineering for connection application in Europe. They are not just an alternative fastener {{that can be used for}} timber connection. Certain requirements for current structure design and construction details need to be verified in the interest of safety. Most <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> can be laid out with small spacing and edge distance without the risk of splitting wood, which often happens with bolted connections. Uibel and Blaß [1] tried to identify suitable spacing and distance for <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> with corresponding minimum timber thickness. They further modeled a moving load during the screw-in process with factors of wood density, screw-in speed, angle between screw axis and growth ring tangent. The resulted split areas were simulated mostly by a FE model. This gave practical information about the application of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> to timber construction.|$|E

Temporary fixation distal to the osteotomy is performed with a K-wire drilled through a guiding sleeve. Plate position is checked fluoroscopically. As the TomoFix is an internal fixator, precise fit to the femur is not necessary. After drilling, at least four <b>self-tapping</b> locking <b>screws</b> are inserted distally. Next, a bicortical <b>self-tapping</b> lag <b>screw</b> is inserted eccentrically in the dynamic part of the combi-hole directly superior to the osteotomy putting the osteotomy under axial compression. Three self-tapping monocortical or bicortical (depending on bone quality and patient’s stature) screws are inserted in the remaining holes proximal of the lag screw. Finally, the lag screw is changed for a <b>self-tapping</b> bicortical locking <b>screw</b> inserted in the locking part of the combi-hole.

5000|$|A <b>{{self-tapping}}</b> <b>screw</b> is a screw {{that can}} tap its own hole {{as it is}} driven into the material. For hard [...] such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting {{a gap in the}} continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a [...] and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine screw cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.|$|R

30|$|The {{characteristic}} strength properties of structural glulam connections assembled with <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> were examined following the ASTM testing procedure in the study.

And, the screws with both double-threaded sections and fully threaded shanks were higher than those of single-threaded screws. An improvement on the initial stiffness of a connection was found when the number of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> increased. The connections assembled with the toe-nailing approach from the beam’s bottom surface provided higher maximum loading capacity, medium initial stiffness, and a larger ductility factor, resulting in higher dissipated energy with less fragile failure. The derived allowable loading values for a beam–girder connection fastened with <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> using the face-nailing approach were close to the code values for bolted and pinned connections. And, a toe-nailing approach provided higher allowable loads for connections than using a face-nail approach.|$|E

It is suggested that <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> with 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm screw connections. <b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> with fully threaded shanks showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded screw connections, but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using screws with half-threaded shank. The nailing approach of using <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A self-tapping screw connection with derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|E

In general, the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with 12 <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> was 11.7  % higher than that with 8 screws. Findings further showed the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with a half-threaded shank and <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> had significant improvement when increasing from 8 to 12 screws, i.e., 38.6 and 63.3  % for 8 and 10  mm screws (F 8 - 260 - 12 and F 10 - 260 - 12), respectively. However, no further improvement in the maximum load capacity was found for the double-threaded and fully threaded screws as assembled from 8 to 12 screws. Some specimens fastened with 12 screws failed with a split along the glue line where screws were arranged during the assembly. It might limit the improvement of a connection through increasing number of fasteners. In the case of initial stiffness of a beam–girder connection, an improvement of 50.4  % was found when the number of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> used to assemble the glulam structure was increased from 8 to 12.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} sacroiliac luxation repair with positional screw insertion {{from the}} ventral {{surface of the}} sacral wing via a ventral abdominal approach in cats. ANIMALS: 18 European shorthair cats. PROCEDURES: All cats underwent clinical examination including orthopedic and neurologic examination and assessment of lameness and pain before and immediately after surgery and 6 and 16 weeks after surgery. All sacroiliac luxations were stabilized with a single positional 2. 4 -mm cortical titanium <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw.</b> The pelvic floor was also repaired in selected cats. Screw entry points and angles determined in a prior study of cadavers were used. Radiographs were taken before surgery and during follow-up evaluations to assess postoperative sacroiliac luxation reduction, implant placement, and repair stability. RESULTS: All implants were placed correctly. Iatrogenic sciatic nerve injuries occurred in 2 cats. Median time to ambulation was 1. 5 days for cats with sacroiliac luxation as the sole injury. Radiographic outcome of sacroiliac luxation repair was excellent in 15 of 17 repairs, good in 1 of 17 repairs, and poor in 1 of 17 repairs. Clinical outcome was excellent in 11 of 15 cats and good in 4 of 15 cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Insertion of a positional screw across the sacroiliac joint via a ventral abdominal approached can be an alternative to conventional techniques of sacroiliac luxation repair in cats.
