A maximum concentration of 15 matm-cm of SO 2 was observed west of Hawaii on April 15; the minimum detectable amount of SO 2 in a single scan is about 1 matm-cm. The disappearance of the band structure at wavelengths below 300 nm indicates that the SO 2 was between 20 km and 30 km altitude.

The meteorological conditions (warmer temperatures, the absence of polar stratospheric clouds) at these latitudes do not seem to favor heterogeneous chemistry as the direct cause for the observed year-round ozone reduction. A mechanism involving the seasonal transport of ozone-poor air from within the polar vortex to lower latitudes (the so-called 'dilution effect') is proposed as a possible explanation for the observed year-round ozone reduction in subpolar regions. A two-dimensional model with an imposed springtime Antarctic ozone depletion is used to study the post-ozone hole impact on the spatial and temporal distributions of column ozone at latitudes north of 60 deg S. It is found that the time constant associated with the dilution effect in the latitude region 40 - 60 deg S is about 1 year, long enough to contribute to the observed year-round decrease of total ozone in that region...|$|R

By measuring {{the intensity of}} a series of nitric oxide (NO) gamma band fluorescence features in this wavelength range, it has been possible to estimate the amount of NO in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The background of atmospherically scattered sunlight normally masks the much weaker NO gamma band emission, but these emission features are discriminated by subtracting a synthetic spectrum calculated for a model atmosphere that includes only Rayleigh scattering and absorption by ozone and oxygen. The resulting difference plot clearly reveals features resulting from processes not included in the simple model, such as NO gamma band emission. Nitric oxide is inferred by measuring the absolute intensity of various bands relative to the adjacent background and relating this intensity to total NO above an altitude determined by the backscattering contribution function for that band.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of the atmospheric pollution problem are the anthropogenic impacts on the stratospheric ozone layer, the related trends of the total ozone content drop and the solar ultraviolet radiation enhancement at the Earth's surface level. During September 2002, the ozone hole over the Antarctic was much smaller than in the previous six years. It has split into two separate holes, due to the appearance of sudden stratospheric warming that has never been observed before in the southern hemisphere. The analysis of this unprecedented event is attempted, regarding both the meteorological and photochemical aspects, in terms of the unusual thermal field patterns and the induced polar vortex disturbances.

40|$|NOAA’s {{program of}} long term {{monitoring}} of the vertical distribution of ozone with Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) ozonesondes has undergone a number of changes over the 50 year record. In order to produce a homogenous data set, these changes must be documented and where necessary, appropriate corrections applied. This is the first comprehensive and consistent reprocessing of NOAA’s ozonesonde data records that corrects for these changes using the rawest form of the data (cell current and pump temperature) in native resolution {{as well as a}} point by point uncertainty calculation that is unique to each sounding. The reprocessing is carried out uniformly at all eight ozonesonde sites in NOAA’s network with differences in sensing solution and ozonesonde types accounted for in the same way at all sites. The corrections used to homogenize the NOAA ozonesonde data records greatly improve the ozonesonde measurements with an average one sigma uncertainty of ± 4 – 6  % in the stratosphere and ± 5 – 20  % in the troposphere. A comparison of the integrated column ozone from the ozonesonde profile with co-located Dobson spectrophotometers total column ozone measurements shows agreement within ± 5  % for >  70  % of the profiles.

40|$|Measurements of the {{atmospheric}} backscattered UV albedo {{have been used}} from satellites for more than 20 years to measure ozone. The longest continuous record has been from the <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> (SBUV) and TOMS on the Nimbus 7 satellite, which have been in operation since November of 1978. Because of degradation in space of the diffuser plate used to measure extraterrestrial solar flux, it has been necessary to develop new techniques to maintain the calibration of these instruments. Calibration is maintained by requiring that ozone measured by different wavelength pairs be consistent, and by requiring that ozone measured at different solar zenith angles be consistent. This technique of using a geophysical quantity, ozone, as a transfer standard for wavelength calibration is very powerful. The recalibrated data {{have been used to}} measure total ozone trends to an accuracy of +/- 1. 3 percent 2 (sigma) error over ten years. No significant trends are found near the equator, but significant trends larger than predicted by homogeneous chemistry are found at middle to high latitudes in both hemispheres.

Globally averaged trends determined from the SME data (- 0. 5 + or - 1. 3 percent/yr) were found to fall within model calculations by Rusch and Clancy (1988); the SBUV trends, on the other hand, were found to exceed maximum predicted ozone decreases {{by a factor of}} 3 or more. Detailed comparison of the two data sets indicated that an absolute offset of 3 percent/yr accounts for much of {{the difference between the two}} trends; the offset is considered to be due to incomplete characterization of the SBUV calibration drift.

40|$|The {{mid-latitude}} upper {{stratospheric ozone}} profiles {{obtained by the}} <b>solar</b> <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>instrument</b> on the Nimbus 7 satellite show a clear annual cycle both in the absolute ozone amounts between 0. 98 and 15. 6 mbar and in the magnitude of disturbances that reveal themselves as longitudinal structure. At the lowest pressure analyzed a winter maximum in ozone exists, but as one progresses downward in altitude {{a shift in the}} temporal phase of the annual cycle occurs in the vicinity of 3 to 4 mbar. Comparison of the observed behavior with the predictions of a one-dimensional photochemical model shows a systematic tendency for calculated ozone amount to be 20 - 27 percent below the data for pressures less than 7. 8 mbar. The chemical model successfully predicts the change in phase of the annual cycle, although at a pressure greater than observed. Diagnosis of model results shows the observed shift to be closely coupled to the magnitude of the ozone column density near 3 - 4 mbar. The wavelength-dependent attenuation of the solar radiation field by ozone alters the relative magnitude of the molecular oxygen and ozone dissociation rates, leading to a change in the temporal phase of the annual cycle...|$|E

The data sets are merged based upon comparisons during the 18 -month overlap period in which both instruments were operational. During this period, the average offset between the two time series is less than 2 % in total ozone, and less than 6 % in Umkehr layers 1 - 10. A linear-regression trend model is applied to the extended time series to calculate updated trends as a function of latitude and altitude. Trends through June 1994 are 1. 5 - 2 % per decade less negative than through June 1990 in the tropical middle stratosphere (35 - 40 km) and in the upper stratosphere (45 - 50 km) at mid-latitudes. In the lower stratosphere, the trends are nearly 1. 5 % per decade more negative in the southern hemisphere tropical regions to 25 deg S, but remain relatively unchanged elsewhere. The seasonal structure of the total ozone trends is similar to past trend study results, but the magnitude of the seasonal trend can vary by 2 % per decade depending on the length of the time series.

40|$|We {{have used}} an {{off-line}} 3 -D chemical transport model (CTM) {{to investigate the}} 11 -yr solar cycle response in tropical stratospheric ozone. The model is forced with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (re) analysis (ERA- 40 /operational and ERA-Interim) data for the 1979 – 2005 time period. We have compared the modelled solar response in ozone to observation-based data sets that are constructed using satellite instruments such as Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>UltraViolet</b> <b>instrument</b> (SBUV), Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE). A significant difference is seen between simulated and observed ozone during the 1980 s, which is probably due to inhomogeneities in the ERA- 40 reanalyses. In general, the model with ERA-Interim dynamics shows better agreement with the observations from 1990 onwards than with ERA- 40. Overall both standard model simulations are partially able to simulate a "double peak"-structured ozone solar response with a minimum around 30 km, and these are in better agreement with HALOE than SAGE-corrected SBUV (SBUV/SAGE) or SAGE-based data sets. In the tropical lower stratosphere (TLS), the modelled solar response with time-varying aerosols is amplified through aliasing with a volcanic signal, as the model overestimates ozone loss during high aerosol loading years. However, the modelled solar response with fixed dynamics and constant aerosols shows a positive signal which is in better agreement with SBUV/SAGE and SAGE-based data sets in the TLS. Our model simulations suggests that photochemistry contributes to the ozone solar response in this region. The largest model-observation differences occur in the upper stratosphere where SBUV/SAGE and SAGE-based data show a significant (up to 4 %) solar response whereas the standard model and HALOE do not. This {{is partly due to}} a positive solar response in the ECMWF upper stratospheric temperatures which reduces the modelled ozone signal. The large positive upper stratospheric solar response seen in SBUV/SAGE and SAGE-based data can be reproduced in model runs with fixed dynamical fields (i. e. no inter-annual meteorological changes). As these runs effectively assume no long-term temperature changes (solar-induced or otherwise), it should provide an upper limit of the ozone solar response. Overall, full quantification of the solar response in stratospheric ozone is limited by differences in the observed data sets and by uncertainties in the solar response in stratospheric temperatures...|$|E

Analyses are conducted based on area-weighted zonal means for 0 - 30 degS, 0 - 30 degN, 50 - 30 degS, and 30 - 60 degN. It has been found that, on average, the differences in monthly zonal mean total ozone vary between 0. 3 and 0. 8 % and are well within 1 %. For GTO minus SBUV, the standard deviations and ranges (maximum minus minimum) of the differences regarding monthly zonal mean total ozone vary between 0. 6 - 0. 7 % and 2. 8 - 3. 8 % respectively, depending on the latitude band. The corresponding standard deviations and ranges regarding the differences in monthly zonal mean anomalies show values between 0. 4 - 0. 6 % and 2. 2 - 3. 5 %. The standard deviations and ranges of the differences ground-based minus SBUV regarding both monthly zonal means and anomalies are larger {{by a factor of}} 1. 4 - 2. 9 in comparison to GTO minus SBUV. The ground-based zonal means demonstrate larger scattering of monthly data compared to satellite-based records. The differences in the scattering are significantly reduced if seasonal zonal averages are analyzed. The trends of the differences GTO minus SBUV and ground-based minus SBUV are found to vary between 0. 04 and 0. 1 %/yr (0. 1 and 0. 3 DU/yr). These negligibly small trends have provided strong evidence that there are no significant time-dependent differences among these multiyear total ozone data records. Analyses of the annual deviations from pre- 1980 level indicate that, for the 15 -year period of 1996 to 2010, all three data records show a gradual increase at 30 - 60 degN from 5 % in 1996 to 2 % in 2010. In contrast, at 50 - 30 degS and 30 degS- 30 degN there has been a leveling off in the 15 years after 1996. The deviations inferred from GTO and SBUV show agreement within 1 %, but a slight increase has been found in the differences during the period 1996 - 2010...|$|E
40|$|The Data Assimilation Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center {{provides}} global 3 D ozone fields at six-hour time intervals. Data from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) <b>instrument</b> {{are used}} in the assimilation. TOMS provides total column information and SBUV provides profile information, primarily above the ozone peak. Information below the ozone peak comes from the model. This paper will explore the realism of the assimilated ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere through validation with ozonesondes, Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), and Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) observations. This work is in preparation of using the assimilated ozone in the radiative calculation for the meteorological assimilation {{as well as in the}} derivation of tropospheric ozone...|$|R
40|$|The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{has been}} {{monitoring}} {{the ozone layer}} from space using optical remote sensing techniques since 1970. With concern over catalytic destruction of ozone (mid- 1970 s) {{and the development of}} the Antarctic ozone hole (mid- 1980 s), long term ozone monitoring has become the primary focus of NASA's series of ozone measuring instruments. A series of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) and SBUV (<b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet)</b> <b>instruments</b> has produced a nearly continuous record of global ozone from 1979 to the present. These instruments infer ozone by measuring sunlight backscattered from the atmosphere in the ultraviolet through differential absorption. These measurements have documented a 15 Dobson Unit drop in global average ozone since 1980, and the declines in ozone in the antarctic each October have been far more dramatic. Instruments that measure the ozone vertical distribution, the SBUV and SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) instruments for example, show that the largest changes are occurring in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. The goal of ozone measurement in the next decades will be to document the predicted recovery of the ozone layer as CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) levels decline. This will require a continuation of global measurements of total column ozone on a global basis, but using data from successor instruments to TOMS. Hyperspectral instruments capable of measuring in the UV will be needed for this purpose. Establishing the relative roles of chemistry and dynamics will require instruments to measure ozone in the troposphere and in the stratosphere with good vertical resolution. Instruments that can measure other chemicals important to ozone formation and destruction will also be needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{ozone data}} record from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura {{satellite}} {{has proven to}} be very stable over the 10 -plus years of operation. The OMI total column ozone processed through the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) ozone retrieval algorithm (version 8. 5) has been compared with ground-based measurements and with ozone from a series of SBUV/ 2 (<b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet)</b> <b>instruments.</b> Comparison with an ensemble of Brewer–Dobson sites shows an absolute offset of about 1. 5 % and almost no relative trend. Comparison with a merged ozone data set (MOD) created by combining data from a series of SBUV/ 2 instruments again shows an offset, of about 1 %, and a relative trend of less than 0. 5 % over 10 years. The offset is mostly due {{to the use of the}} old Bass–Paur ozone cross sections in the OMI retrievals rather than the Brion–Daumont–Malicet cross sections that are now recommended. The bias in the Southern Hemisphere is smaller than that in the Northern Hemisphere, 0. 9 % vs. 1. 5 %, for reasons that are not completely understood. When OMI was compared with the European realization of a multi-instrument ozone time series, the GTO (GOME type Total Ozone) data set, there was a small trend of about − 0. 85 % decade − 1. Since all the comparisons of OMI relative to other ozone measuring systems show relative trends that are less than 1 % decade − 1, we conclude that the OMI total column ozone data are sufficiently stable that they can be used in studies of ozone trends...|$|R
