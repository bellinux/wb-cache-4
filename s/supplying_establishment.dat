Initially, General William C. Westmoreland exercised this command through the Chief, Naval Advisory Group. However, the increasing demands of the war required a distinct operational rather than an advisory headquarters for naval units. As a result, on 1 April 1966, Naval Forces, Vietnam, was established to control the Navy's units in the II, III, and IV Corps Tactical Zones. This eventually included the major combat formations: Coastal Surveillance Force (Task Force 115), River Patrol Force (Task Force 116), and Riverine Assault Force (Task Force 117). The latter unit formed the naval component of the joint Army-Navy Mobile Riverine Force. Commander Naval Forces, Vietnam (COMNAVFORV) also controlled the Naval Support Activity, Saigon (NSA Saigon), which supplied naval forces in the II, III, and IV Corps areas.

H 2 O). Seven weeks after planting, dry matter production, leaf area, N yield, nodulation, nodule-P concentration and acetylene reduction activity increased strongly with P supply. Enhanced leaf area was due mainly to increases in individual leaf size, especially in the large-leaved C. macrocarpum. Shoot-N concentration of all species increased with P supply, which was attributed to increased nodule mass and N 2 fixation, but not to {{a greater proportion of}} leaf material. The response to P supply in leaf number, leaf size and leaf-to-stem ratio as well as nodule number and weight differed among species.

40|$|Nominally free, {{unrestricted}} {{training in}} portable computer skills {{is offered by}} the majority of U. S. temporary help <b>supply</b> (THS) <b>establishments,</b> a practice that is inconsistent with the competitive model of training. This paper asks why temporary help firms provide free general skills training. The answer proposed is that in addition to skills formation, training plays an informational role at THS firms by eliciting private information about worker ability. The model is built on the premise that training is more productive and therefore valuable to high ability workers. Firms offer a package of training and initially lower wages that induces self-selection. Workers of high perceived ability choose training in anticipation of a steeper wage profile while low ability workers are deterred by limited expected gains. Firms profit from their sunk training investment via their short-run informational advantage about ability and thereby limited monopsony power. Market competition among THS firms reduces employer rents, yielding higher wages and more training. Detailed tests of the model using representative establishment data on wages and training find strong support. The analysis demonstrates that beyond providing spot market labor, THS firms gather and sell information about worker quality to clients. The rapid growth of THS as a labor market information broker implies that the demand for worker screening is rising. (JEL D 82, J 31...|$|R
