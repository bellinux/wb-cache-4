40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of varying levels of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> on <b>feed</b> intake, digestibility and rumen fermentation of goats fed corn silage as roughages. Eight growing crossed Thai native x Anglo-Nubian goats between 8 - 10 months of age and pre-trial average body weight of 14. 2 ± 1. 7 kg were allotted into two groups on the basis of body weight in a randomized double 4 x 4 Latin square design to investigate the utilization of concentrate mixtures of varying levels of <b>Sunflower</b> <b>Seed</b> <b>Meal</b> (SSM). The four concentrate mixtures had SSM included at 0 % (control), 7. 3 % (SSM 1), 14. 5 % (SSM 2) and 22. 0 % (SSM 3) in concentrate as replacing Soybean Meal (SBM) with SSM as 25 % CP, 50 % CP and 75 % CP, respectively. On average, all parameters measured, including Dry Matter Intake (DMI), nutrients digestibility, ruminal ammonia-N (NH-N), ruminal total Volatile Fatty Acid (total VFA), individual VFAs concentration 3 (mM/L), microbial N supply and N retention increased (p< 0. 05) with the addition of SSM in concentrate up to 14. 5 % (SSM 2) in concentrate, thereafter decreased (p< 0. 05) in goats fed SSM 22 % (SSM 3). The results indicated that replacing SBM with SSM as 50 %CP (SSM 2), resulted in higher animal performance as a consequence of improved ruminal fermentation, microbial yield and N balance, but decreased (p< 0. 05) with 22. 0 % SSM diet. It is concluded that <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> can successfully replace soybean meal 50 % CP as a protein source in growing goats...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} growth {{performance}} and nutritive value of carp fed diets containing moderate levels of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> in partial replacement of fishmeal. Four isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were formulated with 0 % (control), 15 %, 30 %, or 45 % <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> and fed to triplicate groups of carp (993. 82 ± 11. 68 g). Growth {{was assessed using}} a range of biometric parameters and nutrient utilization was determined by muscle content, fatty acids, and electrophoretic protein profiles of tissues. Condition factor and survival were unaffected by the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> level butweight gain, protein efficiency rate, and absolute and specific growth ratessignificantly declined as the inclusion level rose. Feed conversion ratio negatively correlated with SGR and reflected feed intake. There were no significant effects on protein, lipid, or pH content of fish, but there were slight alterations in dry matter and ash values. Total saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) dropped as the incorporation of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> increased, contrary to total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of both diets and flesh. Minor differences existed in the fractions of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins, independent of the dietary treatment. In conclusion, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> inclusion beyond 15 % can lead to changes in growth performance and fatty acid composition...|$|R

30|$|Recently, SSF {{has built}} up {{reliability}} in many industries and has evolved as an interesting substitute to SLF (Singhania et al. 2009). Severe foaming problems usually result from the production of biosurfactants in SLF and therefore, researches have suggested their production in SSF. Of these biosurfactants, RLs {{have been the most}} attractive for their production in SSF in recent years. The present work aimed at the optimization of the fermentation conditions for RL production in SSF. Twelve different solid substrates or combinations of solid substrates were screened for the production of RLs by the hyperproducing mutant 15 GR using GMSM as the impregnating solution. Selection of an appropriate substrate is an important feature of SSF since it acts as both a source of nutrients and a physical support (Pandey 2003). As shown in the results, the highest RL level was obtained with the mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal.</b> Sugarcane bagasse, a porous residue obtained from cane stalks after the juice extraction from sugarcane (Soccol et al. 2010) consists chiefly of cellulose and hemicelluloses, lignin, nitrogenous compounds, and ash (Abdullah et al. 2006). <b>Sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> is obtained by grinding <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> which are rich in lipids, carbohydrates and proteins (Alberton et al. 2010). The high RL levels obtained using this mixture {{may be due to the}} fact that oils usually stimulate RL production, as reported in previous SLF studies (Benincasa and Accorsini 2008; Costa et al. 2006; Trummler et al. 2003). Another explanation may be that the mixture of substrates resulted in a substrate bed with properties superior to single substrates. Using <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> alone caused the solid substrate to compact considerably probably due to its high lipid content. Sugarcane bagasse acts as a bulking agent, improving the substrate bed properties (Alberton et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|Six Erlenmeyer flasks {{containing}} 10  g of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> mixture were prepared. Twenty milliliters of impregnating solution (MSM[*]+[*]glycerol 5 %) inoculated with 1 % v/v of seed {{culture was}} mixed into the solid substrate and these flasks were incubated at 30  °C, initial pH 8 with no agitation. Over an incubation period of 12  days, one flask was removed at specific time intervals for extraction and determination of RL concentration.

30|$|After {{screening}} {{for the best}} substrate, our first experiment was a kinetic study {{to find out the}} time required for maximum RL production. As shown in the results, a maximum RL concentration of 31.65  g/l-IS (63.3  g/kg-IDS) was obtained after 10  days of incubation. Therefore, results in subsequent experiments were obtained at this time. Upon comparing RL production in SSF with that resulting from SLF using the same impregnating solution as culture media, it was found that SSF (using sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal)</b> resulted in over a threefold increase in RL production, which further proves the superiority of this process.|$|R

In the solid-state fermentation step, a 50 : 50 (by mass) mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> gave 234 units of pNPP-hydrolyzing activity per gram of dry solids at 96 h. This fermented solid was lyophilized and delipidated, packed into a column and used to catalyze the synthesis of biodiesel through the ethanolysis of soybean oil in a medium free of co-solvents, with the reaction mixture being continuously circulated through the column. The best conversion was 95 % after 46 h, which was obtained at 50 ?C, with an alcohol:oil molar ratio of 3 : 1, alcohol addition in two steps and the addition of 1 % of (m/m) water to the reaction medium.

40|$|Abstract: The {{efficacy}} of Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> {{in the diet}} of West African Dwarf (WAD) goats was evaluated in a completely randomized design model for a 56 day period. The diets consist of A (control, without Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal),</b> B (10 % Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> plus 28 % wheat offal) and C (20 % Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> plus 18 % wheat offal). Other ingredients are of fixed percentages. The results revealed increasing crude protein and acid detergent fibre contents as the Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> increased. The intakes of the two components (crude protein and acid detergent fibre) were significantly higher in diet C compared to other diets However, the crude protein digestibility was similar in all the diets while the acid detergent fibre digestibility of the Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> based diet was superior (p 0. 05). Animals on Tigernut <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> based diet gained more weight than those on diet A (control) due probably to higher feed efficiency of these diets (B and C).

30|$|Since {{major changes}} {{have been made in}} the {{fermentation}} conditions for RL production, the time course profile was repeated, using the optimized conditions reached (a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal,</b> an impregnating solution of 20  ml containing 5 %(v/v) glycerol, inoculum size 1 %v/v, pH 8 and incubation temperature of 30  °C). Again, maximum RL production was obtained after 10  days of incubation, however, the RL level this time was about 1.5 fold higher than results obtained in the previous time course study, reaching 46.85  g/l-IS. The obtained value was also about 5.5 folds higher than that obtained using SLF carried out in this study. Moreover, this RL level was obtained in a shorter time than most studies reported so far. In 2008, a maximum RL production of 46  g/l-IS (172  g/kg-IDS) by P. aeruginosa UFPEDA 614 in SSF using a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> with 37.5  ml of impregnating solution containing 10 % v/v glycerol after 12  days was reported (Camilios-Neto et al. 2008). Although our RL yield is comparable with this value when expressed in terms of g/l-IS, our yield expressed in terms of g/kg of solid substrate showed lower values. This may be explained by the smaller volume of impregnating solution used in our study. Moreover, in 2011, the highest RL production of 45  g/l-IS was obtained by the same strain after 12  days of SSF using sugarcane bagasse and corn bran (1 : 1), and an impregnating solution of 35  ml containing 6 % (v/v) of each of glycerol and soybean oil (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011). Therefore, in our study, the mutant 15 GR yielded comparable RL concentrations that were reached in less time and using lower concentrations of carbon source than both these studies. Moreover, although maximum RL concentrations were obtained after 10 days of incubation, high RL levels were already achieved (41.87  g/l-IS (83.74  g/kg-IDS)) by the mutant 15 GR after only 6 days of incubation, unlike Camilios-Neto et al. (2008), whose RL yields reached only about 24  g/l-IS (89  g/kg-IDS) after 6 days of incubation. In addition, in 2017, maximum RL yields of 18.7  g/l was obtained using glycerol as carbon source and rapeseed/wheat bran as matrix (Wu et al. 2017). Our study hence presents an appropriate basis for subsequent studies on RL production using SSF. In conclusion, these results showed that the application of BBD and RSM were successful in enhancing the RL production under SSF by 67 % and a maximum RL concentration of 46.85  g/l-IS was obtained in the present study using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> after only 10  days of incubation. Optimum fermentation conditions were found to be an inoculum size of 1 %v/v, a temperature of 30  °C and a pH of 8. These results suggest that SSF may possibly be a feasible substitute for SLF to produce RLs since our maximum yield was comparable with values that have been obtained in SLF: 23.6  g/l (Noh et al. 2014), 32  g/l (Matsufuji et al. 1997), 36.7  g/l (Muller et al. 2011), and 46  g/l (Linhardt et al. 1989). These findings imply that RL production by P. aeruginosa 15 GR in static tray bioreactors may be successful (Durand 2003). Additional concern to the application of SSF for RL production is hence justified for enhancing RL levels in laboratory-scale work even further and for moving up to pilot scale.|$|R
40|$|A lipolytic {{fermented}} solid {{was produced}} by solid-state fermentation of Rhizopus microsporus CPQBA 312 - 07 DRM on a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> and used, in a packed-bed bioreactor, to pretreat a high-fat wastewater from a meat and sausage processing factory located in São José dos Pinhais, State of Paraná, Brazil. With a hydraulic residence time of 24 h, this pretreatment not only reduced the wastewater’s oil and grease content by up to 96 %, but also increased its 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 /COD) ratio. This ratio was only 0. 19 in the raw wastewater, indicating poor biodegradability, but increased to 0. 55 in the pretreated wastewater, indicating {{that it had a}} sufficiently high biodegradability to be sent to a traditional anaerobic digestion or activated sludge process. After 96 days of operation of the packed bed, a microbiological analysis showed that R. microsporus was still present and viable in the fermented solid.

30|$|Solid-state {{fermentation}} has {{a special}} advantage of preventing the foaming problem that obstructs submerged fermentation processes for rhamnolipid production. In the present work, a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> {{was selected as the}} optimum substrate for rhamnolipid production using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant 15 GR and an impregnating solution including 5 % v/v glycerol. Using Box–Behnken design, the optimum fermentation conditions were found to be an inoculum size 1 % v/v, temperature 30  °C and unlike other studies, pH 8. These optimized conditions yielded a 67 % enhancement of rhamnolipid levels reaching 46.85  g rhamnolipids per liter of impregnating solution, after 10  days, which was about 5.5 folds higher than that obtained by submerged liquid fermentation. Although maximum rhamnolipids concentration was obtained after 10  days of incubation, rhamnolipids concentration already reached high levels (41.87  g/l) after only 6  days. This rhamnolipid level was obtained in a shorter time and using lower carbon source concentrations than most studies reported so far. The findings obtained indicate an enormous potential for employing solid-state fermentation for rhamnolipid production by the studied isolate.|$|R

This was done to avoid interference during orcinol assay (Kosaric and Vardar-Sukan 2014). The aqueous phase was then used for RL quantification. RL concentrations were expressed first as the product mass per kilogram of initial dry solids (g/kg IDS).

Animal performance and development of the intestinal tract and reproductive tract were determined in addition to digestibility and feed passage rate. The LD 12 OP provided a lower AME and nutrient digestibility than calculated and was related to lower live weights. Birds given LD 23 and LD 12 OP showed a faster ovarian and oviduct development between wk 24 and 26 compared with ND.

40|$|An {{experiment}} with 224 weaner pigs (initial BW of 7. 8 kg) {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of dose of dietary phytase supplementation on apparent fecal digestibility of minerals (P, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Cu) and on performance. Four blocks, each with 8 pens of 7 pigs, were formed. Eight dietary treatments were applied to each block in the 43 -d experiment: supplementation of 0 (basal diet), 100, 250, 500, 750, 1, 500, or 15, 000 phytase units (FTU) or of 1. 5 g of digestible P (dP; monocalcium phosphate; positive control) per kilogram of feed. The basal diet, with corn, barley, soybean <b>meal,</b> and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> as the main components, contained 1. 2 g of dP per kilogram of feed. Fresh fecal grab samples were collected in wk 4 and 5 of the experiment. Average daily feed intake, ADG, G:F, and digestibility of all of the minerals increased (P < 0. 001) with increasing Phytase dose. Digestibility of P increased from 34 % in the basal diet to a maximum of 84 % in the diet supplemented with 15, 000 FTU, generating 1. 76 g of dP per kilogram of feed. At this level, 85 % of the phytate phosphorus was digested, compared with 15 % in the basal diet. Compared with the basal diet, digestibility of the monovalent minerals increased maximally at 15, 000 FTU, from 81 to 92 % (Na) and from 76 to 86 % (K). In conclusion, phytase supplementation up to a level of 15, 000 FTU/kg of a dP-deficient diet improved performance of weaner pigs and digestibility of minerals, including monovalent minerals. Up to 85 % of the phytate-P was digested. Thus, dietary phytase supplementation beyond present day standards (500 FTU/kg) could further improve mineral use and consequently reduce mineral output to the environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sixty four newly weaned Awassi lambs (initial BW = 21. 0 ± 0. 75 kg) {{from both}} sexes were {{randomly}} allocated {{to one of}} the four treatments (8 males & 8 females/treatment) and grouped into 8 pens with 8 lambs from each sex per pen. They were then used to evaluate the different sources of protein on a finishing performance trial. The lambs were fed for a period of 114 days using four different rations. These rations were so formulated as to contain the same percentage of crude protein 14 %, but from different sources namely <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (SSM), bitter vetch seed (BVS) and urea. Comparisons were made with the control diet having soybean meal (SBM) as a major source of protein. Four animals from each group were slaughtered and the right leg from each carcass was dissected for examination of differences in muscularity and for carcass and leg composition. Average feed intake over the first 8 weeks of the trial increased linearly (P 0. 05) in final live weight, average live weight gain or average daily gain were detected between lambs given different protein sources. Male lambs, however, had significantly (P> 0. 001) higher final live weight (47. 2 Vs 37. 9 kg), average live weight gain (26719 Vs 16409 g) and average daily gain (234 Vs 144 g/day) than female lambs. The SBM ration had significantly a higher feed efficiency value compared to the other experimental rations (3. 22, 4. 20, 3. 99, and 3. 77 kg/kg for SBM, SSM, BVS, and urea, respectively). The production responses to the rations were observed only in the first 14 days of the experiment.

40|$|The supplementation of {{livestock}} feed with animal protein is a present cause for public concern, and plant protein shortages {{have become increasingly}} prominent in China. This conflict may be resolved by fully utilizing currently available sources of plant protein. We estimated the rumen degradability and the small intestinal digestibility of the amino acids (AA) in rapeseed meal (RSM), soybean <b>meal</b> (SBM), <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (SFM) and sesame meal (SSM) using the mobile nylon bag method to determine the absorbable AA content of these protein supplements as a guide towards dietary formulations for the dairy industry. Overall, this study aimed to utilize protein supplements effectively to guide dietary formulations to increase milk yield and save plant protein resources. To this end, we studied four cows with a permanent rumen fistula and duodenal T-shape fistula in a 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design. The {{results showed that the}} total small intestine absorbable amino acids and small intestine absorbable essential amino acids were higher in the SBM (26. 34 % and 13. 11 % dry matter [DM], respectively) than in the SFM (13. 97 % and 6. 89 % DM, respectively). The small intestine absorbable Lys contents of the SFM, SSM, RSM and SBM were 0. 86 %, 0. 88 %, 1. 43 %, and 2. 12 % (DM basis), respectively, and the absorbable Met contents of these meals were 0. 28 %, 1. 03 %, 0. 52 %, and 0. 47 % (DM basis), respectively. Among the examined food sources, the milk protein score of the SBM (0. 181) was highest followed by those of the RSM (0. 136), SSM (0. 108) and SFM (0. 106). The absorbable amino acid contents of the protein supplements accurately reflected protein availability, which is an important indicator of the balance of feed formulation. Therefore, a database detailing the absorbable AA should be established...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid {{function}} and morphology, liver morphology, some metabolic indices, haematological parameters and growth performance of fattening pigs fed 00 -rapeseed meal (00 -RPM) were examined. The control group was fed {{on a standard}} diet containing 6 % <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (SM) during the growing period and 8 % during the finishing period. The first experimental group was fed a diet in which SM was replaced by equal (6 % and 8 %) amounts of 00 -RPM. The second experimental group was fed with a higher (8 % and 10 %) amount of 00 -RPM. There {{were no significant differences}} between the control and experimental groups in the serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4). Thyroid gland and liver weights were significantly (P < 0. 01) higher in both groups fed 00 -RPM than in the group fed SM. The epithelium of the thyroid gland was cuboidal or columnar and the follicular area was moderately enlarged in pigs fed 00 -RPM. Marked changes in liver histology were not observed. The 00 -RPM diet increased (P < 0. 01) the serum values of total proteins in the first fattening period. At the end of fattening both groups fed 00 -RPM had higher (P < 0. 05; P < 0. 01) concentrations of plasma glucose than the control group. The inclusion of 10 % of 00 -RPM during the finishing period increased (P < 0. 05) the serum values of insulin. Daily weight gain during the growing and the finishing period was higher (P < 0. 05) in the experimental groups than in the control group.

An experiment was conducted at the Indonesian Research Institute for Animal Production to evaluate the effect of jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> on broiler performance. Jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> were treated physically, chemically or their combination to reduce or eliminate the anti nutritive and toxic compounds. Then, the inclusion of untreated or treated jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meals</b> in the diet at the level of 4 % was evaluated on broiler. The experiment was done in Completely Randomized Design with 5 treatments of feed, i. e 1) control feed, 2) feed containing untreated jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (OO), 3) <b>feed</b> containing physically treated jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (OTO), 4) <b>feed</b> containing chemically treated jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (EHM) and 5) feed containing physically and chemically treated jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (EHMO). Every treatment had 7 replications with 5 chickens for each replication. The treatment diets were given to 7 days old chicken for 14 days. The observed parameter were feed intake, daily gain, feed conversion ratio, and mortality. The broiler performance recieved EHMO feed was better that those of OTO or EHM treatment (751. 1; 731. 2; 498. 8 g of body weight for EHMO, EHM and OTO treatments, respectively), however, it was lower than the control treatment (856. 3 g). Feed Conversion Ratios of EHM and EHMO treatments were not significantly different from control treatment (1. 868; 1. 813 vs 1. 707), however, they lower than OO (2. 532) and OTO (2. 249) treatments. Chicken mortality of EHMO treatment was much lower than OO that of treatment (0 vs 34. 29 %, respectively). In conclusion, the processing technology of jatropha <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> using combined physical and chemical treatments (EHMO) was the best choice as it gave better chicken performance without mortality compared to other techniques in this experiment...|$|R

Forty male and female New Zealand White x California rabbits were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments in five replications. The inclusion levels of SFM in diets were 0 (control), 10, 20, and 30 % levels in a completely randomized design. There was significant (P< 0. 001) reduction in daily feed intake (DFI) of rabbits on 30 % SFM based diet. The DFI of 56. 81 g was obtained for rabbits fed 30 % SFM based diet against 65. 73, 67. 17 and 71. 98 g for those fed 0, 10 and 20 % dietary levels of SFM, respectively. The daily weight gain (DWG) (15. 65 - 18. 09 g), feed conversion ratio (FCR) (3. 72 - 4. 28), final live weight (1512. 50 - 1662. 50 g), carcass weight (712. 50 - 837. 50 g), relative organ weights and dressing percentage (46. 92 - 50. 34 %) were not significantly influenced by dietary treatments. The dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), acid detergent fibre intake (ADFI) increased with increasing dietary levels of SFM up to 20 %, but there was a significant (P< 0. 01) reduction in the intake of these nutrients at 30 % dietary level of SFM.

40|$|Effects of low-density broiler breeder diets on {{offspring}} {{performance and}} mortality were studied using 2, 100 female and 210 male Cobb 500 breeders. Breeder treatments involved 4 experimental groups and {{a control group}} with normal density diets (ND, 2, 600 kcal of AME/kg during rearing and 2, 800 kcal of AME/kg during laying). In treatment 2, nutrient densities were decreased by 12 % (LD 12) and 11 % (LD 11) during the rearing and laying periods, respectively, whereas in treatment 3, nutrient densities were decreased by 23 % (LD 23) and 21 % (LD 21) during the rearing and laying periods, respectively. The nutrient density in these treatments was decreased through inclusion of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, wheat gluten <b>feed,</b> and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> in the diets. Treatment 4 included diets with the same nutrient densities as in treatment 2 but included oats and sugar beet pulp (LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP). In treatment 5, the same low-density diet {{was given to the}} breeders as in treatment 2 during the rearing period, but it was followed by a normal density diet during the laying period (LD 12 -ND). Treatments were applied from 4 to 60 wk of age. On low-density diets, offspring showed an increased 1 -d-old weight. As compared with offspring of breeders that received ND, the d 38 live weight of chickens from 29 -wk-old breeders fed LD 11 was improved. Mortality was reduced in offspring from 60 -wk-old parent stock given low-density diets. The IgM titers in 35 -d-old offspring from eggs with a lower-than-average weight were reduced when 29 -wk-old broiler breeders were fed low-density diets. In offspring from eggs with a higher-than-average weight from 60 -wk-old parent stock given LD 11 or LD 21 diets, IgM titers were higher compared with ND. It was concluded that low-density broiler breeder diets can improve offspring growth rates, reduce mortality, and reduce or increase immune responses, depending on breeder age and egg weight...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of alternative protein sources (castor bean cake, sunflower cake, and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed)</b> to soybean <b>meal</b> on the intake and performance of 40 lambs, initially weighing 19. 8 ± 1. 84 kg, fed diets based on Tifton grass hay. The experimental design was completely randomized blocks. There were no differences in the nutrient intake of castor bean diets compared with soybean meal. The intake of nutrients in the sunflower cake and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> diets was decreased compared with soybean meal. The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber of sunflower cake and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> diets were decreased compared with soybean meal. The average daily weight gain of animals fed the castor bean diet (0. 190 kg) was not different from that of the animals fed the soybean meal diet (0. 217 kg). The sunflower cake and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> diets provided less weight gain (0. 171 and 0. 135 kg d- 1, respectively) than soybean meal due to the lower nutrient intake. The hot carcass yield and true yield were not affected by the protein sources. The neck, ribs, and ham weights were similar in lambs fed soybean meal and castor bean cake diets.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the chemical composition and amino acid (AA) digestibility of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> (SFSM) and to use this data to develop prediction equations for estimating AA digestibility for growing pigs. Ten SFSM were collected from five provinces in China. Twelve barrows (38. 8 ± 4. 6 kg), fitted with ileal T-cannula were allotted into two 6 × 6 Latin square designs. Each of six experimental periods comprised a 5 -d adaption period followed by a 2 -d collection of ileal digesta. The ten test diets contained 50 % SFSM as the sole source of AA. Another nitrogen-free diet {{was used to measure}} the basal endogenous losses of crude protein (CP) and AA. Chromic oxide (0. 3 %) was used as an inert marker in each diet. There was considerable variation (CV> 10 %) among the ten SFSM in chemical composition (dry matter [DM]). The concentration of CP and ether extract (EE) ranged from 29. 33 % to 39. 09 % and 0. 88 % to 11. 33 %, respectively. Crude fibre (CF), neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre ranged from 21. 46 % to 36. 42 %, 38. 15 % to 55. 40 %, and 24. 59 % to 37. 34 %, respectively. There was variation among the ten SFSM in apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) for lysine and threonine, which ranged from 63. 16 to 79. 21 and 55. 19 % to 72. 04 % for AID and 67. 03 % to 82. 07 % and 61. 97 % to 77. 01 % for SID, respectively.

Methionine was a good indicator to predict AA digestibility. These results indicate that conventional chemical composition of SFSM was variable (CV> 10 %) among the ten SFSM (DM). The results of AID, SID and prediction equations could be used to evaluate the digestibility of SFSM in growing pigs...|$|R

No relationship was observed between oil content and protein content expressed as a proportion of DDM (defatted dry matter), but there was a significant negative linear relationship between hullability and oil content. Due to the wide range of locations and agricultural practices encountered in the farmers' fields, {{it was not possible to}} verify with confidence the influence of other interactions such as nitrogen fertilization and the potential fertility of the fields. This work nevertheless showed that locality and growing conditions affect the quality of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> This variability in quality could be measured by crushers in order to optimize the dehulling process and thereby produce a meal of consistent quality, with a guaranteed protein content...|$|R

40|$|Restricted {{feeding of}} broiler breeders is {{required}} to obtain good reproductive performance. Current practical feed restriction levels can result in hunger feeling and chronic stress, particularly during the rearing period. On the basis of literature data, low-density diets might improve bird welfare. Recent findings also indicate that low-density broiler breeder diets can reduce offspring mortality. In this thesis, effects of low-density breeder diets on bird welfare and breeder and offspring performance were evaluated. Breeder treatments involved: 1) normal density diets (ND), 2) diets with 12 and 11 % reduced nutrient densities during rearing and laying (LD 12 and LD 11), 3) diets with 23 and 21 % reduced nutrient densities during rearing and laying (LD 23 and LD 21), 4) as 2), but with oats and sugar beet pulp instead of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, wheat gluten <b>feed</b> and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>meal</b> in the diets (LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP), and 5) LD 11 diets during rearing followed by ND diets during laying. Feeding LD 23 diets reduced stereotypic pecking behaviour and increased time spent on sitting {{during the first half}} of the rearing period. LD 23 and LD 12 OP diets reduced feed intake motivation during rearing. It was concluded that LD 23 can improve bird welfare {{during the first half of}} the rearing period. However, LD 21 impaired bird welfare during laying. LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP diets gave significantly lower live weights during rearing and laying. Low-density diets delayed reproductive tract development at 24 weeks of age, which was followed by an increased development between week 24 and 26. Changes in bird development were related to changes in nutrient digestibility and utilization of digested nutrients. Egg weights and amount of egg white increased and embryonic development was improved on low-density diets. Laying percentage was significantly higher on LD 11 diets. LD 11 diets increased live weight of offspring of 29 -week-old breeders significantly in comparison with ND diets. Low-density breeder diets resulted in a significant reduction in offspring mortality when breeders were 60 weeks of age. Antibody titres in offspring indicated that nutrients in eggs with a relatively low weight were used for growth rather than for immune system development.
