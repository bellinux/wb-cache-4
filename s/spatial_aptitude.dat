50|$|Psychological tests measure {{specific}} abilities, such as clerical, perceptual, numerical, or <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude.</b> Sometimes {{these tests}} must be specially {{designed for a}} particular job, {{but there are also}} tests available that measure general clerical and mechanical aptitudes, or even general learning ability. An example of an occupational aptitude test is the Minnesota Clerical Test, which measures the perceptual speed and accuracy required to perform various clerical duties. Other widely used aptitude tests include Careerscope, the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which assess verbal reasoning, numerical ability, abstract Reasoning, clerical speed and accuracy, mechanical reasoning, space relations, spelling and language usage. Another widely used test of aptitudes is the Wonderlic Test. These aptitudes are believed to be related to specific occupations and are used for career guidance as well as selection and recruitment.|$|E
50|$|A single {{construct}} such as mental ability is measured with multiple tests. Often, a person's group of test scores will be {{highly correlated with}} each other, which makes a single measure useful in many cases. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor's General Learning Ability is determined by combining Verbal, Numerical and <b>Spatial</b> <b>aptitude</b> scores. However, many individuals have skills that are a lot higher or lower than their overall mental ability level. Aptitude subtests are used intra-individually to determine which tasks that individual is more skilled at performing. This information can be useful for determining which job roles are the best fits for employees or applicants. Often, before more rigorous aptitude tests are used, individuals are screened for a basic level of aptitude through a previously-completed process, such as SAT scores, GRE scores, degrees, or other certifications.|$|E

40|$|Self-handicapping {{is defined}} as the {{construction}} of obstacles or impediments to successful performance by an individual to protect or enhance self-esteem or self-image. The purpose of this research study was to explore the consequences of engaging in a behavioral self-handicapping strategy. In addition to positive and negative affect, test performance, test performance attributions, and self-efficacy were measured. Self-esteem and tendency to self-handicap served as covariates. Self-selected handicaps were examined in a quasi-experimental design. Participants chose whether to self-handicap or not by selecting either perceived distracting or enhancing music. Participants completed pre-test measures of positive affect, negative affect, self-esteem, and tendency to self-handicap. A practice test composed of items from the Diagnostic and <b>Spatial</b> Relations <b>Aptitude</b> Test (DSRAT) provided a pre-test measure of performance. After completing the pre-test measure of performance, participants chose to listen to either perceived performance-distracting or perceived performance-enhancing music while completing the DSRAT performance test. Upon completion of the test and receiving false failure feedback, positive and negative affect, performance attributions, self-efficacy, and test performance were measured.

The study presents and examines demographics of the population including performance on standardized admission tests, learning styles preferences and <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude.</b> Performance metrics are provided for five topic areas in mathematics and three topic areas in electromagnetics. ^ Students’ experiences in the course are examined and a number of significant factors relating to their experience with electromagnetics in the course were analyzed using a phenomenographical framework. Significant factors in students’ experiences with electromagnetics in the course include mathematical concepts, visual tools, laboratory exercises and course references. Students in the course have a high degree of spatial ability and prefer visual, hands-on learning activities which present concepts in a logical and sequential manner. ^ Key findings are that students are challenged by the mathematical requirements of the course and are unable to relate numerical values with electromagnetic phenomena. Prerequisite mathematics coursework requirements do not cover all mathematical concepts required to examine electromagnetic in the course. The limited time available to present these concepts in the course is not sufficient to address the absence of additional mathematics coursework. A large segment of students in the course have transfered from other academic majors and have completed additional mathematics coursework. These students have a higher average performance on mathematics problems appearing in the course. ...|$|E

(2) A "Partial Motion" condition which was identical to the ???Stills" condition except for the addition of an animated cueing arrow. (3) A "Full Motion" condition which followed a standard motion picture format. The experimental task called for subjects to solve problems by diagraming the correct movement patterns required to move a designated chesspiece from one point on the chessboard to another. Performance measures taken were number of problems correctly solved within the allowed time, and accuracy of movements (parsimony of moves in reaching a correct solution). High aptitude subjects were expected to show no differences due to instructional mode because their superior ability would enable them to grasp the spatial concepts without motion. Low aptitude subjects were expected to perform better with the "Partial Motion" and ???Full Motion" conditions, with the motion cues compensating for their lower aptitude. No differences were expected between the ???Partial??? or "Full" motion conditions because it was hypothesized that the simplest form of motion enhancement that furnishes the critical visual cues would be as effective as more elaborate forms. The results supported the hypothesis on the number of correct responses criterion. No differences were observed on the accuracy or parsimony of movement measure. Implications of these findings in terms of cost effectiveness of instructional media and training are discussed and potential extensions of the study suggested...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contends that}} basic {{architectural}} design training requires malleable aesthetic and spatial sensibilities {{which in turn}} can cultivate a pliable and multiple sense of self. "A sense of self" here draws on William James's and Ulric Neisser's plural ways of conceiving and knowing oneself through self-knowledge, self-consciousness and self-agency, all of which combine to motivate our actions in the world. "Aesthetic", borrows from Mark Johnson's definition of constituting the patterns, images, feelings, qualities, and emotions by which meaning is possible for us {{in every aspect of}} our lives. "Spatial" captures the ways in which we situate and orient self in the world. How we are trained to perceive, apprehend, cogitate, examine, reflect, record, and practice these sensibilities guides how we piece together our experiences in the world as a series of aesthetic and spatial fragments. I argue that 1. The cultivation of multiple and pliable attributes of self is prescient and relevant to fields beyond design. 2. The site of cultivation lies beyond the mind. I build a case that these two contentions are picking up on recent waves in situated and embodied cognition and posthuman discourse, that have each reclaimed the body, physical, digital and virtual environments, and the nonhuman respectively as extended sites of perception and cognition. Posthumanism here, in the terms of physicist and feminist theorist Karen Barad, extends agency to the nonhuman by prefiguring neither human nor nonhuman in interactions. Both situated cognition and posthumanism are engendering new aesthetic and spatial abilities that exemplify the multiplicity and malleability of self. In order to productively instrumentalize their common findings, we need new methodologies and materials that escape individual disciplinary silos which proliferate canons and inhibit the creation of common ground. Design pedagogy has the ability to subsume the motivations of various fields in order to develop such methodologies. I embody cognitive science and posthuman discourse, in order to make visible their pursuits, knit together their underlying values, and frame their common calls as design problems. Through this, I develop a new methodology called Performative Experiment, that primes the malleability of aesthetic and spatial sensibilities by estranging one from canons and rote moves. Like parkour for imagination, displacing the center of thought from the mind into the surroundings that are appropriated as an extension of self, performative experiments arrest the <b>spatial</b> and aesthetic <b>aptitudes</b> growing out of a malleable sense of self. I present the shadow and shaded silhouette as materials with which to engage these priming methodologies. In order to implement the case I've built, I present Hogarth's Silhouettes as a proof of concept of a foundational experiment in design education. My claim is that it puts into play a malleability of aesthetic and spatial sense of self, which constitutes a new form of design thinking/doing, across disciplines. by Akshita Sivakumar. Thesis: S.

A detailed cognitive task analysis revealed specific spatial strategies for solving the orthographic projection tasks. These detailed strategies were used to design a computerized learning environment called the orthographic projection tutor (OPT). Pre- and posttests of orthographic projections were administered to a treatment group and 2 control groups.

30|$|Everyday tasks, from {{handling}} fragile {{objects to}} navigating a highway to parking one's car at work, require {{a high degree}} of SA and <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude.</b> Such tasks require the human actor to quickly adapt to new stationary and moving objects, as well as unpredictable moves that these may make, such as a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road. In the case of parking a car, the driver must account for the overall distribution of objects in the space of the parking lot at the time he/she plans to park, as well as the actions those objects may take based on the intentions of other human actors, hence the Parking Dilemma [2]. In order to properly understand and predict the actions of others in this space, the driver must predict what others will do, or their actions will otherwise appear random. For instance, a car may suddenly change course to move to a parking spot, which a driver considering the intentions of other drivers is more likely to detect and account for in his subsequent driving maneuvers.|$|E

Since Physics and Chemistry deal with three-dimensional (3 -D) objects, the ability to visualize and mentally manipulate shapes is very helpful in their learning. In fact, much of what Physics and Chemistry students know {{takes the form of}} images. However, little attention has been given to the pedagogical effectiveness of visual stimuli in those disciplines. Computers are being increasingly used as teaching tools. The new approaches include simulations, multimedia presentations and, more recently, virtual environments. Computer-based worlds are useful to visualize physical and chemical processes allowing for better conceptual understanding. Since 3 -D virtual environments need to be explored and evaluated in science education, we have created a virtual environment (Virtual Water) for studying phases of matter, phase transitions and atomic orbitals at the final year of high school and first year of university levels. Based on that work, we discuss the implications of visual learning in designing strategies to cater for differences in learning modes. Our study indicates that 3 -D virtual environments may help students with high <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude</b> to acquire better conceptual understandings.

In the screening process questionaires addressed to parents, teachers, and pupils nad based on the Multiple Intelligences Theory were used.

40|$|Spatial ability {{strongly}} predicts whether college students pursue science-and math-related majors, {{in which women}} are especially underrepresented (Ramirez et at., 2012). One factor that can negatively impact spatial ability is anxiety around completing spatial tasks (e. g., mental rotation, spatial orientation; Lawton, 1996), which tends to be higher in women than in men (Lawton, 1994). Individual and gender differences in self-reported spatial anxiety and childhood wayfinding experience {{have been linked to}} the use of different tactics for navigating, or wayfinding, with men and women relying on different strategies (Lawton 2 ̆ 6 Kallai, 2002). Moreover, less childhood wayfinding experience may contribute to higher levels of spatial anxiety and lower <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude</b> in adults, but this remains inconclusive. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether self-reported spatial anxiety, childhood wayfinding experience, and use of particular wayfinding strategies predict performance on different kinds of spatial tasks. One hundred eight undergraduate psychology students from FIU reported their anxiety levels, childhood wayfinding experience, and wayfinding strategies, and performed a variety of spatial memory tests.

40|$|Spatial {{reasoning}} predicts college students’ {{pursuit of}} science and math careers, in which women are typically underrepresented (Blair, 2011). Previous research has found gender differences in preschool children’s spatial skills (e. g., mental rotation; Levine et al., 1999), with boys typically outperforming girls. This sex difference in spatial reasoning remains prevalent in adulthood. Explanations for sex differences in one type of spatial ability-wayfinding (i. e., navigation) - include higher levels of spatial anxiety in women compared to men (Lawton, 1994). Because spatial skills take time to develop through the interaction of brain development (e. g., the hippocampus) and spatial experience (e. g., navigation, block/puzzle design), the basis for sex differences in <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude</b> is still debated. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine whether self-reported spatial anxiety, childhood wayfinding experience, and use of particular wayfinding strategies mitigate or enhance sex differences in performance on different kinds of spatial tasks. One hundred eight undergraduate psychology students from FIU reported their anxiety levels, childhood wayfinding experience, and wayfinding strategies, and performed a variety of spatial memory tests. Preliminary analyses revealed significant, predictable gender differences in spatial anxiety (t(105) =- 2. 116; p 3 ̆c. 05), spatial orientation (t(105) = 2. 071; p 3 ̆c. 05), and mental rotation (t(105) = 2. 252; p 3 ̆c. 05), with women reporting higher levels of spatial anxiety and men scoring higher on both spatial tasks. Furthermore, although non-significant, predictable patterns of gender differences emerged in which men reported higher levels of past wayfinding experience and the use of orientation wayfinding strategies, while women reported higher levels of route wayfinding strategies. The current findings corroborate previous research on sex differences in spatial reasoning, while providing some potential explanations for these differences. Namely, sex differences in past wayfinding experiences, spatial anxiety, and wayfinding strategies may help us understand why men and women perform differently on spatial tasks...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Radiography in the Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences, 2008 Introduction Research to date {{has not been able}} to agree whether spatial abilities can be developed by practice. According to some researchers spatial ability is an inherited cognitive ability, compared to spatial skills that are task specific and can be acquired through formal training. It is commonly assumed that radiographers require general cognitive spatial abilities to interpret complex radiographic images. This research was conducted to investigate second year radiography students’ three-dimensional thinking skills pertaining to film-viewing assessments. Materials and methods The experimental research strategy was mainly applied together with correlation research. Two trials were run (in 2005 and 2006). The sample group consisted of fifteen second year diagnostic radiography students in 2005 and twenty-three second year diagnostic radiography students, of the same institution, in 2006. Each year group was randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. Two instruments were used, that is a film-viewing assessment and a three-dimensional test, Academic Aptitude Test (University) (AAT) nr. nine: Spatial Perception (3 -D). The whole class completed this basic <b>spatial</b> <b>aptitude</b> test, as well as a base-line film viewing assessment, which focused on the evaluation of technique/anatomy of second year specialised radiographic projections. The marks that the students achieved in the fore-mentioned tests were compared, to determine if there was any correlation between their performances in the different tests. A curricular intervention, which was intended to improve applied three-dimensional skills, was subsequently applied. The students executed certain modified radiographic projections on parts of a human skeleton. For each radiographic projection, the students had to draw the relation of the X-ray beam to the specific anatomical structures, as well as the relation of these structures to the film. The related images of these projections were also drawn. With each of the following sessions, films including images of the previous session were discussed with each student. After the intervention, the whole class wrote a second film-viewing assessment. The marks achieved in this assessment were compared to the marks of the initial film-viewing assessment to determine the influence of the intervention on the performance of the intervention group. Following this assessment, for ethical reasons, the same intervention took place with the control group. A third film-viewing assessment was then written by all the diagnostic second year students to evaluate the overall impact of the intervention on the applied three-dimensional skills of the class. The marks of both the 2005 and 2006 classes (intervention classes) were compared to the marks achieved by former classes from 2000 to 2004 (control classes), in film-viewing assessments to evaluate the role of the curricular intervention over the years. The students again completed the three-dimensional test, Spatial Perception (3 -D) to evaluate the impact of the intervention on students’ general three-dimensional cognitive abilities. These marks were also compared to the marks of the third filmviewing assessment, to determine if there was any correlation between the students’ performances in the different tests. Results The intervention groups did not perform significantly better in film-viewing assessments after the intervention, compared to the control groups, but reasonable differences, favouring the intervention group, were achieved. Statistical significance was achieved in film-viewing assessments with both year groups after the whole class had the intervention. The intervention year groups also performed significantly better than the previous year groups (without the intervention) in film-viewing assessments. The performance in general three-dimensional cognitive abilities of the group of 2006 improved significantly after the intervention, but on the contrary, the performance of the group of 2005 declined. There was a small intervention effect on the performance of the group of 2006. Only a weak to moderate correlation between the marks of the students achieved in the three-dimensional tests and the marks achieved in the film-viewing assessments, was found. Conclusion The contrasting evidence between the data of the two groups (2005 and 2006) in the three-dimensional tests and the small intervention effect on the performance of the group of 2006, makes the intervention not applicable for the increase of general spatial abilities. The results of this research show that the applied three-dimensional skills of radiography students in interpreting specialised and modified projections can be improved by intensive practice, independent of their inherited spatial abilities...|$|E
