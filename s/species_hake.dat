Hake (merluza) is the main fish species consumed in quantity and value terms in Spain. But commercialised as hake can be found several fish species and presentations. When many papers focus on product aggregation and market integration for several whitefish species using somehow aggregated data; the present study questions the product aggregation on one <b>species,</b> <b>hake,</b> depending on size, gear, origin, etc., by using disaggregated data on several markets in the Spanish market chain.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to prove a mandatory square mesh panel in the Basque trawling fleet operating in the ICES subzones VIIIabd. Selectivity parameters were calculated for the dual selection system (70 mm codend + 100 mm square mesh panel in extension piece) and for commercial codends (70 mm codend), with the aim to compare them and determine the effect of the square mesh panel in the overall selectivity of the gear for three selected <b>species</b> (<b>Hake,</b> Red mullet and Pout), using a three compartment setup (codend, codend cover and square mesh panel cover). The low escape-panel contact found in the selected species, {{especially in the case of}} the hake can be attributed to different factors such as passive behaviour in the trawl, high turbidity and high trawling speed. The data were analyzed with the software SELNET that enables the analysis of data for experimental designs involving multiple compartments by means of complex selection models...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} a first approach concerning a novel chilling strategy, which employs {{a mixture of}} different preservative organic acids (ascorbic, citric and lactic) in the icing medium. Thus, ice prepared from water including two different concentrations of a commercial acid mixture-formula (800 and 400 [*]ppm; C- 800 and C- 400 conditions, respectively) were applied as icing system to three important commercial fish lean <b>species</b> (<b>hake,</b> Merluccius merluccius; megrim, Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis; angler, Lophius piscatorius). Lipid oxidation (peroxide value; thiobarbituric acid index; fluorescent compound formation) and hydrolysis (free fatty acid formation) were evaluated throughout the chilling time (up to 12 – 15 days) and compared to results obtained in fish kept under traditional ice prepared only from water (C- 0 condition); a complementary sensory evaluation was carried out. As a result of employing the C- 800 icing condition, a partial inhibition of lipid oxidation and hydrolysis development was obtained that {{was accompanied by a}} shelf life enhancement in all cases. Further research taking into account the complementary action of the present organic acids is envisaged. According to the lipid damage analysis, lipid hydrolysis was a more relevant event than lipid oxidation in all fish species tested.

40|$|We used stable-isotope {{analysis}} (SIA) {{to evaluate}} sources {{of variation in}} the diet of and prey selection by Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus breeding on the Argentinean Patagonia coast. Our aim was to determine potential sources of variation in diet, focusing mainly on sex and age, although geographic and temporal effects were also taken into account. In addition, we evaluated how prey selection affects offspring quality. We measured stable nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) isotope values in whole blood of chicks (n = 98), yearlings (n = 15) and adults (n = 143) in 9 different breeding colonies during 2 consecutive breeding seasons (1999 and 2000). We also measured stable isotope values in representative prey consumed by this species. Stable nitrogen and carbon isotope values in blood for penguins varied from 17. 8 to 20. 0 ” and from - 18. 1 to - 14. 8 ”, respectively. Both colony and season {{had a significant effect}} on the 2 isotope signatures. Adult males had higher blood δ 15 N and δ 13 C values than females. Age significantly affected both δ 15 N and δ 13 C values, with chicks showing the highest and yearlings the lowest δ 15 N values. Chicks showed lower δ 13 C values than yearlings and adults. Mean prey δ 15 N values ranged from 13. 6 ” in squid to 18. 0 ” in octopus. As anchovy, the main prey consumed by the species in the study area, did not differ from other fish <b>species</b> (<b>hake)</b> in its δ 15 N value, we used it to represent a fish dietary alternative. Using a 2 source (anchovy and squid) isotopic mixing model, we determined that the mean proportion of anchovy in the diet was 49 % for yearlings, 76 % for chicks, and 69 % and 67 % for adult males and females, respectively. Sex and age differences in diet, as revealed by stable isotopes, may be the consequence of individual morphology (sexual size dimorphism) and reproductive constraints imposed by chick development since growing young require more nutritive prey than adults and yearlings. This reasoning would also explain the significant and positive correlation found between proportion of anchovy in the diet and body condition of chicks. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

We evaluated {{the effects of a}} large-scale offshore MPA located on the Southwest Atlantic Patagonian Shelf (438 S 638 W) on the demersal fish assemblage. Compliance of the Patagonian MPA was assessed by analysing eight years of satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS; 2000 – 2008) data, which showed compliance and fishing effort concentrated near the protection boundaries. MPA effects were studied by employing a five year database collected by a scientific research vessel in protected and fishing locations, before and after the MPA establishment.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} was to examine the exploitation patterns of the M. capensis and M. paradoxus hake fisheries on the Southeast Coast, and determine the size and <b>species</b> of <b>hake</b> caught in each of the hand-line, long-line, and trawl methods. The handline hake fishery has increased substantially over the last several years and concerns are beginning to emerge about the impact this will have on the inshore resource collected on the South Coast between August 1998 and July 1999 was used to describe the hand-line method and estimate annual landings. Data on the size and species in longline catches of hake caught during 1997 were already available for this study. Size distributions in trawl catches were determined from commercial category landing data reported by catch weight and depth. The species composition in these catches determined by comparison using RV Afrikana survey data collected in the same depth regions. Location plays a significant role in determining the sizes and <b>species</b> of <b>hake</b> caught by each gear. Hand-lines catch smaller sizes on average than do long-lines, inshore trawls target mainly M. capensis while offshore trawls catch both <b>hake</b> <b>species.</b> A substantial amount of the hand-line hake caught on the South Coast is not reported. Examination of the exploitation patterns reveal that intense trawling pressure is directed at the smaller sized M. paradoxus inhabiting the depth region between 160 - 400 -meters. Inshore trawls discard a large amount of small sized M. capensis within the 100 -meter isobath. A preliminary stock assessment on the status of each <b>hake</b> <b>species</b> found that M. paradoxus appears to be over-exploited while M. capensis was in better shape. However, length-based pseudo-cohort analysis, used in this assessment, is critically reliant on having length frequency data from a steady state population in equilibrium. This limits the application of this model for management purposes and this finding is purely theoretical at this stage. Results suggest that each <b>hake</b> <b>species</b> is under a different pattern and level of exploitation and the multi-species nature of hake stocks on the South Coast should be considered in developing optimum management policies. Future work should focus on developing appropriate age/length keys so that an age-based VPA, which is more powerful than the length-based approach, can be applied towards stock assessments on the South Coast. Alternatively, length-data covering a longer period should be compiled and the equilibrium assumption further investigated so that the results from length-based models can be used with more confidence...|$|R

40|$|From 1992 to 2001, {{by-catch}} {{that was}} landed from the Spanish deepwater trawl fishery for black hake off Mauritania was closely monitored. This {{is a highly}} specialised fishery, with two <b>species</b> of black <b>hake</b> (Merluccius senegalensis and Merluccius polli) constituting between 77 – 99 % of total land-ings, which have annually averaged 9 300 tons {{over the past two}} decades. Landings of Sparidae were highest among by-catch species of commercial value, with the large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthal-mus being the most important until 1996, after which the family Lophiidae and others predominated. Next were the Elasmobranchii, including large demersal squalids and several species of rays, although their annual landings fell from 182 tons in 1992 to only 4 tons in 1999, rising to 37 tons in 2001. The present paper analyses these changes using by-catches retained in the black hake fishery. We believe that the decline could be due to a set of different factors: a change in depths fished, economic reasons and probable over-exploitation of both targeted species and by-catch. Elasmobranchs constituted only 0. 1 % of total landings in 1999, compared to 1. 9 % in 1992, although their contribution to total com-mercial by-catch was constant. Seasonality was clearly evident, with an absolute and proportional rise in elasmobranch by-catch during warm periods, reaching 75 % of by-catch landings in some months, coinciding with a drop in total by-catch.
