5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the <b>standard</b> <b>length</b> of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E

25|$|And {{although}} {{lengths of}} containers vary from , {{according to two}} 2012 container census reports about 80% of the world's containers are either twenty or forty foot <b>standard</b> <b>length</b> boxes of the dry freight design. These typical containers are rectangular, closed box models, with doors fitted at one end, and made of corrugated weathering steel (commonly known as CorTen) with a plywood floor. Although corrugating the sheet metal used for the sides and roof contributes significantly to the container's rigidity and stacking strength, just like in corrugated iron or in cardboard boxes, the corrugated sides cause aerodynamic drag, and up to 10% fuel economy loss in road or rail transport, compared to smooth-sided vans.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor {{there was a need}} for large vessels that could be {{converted}} into training aircraft carriers for pilot training. The Greater Buffalos length, following conversion, would be roughly two thirds the length of an Independence class aircraft carrier and it was felt by the navy that if pilots could master takeoffs and landings on the shorter deck they would have less problems transitioning to a <b>standard</b> <b>length</b> carrier. Other benefits by using her for training were that an active duty combat ship would not have to be used for training and with her location on the Great Lakes she would be {{out of the reach of}} enemy submarines and mines. The Greater Buffalo was acquired by the Navy on 7 August 1942 by the War Shipping Administration to be converted into a training aircraft carrier and renamed Sable on 19 September 1942.|$|E
25|$|A. guttatus {{is easily}} {{differentiated}} from {{other members of}} the A. ischnosoma group by a slender (vs. moderately thick) humeral process (maximum width 10.011.8% its length vs. 13.218.4). A. mahakamensis is differentiated from other members of its group by a rounded (vs. angular) anterior margin of the anal fin, and a more slender body. A. septentrionalis can be differentiated by members of the A. ischnoma group by a smaller dorsal to adipose distance (4.45.7% <b>standard</b> <b>length</b> vs. 6.29.8), fewer branchiostegal rays (4 vs. 56) and an almost uniformly cream colour pattern with few very small brown spots (vs. a variegated colour pattern with numerous brown patches). A. strigosus can be differentiated from members of the A. ischnosoma species group by a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin of the adipose fin and a more slender body; the genital papilla in male A. strigosus is also morphologically different from other members of its species group (short and thick vs. long and thin). A. ischnosoma is distinguished from {{other members of the}} A. ischnosoma group by a greater distance between the dorsal fin and adipose fin (9.010.1% SL vs. 4.48.7) and a greater exposure of the premaxillary teeth when the mouth is closed (one-third vs. less than one-fifth to none).

25|$|A. chamaeleon can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} members of the A. rugosus species group by shorter nasal barbels (1.06.0% length of the head vs. 6.523.9), wide-set eyes (distance between eyes 38.947Â·5% length of the head), and a head with gently sloping lateral margins and a broadly rounded snout when viewed dorsally. A. falcifer can be differentiated from {{other members of}} the species group by an adipose fin with a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin and a longer dorsal-fin base (10.813.1% <b>standard</b> <b>length</b> vs. 7.910.5); generally the colour pattern of A. falcifer is also different in having many small blotches (vs. few large blotches) of various shades of brown, with many small dark brown spots (vs. no spots) on the dorsal surfaces of the head. Both A. falcifer and A. pachyderma lack serrations on the pectoral spine, but the two species can be separated based on their colouration (cream with numerous small blotches of various shades of brown in A. falcifer vs. overall cream in A. pachyderma) and the shape of the posterior margin of the adipose fin. A. pachyderma can be differentiated by its colouration (overall cream vs. generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown) and, except for A. falcifer, lack (vs. presence) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine. A. rugosus differs from A. chamaeleon in having longer nasal barbels (6.515.6% head length vs. 1.06.0) and a head with steeply sloping (vs. gentlysloping) lateral margins and a convex (vs. broadly rounded) snout when viewed dorsally; from A. falcifer in having an adipose fin with an angular (vs. rounded) posterior margin; from A. pachyderma in its colouration (generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown vs. overall cream) and the presence (vs. lack) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine.|$|E

500|$|The {{wild-type}} of {{the species}} has 8 or 9 black vertical bars on a blue-grey body, along with a dark blotch on the operculum. Juvenile convict cichlids are monomorphic until they reach sexual maturity. The male is mostly gray with light black stripes along the body. Males are larger than females, and they have more pointed ventral, dorsal and anal fins which often extend into filaments. In addition, older males frequently develop vestigial fatty lumps on their foreheads. Unusually for fish, the female is more highly coloured. She has more intense black bands across the body, and pink to orange colouration in the ventral region and on the dorsal fin. Mature males in the wild have a <b>standard</b> <b>length</b> of 6.3 to 6.6 centimeters, and breeding females are 4.2 to 5.5 centimeters long.
