2500|$|Coal {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the Earth's crust. The <b>surrounding</b> <b>strata,</b> if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of 'dirty' coals. The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the fly ash precisely because they do not burn well. The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black shale and is less than phosphate rocks, but is more of a concern because {{a small amount of}} the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled. According to U.S. NCRP reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490 person-rem/year for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year).

60|$|Many {{of these}} tufaceous beds resemble, with the {{exception}} of being more indurated, the upper beds of the Great Patagonian tertiary formation, especially those variously coloured layers high up the River Santa Cruz, and in a remarkable degree the tufaceous formation at the northern end of Chiloe. I was so much struck with this resemblance, that I particularly looked out for silicified wood, and found it under the following extraordinary circumstances. High up on this western flank, at a height estimated at 7,000 feet above the sea, in a broken escarpment of thin strata, composed of compact green gritstone passing into a fine mudstone, and alternating with layers of coarser, brownish, very heavy mudstone, including broken crystals and particles of rock almost blended together, I counted the stumps of fifty-two trees. (For the information of any future traveller, I will describe the spot in detail. Proceeding eastward from the Agua del Zorro, and afterwards leaving {{on the north side of}} the road a rancho attached to some old goldmines, you pass through a gully with low but steep rocks on each hand: the road then bends, and the ascent becomes steeper. A few hundred yards farther on, a stone's throw on the south side of the road, the white calcareous stumps may be seen. The spot is about half a mile east of the Agua del Zorro.) They projected between two and five feet above the ground, and stood at exactly right angles to the strata, which were here inclined at an angle of about 25 degrees to the west. Eleven of these trees were silicified and well preserved; Mr. R. Brown has been so kind as to examine the wood when sliced and polished; he says it is coniferous, partaking of the characters of the Araucarian tribe, with some curious points of affinity with the Yew. The bark round the trunks must have been circularly furrowed with irregular lines, for the mudstone round them is thus plainly marked. One cast consisted of dark argillaceous limestone; and forty of them of coarsely crystallised carbonate of lime, with cavities lined by quartz crystals: these latter white calcareous columns do not retain any internal structure, but their external form plainly shows their origin. All the stumps have nearly the same diameter, varying from one foot to eighteen inches; some of them stand within a yard of each other; they are grouped in a clump within a space of about sixty yards across, with a few scattered round at the distance of 150 yards. They all stand at about the same level. The longest stump stood seven feet out of the ground: the roots, if they are still preserved, are buried and concealed. No one layer of the mudstone appeared much darker than the others, as if it had formerly existed as soil, nor could this be expected, for the same agents which replaced with silex and lime the wood of the trees, would naturally have removed all vegetable matter from the soil. Besides the fifty-two upright trees, there were a few fragments, like broken branches, horizontally embedded. The <b>surrounding</b> <b>strata</b> are crossed by veins of carbonate of lime, agate, and oxide of iron; and a poor gold vein has been worked not far from the trees.|$|E

Shortly after the flooding, Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Limited, went into receivership. It became clear that no new operator would take over the mine, and all the pumps were switched off, allowing further flooding. Without access, the true cause of the flooding could not be conclusively determined by the investigation. It was concluded that one of the dams, or the <b>surrounding</b> <b>strata,</b> had probably failed, but the exact reason was not known. The design margins for the dams appeared to be adequate.|$|E
5000|$|The Nashville Basin, {{also known}} as the Central Basin, is a term often used to {{describe}} the area surrounding Nashville, Tennessee.

The uplifting of the Nashville Dome fractured overlying strata, making it more easily eroded and thus the [...] "dome" [...] resulted in a [...] "basin". Uplifted strata {{in the center of a}} geological dome have higher potential erosive energy than the <b>surrounding</b> <b>strata,</b> because they are physically higher.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Longwall mining is {{the only}} {{technically}} proven and established method worldwide for coal extraction at greater depth. In this paper, 2 D plane strain finite element models of longwall panels are developed and analyzed to understand the interaction of hydraulic powered support with <b>surrounding</b> rock <b>strata.</b> Based on Indian geomining conditions, finite element models are developed including the structural components of hydraulic powered support (like hydraulic legs, canopy, gob shield, pin joints, base and lemniscate link), the surrounding rock mass and broken rocks (gob). The study is focused to evaluate the strata behaviour for different capacity of hydraulic powered supports those are installed in Indian longwall faces. Results obtained from finite element models are analyzed in terms of stress distribution in hydruaulic legs, abutment stresses and roof-to-floor convergence.

40|$|The Hopewell {{series is}} a group of pre-Cambrian {{metamorphic}} rocks exposed in the Picuris, Petaca, and Ojo Caliente districts of northern New Mexico. In the Ojo Caliente district these and other pre-Cambrian rocks are exposed in an elongate inlier in the <b>surrounding</b> Tertiary <b>strata.</b> This inlier represents a low mountain or monadnock on an early Tertiary erosion surface. The Hopewell series has been divided into two phases, the Picuris basalt and a series of metasedimentary rocks. Both general rock types show a well defined sequence of metamorphic degree, but the variation of metamorphic degree is roughly bedding controled. The highest degree of metamorphism noted in the area is correlative with the sillimanite zone. In type, the metamorphic processes involved could be classed as normal regional metamorphism, which includes a certain amount of metasomatism. From the evidence in the Ojo Caliente district it seems probable that the processes of normal regional metamorphism were carried out in large part under the influence of hydrothermal solutions. ...|$|R

The Tapeats Sandstone lies on an unconformity at 850 m in the Grand Canyon, whereas at Aztec Peak it appears at about 2350 m, a vertical displacement from which can be inferred about 1500 m of ancient uplift, implying that the Sierra Ancha once stood at least 1500 m higher than the range does today, and that the Paleozoic strata which overlie the Tapeats in the Grand Canyon have been removed in the Sierra Ancha through erosion.

The sandstone body {{appears to be an}} ancient stream channel, infilled with fine-grained sand and organic matter. Coalification of the organic matter produced methane as a byproduct.
