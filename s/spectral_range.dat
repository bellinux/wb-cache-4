To determine the <b>spectral</b> <b>ranges</b> and extract relevant information from near infrared spectroscopy of serum {{in the regions}} of 12000 - 4000 cm- 1 when predicting triglyceride concentrations, in this paper, the first three principal components, which represent not less than 94 percents spectral information, were calculated using principal components analysis. According to this, certain <b>spectral</b> <b>ranges,</b> which contained useful absorption information, were determined based on the absorption characteristics of triglyceride and the absorption interference of water in serum.

30|$|It was {{previously}} {{shown that the}} blue and red <b>spectral</b> <b>ranges,</b> the main absorption bands of chlorophyll, are only sensitive to low chlorophyll levels, but at moderate to high levels, they become insensitive (Gitelson and Merzlyak, 199419961997). In these <b>spectral</b> <b>ranges,</b> reflectance is only sensitive to total chlorophyll levels at 90  mg m- 2 (Gitelson et al., 2003). Such low levels of chlorophyll are found in highly stressed or senescent leaves. The three sweet potato varieties {{used in this study}} grew well under greenhouse conditions, and the lowest chlorophyll content recorded was 99  mg m- 2 in yellow leaves (Table  1). In both the model development and validation datasets, chlorophyll contents were not low. Therefore, the blue and red spectral reflectances for sweet potato leaves should be insensitive to chlorophyll content. For the green and yellow (G[*]+[*]Y) sweet potato leaves, Rλ values in the visible blue (400 [*]~[*] 500  nm) and visible red (660 [*]~[*] 690) ranges showed the lowest correlations with chlorophyll content, but Rλ values showed maximum sensitivity to the chlorophyll content in the green (500 [*]~[*] 600  nm) and red edge (around 700  nm) ranges (Figure  2 A). This was due to the strong absorption by chlorophyll in the blue (400 [*]~[*] 500  nm) and red (660 [*]~[*] 690  nm) <b>spectral</b> <b>ranges,</b> but weak absorption in the green (500 [*]~[*] 600  nm) and red edge areas (around 700  nm). Therefore, reflectance in the green and red edge ranges can be used as more-precise measurements for developing leaf chlorophyll content estimation algorithms (Lichtenthaler et al., 1996; Gamon and Surfus, 1999; Gitelson et al., 2002). For green and yellow (G[*]+[*]Y) leaves, three indices derived from the reciprocal reflectance, [(Rλ)- 1 - (RNIR)- 1], [(RNIR/Rλ) - 1], and [1 - (Rλ/RNIR)], displayed strong correlation with the total chlorophyll content in the green and red edge <b>spectral</b> <b>ranges</b> (Figures  3 A, B, 4 A).|$|R

25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free <b>spectral</b> <b>range</b> (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E
