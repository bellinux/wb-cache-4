40|$|Water quality {{models are}} {{increasingly}} being used routinely to help ascertain the quality of water in drinking water distribution systems for design and operational management purposes. Conventional water quality models are demand driven and consequently do not incorporate the effects of any deficiency in pressure on the water quality throughout the distribution network. This paper assesses a new integrated pressure dependent hydraulic and water quality model. The model {{is an extension of}} the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and <b>subnormal</b> <b>pressure</b> and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with <b>subnormal</b> <b>pressures,</b> if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory. The results here may be indicative of modelling errors that may not have been recognised explicitly hitherto...|$|R

5000|$|When a {{normally}} pressured {{formation is}} raised {{toward the surface}} while prevented from losing pore fluid in the process, it will change from normal pressure (at a greater depth) to abnormal pressure (at a shallower depth). When this happens, and then one drill into the formation, mud weights of up to 20 ppg (2397 kg/m ³) may be required for control. This process accounts {{for many of the}} shallow, abnormally pressured zones in the world. In areas where faulting is present, salt layers or domes are predicted, or excessive geothermal gradients are known, drilling operations may encounter abnormal pressure. Abnormal pore pressure is defined as any pore pressure that is greater than the hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluid occupying the pore space. It is sometimes called overpressure or geopressure. An abnormally pressured formation can often be predicted using well history, surface geology, downhole logs or geophysical surveys.Subnormal pore pressure is defined as any formation pressure that is less than the corresponding fluid hydrostatic pressure at a given depth. Subnormally pressured formations have pressure gradients lower than fresh water or less than 0.433 psi/ft (0.0979 bar/m). Naturally occurring <b>subnormal</b> <b>pressure</b> can be developed when the overburden has been stripped away, leaving the formation exposed at the surface.Depletion of original pore fluids through evaporation, capillary action and dilution produces hydrostatic gradients below 0.433 psi/ft (0.0979 bar/m). <b>Subnormal</b> <b>pressures</b> may also be induced through depletion of formation fluids.If Formation Pressure < Hydrostatic pressure then it is under pressured.

40|$|Critical pressure-deficient {{operating}} conditions frequently occur in water distribution networks. Head driven analysis (HDA) of water distribution networks {{allows for the}} pressure-dependent nature of nodal flows and, therefore, yields the actual nodal flows and heads for both normal and <b>subnormal</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. Hence, HDA simulation models are more practical than demand driven analysis models that assume that all demands are satisfied in full even under pressure-deficient conditions. This paper describes an approach in which a new pressure-dependent demand function that has no discontinuities has been incorporated in the Gradient Method. The procedure has been tested extensively and demonstrated {{to be capable of}} effectively simulating both normal and pressure-deficient {{operating conditions}}.

40|$|In a water {{distribution}} system (WDS), low pressure situations can arise {{for a variety}} of reasons. For example, over time, the demands may exceed the capacity of the WDS or some major components e. g. pumps and trunk mains may not be operational while repairs are carried out. The extent to which demands are satisfied in a WDS is governed by the actual amount of pressure in the system and pressure-deficient operating conditions are not uncommon. Despite this, the conventional modelling approach works well only under fully satisfactory pressure regimes, with results for <b>subnormal</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions often being inaccurate, misleading and even unreasonable. Sample results for a prototype FORTRAN computer program which can perform head-driven analysis using a globally convergent Newton-Raphson scheme are presented.

Noise measurements were made at the three angles of attack: 0 °, 1. 4 ° and 4. 2 °, and covered a range of Reynolds numbers between 1. 0 × 105 and 6. 0 × 105.

Our principal results are as follows: (1) The winds associated with the diurnal tide weaken during geomagnetic storms, causing primarily zonally oriented changes in the evening sector, few changes in the middle of the afternoon, a combination of zonal and meridional changes in the late morning region, and mainly meridional changes early in the morning; (2) Decreases in the magnitudes of the horizontal winds associated with the diurnal tide lead to a net downward tendency in the vertical winds blowing through a constant pressure surface; (3) Because of these changes in the vertical wind, there is an increase in compressional heating (or a decrease in cooling through expansion), and thus temperatures in the low- to middle-latitudes of the winter hemisphere increase; (4) Densities of all neutral species increase on a constant height surface, but the pattern of changes in the O/N 2 ratio is not well ordered on these surfaces; (5) The pattern of changes in the O/N 2 ratio is better ordered on constant <b>pressure</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The increases in this ratio on constant <b>pressure</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the low- to middle-latitude, winter hemisphere are caused by a more downward tendency in the vertical winds that blow through the constant <b>pressure</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Nitrogen-poor air is then advected downward through the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface,</b> increasing the O/N 2 ratio; (6) The daytime geographical distribution of the modeled increases in the O/N 2 ratio on a constant <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> in the low- to middle-latitudes of the winter hemisphere correspond very closely with those of increases in the modeled electron densities at the F 2 peak...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{gas turbine}} engines, film cooling is {{extensively}} used {{to cool the}} components exposed to the hot mainstream gas path. In implementing film cooling on modern gas turbine engines, the trailing edge film poses a particularly challenging design problem. From an aerodynamic point of view, {{the trailing edge of}} a blade is designed to be as thin as possible. However, this conflicts with the implementation of the cooling design. The most common method of film cooling the trailing edge is via late <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> discrete film cooling holes. Another method of cooling the trailing edge is by using discrete <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> slots. This thesis documents a comparative aerodynamic and heat transfer study of three trailing edge cooling configurations. The study was carried out using a large scale, low speed wind tunnel situated at the Southwell Laboratory. The three trailing edge cooling configurations considered were as follows. First is the common late pressure film cooling of the trailing edge via discrete film cooling holes. This configuration is designated as datum configuration. Second is the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> slot coolant ejection. This configuration was designated as cast cutback configuration. The third is the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> ejection via discrete film cooling holes within a step cutback. This configuration was designated the machined cutback configuration. The above configurations were incorporated into three flat plates manufactured using stereolithography. In the aerodynamic study, the static pressure distribution and discharge coefficient for the three configurations were compared. Furthermore, two dimensional total pressure measurements were carried out using a traverse mechanism downstream of the test plates. The total pressure measurements were used to compute the mixed out losses for the three configurations. It was found that the datum and machined cutback configurations have similar discharge coefficients and mixed out losses whilst the cast cutback configuration produces greater mixed out loss. The film effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient on the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> downstream of the coolant ejection was obtained using a steady state heat transfer technique. The effectiveness measurements were compared with those from the literature and correlated against the two dimensional slot model. The heat transfer measurements show that the cast cutback configuration has the potential to give higher effectiveness at the trailing edge. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R

A direct spectral-element Navier-Stokes solver {{has been used for}} the laminar flow regime (Re 106 are based on the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model. The rotor wakes are represented by velocity distortions moving along the inlet boundary of the computational domain. After interception, the rotor wake migrates towards the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> of the stator blades where it forms a pair of counter-rotating vortices. A moving series of such vortex pairs is the dominant form of unsteady flow over the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface.</b> The unsteady flow over the suction surface is characterized by a street of co-rotating vortices, produced in the leading edge region. These vortices consist of boundary layer fluid distorted and detached by the passing wakes. Downstream of the leading edge, each of these vortices induces an associated, opposite-sign vortex. The blade loading fluctuations arising from wake interaction, are of two kinds. First, a strong pressure pulse occurs on the leading edge upon wake interception. This pulse is a potential flow effect associated with the excess tangential velocity in the wake. Second, a moving pattern of pressure fluctuations, associated with the vortices, is present over the blade <b>surface.</b> The <b>pressure</b> fluctuations are negative on the suction surface, and positive on the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface.</b> The unsteady flow features over the suction surface can be adequately represented by linearized perturbation calculations, where the disturbance flow associated with the wakes is linearized about a steady viscous flow. Three parameters influence the unsteady flow over the suction surface-stator blade loading, excess wake momentum in the stator frame, and wake reduced frequency. The strength of the disturbance flow vortices is directly proportional to the wake momentum and decreases at higher reduced frequencies. An adverse pressure gradient results in stronger vortices and pressure fluctuations. On the <b>pressure</b> <b>surface,</b> the amount of unsteady flow depends on the excess wake momentum only. Strategies for controlling the unsteady flow are simulated using appropriate blade surface boundary conditions. Fluid removal from the suction surface prevents formation of vortices and reduces the associated loading disturbances.

The ladder structure of these tones was eliminated by modifying the tunnel to approximate to anechoic conditions.
