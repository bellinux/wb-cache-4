A {{concurrence}} {{of two or}} more causes, not separately producing each its own effect, but {{interfering with}} or modifying the effects of one another, takes place, as has already been explained in two different ways. In the one, which is exemplified by the joint operation of different forces in mechanics, the <b>separate</b> <b>effects</b> of all the causes continue to be produced, but are compounded with one another, and disappear in one total. In the other, illustrated by the case of chemical action, the <b>separate</b> <b>effects</b> cease entirely, and are succeeded by phenomena altogether different, and governed by different laws.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} when {{information asymmetry}} among investors affects {{the cost of}} capital in excess of standard risk factors. When equity markets are perfectly competitive, information asymmetry has no <b>separate</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the cost of}} capital. When markets are imperfect, information asymmetry can have a <b>separate</b> <b>effect</b> on firms’ cost of capital. Consistent with our prediction, we find that information asymmetry has a positive relation with firms’ cost of capital in excess of standard risk factors when markets are imperfect and no relation when markets approximate perfect competition. Overall, our results show that the degree of market competition is an important conditioning variable to consider when examining the relation between information asymmetry and cost of capital...|$|R
