5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as <b>sneaker</b> males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. <b>Sneaker</b> males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E

With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They hover over a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. Males {{may need to be}} 6 or 7 years old to function capably as parental males, but may be able to function as <b>sneaker</b> or satellite males when they are as young as 2 or 3 years old. The smaller satellite and <b>sneaker</b> males may get mauled by the more powerful parental males, but they spawn when they are younger and they do not put energy into parental care.|$|E

25|$|Kleptogamy {{is a good}} {{strategy}} in many ways.

Secondly, the <b>sneakers</b> do not provide parental care to their eggs. The paired males provide parental care instead of the <b>sneakers.</b> Therefore, the <b>sneakers</b> can save energy, and they can put more effort into finding new targets for cheating.|$|R

25|$|Aggressive sex is an {{activity}} that most cephalopods engage in; a protein in the male capsule sheath stimulates this behavior. Male- male aggression is seen in cephalopods; smaller males tend to lose these interactions. When a female is near the males charge on another continuously and begin to flair their arms. If neither male backs away, the arms extend to the back exposing the mouth {{which leads to the}} biting of arm tips. During mate competition males also participate in a technique called flushing. This technique is used by the second male attempting to mate with a female. Flushing removes spermatophores in the buccal cavity that was placed there by the first mate by forcing water into the cavity. Another behavior that males engage in is <b>sneaker</b> mating or mimicry- smaller males adjust their behavior to that of a female in order to reduce aggression. By using this technique, they are able to fertilize the eggs while the larger male is distracted by different male. During this process, the <b>sneaker</b> males quickly insert drop like sperm into the seminal receptacle.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between reproductive morphology and reproductive tactics was examined in Scartella cristata, a combtooth blenny, which exhibits three behaviourally distinct mature male types: nesters, big males that care for eggs; hole-dwellers, medium-sized, non-reproducing males that are site-attached to a hole; <b>sneakers,</b> small, vagrant males that release sperm in the nests {{of the big}} males. The anal fin gland was a densely folded, mucous-secreting structure probably involved in pheromone synthesis. It was relatively larger in nesters than hole-dwellers, and altogether rudimentary in <b>sneakers.</b> <b>Sneakers</b> invested more in sperm production than nesters or hole-dwellers, suggesting adaptation to sperm competition. Approximately half of the testes of nesters and hole-dwellers was comprised of a highly developed efferent duct system or ‘testicular gland’, but this was extremely reduced in <b>sneakers.</b> In nesters the gland was characterized by many large vacuoles. A pair of secretory blind pouches was present in nesters and hole-dwellers, but barely visible in <b>sneakers.</b> In nesters, the sperm duct walls were thickened and highly secretory containing sperm dispersed in a granular matrix. In <b>sneakers</b> they were thinwalled and packed with concentrated sperm. Such differences probably represent different priorities for sperm production in relation to sperm competition and sperm economy. Thus it appears the accessory structures are traits developed specifically for a nesting tactic, whereas the gonad of <b>sneakers</b> is simply organized to produce as much sperm as possible...|$|R

25|$|Common musical {{aesthetics}} {{include a}} bass-heavy drumbeat, often emulating the slowed down breakbeat samples typical of hip hop in the 1990s, giving the genre a more psychedelic touch. Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially {{attributable to the}} influence of genres such as jazz and early R, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions - Massive Attack & Groove Armada collaborates with vocalists of mixed genders, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird, and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with <b>Sneaker</b> Pimps.|$|E
