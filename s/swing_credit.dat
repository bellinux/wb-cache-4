An earlier system of bilateral clearing accounts was replaced on January 1, 1964, by accounts with the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, using the transferable ruble as the unit of account. Although the bank provided a centralized mechanism of trade accounting and <b>swing</b> <b>credits</b> to cover temporary imbalances, it could not establish a system of multilateral clearing because of the centrally planned nature of the members' economies and the inconvertibility of their currencies. In 1987, the transferable ruble remained an artificial currency functioning as an accounting unit and was not a common instrument for multilateral settlement. For this reason, this currency continued to be termed [...] "transferable" [...] and not [...] "convertible." ...|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{financial}} turmoil {{has triggered}} a lively debate on ways of containing systemic risk and lessening {{the likelihood of}} boom-and-bust episodes in credit markets.

This paper uses a two-country DSGE model with financial frictions to illustrate how procyclicality in borrowing limits reinforces the "overreaction" of asset prices to shocks described by Aiyagari and Gertler (1999), and to quantify the stabilization gains from policies aimed at smoothing cyclical <b>swings</b> in <b>credit</b> conditions. Results suggest that, in financially constrained economies, the ensuing volatility reduction in equity prices, investment, and external imbalances would be sizable.

40|$|Abstract: The U. S. house {{price boom}} {{has been linked}} to an {{unsustainable}} easing of mortgage lending standards. However, time series models of U. S. house prices ignore changes in mortgage lending standards and perform poorly in the 2000 s. We incorporate data on mortgage standards for first time buyers into a model of US house prices based on the (inverted) demand for housing services. Our first time buyer loan-to-value series is weakly exogenous. It captures shifts in the supply of mortgage credit and not expectations of future house price appreciation. Using this series, we estimate a U. S. house price equation that yields a stable long-run cointegrating relationship, plausible income and price elasticities and an improved fit. Our findings suggest that <b>swings</b> in <b>credit</b> standards played a major, if not the major, role in driving the recent boom and bust in U. S. house prices...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} cycle {{refers to}} fluctuations in perceptions and attitudes about financial risk over time. It is often marked by <b>swings</b> in <b>credit</b> growth, asset prices, terms {{of access to}} external funding, and other financial developments. A single measure that summarised such indicators would simplify analysis of the financial cycle, with benefits for both systemic risk assessment and stabilisation policy. It is not obvious, however, how best to select and combine the many potentially relevant indicators or how {{the usefulness of the}} resulting measure might be assessed. One criterion is predictive power. This special feature reviews the power of three differently composed measures to predict output fluctuations up to two years ahead. One of the measures is found to have substantial predictive content for output forecasting at short horizons. However, this result seems to arise mainly from the inclusion of indicators strongly related to actual financial system stress, rather than from swings in more generalised perceptions and attitudes about financial risk. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{inflation}} {{under control}} in many in {{middle income countries}} (MICs), it is now <b>swings</b> in <b>credit,</b> investment and asset prices that affect these countries the most. In this paper we present a framework to analyze both theoretically and empirically how credit market shocks are propagated and amplified in MICs. The strength of the credit channel in our model derives from two key characteristics of MICs: (i) a sharp asymmetry across the tradables (T) sector and the more bank-dependent nontradables (N) sector; and (ii) a significant degree of currency mismatch in the N-sector. This makes movements in the real exchange rate the driving element in the amplification of shocks. The equilibrium imposes unambiguous contemporaneous linkages among key macroeconomic variables and allows us to derive structural VARs. Estimating these VARs using quarterly data {{for a group of}} MICs, we find evidence for a strong credit channel, for a balance sheet effect and for asymmetric sectorial responses. Our findings indicate that inflation targeting is not sufficient to guarantee economic stability, as such policy might overlook the development of lending booms and associated sectorial asymmetries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{landscape}} of charitable giving in Canada has been altered {{over the past}} decade by tax incentives favoring large gifts of capital. Next steps could include tax credits for donations of real estate assets and private company shares. This policy reform promises to increase charitable giving, broaden the donation base and make charities less vulnerable to market <b>swings.</b> These <b>credits</b> can be introduced {{in a manner consistent with}} existing laws that reduces the chance of tax system abuse. 1 Contribution limits increased from 20 percent to 75 percent of income per annum and 100 percent at death. 2 Statistics Canada does not break out giving data by type of asset or timing (i. e., gifts by will or life insurance). The absence of detailed tax data makes it difficult to state definitively the relative importance of capital tax incentives on giving. The sharp rise in giving is coincident with introduction of tax incentives. Wages and income grew by 87. 5 percent from 1995 to 2007 versus 140 percent for donations. [CANSIM Table 380 - 0016]. In the two decades prior to 1996, giving tracked wages. Other factors affecting giving may include capital market growth, real estate values, lower tax rates, changing philanthropic attitudes, more fundraising, and increased concentration of wealth. Since 1996, successive federal governments in Canada have introduced more than 20 tax incentives t...|$|R

40|$|Long-span {{time series}} on credit by {{institutional}} sectors and industries are {{not readily available}} in Denmark. The paper constructs annual time series for credit to Danish residents by sector and industry 1951 - 2005 and explores the trends and cycles in credit {{during the past five}} decades. There {{seems to have been a}} structural shift in the relationship between growth in real credit and economic activity around 1980 that might be related to the development in the monetary and financial system broadly defined. In the post- 1980 period characterised by increased influence from market forces due to financial liberalisation and internationalisation the <b>swings</b> in real <b>credit</b> growth have been very large relative to the economic growth compared to the pre- 1980 period where credit rationing and exchange controls served as important economicpolicy instruments. The credit expansion during the last five decades has caused an upward trend in loan-tovalue ratios. However, throughout the entire period the macro level of non-financial sector indebtedness relative to the stock of real assets and net financial assets has been fairly low, even after the house price decline during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. The process of financial liberalisation in Denmark has therefore been relatively smooth and has not raised any concern regarding financial stability seen from a macroeconomic point of view. There seems to have been a shift over time in the short-term cyclical behaviour of commercial credit to the various industries. Real credit to agriculture, industry and services were contemporaneous with private sector real GDP in the pre- 1980 period but has lagged the business cycle with one year in the post- 1980 period. This might reflect the more restricted access to credit in the pre- 1980 period, which gave firms an incentive to raise loans at an early stage of the business cycle in order to be sure to have command over the funding necessary for their planned investments. Another possible explanation could be the increased significance of commercial and industrial foundations in the Danish economy. Foundations might be seen as patient owners without an urgent need for return on equity. In step with the increased capital accumulation in those foundations it might therefore have been possible for Danish firms to finance larger shares of their fixed investments in the initial stages of an upturn with own funds from retained earnings rather than loans from domestic and foreign credit institutes...|$|R
