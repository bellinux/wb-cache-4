5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating roller screw system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating roller screw system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Certain cams can be {{characterized}} by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a roller follower (a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end) would make as the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the radial displacement experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is {{the motion of the}} follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the follower is at rest, and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.However, the most common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters</b> relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the tip circle.

The presentation given in AS 1403 and particularly ASB 249 lends itself to computerised calculations owing to the rigorous design procedure and time required for complete analysis. The programme {{has the capacity to}} analyse shafts supported by two bearings, being either simply-supported or cantilevered and is best suited to the design of gearbox shafts. The programme may also be used to analyse drive shafts where the peak shaft torque is entered directly in the input data. Shafts with one or two gears being either spur, helical or double-helical type may be analysed. AS 1403 also provides for- the design of hollow construction shafts. In keeping with modern design practice, a comprehensive array of gear and bearing fits have been provided. Optimisation in this study {{is aimed at}} developing a solution criterion for minimising the shaft diameter. Recent design practice requires reduced <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters</b> where possible in order to locate components and reduce drive inertia. Savings in material and manufacturing costs can thus be expected. Execution of the optimisation programme follows entry of all input data in the required format.

The coordinates of the light stripe centers on the shaft were obtained by a novel grayscale barycenter extraction algorithm along the radial direction.

A virtual plane was established perpendicular to the measured shaft axis, and the coordinates of the light stripe centers on the shaft were projected to the virtual plane.

In 2016, Zheng [10] reported a method for measuring the diameter of a train wheel by line structured-light measurement system. The axle of the wheelset and the wheel tread are measured by structured-light sensors, and the center of the rolling round is calculated by the axle. At last, the diameter of the rolling round is determined by the center and the contact points on the wheel tread. The method had been proven to be quite stable and accurate by static experiment and dynamic field experiment. According to the different shape of the projection feature, the structured light can be divided into different types and the line-structured light is mainly studied in this paper.|$|E

40|$|Drilled shaft {{foundations}} {{are increasingly being}} used to support various types of buildings and infrastructure facilities. The load carrying capacity of these drilled shafts is largely dependent on their diameter. The large loads carried by such structural elements make quality control and assurance of their diameters during construction extremely critical.

Propeller fans can be used as either main mine fans or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

40|$|Different {{practices}} in paleoanthropology and legal medicine raise {{questions concerning the}} robustness of body mass (BM) prediction. Integrating personal identification from body mass estimation with skeleton is not a classic approach in legal medicine. The originality of our study {{is the use of}} an elderly sample in order to push prediction methods to their limits and to discuss about implications in paleoanthropology and legal medicine. The aim is to observe the accuracy of BM prediction in relation to the body mass index (BMI, index of classification) using five femoral head (FH) methods and one shaft (FSH) method. The sample is composed of 41 dry femurs obtained from dissection where age (c. 82 years) and gender are known, and weight (c. 59. 5  kg) and height are measured upon admission to the body leg service. We show that the estimation of the mean BM of the elderly sample is not significantly different to the real mean BM when the appropriate formula is used for the femoral head diameter. In fact, the best prediction is obtained with the McHenry formula (1992), which was based on a sample with an equivalent average mass to that of our sample. In comparison, external <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters,</b> which are known to be more influenced by mechanical stimuli than femoral head diameters, yield less satisfactory results with the McHenry formula (1992) for <b>shaft</b> <b>diameters.</b> Based on all the methods used and the distinctive selected sample, overestimation (always observed with the different femoral head methods) can be restricted to 1. 1 %. The observed overestimation with the shaft method can be restricted to 7 %. However, the estimation of individual BM is much less reliable. The BMI has a strong impact on the accuracy of individual BM prediction, and is unquestionably more reliable for individuals with normal BMI (9. 6 % vs 16. 7 % for the best prediction error). In this case, the FH method is also the better predictive method but not if we integrate the total sample (i. e. the FSH method is better with more varied BMI). Finally, the estimation of the mean BM of a sample can be used with more confidence compared to the estimation of individual BM. The former is very useful in an evolutionary perspective whereas the latter should be used in keeping with the information gathered on the studied specimen in order to reduce prediction errors. Finally, the BM estimation can be a parameter to consider for personal identification. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
