2500|$|In 1931, Hugh Trenchard was {{appointed}} as Police Commissioner [...] Trenchard served {{as head of}} the Metropolitan Police until 1935 and during his tenure he instigated several changes. These included limiting membership of the Police Federation, introducing limited terms of employment and the short-lived creation of separate career paths for the lower and higher ranks akin to the military system of officer and non-commissioned career streams. Perhaps Trenchard's most well known achievement during his time as Commissioner was the establishment of the Hendon Police College which originally was the institution from which Trenchard's junior <b>station</b> <b>inspectors</b> graduated before following a career in the higher ranks.|$|R
