Troilus {{is on his}} knees, <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> drawing his sword when Achilles' spear has already stabbed him and Aeneas comes {{too late to save}} him.

5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river {{for hundreds of years}} before the arrival of whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century.

Fishing, hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands. Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E

5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Matsui's {{instructions}} {{said nothing}} about treatment of Chinese POWs. Matsui inadvertently contributed to the atrocity {{in a major way}} when he demanded on December 14 that his triumphal entrance into Nanking be scheduled for the early date of December 17. At the time his subordinates in Nanking objected because they were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> scrambling to apprehend all the former Chinese soldiers hiding in the city and had no facilities in which to hold them. Regardless, Matsui held firm, and in many cases his men responded to the conundrum by ordering that all their prisoners be executed immediately after capture. Most of the large-scale massacres that took place within Nanking occurred in the days immediately prior to Matsui's entrance into the city.|$|E

While the {{aircraft}} had first been {{picked up by a}} German radar station shortly after they crossed the Norwegian coastline, the battleship was not immediately warned. At the time of the attack Tirpitz was preparing to sail for her high-speed trials, and her crew were busy unmooring the vessel.

The warning from the radar station arrived shortly before the British aircraft appeared over Kaafjord, and the battleship's crew were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> moving to their battle stations when the attack commenced; at this time not all of the watertight doors were closed and some damage-control stations were not fully manned.|$|E

Training for the raid was begun immediately, but encountered several problems. 38 Wing was a new unit <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> formation, so No. 51 Squadron RAF under Wing Commander Percy Charles Pickard was selected to provide the aircraft and aircrew needed for the operation, although Group Captain Nigel Norman of 38 Wing would remain in overall command.

5|$|Although the {{fighting}} {{had not yet}} spread to the Pacific, by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies {{about the possibility of}} a war with Japan. After a review of the defences around Singapore and Malaya, the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region. In October, the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and supporting elements. As a result, the 2/18th—with a strength of 793 men—subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941, bound for Singapore. The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, so the deployment was only intended to be short, as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May. Consequently, the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and while they were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> being brought up to full strength.|$|E

40|$|Globally, the {{internationalization}} {{of higher}} education has assumed a key position on domestic policy agendas, not only for educational and scientific reasons, but also increasingly due to socio-economic con-siderations.

Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and lacked realism, meaning that commanders did not benefit from handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{accounts}} of the subsequent battle: the account of Wen Daya, and a later official account, which became the dominant version in traditional Chinese historiography. The latter was compiled {{during the reign of}} Li Shimin, and therefore enhances his own role, having him decide the battle in a cavalry charge, while denigrating the role of both his father and his elder brother Li Jiancheng, whom Li Shimin would murder and supplant on the throne. The two accounts are difficult to reconcile, but Wen Daya's account, despite its own inadequacies, is to be preferred as an eyewitness testimony. According to Wen Daya, Li Yuan feared that Song Laosheng would deny battle and instead force him to engage in a prolonged and costly siege of the town. For this reason, as soon as the headquarters with the cavalry cleared the hills and came into view of Huoyi in the early afternoon of 8 September, Li Yuan sent his sons {{at the head of the}} cavalry to manoeuvre before the walls of Huoyi, hoping to entice the Sui army to come out. In this he hoped to exploit Song Laosheng's reputation for rashness. The slower-moving infantry, which formed bulk of Li Yuan's army, was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> traversing the hills, and Li Yuan sent officers to hurry them up. Song Laosheng, who may have seen this as an opportunity to destroy his enemy piecemeal, deployed his army outside the town wall, but proved reluctant to advance further, and had to be goaded further away from the town through a feigned retreat by the cavalry.|$|E
