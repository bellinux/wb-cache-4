Other soil series in the watershed include the Chenango-Pope-Holly series, the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich series, and the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. The Chenango-Pope-Holly series {{is found in the}} lower reaches of the watershed, the Leck Kill-Minersville-Calvin series is found in the northwestern part of it, and the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich series occurs in the southwestern part of the watershed. All other parts of it are occupied by the Berks-Weikert-Alvira series.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} soil {{series in the}} {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is the Watson-Berks-Alvira series. It is a <b>shaly</b> silt loam that mostly occurs in the watershed's plains and highlands. Other soil series in the watershed include the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series and the Chenango-Pope-Holly series. The Chenango-Pope-Holly occupies areas near the creek itself in its lower reaches and the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series occurs {{throughout most of the}} southern edge of the watershed. All other parts of the watershed lie over soil of the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series. 80 percent of the soil is of the Watson-Berks-Alvira series, 12 percent is of the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series, and 8 percent is of the Chenango-Pope-Holly series. The Holly-Monogahela-Basher soil association is found in the floodplain of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and <b>shaly</b> gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E
30|$|Three macrostructures {{have been}} {{identified}} over the study area in the Greater Ughelli depobelt. Each macrostructure {{is characterized by a}} sandy sequence in the north which becomes <b>shalier</b> to the south. The classic Niger Delta stratigraphic sequence of holo-marine shales (Akata Formation), fluviodeltaic sand-shale intercalation (Agbada Formation) and upper coastal plain sands (Benin Formation) is recognised throughout OML A and B. Some of the regional down-to-basin DTB faults within the study area extended from the Older Akata Formation to Younger Benin Formation.|$|R
50|$|The Deicke and Millbrig {{bentonite}} layers {{lie in the}} Decorah Formation, {{which is}} primarily composed of shale and carbonate rocks. The two bentonite layers are also separated by layers of shale and carbonate rocks. These layers in-between the units change as you correlate the units. In some areas the rock units between the bentonite layers are primarily shale and in those areas the carbonate rocks found normally are much thinner in thickness and are <b>shalier</b> {{than they are in}} other areas where this stratigraphic sequence is found. Moreover, in other field areas the shale layer between the Deicke and Millbrig Bentonite layers is thinner and the carbonate rocks like wackestone are much more predominant.|$|R
5000|$|The type {{locality}} for the Coldwater Sandstone is in Coldwater Canyon, {{a western}} {{branch of the}} Sespe River {{a few miles north}} of Fillmore. [...] The unit is typically around half a mile thick, ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 feet through most of its extent, although it thins westward to around 1,000 feet thick in the hills north of El Capitan State Beach. From there going west to Gaviota, the unit gradually grades into the Sacate Formation, a similar but <b>shalier</b> and more siltstone-rich unit which is also conformably overlain on the Cozy Dell Formation. [...] The Coldwater and Sacate Formations are sometimes considered as a single unit, particularly underneath the Santa Barbara Channel where they appear in drill cores. The Gaviota Formation is deposited conformably on top of the Coldwater-Sacate {{in the western part of}} the dual unit's extent, and the Sespe Formation appears conformably on top of it elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with <b>shaly</b> texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E

Prominent outcrops are located between Death Valley Buttes and Daylight Pass, in upper Echo Canyon, and just west of Mare Spring in Titus Canyon. Before tilting to their present orientation, these four formations were a continuous pile of mud and sand [...] deep that accumulated slowly on the nearshore ocean bottom.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work {{deals with the}} diagenesis and reservoir quality of the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein in south-western Germany. The Buntsandstein {{in the study area}} is a continental succession with mostly fluvial and subordinately lacustrine and aeolian sediments. The most promising reservoir units are the Lower and Middle Buntsandstein, consisting mostly of stacked fluvial channel sandstones, interlayered by only thin mudstone beds. The Upper Buntsandstein is <b>shalying</b> upward and is thus less favourable as reservoir. The mineralogy of the Buntsandstein indicates intense weathering. Plagioclase is completely absent, because it was already partly dissolved in the hinterland and finally replaced by kaolinite shortly after deposition. Dissolution vugs after plagioclase were apparently lost due to compaction. K-feldspar dissolution occurred after framework-supporting quartz cementation. This cement stratigraphic position is indicated by less compaction-affected vugs or “ghosts” after K-feldspar. In most cases, K-feldspar is replaced by kaolinite and minor illite. Neither plagioclase nor K-feldspar dissolution have therefore a significantly positive effect on reservoir qualities. Regionally different quartz cementation west and east of the URG was observed: The quartz cement content on the western flank hardly reaches 10...|$|R
30|$|The {{study area}} {{falls within the}} {{southern}} part of the Bumma Field (Fig.  1), which Reijers (2011) reported as being <b>shalier</b> than the northern part of the field, thus having lower chances of productive reservoirs. Shell Petroleum Development Company Internal Report, (2007) highlighted that the lack of productive reservoirs in {{the southern part of}} the field have significantly led to drilling marginal and dry wells (Table  1), so there is need to adopt an improved technique such as cross-plot analysis of Poisson impedance and its inversion to discriminate lithofacies and predict fluid types in Bumma Field. The Poisson impedance was first published by Quakenbush et al. (2006) and they derived the attribute seismically by combining the discrimination characteristics of Poisson’s ratio along with density, both of which are parameters useful in reservoir delineation. Also, several works have highlighted Poisson impedance as a very favorable attribute for identifying new prospect and characterizing clastic reservoir (Mazumdar 2007; Omodu et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2010; Zhou and Hilterman 2010; and; Sharma and Chopra 2013). Therefore, the main aim of this study is to use cross-plot analysis and seismic simultaneous inversion-derived Poisson impedance to discriminate lithofacies and predict fluid types associated with H-reservoirs (comprising of H 1, H 4 and H 5 sands) in Bumma Field.|$|R
500|$|In {{south central}} Pennsylvania, the Marcellus is mapped with three members, {{from top to}} base: The Mahanoy Member(Dmm), a dark gray to grayish black silty shale and siltstone; the Turkey Ridge Member(Dmt), an olive to dark-gray fine to medium grained sandstone; and the Shamokin Member(Dms), a dark gray to grayish black fissile {{carbonaceous}} shale that is calcareous in places near the base. The Turkey Ridge is commonly mapped in the Mahantango Formation, or included in the Montebello Formation(Dmot), and only the Shamokin correlates with the Marcellus on adjacent map sheets. In extreme eastern Pennsylvania, the Broadhead Creek member, a dark gray silty shale with dark gray <b>shaly</b> limestone concretions, appears above the Stony Hollow and Union Springs, in a layer up to [...] thick.|$|E
500|$|Tapeats Sandstone averages 525million {{years old}} and is made of medium- to {{coarse-grained}} sand and conglomerate that was deposited on an ancient shore (see 3a in [...] ). Ripple marks are common in the upper members of this dark brown thin-bedded layer. Fossils and imprint trails of trilobites and brachiopods have also {{been found in the}} Tapeats. Today it is a cliff-former that is [...] thick. Bright Angel Shale averages 515million {{years old and}} is made of mudstone-derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and <b>shaly</b> limestone with a few thin beds of dolomite. It was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod, trilobite, and worm fossils (see 3b in figure 1). The color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish-tan to gray parts. It is a slope-former and is [...] thick. Glauconite is responsible for the green coloration of the Bright Angel. Muav Limestone averages 505million years old and is made of gray, thin-bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from calcium carbonate precipitates (see 3c in figure 1). The western part of the canyon has a much thicker sequence of Muav than the eastern part. The Muav is a cliff-former, [...] thick.|$|E
2500|$|The upper {{member of}} the Dox Formation is the Ochoa Point Member. Within the central Grand Canyon, it also has been removed by pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion. It {{consists}} of micaceous mudstone that grades upward into a predominantly red quartzose, silty sandstone. Sedimentary structures found in this member include, salt crystal casts in the mudstone, and asymmetrical ripple marks and small-scale cross beds, in the sandstones. The Ochoa Point Member is [...] thick and forms steep slopes and cliffs below the Cardenas Basalt. The Dox Formation that directly underlies the Cardenas Basalt consists of brick-red to vermilion well-bedded sandstone, with parallel bedding and <b>shaly</b> partings, forming smooth slopes. It also contains a thin, discontinuous basaltic lava flow.|$|E
2500|$|Dublin is Ireland's oldest settlement.

The historic town grew up on the southern bank of the River Liffey, a few kilometres upstream from the river's outfall into Dublin Bay. The original settlement was situated on a ridge overlooking a shallow ford in the river, which had probably been a regular crossing-point since earliest times. The bedrock underlying the city is [...] limestone, a dark <b>shaly</b> sedimentary rock which was once quarried locally and whose mottled grey appearance can still be seen today in some of the city's oldest buildings.

60|$|The beds of gypsum, {{together}} with the red alternating sandstones and conglomerates, present so perfect and curious a resemblance with those seen in our former section in the basin-valley of Yeso, that I cannot doubt {{the identity of the}} two formations: I may add, that a little westward of the P. del Inca, a mass of gypsum passed into a fine-grained, hard, brown sandstone, which contained some layers of black, calcareous, compact, <b>shaly</b> rock, precisely like that seen in such vast masses on the Peuquenes range.|$|E
60|$|Leaving the basin-plain of Yeso, {{the road}} rapidly ascends, passing by {{mountains}} {{composed of the}} gypseous and associated beds, with their stratification greatly disturbed and therefore not easily intelligible: hence {{this part of the}} section has been left uncoloured. Shortly before reaching the great Pequenes ridge, the lowest stratum visible [N] is a red sandstone or mudstone, capped by a vast thickness of black, compact, calcareous, <b>shaly</b> rock [O], which has been thrown into four lofty, though small ridges: looking northward, the strata in these ridges are seen gradually to rise in inclination, becoming in some distant pinnacles absolutely vertical.|$|E

60|$|Two {{of these}} shells, namely, the Gryphaea and Trigonia, {{appear to be}} {{identical}} with species collected by Meyen and myself on the Peuquenes range; and {{in the opinion of}} Von Buch and M. d'Orbigny, the two formations belong to the same age. I must here add, that Professor E. Forbes, who has examined my specimens from this place and from the Peuquenes range, has likewise a strong impression that they indicate the Cretaceous period, and probably an early epoch in it: so that all the palaeontologists who have seen these fossils nearly coincide in opinion regarding their age. The limestone, however, with these fossils here lies at the very base of the formation, just above the porphyritic conglomerate, and certainly several thousand feet lower in the series, than the equivalent, fossiliferous, black, <b>shaly</b> rocks high up on the Peuquenes range.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the fossils}} which I {{collected}} were {{found a good}} way down the western slope of the main ridge, and hence must originally have been covered up by a great thickness of the black <b>shaly</b> rock, independently of the now denuded, thick, overlying masses of red sandstone. I neglected {{at the time to}} estimate how many hundred or rather thousand feet thick the superincumbent strata must have been: and I will not now attempt to do so. This, however, would have been a highly interesting point, as indicative of a great amount of subsidence, of which we shall hereafter find {{in other parts of the}} Cordillera analogous evidence during this same period. The altitude of the Peuquenes Range, considering its not great antiquity, is very remarkable; many of the fossils were embedded at the height of 13,210 feet, and the same beds are prolonged up to at least from fourteen to fifteen thousand feet above the level of the sea.|$|E
6000|$|The {{bitterness}} of death remained behind {{as we passed}} out of the baneful Bights. Wind and wave were dead against us, yet I greatly enjoyed the gradual emerging of the sun through his shroud of [...] "smokes;" [...] the increasing consciousness that a moon and stars really exist; the soft blue haze of the sky, and the coolness of 73° F. at 6 A.M. in the captain's cabin. I had also time to enjoy these charms. The [...] "Torch" [...] was not provided with [...] "despatch- boilers:" [...] she was profoundly worm-eaten, and a yard of copper, occasionally clapped on, did not prevent her making some four feet of water a day. So we rolled leisurely along the well-known Gaboon shore, and faintly sighted from afar Capes Lopez and St. Catherine, and the fringing ranges of Mayumba-land, a blue line of heights based upon gently rising banks, ruddy and white, probably of <b>shaly</b> clay. The seventh day (August 5) placed us off the well-known [...] "red hills" [...] of Loango-land.|$|E
60|$|I {{believe this}} last great bed {{is covered by}} other nearly similar alternations; but the section is here {{obscured}} by a tilt from the next porphyritic chain, presently to be described. I have given this section in detail, as being illustrative of the general character of the mountains in this neighbourhood; but it must not be supposed that any one stratum long preserves the same character. At a distance of between only two and three miles the green mudstones and white indurated tuffs are {{to a great extent}} replaced by red sandstone and black calcareous <b>shaly</b> rocks, alternating together. The white indurated tuff, bed 11, here contains little or no gypsum, whereas on the northern and opposite side of the valley, it is of much greater thickness and abounds with layers of gypsum, some of them alternating with thin seams of crystalline carbonate of lime. The uppermost, dark-coloured, hard mudstone, bed 12, is in this neighbourhood the most constant stratum. The whole series differs to a considerable extent, especially in its upper part, from that met with at [BB], in {{the lower part of the}} valley; nevertheless, I do not doubt that they are equivalents.|$|E
6000|$|... § LXXXVI. Let us then {{consider}} our definition as including the narrowest arch, or tracery bar, {{as well as}} the broadest roof, and it will be nearly a perfect one. For the fact is, that all good Gothic is nothing more than the developement, in various ways, and on every conceivable scale, of the group formed by the pointed arch for the bearing line below, and the gable for the protecting line above; and from the huge, gray, <b>shaly</b> slope of the cathedral roof, with its elastic pointed vaults beneath, to the slight crown-like points that enrich the smallest niche of its doorway, one law and one expression will be found in all. The modes of support and of decoration are infinitely various, but the real character of the building, in all good Gothic, depends upon the single lines of the gable over the pointed arch, Fig. IX., endlessly rearranged or repeated. The larger woodcut, Fig. X., represents three characteristic conditions of the treatment of the group: a, from a tomb at Verona (1328); b, one of the lateral porches at Abbeville; c, one of the uppermost points of the great western façade of Rouen Cathedral; both these last being, I believe, early work of the fifteenth century. The forms of the pure early English and French Gothic are too well known to need any notice; my reason will appear presently for choosing, by way of example, these somewhat rare conditions.|$|E
6000|$|As he looked, Cyril Milliter felt {{a horrible}} misgiving arise {{suddenly}} within him. The creature {{at which he}} was gazing so intently was not a bird, it was a lizard.

But they are not arranged in a regular fan; the quills stand in pairs, {{one on each side}} of each joint in a long tail, for all the world exactly like a lizard's.... Still, it must be a bird; for, see, these are wings ... and that is certainly a bird's claw.... But here's the head; great heavens! what's this?... A jaw, with teeth in it...." [...] Cyril Milliter leaned back, distractedly, and held his beating forehead between his two pale hands. To most scientific men it would have been merely the discovery of an interesting intermediate organism--something sure to make the reputation of a comparative anatomist; to him, it was an awful and sudden blow dealt unexpectedly from the most deadly quarter at all his deepest and most sacred principles. Religion, honour, Truth, the very fundamental basis of the universe itself--all that makes life worth living for, all that makes the world endurable--was bound up implicitly that moment for Cyril Milliter in the simple question whether the shadowy creature, printed in faint grey outline on the slab of <b>shaly</b> oolite before him, was or was not half bird and half lizard.|$|E
6000|$|... § 12. Turner's way of wedging {{the stones}} of the glacier moraine {{together}} in strength of disorder, in the upper subject, and his indication of the springing of the wild stems and leafage out of the rents in the boulders of the lower one, will hardly be appreciated unless the reader is fondly acquainted {{with the kind of}} scenery in question; and I cannot calculate on this being often the case, for few persons ever look at any near detail closely, and perhaps least of all at the heaps of débris which so often seem to encumber and disfigure mountain ground. But for the various reasons just stated (§ 7), Turner found more material for his power, and more excitement to his invention, among the fallen stones than in the highest summits of mountains; and his early designs, among their thousand excellences and singularities, as opposed to all that had preceded them, count for not one of the least the elaborate care given to the drawing of torrent beds, <b>shaly</b> slopes, and other conditions of stony ground which all canons of art at the period pronounced inconsistent with dignity of composition; a convenient principle, since, of all foregrounds, one of loose stones is beyond comparison the most difficult to draw with any approach to realization. The Turnerian subjects, [...] "Junction of the Greta and Tees" [...] (Yorkshire Series, and illustrations to Scott); [...] "Wycliffe, near Rokeby" [...] (Yorkshire); [...] "Hardraw Fall" [...] (Yorkshire); [...] "Ben Arthur" [...] (Liber Studiorum); [...] "Ulleswater" [...] and the magnificent drawing of the [...] "Upper Fall of the Tees" [...] (England Series), are sufficiently illustrative of what I mean.|$|E

The {{existing}} {{forms of}} the Alps are, therefore, traceable chiefly to denudation as they rose from the sea, followed by more or less violent aqueous action, partly arrested during the glacial periods, while the produced diluvium was carried away into {{the valley of the}} Rhine or into the North Sea. One very important result of denudation had not yet been sufficiently regarded; namely, that when portions of a thick bed (as the Rudisten-kalk) had been entirely removed, the weight of the remaining masses, pressing unequally on the inferior beds, would, when these were soft (as the Neocomian marls), press them up into arched conditions, like those of the floors of coal-mines in what the miners called [...] "creeps." [...] Many anomalous positions of the beds of Spatangenkalk in the district of the Lake of Annecy were in all probability owing to this cause: they might be studied advantageously in the sloping base of the great Rochers de Lanfon, which, disintegrating in curved, nearly vertical flakes, each a thousand feet in height, were nevertheless a mere outlying remnant of the great horizontal formation of the Parmelan, and formed, like it, of very thin horizontal beds of Rudisten-kalk, imposed on <b>shaly</b> masses of Neocomian, modified by their pressure. More complex forms of harder rock were wrought by the streams and rains into fantastic outlines; and the transverse gorges were cut deep where they had been first traced by fault or distortion. The analysis of this aqueous action would alone require a series of discourses; but the sum of the facts was that the best and most interesting portions of the mountains were just those which were finally left, the centers and joints, as it were, of the Alpine anatomy. Immeasurable periods of time would be required to wear these away; and to all appearances, during the process of their destruction, others were rising to take their place, and forms of perhaps far more nobly organized mountain would witness the collateral progress of humanity.|$|E
