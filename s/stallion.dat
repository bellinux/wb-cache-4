40|$|Sperm {{competition}} theory predicts semen {{characteristics to}} be affected by the social environment. We used the polygamous horse (Equus caballus) to experimentally study within-subject plasticity in response to different social environments. <b>Stallions</b> were sequentially exposed, over a period of 8 weeks each, to other <b>stallions</b> and then singly to mares, or vice versa (in adjacent boxes separated by grills). Ejaculates were collected to determine semen characteristics. Highest sperm numbers were found in <b>stallions</b> that were first exposed to other <b>stallions</b> and then to mares, while lowest sperm numbers were observed in <b>stallions</b> that had been exposed to mares but not yet to other <b>stallions.</b> One of three sperm velocity measures (curvilinear velocity) was consistently elevated in <b>stallions</b> that were first exposed to <b>stallions</b> and then to mares. Sperm number after exposure to mares and curvilinear sperm velocity after exposure to <b>stallions</b> were both positively correlated to average blood testosterone levels during the corresponding period of exposure. We conclude that ejaculate characteristics are plastic traits affected by the social environment in horses...|$|R
50|$|Mature, domesticated <b>stallions</b> are {{commonly}} kept by {{themselves in a}} stable or small paddock. When <b>stallions</b> are stabled {{in a manner that}} allows visual and tactile communication, they will often challenge each another and sometimes attempt to fight. Therefore, <b>stallions</b> are often kept isolated from each other {{to reduce the risk of}} injury and disruption to the rest of the stable. If <b>stallions</b> are provided with access to paddocks, there is often a corridor between the paddocks so the <b>stallions</b> cannot touch each other. In some cases, <b>stallions</b> are released for exercise at different times of the day to ensure they do not see or hear each another.|$|R

Influential stallions on the Section C and D bloodlines include: Trotting Comet, foaled in 1840 {{from a long line of}} trotting horses; True Briton, foaled in 1930, by a trotting sire and out of an Arab mare; Cymro Llwyd, foaled in 1850, by an Arab <b>stallion</b> and out of a trotting mare; and Alonzo the Brave, foaled in 1866, tracing his ancestry through the Hackney breed to the Darley Arabian.|$|E
5|$|Two stallions, named Odin and Mazarin, {{had a large}} {{influence}} {{on the development of}} the Dole breed. Odin (son of Partisan), was a <b>stallion</b> of Thoroughbred (some sources say Norfolk Trotter) breeding, imported to Norway in 1834. Odin was said to cost ₤257 at the time and to have been bred to over 100 mares in his first four years in Norway. All Dole Trotter horses today contain Odin bloodlines. Mazarin was an Arabian imported to Norway in 1934. In 1849, another influential <b>stallion</b> was foaled, named Veikle Balder 4; he was a grandson of Odin and is considered the foundation <b>stallion</b> of the heavier Dole type. A <b>stallion</b> named Brimen 825 was used by breeders to maintain and improve some horses of the heavier Dole type for draft uses.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{evaluate}} daily sperm output, testicular measurements and post-thaw sperm quality of Tori and Estonian breed <b>stallions.</b> In the first study, daily sperm output (DSO) and testicular measurements were evaluated.

5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a <b>stallion.</b> Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a <b>stallion</b> has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a <b>stallion</b> to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian <b>stallion</b> Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a <b>stallion</b> to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, growing public {{opposition}} to the removal of feral horses prompted management strategy changes, and today the herds within the Theodore Roosevelt National Park are managed {{for the purposes of}} historical demonstration. However, in 1986 the park added outside bloodlines with the aim of modifying the appearance of the Nokota. Park management felt that the horses created with the outside bloodlines would sell better at subsequent auctions. The dominant herd stallions were removed and replaced with two feral stallions from Bureau of Land Management Mustang herds, a crossbred Shire <b>stallion,</b> a Quarter Horse <b>stallion</b> and an Arabian <b>stallion.</b> At {{the same time that the}} <b>stallion</b> replacements took place, a large number of horses from the park were rounded up and sold. At the 1986 auction, concerned about the welfare of the Nokota horse, Leo and Frank Kuntz purchased 54 horses, including the dominant <b>stallion,</b> a blue roan. This was in addition to smaller numbers of horses purchased in 1981, 1991 and 1997. After researching the history of the breed, the Kuntzs stated that they had found evidence that the horses in the park were probably related to the remaining horses from the band of 250 Sitting Bull horses, who had been range-bred by the Marquis de Mores, who founded the town of Medora. However, the short-lived Nokota Horse Association claimed that there was no evidence for this claim.|$|E
