The aqueous leaf extract of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> (SNALE) was given orally in two doses of 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg. The dose of 400 mg/kg significantly inhibited the gastric ulcer induced by all three models when compared with the serum parameters’ like Pylorus ligated (PL), Aspirin induced ulcerogenesis (APL) and cold resistant stress induced ulcer (CRSU) with the standard drug omperazole.

The medicinal {{values of the}} berries of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> (Black night shades) have been mentioned in ancient literature as useful in disorders of inflammation. Dried pulverized berries of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> were extracted with methanol by using soxhlet apparatus. The effect of methanolic extracts of berries of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> were studied on carrageenan induced paw edema. The methanolic extract decreased the edema induced in hind paw. The methanolic extract of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> (375 mg/kg b. w.) has showed significant anti-inflammatory. It has been concluded that methanolic extract of berries of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> Linn (375 mg/kg b. w.) augments that it is having good anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan induced paw edema.

Since extracted lipids from the leaves of this plant has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects, this study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of <b>Solanum</b> <b>nigrum</b> <b>L</b> ethyl acetate fraction on alpha motoneurons degeneration rate after sciatic nerve injury in rats. Methods: 48 wistar rats with average body weight of 250 to 300 gr were divided randomly to six groups (control, compression, compression+ extract 25, 50, 75, 100 mg/kg). In the treated group, in addition to compression, extract was injected intraperitoneally too (2 time, every week, I. P). After four weeks, lumbar segments of spinal cord L 2 -L 4 were removed, processed, serially sectioned and were stained with Toluidine blue. The alpha motoneurons were counted by dissector method.
