40|$|Abstract:Electrochemical photo-voltaic {{detector}} with REDOX reactions {{occurring at}} the two electrodes was designed, fabricated and characterized through its characteristic properties. The photosensitive material used was HgxCd 1 -xTe (0 ? x ? 0. 5) and <b>sodium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> electrolyte {{was used as a}} medium of charge transport from one electrode to another. The various designing and processing parameters were optimized to yield quality photo electrode material and the photo-voltaic detector cells were fabricated for each of these electrodes. The photo-voltaic detector performance was then tested through its current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, power output, spectral and photo response studies. The quantum conversion efficiency ?% and fill factor ff % are found to be enhanced from 0. 24 % to 0. 55 % and 30 % to 49 % respectively, when the composition parameter varied from zero to 0. 1. The other performance parameters were also evaluated from their characteristic studies and in turn their variations are correlated with electrode materials composition. A best electrode composition is searched out from these studies...|$|E

Determination of S speciation mainly consists of the application of chromatographic and electrochemical techniques while its size determination is limited only to the application of microscopic and light scattering techniques. S biological and geochemical importance together with recent increases of S industrial applications requires the development of different analytical tools for S sizing and quantification. In recent years the use of electrochemical measurements as a direct, fast, and inexpensive technique for the different nanoparticles (NPs) characterization (Ag, Au, Pt) is increasing. In this work, electrochemical i. e. chronoamperometric measurements at the Hg electrode are performed for determination of the size distribution of the S NPs. Results: S NPs were synthesized in aqueous medium by <b>sodium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> acidic hydrolysis. Chronoamperometric measurements reveal the polydisperse nature of the formed suspension of S NPs. The electrochemical results were compared with dynamic light scattering measurements parallel run in the same S NPs suspensions. The two methods show fairly good agreement, both suggesting a log-normal size distribution of the S NPs sizes characterized by similar parameters. Conclusions: The preliminary results highlight the amperometric measurements as a promising tool for the size determination of the S NPs in the water environment...|$|E
40|$|As a {{continuation}} of the preliminary study of the colorimetric method as a rapid means of control of polysulphide solutions, the effect of free alkali on <b>sodium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> solutions at room temperature was studied, since in the process of dipping the washing-out of the suint of the fleece results in the interaction of clipwash with alkali and in the formation of alkali polysulphides. It was found that the chemical interaction, as revealed by ordinary chemical analysis, is slight, though the colorimetric study reveals a marked change in chemical nature. This change was ascribed, either to the formation of a complex compound between the alkali and the polysulphide, or to the existence of different isomers of the polysulphides in solution. The observation that field samples of lime-sulphur cannot be directly compared calorimetrically is thus partially explained. It was further shown that the addition of excess sodium carbonate and alcohol causes immediate precipitation of all turbidity-forming materials, rendering a perfectly clear solution of the alkali polysulphides which can be matched against a potassium dichromate standard. In this way fairly accurate values were obtained with both used and unused lime-sulphur clip washes. It is proposed to apply this colorimetric principle for evolving a simple field method of control.

40|$|A {{number of}} geochemically {{relevant}} model compounds (alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, acids, alcohols and esters) {{have been subjected}} to a reaction with <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>polysulphide</b> either in one solvent or mediated by a phase transfer reagent. This reaction, referred to as the hydrosulphurization reaction, is regarded as a simulation of a natural sulphurization reaction of functionalized lipids in early stages of diagenesis. Only alkenes, ketones and aldehydes reacted to form organic sulphur compounds. Generally with compounds possessing carbon [...] -carbon double bonds an addition reaction took place apparently following the Markovnikov rule. The oxo-group of ketones and aldehydes are substituted by sulphur and polysulphide-linked dimers are formed. Polymers or cyclic sulphides are derived from substrates with more than one functionality depending on the spacing between functionalities. Thermal treatment of a polymeric mixture resulted in the formation of thiophenes. These results can explain the formation of many organic sulphur compounds found in sediments and oils...|$|R
40|$|Specific enzymes {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to increase the possibilities for extracting wood polymers. Enzymatic treatment requires an open wood structure, which was achieved by extended impregnation of the wood. However, some of the hemicelluloses, primarily glucomannan, and lignin were lost during the impregnation. To improve the carbohydrate yield, three glucomannan modification agents: <b>sodium</b> borohydride, <b>polysulphide</b> and anthraquinone, were used, which increased the yields of the impregnated materials from 76. 6 % to 89. 6 %, 81. 3 % and 80. 0 %, respectively. Through the use of additives, most of the glucomannan could be retained in the wood while still allowing the enzymes to penetrate the wood and attack the polymers. The additives also increased the extraction yield from 9 to 12 % w/w wood. Gamanase treatment prior to the extraction increased the extraction yield to 14 %. Of the three stabilising agents, sodium borohydride was the most efficient, providing the highest extraction yields. Updated from manuscript to article in journal. QC 20150115 </p...|$|R
