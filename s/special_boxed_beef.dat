40|$|It {{seems to}} me that the fed cattle market has become more {{volatile}} since BSE was discovered in North America last May. Is this the case? Have prices for <b>box</b> <b>beef</b> and for feeder cattle become more volatile? Doing some quick analysis to see if in fact this was true, I looked at week to week changes in the USDA reported Choice <b>Box</b> <b>Beef</b> Cutout Value, the price of fed cattle in Nebraska on a live weight basis and the price of 750 pound steers in Nebraska...|$|R
40|$|The study compares {{cost and}} {{benefits}} {{of carbon dioxide and}} vacuum packaged <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> distribution to retail grocery outlets In the retail grocery segment of the beef distribution channel, the major portion still moves fresh in the form of hanging quarters or primals. However, a recently important method of shipment to the retail grocery segment is <b>beef</b> in <b>boxed,</b> palletized form. Although nc accurate data are available to document the proportion of beef which is distri-buted boxed versus hanging, industry corr-sensus is that the boxed, palletized method will continue to increase in im-portance (4). This study provides tl~eresults,~fa comparative cost-benefit analysis of carbon dioxide and vacuum packaged <b>boxed</b> <b>beef,</b> both of which hold promise for in-creased utilization in the trade. The intent is not to identify one method. as superior in all situations to the other, but rather to analyze relative costs and savings associated with the two methods. The specific objectives were: 1) to identify additional costs associated with utilization of carbon dioxide dnd vacuum packaged <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> at the packer level, and 2) to evaluate the two systems with respect to shrink, trim 10 SS, and retail case life so as to provide a cost-benefit comparison of the two <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> methods, The carbon dioxide method of <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> consists of placing a sheet of polyethylene in a cardboard box.,placins either a primal or subprimal cut on tl~c polyethylene which is then folded over tllc meat. Just prior to box closure, a small perforated polyethylene bag of carbon dioxide pellets (typically about two pounds) is placed in the box which may then be l~al-Ietized. The vacuum packaged method is beLter known and consists of drawing a partial vacuum on a laminated barrier bag containin~ either a primal <Jrsubprimal cut. Tht’se vacuum packaged cuts then may be placed i[~ boxes or other master containers for pal-letized storage and/or shipmerrL...|$|R
40|$|This study {{estimates}} wholesale {{demand for}} pork, chicken, and quality differentiated beef. We estimate meat retailer own- and cross-price demand elasticities for USDA Choice and Select <b>boxed</b> <b>beef.</b> Results indicate that meat retailers have more elastic demand for lower quality graded beef. Retail beef price {{has a strong}} positive relationship with Choice and Select <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> demand, and a strong negative relationship with wholesale pork and chicken demand.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal procurement, processing and production decisions of a meat processing company (hereafter a “packer”) in a beef supply chain. The packer processes fed cattle to produce two beef products, program (premium) <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> and commodity <b>boxed</b> <b>beef,</b> in fixed proportions, but with downward substitution of the premium product for the commodity product. The packer can source input (fed cattle) from a contract market, where long-term contracts are signed {{in advance of}} the required delivery time, and from a spot market on the spot day. Contract prices are taken to be of a general window form, linear in the spot price but capped by upper and lower limits on realized contract price.

40|$|Three {{groups of}} steers [...] one {{theoretical}} group and two experimental groups—were evaluated for marketing cattle live, as <b>boxed</b> <b>beef,</b> and grade and yield when the live price was $ 71 to $ 73 /cwt, grade and yield price $ 125 /cwt for Choice yield grade 3 carcasses with $ 20 /cwt discount for Select carcasses, {{and in a}} commodity-trim or close-trim <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> market. The {{results show that the}} value of highyielding steers can be significantly increased if sold in a close-trim <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> market. The close-trim premiums ranged from $ 5. 06 per head for Select close-trim yield grade 4 carcasses to $ 87. 18 per head for close-trim Choice yield grade 1 carcasses. A group of experimental steers averaging 82 % Choice and 60 % yield grades 1 and 2 returned an additional $ 104 in the close-trim boxed market compared with selling live for $ 73 /cwt. Another group of experimental steers averaging 21 % Choice, 18 % Standard, and 93 % yield grades 1 and 2 had $ 29 per head greater return than if the steers had been sold live for $ 71 /cwt. These comparisons emphasize the importance of knowing how cattle will potentially grade before selecting an alternative marketing strategy. This prior knowledge is most important when the spread in price between Choice and Select is high. Producers need to learn more about their cattle to predict how the cattle may grade for a specified value-based market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal procurement, processing and production decisions of a meatpacker in a beef supply chain. The meatpacker processes fed cattle to produce two <b>beef</b> products, program <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> (a. k. a. program <b>beef)</b> and commodity <b>boxed</b> <b>beef</b> (a. k. a. commodity beef), in fixed proportions. The program beef {{can also be}} sold as commodity beef (downward product substitution). The demands for beef products are price-dependent and random. The meatpacker can source input (fed cattle) using long-term contracts, usually signed several months {{in advance of the}} required delivery time. The meatpacker can also source from a spot (or cash) market on the spot day. Contract prices are assumed (as is typical of the beef industry) to be benchmarked on spot price at delivery time, and contract cattle can be resold at a discount in the spot market. Cattle purchased under contract or on the spot market have different characteristics in terms of unit price, processing cost and cattle quality (in terms of available content of each beef product). We solve for the optimal contracting portfolio and analyze the effect of spot market characteristics (transaction costs, spot price vari...|$|R
