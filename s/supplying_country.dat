The liberalization of the trade regime governing textiles and apparel with the phase out of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). has opened up the market for an apparel <b>supplying</b> <b>country</b> who remains competitive in the global apparel trade.

For each country this represents both an opportunity and a threat. An opportunity for the countries who remains competitive in the apparel trade since markets will no longer be restricted, and a threat for the countries who are not very competitive in the trade of apparel because other apparel manufacturers will no longer be restrained. To get an opportunity form the liberalized apparel market apparel manufacturers should build comparative advantage over the competitors. / The study focuses on Sri Lankan apparel industry and it reviews the most recent market developments in apparel retailer sourcing strategies with the quota removal. The study builds a framework to assess the capabilities of apparel manufacturers, to be successful in the competitive apparel market. It examines the capability of Sri Lankans apparel manufacturers to fulfill the requirements of the apparel retailers in both country level and organizational level.
