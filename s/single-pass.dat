25|$|<b>Single-pass</b> bore {{finishing}} is a {{machining process}} similar to honing {{to finish a}} , except the tool only takes a single pass. The process was originally developed to improve bore quality in cast iron workpieces.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme-linked receptors {{are either}} enzymes themselves, or {{directly}} activate associated enzymes. These are typically <b>single-pass</b> transmembrane receptors, with the enzymatic {{component of the}} receptor kept intracellular. The majority of enzyme-linked receptors are, or associate with, protein kinases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Single-pass</b> bore {{finishing}} is {{not well}} suited for blind holes because the tool has a tapered lead on it which prevents {{the bottom of the}} hole from being finished. The process can be performed on blind holes, but it requires an alternative tool design and suitable manufacturing conditions. A better alternative is ID grinding.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low <b>single-pass</b> gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small <b>single-pass</b> gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{exchangers}} fabricated {{separately from}} antimicrobial copper and aluminium in a full-scale HVAC system {{have been evaluated}} {{for their ability to}} limit microbial growth under conditions of normal flow rates using <b>single-pass</b> outside air. Commonly used aluminium components developed stable biofilms of bacteria and fungi within four weeks of operation. During the same time period, antimicrobial copper was able to limit bacterial loads associated with the copper heat exchanger fins by 99.99% and fungal loads by 99.74%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Single-pass</b> bore {{finishing}} is {{not usually}} done in a milling machine for several reasons. Firstly, most milling machines have only one spindle, so changing the tool more than four to six times can increase cycle times significantly. Secondly, most workpieces that require this process are made on horizontal machining centers (HMC), which reduces float-ability due to gravity. Thirdly, the lubrication may not be sufficient, {{which can lead to}} material build-up between diamonds, diminishing the tool's effectiveness. Finally, if any chips remain from previous operations they can ruin the tool.|$|E
25|$|Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit {{protease}} complex, {{itself an}} integral membrane protein, that cleaves <b>single-pass</b> transmembrane proteins at residues within the transmembrane domain. Proteases {{of this type}} are known as intramembrane proteases. The most well-known substrate of gamma secretase is amyloid precursor protein, a large integral membrane protein that, when cleaved by both gamma and beta secretase, produces a short 42 amino acid peptide called amyloid beta whose abnormally folded fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Gamma secretase is also critical in the related processing of several other type I integral membrane proteins, such as Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, ephrin-B2, or CD44.|$|E
25|$|This {{classification}} {{refers to}} the position of the N- and C-terminal domains. Types I, II, and III are <b>single-pass</b> molecules, while type IV are multiple-pass molecules. Type I transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on plasmalemma). Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains targeted to the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain targeted to the lumen. The implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type.|$|E

2500|$|Mammals possess four {{different}} notch receptors, {{referred to as}} NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. The notch receptor [...] is a <b>single-pass</b> transmembrane receptor protein. [...] It is a hetero-oligomer composed of a large extracellular portion, which associates in a calcium-dependent, non-covalent interaction with a smaller piece of the notch protein composed of a short extracellular region, a single transmembrane-pass, and a small intracellular region.|$|E
2500|$|Notch {{and most}} of its ligands are transmembrane proteins, so the cells expressing the ligands {{typically}} must be adjacent to the notch expressing cell for signaling to occur. The notch ligands are also <b>single-pass</b> transmembrane proteins and are members of the DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2) family of proteins. [...] In Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), there are two ligands named Delta and Serrate. [...] In mammals, the corresponding names are Delta-like and Jagged. [...] In mammals there are multiple Delta-like and Jagged ligands, as well as possibly a variety of other ligands, such as F3/contactin.|$|E
2500|$|The company's final {{graphics}} chips, the GD546x [...] "Laguna" [...] {{series of}} PCI/AGP 3D-accelerators, were novel {{in that they}} {{were one of the}} few video cards to use Rambus RDRAM. The patented use of tiled memory used by the GD546x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today. However, like many other 2D/3D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time, the feature set of perspective-correct texture mapping, bilinear filtering, <b>single-pass</b> lighting, gouraud shading, and alpha blending, was incomplete compared to the next generation of 3D chips. The GD546x family was limited by CPU processing at the time, CPU's could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block. The raw processing power of the GD546x was nearly 2.5 million 25 pixel triangles per second, much faster than competitors.|$|E

However, <b>single-pass</b> compiling {{turns out to be a}} bad match for small machines, and isn't likely to help the advanced optimizations common in large machines.|$|E

5000|$|VBR {{is created}} using the {{so-called}} <b>single-pass</b> encoding or multi-pass encoding. <b>Single-pass</b> encoding analyzes and encodes the data [...] "on the fly" [...] {{and it is}} also used in constant bitrate encoding. <b>Single-pass</b> encoding is used when the encoding speed is most important â€” e.g. for real-time encoding. <b>Single-pass</b> VBR encoding is usually controlled by the fixed quality setting or by the bitrate range (minimum and maximum allowed bitrate) or by the average bitrate setting. Multi-pass encoding is used when the encoding quality is most important. Multi-pass encoding cannot be used in real-time encoding, live broadcast or live streaming. Multi-pass encoding takes much longer than <b>single-pass</b> encoding, because every pass means one pass through the input data (usually through the whole input file). Multi-pass encoding is used only for VBR encoding, because CBR encoding doesn't offer any flexibility to change the bitrate. The most common multi-pass encoding is two-pass encoding. In the first pass of two-pass encoding, the input data is being analyzed and the result is stored in a log file. In the second pass, the collected data from the first pass is used to achieve the best encoding quality. In a video encoding, two-pass encoding is usually controlled by the average bitrate setting or by the bitrate range setting (minimal and maximal allowed bitrate) or by the target video file size setting.|$|E
