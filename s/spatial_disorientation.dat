5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case.

To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to <b>spatial</b> <b>disorientation</b> and loss of control.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{be aware}} of the environment, one must sense or {{perceive}} that environment. The body senses the environment by the interaction of specialized sensory organs with some aspect or another of the environment. The central nervous system utilizes these sensations in order to coordinate and organize muscular movements, shift from uncomfortable positions, and adjust properly. One relevant question is “What is the relative contribution of gravity to these sensory and motor functions?” This manuscript reviews the effects of microgravity on the functioning of the sensory organs primarily used for balance and <b>spatial</b> orientation. <b>Disorientation</b> and malaise so frequently encountered during early exposure to microgravity and on return to Earth are described. Theories and actual data regarding the role of the central nervous system in the adaptation of sensorimotor functions (including the control of posture, eye movements, spatial orientation, and cognition) to changes in the gravito-inertial force level during space flight are explored...|$|R
25|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} the crash had {{been caused by}} a combination of severe weather and mechanical problems with the aircraft.

When the aircraft cleared the clouds, Hughes attempted to arrest the high descent rate by pulling the nose up and applying full power, {{but it was too}} late. The FAA investigators later found evidence that the propeller was at maximum speed during impact.|$|E
40|$|Architectural {{designers}} {{often need}} to strike an uneasy balance between idealism and reality. Under most circumstances, architects are restricted by clients, budgets, and available technologies. However, divorced from traditional constraints, visionary concepts of new dwellings, new cities, and new “worlds” will spark greater forms of innovation and drive creativity for future generations. The exploration of new spatial boundaries and conceptual environments for design will irrevocably alter {{the human experience}} while adapting new challenging roles for future architects. Architecture can be understood in part as the art of organizing spaces through the manipulation of materials and forms. Designed spaces are arranged to provide unique sensory reactions for their occupants while emotionally and physically orientating them on Earth. As a catalyst towards the awareness of one’s surroundings, architecture has always {{had to contend with}} the many limiting factors imposed by the forces on Earth. These include, but are not limited to, gravity and climate. On Earth, structurally sound construction is limited by the forces of gravity as it influences design capabilities by standardizing forms, functions, and structural elements of architectural spaces. New design challenges and opportunities arrive when we look to create structures outside of Earth’s boundaries. This thesis proposes a futuristic model of an efficient and unique passenger transport system that connects Earth-based hybrid air/space ports with an outer space orbital infrastructural hub. This modern intervention will allow for new outer space industries, such as transit, tourism, and hospitality, which will provide unique opportunities for the future of humanity. Additionally, the thesis studies the positive architectural and experiential potentials for the future living occupancy of outer space. In recognizing the financial and logistical limitations of current space constructions, such as the International Space Station, the thesis looks beyond the limitations of current technologies and towards designs that are driven by the fulfillment of human experiences in space. Life in space, the thesis envisions, will spark new human experiences and rituals while necessitating new forms and designs in architecture. Weightlessness and its related <b>spatial</b> <b>disorientations,</b> in addition to the many other unique conditions in this unfamiliar territory, will inspire a new conceptual language for architecture and human cultures. The thesis will demonstrate that spaces designed for extraterrestrial experiences can be innovatively dynamic as they respond to new cultures and activities that evolve as a reaction to extreme conditions. Introducing humans to the environs of orbital space will be the initial stage in a long-term phasing tactic to colonize and commercialize beyond the expanse of Earth, eventually extending humanity to the remote neighbouring planets of the universe...|$|R

40|$|This practice-led art {{research}} project investigates {{the relationships between}} geometric abstract painting, architecture and urban space. The outcome of the research is an exhibition of large-scale and medium sized geometric abstract paintings on canvas that explore issues of reflection and spatial deformation. Compositions drawing from the spatialities of contemporary architecture and urban space are examined {{through the use of}} reflective materials, fragmented abstract form and irregular structuring to create a range of spatial interpretations intended to engage and manipulate the viewer’s perceptions of illusory space. The project focuses on the inventive uses of reflective painting materials and recently developed synthetic colours influenced by digital technologies and high-gloss surface qualities. Innovative possibilities and opportunities in contemporary abstract painting practice are investigated through the use of newly developed commercial paint materials, pigments and mediums to create new perceptual and physiological experiences for the viewer. From the position of being a contemporary abstract painter I investigate key issues of <b>spatial</b> unease, <b>disorientation</b> and instability experienced in contemporary architecture and urban space, in order to produce highly ambiguous pictorial spatial experiences in my work, including infinite reflections, permutations and deformations.

25|$|Despite initial {{reports that}} {{technical}} issues {{had resulted in}} the accident, the cause {{was found to be}} <b>spatial</b> <b>disorientation</b> of the pilot following the loss of the attitude indicator. Flying in poor weather conditions, the flight crew would have had to rely only on their instruments; such a situation is known as instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The failure of the attitude indicator was caused by the failure of both generators and the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist; the battery was therefore drained of power in less than half the time that it {{should have been able to}} supply power for.|$|E

They did neither enter the Standard Instrument Departure of Istanbul nor the Standard Terminal Arrival Route and approach procedure of Isparta into the flight management system.|$|E

The subject also developed confusional episodes with <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>disorientation,</b> visual and auditory hallucinations, complex behavior during sleep and progressive nocturnal insomnia associated with diurnal drowsiness. There was also severe constipation, urinary incontinence, and excessive lacrimation.

Marked hyperhidrosis and excessive salivation were evident. Neurological examination disclosed diffuse muscle twitching and spontaneous and reflex myoclonus, slight muscle atrophy in the limbs, absence of tendon reflexes in the lower limbs and diffuse erythema especially on the trunk with scratching lesions of the skin.Compulsive behaviours, stereotypies and reduplicative paramnesias can be part of the CNS spectrum.|$|R

The internal consistency of pointing was disrupted by disorientation when participants learned the locations of objects while standing amid them and the layout did not have salient intrinsic axes. It was also observed that many participants retrieved <b>spatial</b> relations after <b>disorientation</b> from the original learning heading.

25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to <b>spatial</b> <b>disorientation</b> and SMS.|$|E

This process seems to be shared by humans and certain animal species and appears to be subdivided into the processing of the identity of experienced situations, on the one hand, and of their unity on the other.

40|$|AbstractIdentifying human {{attachment}} to the environment by developing different degrees, spatial ranges and dimensions, this study aims to further the growing body {{of knowledge about the}} discipline of Environmental Psychology within the process of interior design solving problems. Environmental Psychology provides an analytic point of view up on the existing built environment with a rich and diverse set of quantitative indicators for characterizing spaces in many ways that are potentially relevant to a variety of psychological responses, including choosing routes while locomotion, orientation and <b>disorientation,</b> <b>spatial</b> knowledge acquisition, perceived spaciousness, privacy and social interaction, stress and fear, and aesthetic judgments (Kolb, 1984). Experimental Learning Theory defines learning as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience”. This study makes the emphasis on “exploratory” and “descriptive” aspects of the Environmental Psychology within the real life context, providing comprehensive information to be inferred and issued in a complementary manner in interior design education. In such a way that; viable physical environment, social organization and norms, characteristics of people objectives are to determinants empirically whether, and how the use of experience and practices can improve design problem-solving by both novice and expert designers.

40|$|Anosognosia for {{hemiplegia}} is {{a common}} and striking disorder following stroke. Because it is typically transient and variable, it remains poorly understood and has rarely been investigated at different times in a systematic manner. Our study evaluated a prospective cohort of 58 patients with right-hemisphere stroke and significant motor deficit of the left hemibody, who were examined using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at 3 days (hyperacute), 1 week (subacute) and 6 months (chronic) after stroke onset. Anosognosia for hemiplegia was frequent in the hyperacute phase (32 %), but reduced by almost half 1 week later (18 %) and only rarely seen at 6 months (5 %). Anosognosia for hemiplegia was correlated with the severity of several other deficits, most notably losses in proprioception, extrapersonal <b>spatial</b> neglect and <b>disorientation.</b> While multiple regression analyses highlighted proprioceptive loss as the most determinant factor for the hyperacute period, and visuospatial neglect and disorientation as more determinant for the subacute phase, patients with both proprioceptive loss and neglect had significantly higher incidence of anosognosia for hemiplegia than those with only one deficit or no deficits (although a few double dissociations were observed). Personal neglect and frontal lobe tests showed no significant relation with anosognosia for hemiplegia, nor did psychological traits such as optimism and mood. Moreover, anosognosia for neglect and prediction of performance in non-motor tasks were unrelated to anosognosia for hemiplegia, suggesting distinct monitoring mechanisms fo...|$|R
500|$|The CAB {{concluded}} that the accident was due to [...] "the pilot's unwise decision {{to embark on a}} flight" [...] that required instrument flying skills he had not proved to have.

Nevertheless, the CAB determined that the evasive maneuvers taken by the pilot of Flight 663 {{in order to avoid}} the oncoming Pan Am jet caused <b>spatial</b> <b>disorientation.</b> The disorientation, coupled with the extreme maneuver, made it impossible for the pilot to recover from the roll in the few seconds remaining before the DC-7 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. The CAB also determined that Captain Carson had neither the time nor adequate information to assess Flight 663's position relative to Pan Am 212 and, given the illusion of a collision course, he had acted appropriately in initiating evasive maneuvers.

40|$|International audienceA rapid {{increase}} in incidence of neurodegenerative disorders has been observed with {{the aging of the}} population. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly. It is characterized by memory dysfunction, loss of lexical access, <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>disorientation</b> and impairment of judgement clinically. Unfortunately, clinical development of drugs for the symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment of AD has resulted in both promise and disappointment. Indeed, a large number of drugs with differing targets and mechanisms of action were investigated with only a few of them being clinically available. The targeted drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, is restricted due to the limitations posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as well as due to opsonization by plasma proteins in the systemic circulation and peripheral side-effects. Over the last decade, nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery represents one promising strategy to successfully increase the CNS penetration of several therapeutic moieties. Different nanocarriers are being investigated to treat and diagnose AD by delivering at a constant rate a host of therapeutics over times extending up to days, weeks or even months. This review provides a concise incursion on the current pharmacotherapies for AD besides reviewing and discussing the literature on the different drug molecules that have been successfully encapsulated in nanoparticles (NPs). Some of them have been shown to cross the BBB and have been tested either for diagnosis or treatment of AD. Finally, the route of NPs administration and the future prospects will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Large kindreds segregating {{familial}} Alzheimer disease (FAD) {{offer the}} opportunity of studying clinical variability as observed for presenilin 1 (PSEN 1) mutations. Two early-onset FAD (EOFAD) Calabrian families with PSEN 1 Met 146 Leu (ATG/CTG) mutation constitute a unique population descending from a remote common ancestor. Recently, several other EOFAD families with the same mutation have been described worldwide. METHODS: We searched for a common founder of the PSEN 1 Met 146 Leu mutation in families with different geographic origins by genealogic and molecular analyses. We also investigated the phenotypic variability at onset {{in a group of}} 50 patients (mean age at onset 40. 0 +/- 4. 8 years) by clinical, neuropsychological, and molecular methodologies. RESULTS: EOFAD Met 146 Leu families from around the world resulted to be related and constitute a single kindred originating from Southern Italy before the 17 th century. Phenotypic variability at onset is broad: 4 different clinical presentations may be recognized, 2 classic for AD (memory deficits and <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>disorientation),</b> whereas the others are expressions of frontal impairment. The apathetic and dysexecutive subgroups could be related to orbital-medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Genealogic and molecular findings provided evidence that the PSEN 1 Met 146 Leu families from around the world analyzed in this study are related and represent a single kindred originating from Southern Italy. The marked phenotypic variability might reflect early involvement by the pathologic process of different cortical areas. Although the clinical phenotype is quite variable, the neuropathologic and biochemical characteristics of the lesions account for neurodegenerative processes unmistakably of Alzheimer nature...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} reading {{difficulties}} is ordered {{in the manner}} of a series of models, derived from a consideration of the reading process. They lead to model of abilition and conditions that, when absent or not optimum, will inhibit reading. Examples are lack of motivation, perceptual handicaps or emotional problems. However, the models do not predict the cause of specific development dyslexia - and hence this is this is examined in detail. It is conceived of a syndrome in which the major symptoms is difficulty in reading, and this is accompanied by minor symptoms such as speech retardation or defect, motor disorders, perceptual disorders, abnormal lateral preferences, <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>disorientation.</b> Other factors unusually frequent in the background of specific developmental dyslexics are - adoption, multiple birth, a history of difficult pregnancy or difficult birth, a history of difficult pregnancy or difficult birth or severe illness in early childhood. An hereditary factor is involved in some cases. The cause of specific developmental dyslexia has been ascribed to many malfunctions. Some are inadequate in explaining the facts known about the dundrome - for example, direct emotional causation. The minimal brain damage and the maturational leg hypotheses are retained. It is possible that the two causes are interrelated, in that brain damage causes an inhibition of maturation. A genetic factor could be envisaged to set in either case, in the former being represented as a malformation. (e. g. vascular). It is considered of great importance to institute a screening programme at age five to predict potential reading failure cases and thus give them help from the start of reading. A format for such a programme is suggested. Given maximum opportunity, severe reading problems can be overcome. Given less than this, delinquency often is a result...|$|R

40|$|Since Hippocrates that neuropsychiatric illness {{secondary}} to liver disease fascinates physicians, {{but only in}} the XIX century Marcel Nencki and Ivan Pavlov suggested the relation between high concentrations of ammonia and Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). The reaction of ammonia and glutamate (origins glutamine, “the Trojan Horse of neurotoxicity of ammonia) continues to be the main responsible for the neurologic lesions, recently confirmed by neurochemistry and neuroimagiology studies. Glutamine starts the inflammatory reaction at the central nervous sys- tem but other important actors seem to be manganese and the neurotransmitters systems of GABA and endocanabinoids. Nowadays there are three different etiologic big groups for HE: type A associated with acute liver failure; type B associated with portosystemic bypass; and type C associated with cirrhosis of the liver. The staging of HE is still based on classic West Haven system, but a latent Grade 0 was introduced (the so called minimal HE); remaining the aggra- vating HE from Grade 1 (subtle changes at clinical examination) to Grade 4 (coma). In this work a bibliographic review was made on 30 of the most pertinent and re cent papers, focusing in psychopathology, physiopathology, etiology and staging of this clinical entity transversal to Psychiatry and Gastroenterology. Alterations are described in vigility and conscience like temporal, <b>spatial</b> and personal <b>disorientation.</b> Attention, concentration and memory are impaired very early, on latent phase and can be accessed through neuropsychological tests. Mood oscillates between euphoric and depressive. Personality changes begin obviously and abruptly or in a subtle and insidious way. There can be changes in perception like visual hallucinations or even of acoustic-verbal. The thought disorders can be of delusional type, paranoid, systematized or not, but also monothematic ala Capgras Syndrome. Speech can be accelerated, slowed down or completely in- comprehensible. Insight is diminished at the very beginning at minimal HE, especially regarding the car driving abilities. Instinctive life can be impaired as various sleep disorders are present among half of HE patients; loss of appetite is common but there is a case of pica {{secondary to}} HE; and libido can seem increased by some pre-frontal type of disinhibition. </div...|$|R

Another is the fourteen miles {{of steel and}} barbwire fence that separates San Diego and Southern California from Tijuana and Northern Mexico. Built on sediments of colonial history (when California was a Spanish possession and Franciscan missionaries sought the conquest of indigenous souls) and nineteenth-century American expansion (gold rushes, Mexican-American wars and Manifest Destiny), San Diego and Tijuana are cities whose stark contrast belies their irrevocably intertwined existence. While Tijuana evokes a cliche Hollywood image as a dusty border town, with shanties, saloons, and vendors hawking wide-brimmed sombreros and colourful ponchos in a steamy noonday sun, it is the fastest growing city in Mexico, with immigrants from {{every state in the}} country coming to work in the maquiladores (branch-plant factories) for a dollar an hour or to wait to cross the border. Its stately avenues, lined with art-deco facades, are thronged with people. The Centro Cultural Tijuana, with its vast exterior plaza and cavernous interior antechamber, is a marble showcase for the city's economic and cultural ascendancy. While Thomas Glassford probed the banality of San Diego's leisure industry, Betsabee Romero constructed a hybrid shrine to the cultural distinctiveness of Tijuana.

To reach Romero's Jute Car installation required a trek through Tijuana, in which paved roads led to dirt ones and to the ramshackle houses of Colonia Libertad, perched {{at the edge of the}} border fence. On a hillside cliff above the shacks, Romero placed an old car decorated with the intricate designs of Mexican folk art and stuffed with dried roses. Made in Mexico City and transported to Colonia Libertad, it reverberated with historical echoes that reached back in time to the appearance, on a hillside outside Mexico City, of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531. The first Virgin of the Americas of indigenous origin, Guadalupe became the patron saint of the poor and downtrodden, an icon carried into, the Independence Wars of the eighteen-hundreds by a rabble army led by the priest Hidalgo. In decorating a car in motifs that traditionally bordered Guadalupe's image, Romero imbued a fetish object of power and speed with a centuries-old patina of miracles and spirituality. While many of the Mexican artists drew upon strategies of pastiche and the appropriation of kitsch to politicize and vindicate the cultural differences between San Diego and Tijuana, other artists were less concerned with exposing the cultural mores of the border region than with reflecting the <b>spatial</b> and social <b>disorientation</b> engendered by the border experience. In contrast to the cultural specificity of Romero and Ruben Ortiz Torres's hybrid cars, Kim Adams constructed a nomad vehicle that crossed borders and cultures. Fusing two children's bicycles, so that the front wheels and handlebars were attached to a single middle wheel, Adams left these playful concoctions in various locations in San Diego and Tijuana for children to find and adopt. A tongue-in-cheek metaphor for the border, Adams's intervention pivoted on the process by which the children who stumbled across his bicycles resolved the dilemma of their mutated function. Like the border itself, his vehicles required an inordinate degree of cooperation or, alternatively, an act of severing the bicycles in two...|$|R
2500|$|A report {{into the}} {{accident}} was published on 12 February 2009. In it, the AAIB did not reach a definite conclusion as {{to the cause of}} the accident, stating instead that [...] "the helicopter crashed in a wooded valley while manoeuvering at high speed and low height. It was intact prior to impact, and the available evidence indicated that the engine was delivering power. The cause of {{the accident was}} not positively determined. Although no technical reason was found to explain the accident, a technical fault could not be ruled out entirely. However, {{it is more likely that}} the pilot attempted a turning manoeuvre at low height, during which the helicopter deviated from its intended flight path; whether due to the pilot encountering handling difficulties, misjudgement, <b>spatial</b> <b>disorientation,</b> distraction or a combination of such events. There were indications that the pilot had started a recovery but, with insufficient height in which to complete it, the helicopter struck trees in the valley and crashed, killing all four occupants." ...|$|E
