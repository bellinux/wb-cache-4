5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a <b>systemic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>reaction</b> to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, <b>systemic</b> <b>reaction</b> figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
25|$|Latex {{can trigger}} an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and <b>systemic</b> <b>reaction.</b> The {{prevalence}} of latex allergy {{in the general}} population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors associated with increased risk of adverse <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> to cluster allergen immunotherapy and to create a preliminary predictive clinical model. Methods: In a prospective observational study, the tolerance of 611 patients with seasonal respiratory diseases who were receiving cluster immunotherapy was monitored and all <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> were recorded. Associations between potential prognostic factors (sex, age, respiratory disease, severity, duration of disease, previous immunotherapy, nonseasonal symptoms, skin prick test, total immunoglobulin (Ig) E, specifi c IgE, treatment schedule, allergenic composition, batch, date of treatment, habitat, place of residence) and <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> were estimated. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to build a predictive clinical model and estimate the probability of <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> to cluster immunotherapy. Results: Sixty-fi ve patients (10. 6 %) suffered <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Only 7 independent risk factors were retained in the fi nal model: age over 14 years (odds ratio [OR], 2. 6), previous immunotherapy (OR, 0. 3), skin prick test positive to Chenopodium album (whit...|$|R

The most common local reaction is injection site pain. It {{has been reported to}} occur in 16% of patients receiving intramuscular injections, and 3% of patients receiving intravenous injections. Less frequently reported side effects include inflammation of veins (1.2%), sometimes associated with a blood clot (3%). The most commonly reported <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> are diarrhea (3%) and rash (2%). Less frequent <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> to ampicillin/sulbactam include chest pain, fatigue, seizure, headache, painful urination, urinary retention, intestinal gas, nausea, vomiting, itching, hairy tongue, tightness in throat, reddening of the skin, nose bleeding, and facial swelling.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{accelerated}} schedules of allergen immunotherapy (ASAI) {{in patients with}} bronchial asthma (BA) has been reported but there are little data on the safety of ASAI for patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). In this study, we investigated the safety of ASAI in patients with AD. Sixty patients with AD and 18 patients with BA sensitized to house dust mites (HDM) were studied. A maximum maintenance dose of HDM extract, adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide, was administered to patients by subcutaneous injection with either a 3 -day protocol (rush immunotherapy) or 1 -day protocol (ultra-rush immunotherapy). <b>Systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> were observed 4 of 15 patients (26. 7 %) with AD during rush immunotherapy, 13 of 45 patients (28. 9 %) with AD during ultra-rush immunotherapy, and 4 of 18 patients (22. 2 %) with BA during rush immunotherapy (P > 0. 05). No severe or near fatal <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> occurred in 78 subjects of this study. <b>Systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> developed within 4 hr after administration of the maximum allergen dose in 20 of 21 patients (95. 2 %) with AD and BA who showed <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> during rush or ultra-rush immunotherapy.

40|$|Hymenoptera venom allergy {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in children, so paediatricians are frequently unprepared and thus incapable of giving adequate answers.

Severe <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> presenting with respiratory and/or cardiocirculatory symptoms and/or laryngeal oedema, exceptionally fatal in paediatric age, are a strong indication for specific immunotherapy (SIT).

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that patients with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) respond to pepsin-sensitive allergens, and systemic reactors identify pepsin-resistant allergens. We sought to assess the digestibility of kiwifruit proteins in simulated gastric fluid (SGF), and to compare the immunogenicity of the digests in patients with isolated oral and <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> to kiwifruit. In addition, the effect of pH on digestibility of kiwifruit proteins was investigated. The in vitro resistance of kiwifruit proteins to digestion was determined using SGF. G-immunoglobulin (IgE) binding to digested proteins was investigated by Western blotting using sera from children and adults (aged 5 - 72 yr) with <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> and patients with isolated oral symptoms. To determine whether pH conditions influence digestion of kiwifruit extracts, digestion at pHs 1. 5 - 7 were compared by SDS-PAGE. Patients with <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> showed IgE binding to digestion-resistant allergens, but patients with oral symptoms reacted only to digestion-labile allergens. An increase in pH from 1. 5 to 2. 5 significantly reduced pepsin breakdown of kiwifruit allergens. Immunoreactive digested protein fragments were detectable by immunoblot but not Coomassie stain. This study confirms {{a difference in the}} lability of food allergens recognized by patients with <b>systemic</b> <b>reactions</b> and those with OAS. Pepsin digestion of kiwifruit proteins was impaired by hypoacidic conditions suggesting that patients with hypoacidic gastric conditions are at increased risk of systemic absorption of allergens. The data indicate that commonly used methods for predicting allergenicity of novel proteins using Coomassie stains may be flawed...|$|R
