40|$|Computer-based spell {{checkers}} help {{to correct}} misspells instantly. Almost all the word processing devices are now {{equipped with a}} spell-check function that either automatically corrects errors or provides a list of intended words. However, {{it is not clear}} on how the reliance on this convenient technological solution affects spelling learning. According to cognitive load theory convenience might be harmful for learning because it reduces the amount of effort invested in the learning task. In this study, effects of <b>spelling</b> <b>aids</b> on detecting and correcting misspelled words were examined by comparing English as a second language studentsÂ¿ performances on detecting and correcting the misspelled word across four conditions: control, red underline, spell-check (drop-down list), and dictionary. Learning transferability and durability were also examined. Results indicated that all <b>spelling</b> <b>aids</b> induced error-detection learning even when the errors were presented in a different context (transferability) or in a delayed posttest (durability). For error-correction learning, results showed that both the spell-checker (drop-down list) and the dictionary helped the students to learn the spelling incidentally. On the delayed posttest, error-correction performance in these two aided conditions was significantly higher than the performance in the control group. In conclusion, effort spent on searching for the correct words relates to better incidental spelling learning. Convenience and effort should be considered as factors influencing incidental spelling learning in the design of computer-based spell checkers...|$|R

Typical BCI applications comprise <b>spelling</b> <b>aids</b> or environmental control systems supporting paralyzed patients {{that have lost}} motor control completely. The design of an EEG based BCI system requires good answers for the problem of selecting useful features during {{the performance of a}} mental task {{as well as for the}} problem of classifying these features. For the special case of choosing appropriate EEG channels from several available channels, we propose the application of variants of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for both problems. Although these algorithms do not rely on prior knowledge they can provide more accurate solutions than standard lter methods [1] for feature selection which usually incorporate prior knowledge about neural activity patterns during the performed mental tasks. For judging the importance of features we introduce a new relevance measure and apply it to EEG channels. Although we base the relevance measure for this purpose on the previously introduced algorithms, it does in general not depend on specic algorithms but can be derived using arbitrary combinations of feature selectors and classifiers...|$|R

40|$|Advanced Natural Language Processing Tools for Web Information Retrieval, Content Analysis, and Synthesis. The {{goal of this}} SBIR was to {{implement}} and evaluate several advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and techniques to enhance the precision and relevance of search results by analyzing and augmenting search queries and by helping to organize the search output obtained from heterogeneous databases and web pages containing textual information of interest to DOE and the scientific-technical user communities in general. The SBIR investigated 1) the incorporation of spelling checkers in search applications, 2) identification of significant phrases and concepts {{using a combination of}} linguistic and statistical techniques, and 3) enhancement of the query interface and search retrieval results through the use of semantic resources, such as thesauri. A search program with a flexible query interface was developed to search reference databases with the objective of enhancing search results from web queries or queries of specialized search systems such as DOE's Information Bridge. The DOE ETDE/INIS Joint Thesaurus was processed to create a searchable database. Term frequencies and term co-occurrences were used to enhance the web information retrieval by providing algorithmically-derived objective criteria to organize relevant documents into clusters containing significant terms. A thesaurus provides an authoritative overview and classification of a field of knowledge. By organizing the results of a search using the thesaurus terminology, the output is more meaningful than when the results are just organized based on the terms that co-occur in the retrieved documents, some of which may not be significant. An attempt was made {{to take advantage of the}} hierarchy provided by broader and narrower terms, as well as other field-specific information in the thesauri. The search program uses linguistic morphological routines to find relevant entries regardless of whether terms are stored in singular or plural form. Implementation of additional inflectional morphology processes for verbs can enhance retrieval further, but this has to be balanced by the possibility of broadening the results too much. In addition to the DOE energy thesaurus, other sources of specialized organized knowledge such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Wikipedia were investigated. The supporting role of the NLP thesaurus search program was enhanced by incorporating <b>spelling</b> <b>aid</b> and a part-of-speech tagger to cope with misspellings in the queries and to determine the grammatical roles of the query words and identify nouns for special processing. To improve precision, multiple modes of searching were implemented including Boolean operators, and field-specific searches. Programs to convert a thesaurus or reference file into searchable support files can be deployed easily, and the resulting files are immediately searchable to produce relevance-ranked results with builtin <b>spelling</b> <b>aid,</b> morphological processing, and advanced search logic. Demonstration systems were built for several databases, including the DOE energy thesaurus...|$|R

Here we give an overview of the different kinds of assistive technologies available in free and open source forms, or via the relatively new and ever-changing mobile and portable devices market. We outline the tools and how they might be used in learning and teaching. You can then make informed decisions about which tools might be appropriate for you or your learners. These materials are divided into the following sections: Assistive Technology built into your computer: Both Windows and Mac OS have built in assistive technology functions, which make the computer easier to use for many disabled people. This section describes the functions that are available and how you use them. Free and Open Source Assistive Technologies: In this section we highlight tools that are freely available at no cost, many of which are device-agnostic and many of which are portable, meaning they will run from a memory stick and do not require the user to have installation rights on their machine. Mobile Devices as Assistive Technologies, and Apps: Most smartphones and tablet devices have a range of accessibility features built in. There are also many functions that are not specifically designed for people with disabilities but may be particularly useful for learners with particular needs.

Results from the dyslexic students were further compared with those obtained with a group of students with moderate learning difficulties (MLD). The spelling of both the dyslexics and the MLD group was found to be considerably more accurate when a computer spell checker was employed. Performance on the electronic hand held machine was also better than when a dictionary was used. For the dyslexic group, but not for the MLD students, performance on all three items of equipment was found to be a function of spelling age. A second investigation examined the effectiveness of utilising the editing facilities of a word processor in the teaching of punctuation skills to 17 dyslexics (mean C. A. = 11. 8 yrs) and 14 MLD controls (mean CA. = 11. 8 yrs). The results indicated the computer mediated teaching to be very effective for both subjects and controls. A third strand of the study examined the benefits resulting from provision of individual laptop computers to 10 secondary aged dyslexic students. After using the equipment for a year, teachers identified improvements in spelling and in the clarity and presentation of written work. Students said they were less anxious about their spelling problems and gained more enjoyment from written tasks. Parents reported a general increase in confidence among their sons and daughters.

40|$|AbstractâThis article {{addresses}} {{the problems of}} word spotting and word recognition on images. In word spotting, {{the goal is to}} find all instances of a query word in a dataset of images. In recognition, the goal is to recognize the content of the word image, usually <b>aided</b> by a <b>dictionary</b> or lexicon. We describe an approach in which both word images and text strings are embedded in a common vectorial subspace. This is achieved by a combination of label embedding and attributes learning, and a common subspace regression. In this subspace, images and strings that represent the same word are close together, allowing one to cast recognition and retrieval tasks as a nearest neighbor problem. Contrary to most other existing methods, our representation has a fixed length, is low dimensional, and is very fast to compute and, especially, to compare. We test our approach on four public datasets of both handwritten documents and natural images showing results comparable or better than the state-of-the-art on spotting and recognition tasks...|$|R
