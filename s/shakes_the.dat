5|$|On the airplane, Jack jokingly tells {{a flight}} {{attendant}} named Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) that his alcoholic drink is not strong, and {{she gives him a}} stronger one. Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> plane, scaring Rose, who is sitting across from Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E
5|$|Once all votes {{have been}} cast, the first Scrutineer chosen <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> container, {{and the last}} Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does not {{correspond}} {{to the number of}} cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the ballots are burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated. If, however, no irregularities are observed, the ballots may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E

As they continue, Heather realizes her map is missing and Mike later reveals he kicked it into a creek the {{previous}} day out of frustration, which prompts Heather and Josh to attack him in a rage. They realize they are now lost and decide simply to head south. They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear sounds again, including the sound of children laughing among other strange noises. After an unknown force <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.|$|E
5|$|Mulder discovers a signal, {{possibly}} {{originating from}} an extraterrestrial intelligence. During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright.

5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

25|$|A {{stick shaker}} is a device (available in some {{hydraulic}} aircraft) that {{is attached to}} the control column, which <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> control column when the aircraft is about to stall. Also in some aircraft like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 there is/was a back-up electrical power supply that the pilot can turn on to re-activate the stick shaker in case the hydraulic connection to the stick shaker is lost.|$|E
25|$|Particle-size {{analysis}} : This is done {{to determine}} the soil gradation. Coarser particles are separated in the sieve analysis portion, and the finer particles are analyzed with a hydrometer. The distinction between coarse and fine particles is usually made at 75 μm. The sieve analysis <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> sample through progressively smaller meshes to determine its gradation. The hydrometer analysis uses the rate of sedimentation to determine particle gradation.|$|E

Rogers Merchandising in Chicago created <b>the</b> <b>shake.</b> Initially, <b>the</b> <b>shake</b> was lemon/lime flavored with vanilla ice cream, lemon/lime sherbet, and vanilla syrup. By 1973, <b>the</b> <b>shake</b> was merely a green colored vanilla <b>shake,</b> eliminating <b>the</b> lemon/lime sherbet. It is now mint flavored.|$|R

25|$|The Irish Film {{industry}} has grew rapidly {{in recent years}} thanks largely to {{the promotion of the}} sector by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Irish Film Board) and the introduction of heavy tax breaks. Some of the most successful Irish films include the Palme d'Or winning The Wind That <b>Shakes</b> <b>the</b> Barley (2006), Intermission (2001), Man About Dog (2004), Michael Collins (1996), Angela's Ashes (1999), The Commitments (1991), The Field (1990), and Once (2007). Michael Collins is the highest grossing Irish film ever in Ireland, making £4,000,000.|$|E

25|$|Interferometric {{detectors}} {{are limited}} at high frequencies by shot noise, which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall—the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at {{the output of}} the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., Brownian motion) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event. All these {{must be taken into account}} and excluded by analysis before detection may be considered a true gravitational wave event.|$|E
25|$|Although {{parthenogenetic}} species do occur, most harvestmen reproduce sexually. Mating involves direct copulation, {{rather than}} the deposition of a spermatophore. The males of some species offer a secretion (nuptial gift) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation. Sometimes, the male guards the female after copulation, and in many species, the males defend territories. In some species, males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> female's sensory leg. This is believed to entice the female into mating a second time. The females lay eggs from an ovipositor shortly after mating to several months later. Some species build nests for this purpose. A unique feature of harvestmen is that in some species, the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners, often against egg-eating females, and subjecting the eggs to regular cleaning. Depending on circumstances such as temperature, the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days, up to about half a year after being laid. Harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity, with most known species having six instars.|$|E
