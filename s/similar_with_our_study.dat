30|$|In {{this study}} {{almost all the}} {{respondents}} said that they have heard about HIV/AIDS. This is very much similar with (Goel and Pandey 1997), (Klepp and Lugoe 1999) in Tanzania. While comparing the knowledge on HIV/AIDS (Khan 2002) showed that when 17 % of adolescent of Bangladesh {{had ever heard of}} AIDS; Indians and Nepalese reported 37 % and 25 % respectively. His study was reflected on the general adolescent population of these countries, which is not <b>similar</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>study</b> as because we have concentrated on a group of population in Dhaka city who are provided with more facilities to get information from mass media. Mass media exposure such as Radio and TV was positively associated with having knowledge on HIV/AIDS among the adolescent. The exposure to such media can communicate knowledge on AIDS in music, news reports, songs, dramas, documentaries and advertising and can profoundly influence attitudes and behavior of people (Khan 2002). The splendid contribution of mass media is also shown in a mass media project using a TV program to teach adolescent in Zaire about HIV/AIDS awareness (Convisser 1992). Regarding the source of information, Radio and TV were reported as a major source of information on HIV/AIDS by our respondents. This is quite similar with (Goel and Pandey 1997) and (Khan 2002). More over 21 % of the respondents in our study, cited that they first came to know about HIV/AIDS from the health personnel. This shows the effectiveness of various programs implemented by the Govt. of Bangladesh in association with international and national NGOs in health sector.|$|E

30|$|To better {{understand}} how the respiratory mechanics are affected, we have considered the lung and chest wall compliance by computing the transpulmonary pressure. The transpulmonary pressure is the distending force of the lung, and it was computed as {{the difference in the}} changes in airway pressure and esophageal pressure. Esophageal pressure was recorded with an esophageal balloon, which has been shown to accurately reflect the pleural pressure in previous studies [29, 30, 32, 33]. Comparing <b>similar</b> anthropometric features <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> Nisbet et al. [28] found that lung compliance ranged from 30 to 40  ml/cmH 2 O, slightly higher compared with the present data. Similarly, Ingimarsson et al. [32] reported that in muscle paralyzed healthy children the compliance of lung averaged 3.3  ±  0.7  ml/cmH 2 O/kg. In the present study, the lung compliance was significantly higher in healthy children compared with ARDS 1.5  ±  0.5  ml/cmH 2 O/kg vs 0.7  ±  0.1  ml/cmH 2 O/kg and did not change with PEEP or tidal volume.|$|R

Moreover, there exists an extra branch which lies between the fundamental and first higher modes of the case of a homogeneous sphere. This is a kind of boundary waves between two media, the mantle and the core. 2) The phase and group velocities become very complicated by the existence of a core. 3) Reflected phase at the core-mantle boundary are found in theoretical seismograms. 4) Transmitted waves through the liquid core are also seen in the seismograms. 5) Diffracted waves in the shadow zone can also be traced. 1. 筆者らはさきに,等質等方弾性球を伝わるスフェロイド型の波を,球のいろいろなモードの固有振動の和として表わし,実際の地震記象によく似た理論地震記象を求めた. 今回は同様な方法を用い,流体核がある場合の等質等方弾性球の極附近に半径方向の力が加わる場合の変位を,球面上の数点で計算した. 2. まず,固有振動数を求めた. これを各iに対しnの函数として示すと,等質等方弾性球のi= 1 とi= 2 という分枝の間に,特別な分枝(i= 1 'と名づける) のあることが分つた. 半径方向の振幅分布を計算すると,この枝に属するモードは,核とマントルの境界面で振幅が著しく大きくなる...|$|R
40|$|The Plasmodium falciparum {{cysteine}} proteases falcipain- 2 and falcipain- 3 {{are major}} hemoglobinases and potential antimalarial drug targets. <b>Our</b> previous <b>studies</b> demonstrated that these enzymes {{are equipped with}} specific domains for specific functions. Structural and functional analysis of falcipains showed that they have unique domains including a refolding domain and a hemoglobin binding domain.

The data for this study is a part af the result of the field study done by the second year medical students of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, Jakarta, on June 27 h, 2001, at Cijeruk subdistrict in Bogor regency. The subjects were seleccted randomly using neighborhood cluster which was diffirent from the previous study in 2000. Interviews and blood pressure were taken at the houses of the subjects from 1 : 00 PM to 4 : 00 PM. The results of this study showed that people aged 40 years or over had an increase risk to suffer hypertension compared to the 18 - 39 year old group, and the risk was most prominent among the 55 - 59 year group [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 17. 7; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) = 6. 26 - 59. 2). Compared to the subjects with normal body posture,those who were obese had more than two-fold increase in the risk to be hypertensive (adjusted OR= 0. 87; 95 % CI= 0. 87 - 4. 17; P= 0. 109). In addition, those who discontinued antihypertensive drugs had almost 14 -fold increase in the risk to be hypertensive relative to subjects who never take antihypertensive drugs (adjusted OR= 14. 16; 95 % CI= 7. 14 - 28. 05). In general, the results of this <b>study</b> is <b>similar</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> last year <b>study</b> which used different subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical {{significance}} of out-pouching {{structures of the}} left atrium (LA) as potential embolic sources remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the association between stroke and LA out-pouching structures. METHODS: A case-control {{study was conducted to}} assess the prevalence of LA out-pouching structures in subjects with and without stroke. Case subjects were 270 stroke patients who had undergone cardiac CT. Control subjects were 270 age- and sex-matched patients without a history of stroke and who had undergone cardiac CT. Presence of LA out-pouching structures was determined by ECG-gated cardiac CT. The location of out-pouching structures was categorized as near Bachmann bundle, anterior, inferoseptal, inferior, and lateral. The prevalence, number and location of out-pouching structures and clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: One hundred sixty eight out-pouching structures were identified in 139 stroke patients (51 %), while a total of 169 out-pouching structures were found in 155 control patients (57 %) (p= 0. 1949). The prevalence of LA out-pouching structures with different locations was not significantly different between the stroke group and control group. In the stroke group, the prevalence of out-pouching structures was not significantly different by subtypes of ischemic stroke and the prevalence of LA out-pouching structures was not different between patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and without AF. CONCLUSION: The left atrial out-pouching structures are commonly seen in a population with and without stroke <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> prevalence. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> suggests that LA out-pouching structures are not significant risk factors of stroke...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bone grafts are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} treatment of bone defects. Bone harvesting can cause postoperative complications and sometimes does not provide a sufficient quantity of bone. Therefore, synthetic biomaterials have been investigated as an alternative to autogenous bone grafts. Aim and Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare bovine derived hydroxyapatite (BHA) and synthetic hydroxyapatite (SHA) graft material as bone graft substitute in maxillary cystic bony defects. Patients were analyzed by computerized densitometric study and digital radiography. Materials and Methods: In this study, 12 patients in each group were included randomly after clinical and radiological evaluation. The integration of hydroxyapatite was assessed with mean bone density, surgical site margin, and radiological bone formation characteristics, of the successful graft cases using computer densitometry and radio-visiograph. Statistical analysis was carried out using Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon matched pairs test and paired t-test. Results: By the end of 24 th week, the grafted defects radiologically and statistically showed similar volumes of bone formation. However, the significant changes observed in the formation of bone and merging of material and surgical site margin at 1 st week to 1 st month. The results were significant and correlating with all the parameters showing the necessity of the grafting for early bone formation. However, the bone formation pattern is different in both BHA and SHA group at 3 rd month interval with significant P value. Conclusion: Both BHA and SHA graft materials are biocompatible for filling bone defects, showing less resorption and enhanced bone formation <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> efficacy. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> showed maximum bone healing within 12 weeks of grafting of defects. The BHA is economical; however, price difference between the two is very nominal...|$|R
