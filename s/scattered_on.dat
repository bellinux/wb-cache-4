40|$|Total beam {{lifetime}} {{consists of}} two components: the residual-gas-scattering lifetime and Touschek lifetime. The residual-gas lifetime is comprised of the elastic and inelastic <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> electrons and elastic and inelastic <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> nuclei. Touschek <b>scattering</b> involves scattering of particles within the bunch. One usually calculates only the elastic <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> nuclei (single Coulomb scattering) and inelastic <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> nuclei (bremsstrahlung) of the residual-gas-scattering lifetime component. Experience gained from computing the beam lifetime in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring shows that the electron scattering should not be neglected, particularly the inelastic contribution. Given the measured quantities from the APS storage ring, one can compare theoretical predictions with experimental results. Uncertainties in calculating the various contributions to lifetime will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the problem}} of elastic wave <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> {{wrinkled}} interfaces, we studied the scattering of ballistic electrons on a wrinkled potential energy region. The electron transmission coefficient depends on both wrinkle amplitude and periodicity, having different behaviors for positive and negative scattering potential energies. For <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> potential barriers, minibands appear in electron transmission, as in superlattices, whereas for <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> periodic potential wells the transmission coefficient has a more complex form. Besides suggesting that tuning of electron transmission is possible by modifying the scattering potential via voltages on wrinkled gate electrodes, our results emphasize the analogies between ballistic electrons and elastic waves even in <b>scattering</b> problems <b>on</b> non-typical configurations...|$|R

Laser radiation with intensities of ∼ 2 × 10 13 W/cm 2 compressed the carbon samples by a factor of two reaching pressures of ∼ 90 GPa. Due to the change of the crystalline structure the scattered signals of the probe radiation were modified significantly in intensity and spectral composition compared to the <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> cold samples.

40|$|Gapless surface {{states on}} topological {{insulators}} are protected from elastic <b>scattering</b> <b>on</b> non-magnetic impurities {{which makes them}} promising candidates for low-power electronic applications.
