40|$|The major task of <b>supply</b> chain {{planning}} â€“ as {{the tactical}} level of <b>supply</b> chain management â€“ is {{the determination of}} supply-chain-wide master plans on a medium-term basis. Both in literature and in commercial <b>supply</b> chain management systems, a centralised approach to <b>supply</b> chain planning is frequently proposed. Due to the incongruence between incentives of the firms involved in the <b>supply</b> chain and overall <b>supply</b> chain objectives, a centralised <b>supply</b> chain planning will either not be accepted or will not lead to system-wide effectiveness. For this reason, <b>supply</b> chain planning decisions are most commonly coordinated on a decentralised basis.

The costs of a mismatch between <b>supply</b> and demand are growing in many industries. Companies have tried various approaches, however these approaches, while useful, have failed to address a number of the drivers of supply-demand mismatch. The literature study starts with an overview of <b>supply</b> chain management. The study covers the various concepts of <b>supply</b> chain management, the importance of <b>supply</b> chain performance, the challenges of managing <b>supply</b> chains, demand management, <b>supply</b> management, as well as the relationship between <b>supply</b> and demand. The literature study continues to cover the various concepts related to the alignment of <b>supply</b> and demand within a <b>supply</b> chain. The study covers the effects of the misalignment between <b>supply</b> and demand within a <b>supply</b> chain, traditional approaches to align <b>supply</b> and demand and the transformation to a more responsive organisation. The various approaches to decrease the <b>supply</b> and demand lead time gap are also discussed. The literature study concludes with an overview of the <b>supply</b> chain of Kraft Foods South Africa, as well as the global Kraft Foods organisation. The review covers the challenges, the sustainable growth plan, the organisational set-up, sources and product range, geographical layout, people, functions and technology involved in Kraft’s <b>supply</b> chain. The review concludes with an overview of the current alignment between <b>supply</b> and demand within Kraft Foods South Africa’s <b>supply</b> chain. Chapter five discusses the details of the research design and methodology that was followed in conducting the research. Chapter six indicates the findings of the structured interviews with the key players in Kraft Foods South Africa’s <b>supply</b> chain.

In desperation, a major operation was planned, intended to transport substantial <b>supplies</b> and sufficient troops to resist the inevitable British invasion on Martinique. To this end, Commodore Amable-Gilles Troude was provided with the ships of the line Courageux, Polonais and Hautpoult, with the frigates Félicité and Furieuse en flûte as armed storeships, carrying the bulk of the <b>supplies.</b>|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is developed through literatures starting from the year 1990 s till 2013 which emphasis on definition of <b>supply</b> chain, halal <b>supply</b> chain, halal food <b>supply</b> chain and halalan-toyyiban <b>supply</b> chain; however due to the application of religious in the <b>supply</b> chain area is relatively new, the searching of materials goes beyond it.
