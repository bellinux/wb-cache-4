40|$|<b>Stereological</b> <b>description</b> of {{dispersed}} microstructure {{is not an}} {{easy task}} and remains the subject of continuous research. In its practical aspect, a correct <b>stereological</b> <b>description</b> of this type of structure is essential for the analysis of processes of coagulation and spheroidisation, or for studies of relationships between structure and properties. One of the most frequently used methods for an estimation of the density Nv and size distribution of particles is the Scheil - Schwartz - Saltykov method. In this article, the authors present selected methods for quantitative assessment of ductile iron microstructure, i. e. the Scheil - Schwartz - Saltykov method, which allows a quantitative description of three-dimensional sets of solids using measurements and counts performed on two-dimensional cross-sections of these sets (microsections) and quantitative description of three-dimensional sets of solids by X-ray computed microtomography, which is an interesting alternative for structural studies compared to traditional methods of microstructure imaging since, as a result, the analysis provides a three-dimensional imaging of microstructures examined...|$|E
40|$|The final {{mechanical}} properties {{of cast iron}} depend on the nature and properties of the matrix and on the morphology of graphiteprecipitates. The article {{presents the results of}} studies of the structure of austenitic ductile iron with different nickel content. The studies include the identification and <b>stereological</b> <b>description</b> of graphite precipitates. The volume fraction of graphite in cast iron was determined in function {{of the size of the}} precipitates and the adopted shape coefficient of single particles, enabling the content of regular spheroids to be estimated...|$|E
