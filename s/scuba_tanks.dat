2500|$|Between 14 and 30 January 2012, rescue divers searched {{within the}} ship for missing people. The {{head of the}} coast guard diving team {{described}} the conditions inside the ship, still perched on a [...] ledge, as [...] "disastrous". Pitch-black conditions with large furniture drifting around made the rescue operation hazardous. Divers would find a path into the ship and tie down obstacles such as mattresses, before making noise to alert trapped people. The divers worked in pairs for safety and searched each assigned area slowly in a zig-zag manner. The search dives were planned as 40 minutes in duration, with sufficient extra compressed air in the <b>scuba</b> <b>tanks</b> in case of emergency. The divers had two torches (headlamps) positioned on their helmets because underwater visibility varied from approximately 5 to 60cm. In addition, divers marked their route by trailing a line {{to be used to}} lead them back out in low visibility and positioned extra emergency air tanks within the ship. The divers were from the Italian Navy, Coast Guard, and Vigili del Fuoco (fire and rescue service).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} {{underwater}} hatha yoga on physiological variables, {{with and without}} scuba diving equipment, were investigated on 20 healthy sport divers {{before and after the}} underwater yoga exercises during 6 weeks. A static apnea test on water surface was applied by facial immerging in water at 2 -min intervals, using two different methods of breath-holding which are called GPB and HV, during this test we measured the heart rate and lung function using pyrometer, E. C. G, and the limit of residual air pressure in <b>SCUBA</b> <b>tank</b> after 30 min dive. After this test we found an observable increase in the apnea time and residual air pressure in <b>SCUBA</b> <b>tank,</b> and this was attributable to a decrease in heart variables and an increase in lung function. Apnoeic time tended to be larger after underwater SCUBA exercises. This results may increase the efficiency in some SUCBA diver’s skills and also gives more safety and relaxation in SCUBA diving program...|$|R

The “Clear” button allows a player to void a data entry mistake during game play.|$|E
5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|R
50|$|The systems used {{to supply}} air are {{compressed}} air systems which push air down a hose to a diving regulator breathing apparatus, are either 12 volt electrical air pumps, gasoline powered pumps, or several <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> floating systems with airlines to the diver. These hookah diving systems usually limit the hose length to allow less than 7 metres depth. The {{exception is the}} gasoline unit which requires a much higher level of training and topside supervision for safe use.|$|R
5000|$|Cousteau's first scuba dive came at age four when Jacques-Yves Cousteau {{strapped}} {{a custom}} made <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> {{to his back}} and sent Fabien Cousteau off into the Mediterranean Sea. His interest in sharks began at a young age, about 6 or 7, and was piqued when he sneaked into a showing of Jaws. The film perplexed him - [...] "It went against everything I had ever learned about sharks ... Great white sharks don't go around chopping up boats," [...] he explained - and started him {{on a mission to}} clear up [...] "the gross misconceptions we have about sharks".|$|R
50|$|After {{the fifth}} group left the escape trunk, divers placed {{a set of}} <b>scuba</b> <b>tanks</b> in the trunk. The final three escapees spent between {{one-half}} and one hour breathing from the tanks before escaping at 18:05, by which time personnel topside were again becoming apprehensive. Divers were sent to investigate the delay and were present when all three escapees simultaneously emerged from the escape trunk.|$|E
50|$|Harold invites {{him along}} on a boat trip during which all three try out some newly bought scuba diving equipment. When they resurface, {{they are unable to}} breathe without using their <b>scuba</b> <b>tanks.</b> They climb back into their boat and find Manuel, the crewman, dead, {{apparently}} of asphyxiation. Upon rowing ashore, they enter the jungle. With their air running out, they discover that the foliage gives off oxygen they can breathe.|$|E
50|$|Professional-grade {{inflatable}} {{boats and}} RIBs have existed for many decades. Modern versions are complex, {{and they can}} be rapidly inflated using SCBA or <b>scuba</b> <b>tanks</b> as well as CO2 to make them mission ready. The professional-grade RIBs are available in many sizes and styles, some sporting T-tops, cabins, and other features. Since the late 1990s, many varieties of inflatable boats, RIBs, whitewater rafts, kayaks and sea kayaks, and canoes, have been developed by Asian, European, and North American companies.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|R
50|$|As {{the series}} progresses, however, Serge seems {{to begin to}} abandon these overly {{intricate}} methods. In Torpedo Juice, he kills a petty mugger by forcing him to swallow a handful of bullets, then subjecting him to a MRI (leaving police to marvel at a corpse featuring numerous exit wounds but no visible entry wounds). Later in the same novel, however, Serge kills a boorish drunk via the relatively mundane method of kicking him to death. Still later, he fills an obnoxious man's <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> with nitrous oxide, leading to his death during Serge's underwater wedding (fittingly enough, to the strains of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb).|$|R

50|$|It {{is at this}} conference, we {{also learn}} that Takashi's father, Bunkichi, had a theory that if dinosaurs were ever to walk the earth again, that would mean a cataclysmic event was about to occur. To prove this point, a {{scientist}} that monitors earthquakes in the region claims that something very big is on the horizon: the eruption of Mt. Fuji! The following day, Takashi decides {{to go looking for}} the Plesiosaurus. To make sure Akiko does not follow, he attempts to empty the air out of her <b>scuba</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tanks {{get very}} hot when filled rapidly. <b>SCUBA</b> <b>tanks</b> are {{sometimes}} immersed in water to cool them down {{when they are}} being filled. That {{would not be possible}} with tanks in a car and thus it would either {{take a long time to}} fill the tanks, or they would have to take less than a full charge, since heat drives up the pressure. However, if well insulated, such as Dewar (vacuum) flask design, the heat would not have to be lost but put to use when the car was running.|$|E
50|$|Worthington Industries is {{a global}} diversified metals {{manufacturing}} company with 2015 fiscal year sales of $3.38 billion. The Columbus, Ohio based company is a steel processor and manufacturer of pressure cylinder, such as propane, oxygen and helium tanks, hand torches, refrigerant and industrial cylinders, camping cylinders, exploration, recovery and production products for global energy markets; <b>scuba</b> <b>tanks,</b> and compressed natural gas storage cylinders; custom-engineered open and enclosed cabs and operator stations for heavy mobile equipment; framing systems for mid-rise buildings; steel pallets and racks for shipping. In addition to its three primary business units (steel processing, pressure cylinders and engineered cabs), the company’s approximately 10 joint ventures also focus on metals-related markets.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, dive shop owners, Joe Schuch and Jack Schammel, {{developed}} {{a more comfortable}} buoyancy compensator vest that featured a smaller buoyancy ring behind the diver's head, and a midriff section with sufficient volume to lift the diver's {{head out of the}} water in the event that one or both of its CO2 cartridges were activated for emergency ascent. In 1969, the original Control Buoyancy Jacket or [...] "CBJ" [...] was manufactured by Waverly Air Products of Chemung, NY and sold in dive shops throughout the east coast of the United States. By 1970, a push-button inflator using air from the diver's <b>SCUBA</b> <b>tank</b> augmented the manual inflation hose.|$|R
50|$|A camstrap is a {{piece of}} webbing with a buckle that is used to secure a {{cylinder}} or <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> to a buoyancy compensator or backplate. The name is derived from the cam action of the buckle to tighten and secure the strap. Also known as a cam band or tank strap. Cam straps are also typically used in whitewater rafting to tie rowing frames to the rafts. However, the cam buckle used in rafting cam straps is very different from one used in diving. The rafting cam strap has a self-locking cam lever that cannot be accidentally released. A thumb released cam locks the webbing in place and its locking action even allows tightening one handed.|$|R
5000|$|HPA {{tanks are}} {{generally}} filled from specially designed air compressors {{which are made}} to create extremely high pressures (unlike shop compressors). Although HPA tanks may in theory be refilled from other sources of compressed air such as a conventional <b>scuba</b> <b>tank</b> or a general-purpose air compressor, the pressure available from these sources is far below the pressure that HPA tanks are designed for. For example, shop compressors create around [...] range, {{an order of magnitude}} less than HPA tanks are designed for (typically in the range of [...] ). HPA tanks are filled from a nipple instead of the ASA valve, which allows them to be filled while the tank is still attached to the paintball marker.|$|R
