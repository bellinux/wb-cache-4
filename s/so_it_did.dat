5|$|In a 2002 article, Bill Simmons {{named the}} worst officiated {{games of the}} prior four years, alleging that the games {{involved}} either extending a series <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not end quickly or advancing a large market team for the NBA's benefit.

5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E
5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 {{damage to}} Timothy Bloodworth was {{considered}} slight, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not {{prevent her from}} sailing from Antwerp two days later. On 30 December, she left Liverpool for New York and arrived on 13 January 1945. The cargo ship headed south to Hampton Roads and departed for Gibraltar on 7 February. She put in at Gibraltar on 23 February and sailed for Oran. From that port she returned to Hampton Roads on 24 March in convoy GUS 76. Timothy Bloodworth next sailed from New York for Liverpool, Southend, and Antwerp, arriving at the latter port on 30 April. She was at Antwerp on Victory in Europe Day. Timothy Bloodworths last reported movement was in convoy ATM 168 from Antwerp to Southend on 28/29 May.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

25|$|St. Ann's Church, a rusticated-stone {{structure}} with a Romanesque Revival tower on East 12th Street that dated to 1847, {{was sold to}} NYU {{to make way for}} a 26-story, 700-bed dormitory. After community protest, the university promised to protect and maintain the church's original facade; and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> literally, by having the facade stand alone in front of the building, now the tallest structure in the area. According to many residents, NYU's alteration and demolition of historic buildings, such as the Peter Cooper Post Office, is spoiling the physical and socio-economic landscape that makes this neighborhood so interesting and attractive.|$|E
25|$|The library {{aimed to}} provide open {{access to all}} its 900,000 volumes. No {{basement}} was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library and a tall book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep {{the height of the}} building low, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low ceiling height of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces. The furniture for the library was specified by the architects, with a preference for oak veneer book stacks and black linoleum floor covering.|$|E

25|$|Giant isopods {{collected}} {{along the}} east coast of Australia by setting traps exhibit a variation in diversity with water depth. The deeper the water, the fewer number of species found, and the larger the species tended to be. The giant isopods found in very deep waters off Australia were compared to those found off Mexico and India. From the fossil record it is thought that Bathynomus existed more than 160 million years ago, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not evolve independently in all three locations, but since then it would be expected that Bathynomus would show divergent evolution in the various locations. However the giant isopods in all three locations were almost identical in appearance (although there are some differences, and they are separate species). This reduced phenotypic divergence is linked to the extremely low light levels of their habitat.|$|E
25|$|Following a seven-month siege, Titus Flavius, Vespasian's son, {{eventually}} {{used the}} collapse {{of several of the}} city walls to breach Jerusalem. By the summer of 70, the Romans had breached the walls of Jerusalem, ransacking and burning nearly the entire city. The Romans began by attacking the weakest spot: the third wall. It was built shortly before the siege <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not have as much time invested in its protection. They succeeded towards the end of May and shortly afterwards broke through the more important second wall. During the final stages of the Roman attack, Zealots under John of Giscala still held the Temple, while the Sicarii, led by Simon Bar Giora, held the upper city. The Second Temple (the renovated Herod's Temple), one of the last fortified bastions of the rebellion, was destroyed on Tisha B'Av (29 or 30 July 70).|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, a heavy {{snowfall}} {{snapped off}} the aircraft's left wing. Despite {{the efforts of}} Museum staff to clear the accumulating snow, the wing's internal structure failed and the wing separated from the fuselage, falling onto a display case containing one of the aircraft's original engines. The wing suffered considerable damage and there was additional damage to the tail and propeller. The wing had largely been restored using wood parts {{because most of the}} metal parts of the wing structure had been eroded, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not possess the structural integrity of the original aircraft. The museum is currently seeking donations to repair the aircraft. The repairs, in 2011, included the mating of the wing and propeller to the fuselage and engine. As of November 2013, the repairs to the CMF Handley Page Hampden have been completed. The wing has been re-secured and the complete aircraft has been repainted. By 20 April 2015 the two gunner sections were open.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the end of}} August, four hurricanes {{had formed}} in the Atlantic, two of which {{attained}} major hurricane status. A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 111mph (178km/h); a storm of this intensity would be classified as a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale introduced in the 1970s. In contrast to the busy August, only three named storms developed in Septemberalthough three of the August hurricanes lasted into September. Hurricane Dog became the strongest hurricane of the season on September6 with winds of its peak strength occurred over the open Atlantic Ocean, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not cause significant damage when it was at its strongest.
