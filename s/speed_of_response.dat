2500|$|The {{opponent}} {{process model}} of the visual system is composed of two chromatic neural channels and one achromatic neural channel. [...] The chromatic channels consist of a red–green channel and a yellow–blue channel and are responsible for color and wavelength. [...] The achromatic channel is responsible for luminance, or white–black detection. [...] Hue and saturation are perceived due to varying amounts of activity in these neural channels consisting of axon pathways from retinal ganglion cells. These three channels are tied closely to reaction time in response to colors. [...] The achromatic neural channel has a faster response time than the chromatic neural channels under most conditions. [...] The functions of these channels are task-dependent. [...] Some activities are dependent on one channel or the other, as well as both channels. [...] When a colored stimulus is summed with white stimulus, both the chromatic and achromatic channels are activated. [...] The achromatic channel will have a slightly slowed response time, since it must adjust to the different luminance; however, despite this delayed response, {{the speed of the}} achromatic channel response time will still be faster than the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> of the chromatic channel. In these conditions of summed stimuli, the magnitude of the signal emitted by the achromatic channel will be stronger than of the chromatic channel. [...] The coupling of faster response with higher-amplitude signal from the achromatic channel means that reaction time will most likely depend on the luminance and saturation levels of the stimuli.|$|E

The ability to upregulate cognitive control in motivationally salient situations was examined in individuals with schizophrenia (patients) and healthy controls. Fifty-four patients and 39 healthy controls were recruited. A computerized monetary response conflict task required participants to identity a picture, over which was printed a matching (congruent), neutral, or incongruent word. This baseline condition was followed by an incentive condition, in which participants were given the opportunity to win money on reward-cued trials. These reward-cued trials were interleaved with nonreward cued trials. Reaction times (RT) were examined for both incentive context effects (difference in RT between baseline and nonreward cue trials in the incentive condition) and incentive cue effects (difference in RT between nonreward and reward cue trials in the incentive condition). Compared with baseline, controls showed a <b>speeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> during both the nonreward (incentive context effect) and reward cued (incentive cue effect) trials during the incentive condition, but with a larger incentive context than incentive cue effect, suggesting a reliance on proactive control strategies.

50|$|Studies of {{the effects}} on the visual pathway on split-brained {{patients}} has revealed {{that there is a}} redundancy gain (the ability of target detection to benefit from multiple copies of the target) in simple reaction time. In a simple response to visual stimuli, split-brained patients experience a faster reaction time to bilateral stimuli than predicted by model. A model proposed by Iacoboni et al. suggests split-brained patients experience asynchronous activity that causes a stronger signal, and thus a decreased reaction time. Iacoboni also suggests there exists dual attention in split-brained patients, which is implying that each cerebral hemisphere has its own attentional system. An alternative approach taken by Reuter-Lorenz et al. suggests that enhanced redundancy gain in the split brain is primarily due to a slowing <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> to unilateral stimuli, rather than a <b>speeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> to bilateral ones.
