He received his bachelor's degree but financial problems {{after his father}} became ill prevented him obtaining a master's degree. He returned to Bahrain to find employment. During his college years, he remained independent of political affiliations. According to Rajab, despite lacking {{a clear understanding of}} what constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>norms,</b> he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms of injustice.

25|$|Inhibition {{conflict}} is a cognitive function that arises in people and {{allows them to}} {{make decisions based on}} immediate stimuli and stimuli that require a higher level of processing. In sober individuals, situations that produce an inhibition conflict would consist of one set of salient cues (external stimuli) that stimulate a certain response and other cues (internal stimuli such as possible negative consequences or societal <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> <b>norms)</b> that would inhibit the salient cues and therefore prevent rash action. Those influenced by alcohol myopia are unable to comprehend this second set of cues, as the condition narrows an individual’s ability for higher-level cognitive functioning. Therefore, these individuals tend to act rashly without consideration for the consequences of their actions.|$|E

The development of elastic moduli was monitored in time to 730 days of age with respect to air entrainment and curing conditions.

40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} {{is a form}} of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. Ideally, CSR policy would function as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby business would monitor and ensure its support to law, ethical <b>standards,</b> <b>and</b> international <b>norms.</b> Consequently, business would embrace responsibility for the impact of its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere. One of the principal affairs on corporate {{social responsibility}} is the labour discrimination. The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination. In fact, Women often experience a "glass ceiling" to enter in top management or in management board of companies. On this paper, we report the political events, laws, ethical <b>standards,</b> <b>and</b> international <b>norms</b> (particulary Global Reporting Initiative), that {{in the last five years}} have faced the discrimination of women on Spain and the impact they are having on the Management Board of IBEX- 35 companies...|$|R

30|$|The {{results also}} have {{implications}} for national educational policy as {{we were able to}} show that non-native speakers’ minimum <b>standard</b> <b>and</b> <b>norm</b> <b>standard</b> in NA for EFL actually seem to reflect the skills necessary for success in a globalized English-speaking world. Students who reach the EFL norm standard are very likely to reach at least PISA baseline proficiency. Reaching baseline proficiency means having attained the skills necessary for the effective and productive participation in an English-speaking society. The majority of students who achieve the EFL norm standard even reach PISA norm proficiency, which is a key measure for post-secondary educational academic success in an English-speaking context. If one considers the progressing globalization in terms of education and labor in conjunction with the prominent role that the English language plays in that process, these results are definitely relevant. We can say with some certainty that a student who attains German EFL standards will, later in adulthood, likely be able to participate actively in today’s globalized world.|$|R
