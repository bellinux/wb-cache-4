5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's <b>substitutionary</b> atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was {{attained}} through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, <b>substitutionary</b> atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a {{conservative}} evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} <b>substitutionary</b> atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by {{the vast majority of the}} Protestant churches and their clergy.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} must be {{made between}} penal substitution (Christ punished instead of us) and <b>substitutionary</b> atonement (Christ suffers for us). Both affirm the <b>substitutionary</b> and vicarious nature of the atonement, but penal substitution offers a specific explanation {{as to what the}} suffering is for: punishment.|$|E
25|$|Augustine teaches <b>substitutionary</b> atonement. However, the {{specific}} interpretation differed {{as to what}} this suffering for sinners meant. The early Church Fathers, including Athanasius and Augustine, taught that through Christ's suffering in humanity's place, he overcame and liberated us from death and the devil. Thus while the idea of <b>substitutionary</b> atonement is present in nearly all atonement theories, {{the specific}} idea of satisfaction and penal substitution are later developments in the Latin church.|$|E
25|$|Jesus Christ is both God and man {{who died}} as a <b>substitutionary</b> sacrifice, was resurrected, ascended to heaven, and will return to {{establish}} his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{on the nature}} of Christ's atonement such as the Moral Influence view, originally formulated by Pierre Abélard, can also be seen as opposed to the <b>Substitutionary</b> view.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection {{underpin}} a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place {{on the death of}} Jesus as compared to his words. According to the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a <b>substitutionary</b> view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject <b>substitutionary</b> atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.|$|E
25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{view has}} historically come {{into conflict with}} a penal <b>substitutionary</b> view of atonement, as the two systems propose radically different criteria of salvation and judgment. The moral influence paradigm focuses on the moral change of people, leading to a positive final judgment for which the criteria focuses on inner moral character. By contrast, a penal <b>substitutionary</b> paradigm denies the saving value of human moral change. It focuses on faith in Christ and on his death on our behalf, leading to a positive final judgment based on what Christ has done for us and our trust in that - not on any positive moral qualities that we ourselves possess.|$|E
25|$|The atonement of Christ did not {{consist in}} his {{suffering}} the identical but the equivalent punishment (i.e., one {{which would have}} the same effect in moral government) as that deserved by mankind because of offended law. Christ died for sins, not persons. The benefits of <b>substitutionary</b> atonement are accessible and available to all men for their salvation.|$|E
25|$|Within the Free Grace movement, {{there has}} been {{disagreement}} over the essential content of saving faith. The traditional Free Grace view holds that the content of faith in Jesus Christ that is necessary for eternal salvation includes belief in His person and work, consisting of belief {{in one or more}} of the following: his deity, his humanity, his <b>substitutionary</b> death for sin and his bodily resurrection.|$|E
25|$|Christians {{believe that}} Jesus’ death was {{instrumental}} in restoring humankind to relationship with God. Christians believe that through faith in Jesus’ <b>substitutionary</b> death and triumphant resurrection people are reunited with God and receive new joy and power in this {{life as well as}} eternal life in heaven after the body’s death. Thus the crucifixion of Jesus along with his resurrection restores access to a vibrant experience of God’s presence, love and grace as well as the confidence of eternal life.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Orthodoxy {{represents}} {{the majority of}} Eastern Christianity. The Orthodox trace their bishops back to the apostles through apostolic succession, and continue the ancient Christian practices of veneration of saints, especially Mary the Mother of God as the Theotokos, prayers for the dead, and monasticism. Orthodoxy does not openly promote statuary, {{although it is not}} expressly condemned, instead limiting itself primarily to two-dimensional iconography. Western theological concepts of original sin, <b>substitutionary</b> atonement, predestination, purgatory and particular judgment are generally rejected by traditional Orthodox theologians.|$|E
25|$|It is Trinitarian, believing {{there is}} only one God who exists as three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit who are of one {{individual}} essence, who are co-equal, co-existent and co-eternal. The Son, Jesus Christ, is eternally begotten of the Father, conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus died on the cross as a <b>substitutionary</b> sacrifice to redeem and restore humanity to God. All who believe in him are justified. He rose again and will return to establish his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Richard Baxter {{rejected}} {{the idea of a}} limited atonement in favour of a universal atonement, which drew him into a long debate with Calvinist theologian John Owen. Interpreting the kingdom of God in terms of Christ as Christus Victor and Rector of all men, Baxter explained Christ's death as an act of universal redemption (penal and vicarious, though <b>substitutionary</b> in explication), in virtue of which God has made a new covenant offering pardon and amnesty to the penitent. Repentance and faith, being obedience to this covenant, are the conditions of salvation.|$|E
25|$|Christians believe Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection makes it {{possible}} for believers to attain forgiveness for sin and reconciliation with God through the atonement. Reformed Protestants generally subscribe to a particular view of the atonement called <b>substitutionary</b> atonement, which explains Christ's death as a sacrificial payment for sin. Christ is believed to have died in place of the believer, who is accounted righteous {{as a result of this}} sacrificial payment. Contemporary Reformed theologians such as William Placher and Nancy Duff have criticized this view, claiming it makes God appear abusive or vindictive and sanctions violence by the strong against the weak.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century some Congregational (later Congregational Christian) churches took {{exception}} to {{the beginnings of a}} growth of regional or national authority in bodies outside the local church, such as mission societies, national committees, and state conferences. Some congregations opposed liberalizing influences that appeared to mitigate traditional views of sin and corollary doctrines such as the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement of Jesus. In 1948, some adherents of these two streams of thought (mainly the latter one) started a new fellowship, the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference (CCCC). It was the first major fellowship to organize outside of the mainstream Congregational body since 1825 when the Unitarians formally founded their own body.|$|E
25|$|From the 1870s {{into the}} early 20th century, evangelicals came to feel {{increasingly}} marginalized as ritualism became more common place within the Church of England. As Evangelicalism continued to lose ground to the high-church party, a split became apparent between conservative evangelicals and liberal evangelicals. Liberal evangelicals led by Vernon Storr coalesced into the Anglican Evangelical Group Movement. Their position was outlined in the 1923 collection of essays Liberal Evangelicalism, which argued that Evangelicalism had been discredited and needed {{to move away from}} strict notions of penal <b>substitutionary</b> atonement and scriptural infallibility. Conservatives accused liberal evangelicals of being no different from the older broad church liberals that evangelicals had always opposed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} I {{was part of}} what is now known as the {{emerging}} church and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a mistake.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{by faith}} alone (sola fide) {{states that it}} is by grace through faith alone that Christians receive {{salvation}} and not through any works of their own (see Ephesians 2:8, Romans 3:23). Open Brethren have {{a strong emphasis on}} the concept of salvation. The brethren teach that the consequence of human sin is condemnation to eternal death in hell. Christ's death on the cross paid sin's penalty and his resurrection is evidence that eternal life is available to any who will have it. The only requirements are that each individual willfully repents of sin, accepts the <b>substitutionary</b> payment of his own sin by faith in Christ's death, and declares that Jesus is Lord (see John 3:14–18 and Acts 10:34–43).|$|E
25|$|Christianity {{developed}} {{the belief that}} the story of Isaac's binding was a foreshadowing of the sacrifice of Christ, whose death and resurrection enabled the salvation and atonement for man from its sins, including original sin. There is a tradition that the site of Isaac's binding, Moriah, later became Jerusalem, the city of Jesus's future crucifixion. The beliefs of most Christian denominations hinge upon the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement of the sacrifice of God the Son, which was necessary for salvation in the afterlife. According to Christian doctrine, each individual person on earth must participate in, and/or receive the benefits of, this divine human sacrifice for the atonement of their sins. Early Christian sources explicitly described this event as a sacrificial offering, with Christ in the role of both priest and human sacrifice, although starting with the Enlightenment, some writers, such as John Locke, have disputed the model of Jesus' death as a propitiatory sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|The term Unitarian {{entered the}} English {{language}} via Henry Hedworth, who applied {{it to the}} teachings of Laelio Sozzini and the Polish Socinians. Unitarian churches were formally established in Transylvania and Poland (by the Socinians) {{in the second half}} of the 16th Century. There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see Edict of Torda) under the jurisdiction of John Sigismund, king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the pre-existence of Christ as well as, in many cases, predestination and original sin as put forward by Augustine of Hippo, and the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement of Christ developed by Anselm of Canterbury and John Calvin. There were several different forms of Christology in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became psilanthropism: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.|$|E
25|$|The recent Evangelical theologian John Stott {{argued that}} penal {{substitution}} {{and the moral}} influence view can be harmonized to an extent. Historically the two theories {{were considered to be}} in strong opposition (e.g. Anselm vs Abelard, the Reformers vs Socinianism), so Stott's attempt at harmonization represents a novel approach. Stott's influential work has led many recent Evangelicals to view the moral influence view as an aspect of penal substitution and harmonizable with it. Stott taught that the penal <b>substitutionary</b> view was primarily the correct explanation of the atonement. He regarded the moral influence theory taken alone to be 'untenable'. Yet while rejecting the moral influence view as a whole, Stott believed that some aspects of it (and of the Ransom theory of atonement) could be endorsed by those holding penal substitution. The aspects of the moral influence view he identified as most suitable for harmonisation are its focus on sanctification, and its idea of Christ as a teacher who inspires us. Stott rejected as unharmonizable the teachings of the moral influence theory regarding sin, the cross, and free forgiveness without atonement.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{criticism}} of penal substitution {{raised by the}} moral influence perspective concerns God's forgiveness. The moral influence framework depicts God as concerned about only {{the present and future}} states of people's moral character, and not their past states. God desires people to become more loving. When people truly change, God is no longer concerned with their previous character and thus is willing to freely forgive their previous actions. The moral influence framework thus teaches that God's forgiveness is free and conditional only on repentance (i.e. moral change). This link between repentance and forgiveness is well-attested to in the New Testament. By contrast, moral influence advocates argue that the penal <b>substitutionary</b> theory portrays God as unable or unwilling to forgive wrong actions and requiring that there be full and complete punishment for all past wrongs, regardless of repentance. They often critique this idea on biblical grounds, pointing to numerous biblical instances of forgiveness and verses that appear to teach that forgiveness depends on repentance. Many also argue that penal substitution's depiction of God as demanding full punishment for every crime regardless of repentance is morally reprehensible and does not reflect a loving, forgiving God.|$|E
500|$|Between 1922 and 1936, the PCUSA became {{embroiled in}} the {{so-called}} Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. [...] Tensions had been building {{in the years following}} the Old School-New School reunion of 1869 and the Briggs heresy trial of 1893. In 1909, the conflict was further exacerbated when the Presbytery of New York granted licenses to preach to a group of men who could not affirm the virgin birth of Jesus. The presbytery's action was appealed to the 1910 General Assembly, which then required all ministry candidates to affirm five essential or fundamental tenets of the Christian faith: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, <b>substitutionary</b> atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E
500|$|All {{students}} must sign a [...] "Statement of Faith" [...] before they enroll, affirming belief {{in what the}} college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, {{students are asked to}} acknowledge [...] "Satan exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom Hell, the place of eternal punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity.... Man is by nature sinful and is inherently in need of salvation, which is exclusively found by faith alone in Jesus Christ and His shed blood.... Christ's death provides <b>substitutionary</b> atonement for our sins." [...] The college professes non-denominational Christian beliefs, informed by Evangelical Protestantism.|$|E
2500|$|Seventh-day Adventists {{uphold the}} central doctrines of Protestant Christianity: the Trinity, the incarnation, the virgin birth, the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement, {{justification}} by faith, creation, [...] the second coming, {{the resurrection of}} the dead, and last judgment.|$|E
2500|$|According to evangelical Kenneth Samples, [...] "It {{should also}} be {{mentioned}} that, though small, there was and is a segment in Adventism which {{could be described as}} being theologically liberal" [...] or even [...] "very liberal". He claims it rejects Christ's vicarious <b>substitutionary</b> atonement.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of these conflicts, a strong {{division}} has remained since the Reformation between liberal Protestants (who typically adopt a moral influence view) and conservative Protestants (who typically adopt a penal <b>substitutionary</b> view). Debate between these positions has a tendency to focus on the following main issues: ...|$|E
2500|$|Advocates of {{the moral}} {{influence}} view often point to the strong history of Christian belief in the moral influence view, {{as compared to the}} supposed more recent appearance of the penal <b>substitutionary</b> view. Christian writings from the second, third and fourth centuries AD testify to the universality {{of the moral}} influence view among Christians during the first few centuries AD (see above). By contrast, it is asserted, penal substitution was not taught in the early church. Penal substitution did not emerge until after the 11th century AD. It is therefore argued that the Bible writers were very unlikely to have taught penal substitution. If they had taught penal substitution, it could be expected that their teaching would have been passed on by word of mouth, and that the writings of Christians {{in the second and third}} centuries AD would attest to it. Moral influence advocates also argue that penal <b>substitutionary</b> teaching represents a historical departure from the Christian faith.|$|E
2500|$|In Western Christianity, [...] "sin is lawlessness" [...] (1 John 3:4) and so {{salvation}} {{tends to}} be understood in legal terms, similar to Jewish law. Sin alienates the sinner from God. [...] It has damaged, and completely severed, the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his death on the cross as a sacrifice for mankind's sin (see Salvation and <b>Substitutionary</b> atonement).|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Anglo-Catholics, evangelical Anglicans stress the Reformed, Protestant nature of Anglicanism. Historically, evangelicals {{have come from}} both moderate Calvinist as well as Arminian backgrounds. Evangelicals stress {{the need for a}} conversion experience and the importance of evangelism; they have a high view of biblical inspiration and biblical authority; and the <b>substitutionary</b> atonement of Jesus Christ is the focus of their preaching. Evangelical Anglicans have been particularly fierce critics of ritualism and sacerdotalism.|$|E
2500|$|A Prayer Book for Australia, {{produced}} in 1995, departed {{from both the}} structure and wording of the Book of Common Prayer, prompting conservative reaction. Numerous objections were made and the notably conservative evangelical Diocese of Sydney {{drew attention to the}} loss of BCP wording and of an explicit [...] "biblical doctrine of <b>substitutionary</b> atonement". The Diocese of Sydney has developed its own small prayer book, called Sunday Services, to supplement the existing prayer book and preserve the original theology which the Sydney diocese asserts has been changed.|$|E
2500|$|... "Limited atonement", {{also called}} [...] "particular redemption" [...] or [...] "{{definite}} atonement", asserts that Jesus's <b>substitutionary</b> atonement was definite and certain in its purpose {{and in what}} it accomplished. This implies that only {{the sins of the}} elect were atoned for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited {{in the sense that it}} is intended for some and not all. Some Calvinists have summarized this as [...] "The atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect." ...|$|E
2500|$|This belief {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} from some Christians, who feel this gives Satan {{the status of}} sin-bearer alongside Jesus Christ. Adventists have responded by insisting that Satan is not a saviour, nor does he provide atonement for sin; Christ alone is the <b>substitutionary</b> sacrifice for sin, but holds no responsibility for it. In the final judgment, responsibility for sin is passed back to Satan who first caused mankind to sin. [...] As the responsible party, Satan receives the wages for his sin and the sins of all the saved—namely, death. Thus, the unsaved are held {{responsible for their own}} sin, while the saved are no longer held responsible for theirs.|$|E
2500|$|The church {{believes}} that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the mediator between God the Father and humanity, and {{was created by}} God the Father. God sanctified him to be without sin, and bestowed upon him the titles [...] "Lord" [...] and [...] "Son of God". The church sees Jesus as God's highest creation, and denies the deity of Jesus. Adherents profess Jesus' <b>substitutionary</b> role in the redemption of humankind. He {{is believed to have}} been [...] "foreordained before the foundation of the world" [...] and sent by God [...] "to deal with sin". Members [...] "are saved by Christ's blood" [...] who died because of his [...] "self-sacrificing love".|$|E
