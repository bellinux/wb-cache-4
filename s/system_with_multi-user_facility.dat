40|$|<b>Multi-user</b> <b>facilities</b> {{serve as}} a {{resource}} for many universities. In 2010, a survey was conducted investigating possible changes and successful characteristics of <b>multi-user</b> <b>facilities,</b> as well as identifying problems in facilities. Over 300 surveys were e-mailed to persons identified from university websites as being involved <b>with</b> <b>multi-user</b> <b>facilities.</b> Complete responses were received from 36 facilities with an average of 20 years of operation. Facilities were associated with specific departments (22 %), colleges (22 %), and university research centers (8. 3 %) or were not affiliated with any department or college within the university (47 %). The five most important factors to succeed as a <b>multi-user</b> <b>facility</b> were: 1) maintaining an experienced, professional staff in an open atmosphere; 2) university-level support providing partial funding; 3) broad client base; 4) instrument training programs; and 5) an effective leader and engaged strategic advisory group. The most significant problems were: 1) inadequate university financial support and commitment; 2) problems recovering full service costs from university subsidies and user fees; 3) availability of funds to repair and upgrade equipment; 4) inability to retain highly qualified staff; and 5) unqualified users dirtying/damaging equipment. Further information related to these issues and to fee structure was solicited. Overall, there appeared to be a decline in university support for facilities and more emphasis on securing income by serving clients outside of the institution and by obtaining grants from entities outside of the university...|$|R

50|$|Consider {{a simple}} banking {{application}} where two users {{have access to}} the funds in a particular account. Bob reads the account and finds there is 1000 dollars in it, so he withdraws 500. Jane reads the same account before Bob has changed it, sees 1000 dollars, and withdraws 800. The account should be 300 dollars overdrawn, however, depending on which transaction gets processed first it will contain either 500 or 200 dollars. This poses a serious problem and needless to say, any database <b>system</b> <b>with</b> <b>multi-user</b> access needs some sort of <b>system</b> to deal <b>with</b> these scenarios.|$|R
30|$|In such coded MIMO-OFDM systems, {{the optimal}} way to decode the {{received}} signal {{would be the}} joint detection-decoding that reveals to be very complex and infeasible for practical implementation. An alternative solution is to perform the detection and the decoding steps iteratively with soft information exchanging. Such method, {{commonly referred to as}} iterative or turbo processing, was initially proposed for turbo decoding [2] where two component decoders exchange soft information to improve the system performance. The turbo principle was rapidly extended to the turbo equalization [3], where equalization and channel decoding were performed iteratively to overcome inter-symbol interference (ISI) [4]. Turbo equalization principle was then applied to several transmission systems, such as <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>multi-user</b> interference [5] and multi-antenna interference [6].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the downlink of a 3 GPP UTRAN Long Term Evolution (LTE) <b>system</b> <b>with</b> <b>multi-user</b> (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) support and channel state information (CSI) feedback to a standard MU-MIMO LTE system utilizing channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback only. For the latter case, we propose an efficient method for estimating the appropriate MU-MIMO transmission parameters based on the LTE Release 8 feedback, which is not providing any additional MU-MIMO feedback information. In order to facilitate a fair performance comparison, we spend approximately the same number of feedback bits for both feedback methods and we evaluate which method performs better in the considered scenario for various cases by means of extensive system-level simulations, assuming a low-rate feedback channel. It is shown that significant performance gains may be realized with both proposed feedback methods compared to conventional LTE Release 8 networks without MU-MIMO support. I...|$|R
40|$|One way of {{modelling}} {{the wireless}} channel is in a statistical manner, {{based on a}} few parameters describing {{the characteristics of the}} environment. In most current wireless channel models, these key parameters are assumed independent between separate links, i. e. on the channels modelling the propagation between one base station and several mobile stations, or one mobile station and several base stations. In practice, dependencies between these wireless channels is expected and as a consequence, system performance evaluations based on models with independent links may be inaccurate. Herein, we consider simulations of a system that depend on the spatial nature of the channel. In particular, we study a <b>system</b> <b>with</b> <b>multi-user</b> scheduling using a single carrier. We investigate the impact of angle spread correlations on multi-user diversity gains using opportunistic scheduling. To facilitate this, a novel method of modelling the angle spread correlations for multi-user system simulations is developed. It is shown that in <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> multiple user scheduling, modelling the angle spread autocorrelation is necessary to obtain reliable system performance results, especially as the number of simultaneous scheduled users increases...|$|R

40|$|A single primary user {{cognitive}} radio <b>system</b> <b>with</b> <b>multi-user</b> diversity {{at the secondary}} users is considered where there is an interference constraint between secondary and primary users. The secondary user with the highest instantaneous SNR is selected for communication from a set of active users which also satisfies the interference constraint. The active number of secondary users is shown to be binomial, negative binomial, or Poisson-binomial distributed depending on various modes of operation. Outage probability in the slow fading scenario is also studied. This is then followed by a derivation of the scaling law of the ergodic capacity and BER averaged across the fading, and user distribution for a large mean number of users. The ergodic capacity and average BER under the binomial user distribution is shown to outperform the negative binomial case with the same mean number of users. Moreover, the Poisson distribution is used to approximate the user distribution under the non-i. i. d interference scenario, and compared with binomial and negative binomial distributions in a stochastic ordering sense. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to supplement our analytical results and compare the performances under different user distributions.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the power allocation problem for practically coded interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> iterative <b>multi-user</b> detection (MUD) over multiple access channels (MACs). Both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channels are considered. For AWGN channels, two power allocation methods based on linear programming are discussed and compared with an interior-point method (IPM). These techniques are extended to power allocation over fading channels. Numerical results show that, with power optimization, IDMA can achieve significant performance improvements over TDMA in fading environments.

Our {{goal was to}} design a generic framework combining emergent narrative, where stories emerge from the actions of autonomous intelligent agents, with the social aspects of traditional board games. As a visual representation of the story world, a map is displayed on a multi-touch table. Users can interact with the story by touching an interface on the table surface with their fingers and by moving tangible objects that represent the characters. This type of interface, where multiple users are gathered around a table with equal access to the characters and the story world, offers a more social setting for interaction than most existing interfaces for AI-based interactive storytelling. ...|$|R

40|$|Timing-related defects {{are among}} the most {{difficult}} types of defects to catch while testing software. They are by definition difficult to reproduce and hence they are difficult to debug. Not all components of a software system have timing-related defects. For example, either a parser can analyze an input or it cannot. However, systems that have concurrent threads such as database systems are prone to timing-related defects. As a result, software developers must tailor testing to exploit vulnerabilities that occur because of threading.
