2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term blitzkrieg is obscure. It was never used {{in the title of}} a {{military}} doctrine or handbook of the German army or air force, and no [...] "coherent doctrine" [...] or [...] "unifying concept of blitzkrieg" [...] existed. The term seems rarely to have been used in the German military press before 1939 and recent research at the German Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt at Potsdam found it in only two military articles from the 1930s. Both used the term to mean a swift strategic knock-out, rather than a radical new military doctrine or approach to war. The first article (1935) deals primarily with supplies of food and materiel in wartime. The term blitzkrieg is used with reference to German efforts to win a quick victory in the First World War but is not {{associated with the use of}} armoured, mechanised or air forces. It argued that Germany must develop <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>food,</b> because it might again prove impossible to deal a swift knock-out to its enemies, leading to a long war. In the second article (1938), launching a swift strategic knock-out is described as an attractive idea for Germany but difficult to achieve on land under modern conditions (especially against systems of fortification like the Maginot Line), unless an exceptionally high degree of surprise could be achieved. The author vaguely suggests that a massive strategic air attack might hold out better prospects but the topic is not explored in detail. A third relatively early use of the term in German occurs in Die Deutsche Kriegsstärke (German War Strength) by Fritz Sternberg, a Jewish, Marxist, political economist and refugee from the Third Reich, published in 1938 in Paris and in London as Germany and a Lightning War. Sternberg wrote that Germany was not prepared economically for a long war but might win a quick war ("Blitzkrieg") [...] He did not go into detail about tactics or suggest that the German armed forces had evolved a radically new operational method. His book offers scant clues as to how German lightning victories might be won.|$|E

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is defined as}} “the access for all people at all times to enough food for a health, active life” (FAO, 1996). <b>In</b> contrast, <b>food</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is defined as being able to meet consumption needs (particularly for staple food crops) from own production rather than by buying or importing. There is a long-standing debate on whether food self-sufficiency is a useful strategy to achieve food security. Supporters of this proposition argue that relying {{on the market for}} to meet food needs is a risky strategy because of volatility <b>in</b> <b>food</b> prices and possible interruption in supplies. The opposing view is that it is costly for a household (or country) to focus on food self-sufficiency rather than producing according to its comparative advantage and purchasing some of its food requirements from the market.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of this work}} is determined, on the one hand, by tightening of the foreign political situation and its possible {{negative impact on the}} food security of the country, and, on the other hand, by the crisis of the domestic agricultural sector. These factors demand the development of new approaches to regional agroindustrial complex (AIC) management. The aim is to develop a methodology for assessing the level of <b>food</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> main <b>food</b> areas of the Volgograd region. The author used the results of the statistical materials of AIC of the Volgograd region for 2016. The analytical methods included mathematical analysis and comparison. The main results are as follows. Based on the analysis of the current situation to ensure food security of Russia it was proved that at the present time it is necessary to develop effective indicators showing the level of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> basic <b>food</b> regions. It was also revealed that at the moment this indicator in the system of regional agrarian and industrial complex is not controlled. As a result of generalization of existing approaches the author’s method of rating the level of self-sufficiency of regions was offered. Its testing was carried out in several districts of the Volgograd region. The proposed authoring method of rating estimation of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> basic foodstuffs can be used in the regional agroindustrial complex management system at the federal and local levels. It can be used to rank areas in terms of their <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>in</b> basic foodstuffs. This allows us to focus on the development of backward areas of agro-food and make appropriate management decisions. The final rating value - 0. 759 obtained by the results of analysis of the situation in the Volgograd region means that the situation in matters of selfsufficiency in basic foodstuffs in general is good. However, we should aim at the maximum possible value of the rating - 1. In the application of the proposed methodology for the assessment of the situation in various regions of the country it is possible to compare and evaluate the situation with the development of appropriate management decisions...|$|R

In the cities a good share of water is lost from the water-supply network, and supply failures often occur because public water utilities, which are often poorly managed, are {{at the end of their}} financial tether. Many residents of urban slums are not connected to the water-supply network and are thus forced to pay prices to water vendors that are far higher than the subsidized drinking-water tariffs.

40|$|This paper reviews {{relevant}} {{literature on}} the sustainability indicators theoretically proposed and practically applied by scholars over the past 15 years. Although {{progress is being made}} in the development and critical analysis of sustainability indicators, in many cases existing or proposed indicators are not the most sensitive or useful measures in developing countries. Indicator selection needs to meet the following criteria: relative availability of data representing the indicators, sensitivity to stresses on the system, existence of threshold values and guidelines, predictivity, integratability and known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time. Based on these criteria, this paper proposes a set of operational indicators for measuring agricultural sustainability in developing countries. These indicators include ecological indicators involving amounts of fertilizers and pesticides used, irrigation water used, soil nutrient content, depth to the groundwater table, water use efficiency, quality of groundwater for irrigation, and nitrate content of both groundwater and crops. Economic indicators include crop productivity, net farm income, benefit-cost ratio of production, and per capita food grain production. Social indicators encompass <b>food</b> <b>self-sufficiency,</b> equality <b>in</b> <b>food</b> and income distribution among farmers, access to resources and support services, and farmers' knowledge and awareness of resource conservation.
