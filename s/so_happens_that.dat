It just <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E

Madonna delivers the melody like a playground nursery rhyme, chanting about bad behavior in a butter-wouldn't-melt sing-song voice." ...|$|E

Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left {{up to me to}} put all the pieces together and make it so that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It just <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E

After this success, Caymmi began to focus more on making music, and he wrote songs that appeared in other Brazilian films. In late 1939, he signed with Odeon Records and recorded his first three singles, [...] "Rainha do Mar/Promessa de Pescador" [...] ("Queen of the Sea/Promise of the Fisherman"), [...] "Roda Pião" [...] ("Top Wheel"), and [...] "O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?/A Preta do Acarajé" [...] ("What Is It About Bahian Women?/The Dark Woman from Acarajé")."] (in Portuguese).

He recorded [...] "Samba da Minha Terra" [...] ("Samba of My Homeland") in 1940 and [...] "A Jangada Voltou Só" [...] ("The Raft Returned Alone") in the following year. In 1944, he performed his own [...] "Acontece Que Eu Sou Baiano" [...] ("It Just <b>So</b> <b>Happens</b> <b>That</b> I'm Bahian") in the movie Abacaxi Azul (Blue Pineapple). In the late 1940s, {{he was a member of}} the samba-canção movement largely founded by his sometime creative rival, composer Ary Barroso. Other prominent Brazilian musicians of the day covered several of his songs, including Dick Farney, who famously recorded Caymmi's [...] "Marina" [...] (1944) in 1947.

2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
