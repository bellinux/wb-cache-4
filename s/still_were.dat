5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's penal system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, {{with much of}} the blame placed on the comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders <b>still</b> <b>were</b> not separated from older ones, that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were not paid for the work they did.|$|E
5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who <b>still</b> <b>were</b> encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E
50|$|In a new {{rejuvenation}} in 1958, two Lomond <b>stills</b> <b>were</b> installed, {{alongside the}} existing stills.

Production continued up until 1981 when the experiment with Lomond <b>stills</b> <b>was</b> abandoned, and the <b>stills</b> <b>were</b> replaced with regular stills.|$|R

5|$|The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944, under section10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939. However, {{the highway}} was mostly {{a series of}} tracks through remote {{pastoral}} areas, with the sealed road ending just past the Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or worse <b>still,</b> <b>were</b> completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|Franck's first paper there, co-authored with Edward Teller, was on {{photochemical}} processes in crystals. Hans Gaffron became his collaborator.

Both his daughters and their families moved to the United States, {{and he was also}} able to bring out his elderly mother and aunt. He became a naturalised United States citizen on 21 July 1941, so he was not an enemy alien when the United States declared war on Germany on 11 December 1941. His daughters <b>still</b> <b>were,</b> though, so they were restricted from travelling, and could not take care of their mother when she fell ill and died on 10 January 1942, although they were permitted to attend her funeral.|$|E
5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there <b>still</b> <b>were</b> several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, <b>still</b> <b>were</b> present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E
