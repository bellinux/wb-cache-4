40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there are}} two market models for {{valuation}} and risk management of interest rate derivatives, the LIBOR and swap market models. In this paper, we introduce arbitrage-free constant maturity swap (CMS) market models and generic market models featuring forward rates that span periods other than the classical LIBOR and swap periods. We develop generic expressions for the drift terms occurring in the stochastic differential equation driving the forward rates under a single pricing measure. The generic market model is particularly apt for pricing of Bermudan CMS swaptions, fixed-maturity Bermudan swaptions, and callable hybrid <b>coupon</b> <b>swaps.</b> Key words: market model, generic market models, generic drift terms, hybrid products, BGM mode...|$|R

We show that if short term debt limits the expropriation of debtholders, it also implies a lower leverage, which prevents the firm from increasing tax shields.

5000|$|A modern {{variation}} on the traditional penpal arrangement {{is to have a}} keypal / epal and exchange email addresses as well as or instead of paper letters. This has the advantage of saving money and being more immediate, allowing many messages to be exchanged {{in a short period of}} time. The disadvantage is that the communication can be very ephemeral if the email messages are not routinely saved. Many people prefer to receive paper letters, gaining the satisfaction of seeing their name carefully printed on a thick envelope in the letterbox. Using postal mail, it is possible to trade <b>coupons,</b> <b>swap</b> slips, postcards, stamps and anything else light and flat enough to fit inside an envelope, often called [...] "tuck-ins".

40|$|International audienceConstant Proportion Debt Obligations (CPDOs) are {{structured}} credit derivatives that generate high coupon payments by dynamically leveraging {{a position in}} an underlying portfolio of investment-grade index default <b>swaps.</b> CPDO <b>coupons</b> and principal notes received high initial credit ratings from the major rating agencies, based on complex models for the joint transition of ratings and spreads for all names in the underlying portfolio. We propose a parsimonious model for analysing the performance of CPDO strategies using a top-down approach that captures the essential risk factors of the CPDO. Our approach allows us to compute default probabilities, loss distributions and other tail risk measures for the CPDO strategy and analyse the dependence of these risk measures on various parameters describing the risk factors. We find that the probability of the CPDO defaulting on its coupon payments can be made arbitrarily small [...] and thus the credit rating arbitrarily high [...] by increasing leverage, but the ratings obtained strongly depend on assumptions on the credit environment (high spread or low spread). More importantly, CPDO loss distributions are found to exhibit {{a wide range of}} tail risk measures inside a given rating category, suggesting that credit ratings are insufficient performance indicators for such complex leveraged strategies. A worst-case scenario analysis indicates that CPDO strategies have a high exposure to persistent spread-widening scenarios and that CPDO ratings are shown to be quite unstable during the lifetime of the strategy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnder the {{foundation}} of Duffie & Huang (1996) [7], this paper integrates the reduced form model and the structure model for a default risk measure, giving rise to a new pricing model of interest rate swap with a bilateral default risk. This model avoids the shortcomings of ignoring the dynamic movements of the firm’s assets of the reduced form model but adds only a little complexity and simplifies the pricing formula significantly when compared with Li (1998) [10]. With {{the help of the}} Crank–Nicholson difference method, we give the numerical solutions of the new model to study the default risk effects on the swap rate. We find that for a one year interest rate <b>swap</b> with the <b>coupon</b> paid per quarter, the variance of the default fixed rate payer decreases from 0. 1 to 0. 01 only causing about a 1. 35 %’s increase in the swap rate. This is consistent with previous results...|$|R
40|$|Duffee and Stanton (2012) {{demonstrated}} some pointed {{problems in}} estimating affine term structure models {{when the price}} of risk is dynamic, that is, risk factor dependent. The risk neutral parameters are estimated with precision, while the price of risk parameters are not. For the Gaussian models they investigated, these problems are replicated and are shown to stem from a lack of curvature in the log-likelihood function. This geometric issue for identifying the maximum of an essentially horizontal log-likelihood has statistical meaning. The Fisher information for the price of risk parameters is multiple orders of magnitude smaller than that of the risk neutral parameters. Prompted by the recent results of Christoffersen et al. (2014) a remedy to the lack of curvature is attempted. An unscented Kalman filter is used to estimate models where the observations are portfolios of FRAs, <b>Swaps</b> and Zero <b>Coupon</b> Bond Options. While the unscented Kalman filter performs admirably in identifying the unobserved risk factor processes, there is little improvement in the Fisher information...|$|R
40|$|The various macro {{econometrics}} {{models for}} inflation are helpless {{when it comes}} to the pricing of inflation derivatives. The only article targeting inflation option pricing, the Jarrow Yildirim model (2000), relies on non observable data. This makes the estimation of the model parameters a non trivial problem. In addition, their framework does not examine any relationship between the most liquid inflation derivatives instruments : the year to year and zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap.</b> To fill this gap, we see how to derive a model on inflation, based on traded and liquid market instrument. Applying the same strategy as the one for a market model on interest rates, we derive no-arbitrage relationship between zero coupon and year to year swaps. We explain how to compute the convexity adjustment and what relationship the volatility surface should satisfy. Within this framework, it becomes much easier to estimate model parameters and to price inflation derivatives in a consistent way.

50|$|A Zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> (ZCS) is a {{derivative}} contract made between two parties with terms defining two 'legs' upon which each party either makes or receives payments. One leg {{is the traditional}} fixed leg, whose cashflows are determined at the outset, usually defined by an agreed fixed rate of interest. A second leg is the traditional floating leg, whose payments at the outset are forecast but subject to change and dependent upon future publication of the interest rate index upon which the leg is benchmarked. This is same description as with the more common interest rate swap (IRS). A ZCS differs from an IRS in one major respect; timings of scheduled payments. A ZCS {{takes its name from}} a zero coupon bond which has no interim coupon payments and only a single payment at maturity. A ZCS, unlike an IRS, also only has a single payment date on each leg at the maturity of the trade. The calculation methodology for determing payments is, as a result, slightly more complicated than for IRSs.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{inflation}} theory, focussing {{on the model}} of Jarrow & Yildirim, which is nowadays used when pricing inflation derivatives. After recalling main results about short and forward interest rate models, the dynamics of the main components of the market are derived. Then the most important inflation-indexed derivatives are explained (zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap,</b> year-on-year, cap and floor), and their pricing proceeding is shown step by step. Calibration is explained and performed with a common method and an heuristic and non standard one. The model is enriched with credit risk, too, which allows {{to take into account the}} possibility of bankrupt of the counterparty of a contract. In this context, the general method of pricing is derived, with the introduction of defaultable zero-coupon bonds, and the Monte Carlo method is treated in detailed and used to price a concrete example of contract.

40|$|This thesis studies a multi-factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton {{model and}} a LIBOR mar- ket model on the Norwegian, European and US {{interest}} rate market. The main concerns are the low-rate environment {{and exposure to}} negative interest rates in these models. We begin by introducing financial markets and the mathematical models explaining them. Further we discuss {{the problem with the}} current low-rate environment and the historical market practice. The focuses are implementations of two multi-factor interest rate models and the presence of negative interest rates. The historical data is provided by DNB and consists of zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> rates for several maturities in the period 2000 - 2012. The volatility factors are derived from historical data using principal component analysis and covariance matrices. With today?s yield curve the probability of negative rates is highly significant in the HJM model, whereas it is zero in LMM because of lognormality. Monte Carlo is used on the models to compare prices of caps and floors. We show that the models do not produce the same price especially around strikes near the current 3 -month rates. Further we price long butterfly spreads to show the absence of arbitrage in both models...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to model bank spread {{behavior}} under capital regulation and deposit insurance. Comparative static results show that an increase in the capital-to-deposits ratio or the deposit insurance decreases the bank's interest margin or spread. It is also shown that an increase in the equity that implies its opportunity cost of the coupon rate on the fixed leg decreases the margin. Previous research on market-based evaluations of bank equity has modeled the bank as a narrowing banking firm with risky assets and insured liabilities. The equity of the bank is viewed as a call option on its risky assets. No attempt was made to explicitly analyze a synergy between lending and deposit-taking, and, in our view, the equity of the bank is viewed as a <b>swap</b> option on <b>coupon</b> bonds. Synergy banking, particularly in the return to retail banking, is important in distinguishing banks from other lenders such as finance companies and mutual fund institutions. These other lenders call for the breaking up of banks into separate lending and deposit-taking operations, respectively. Our findings provide an insight for synergy banking operations concerning regulated bank spread behavior in the return to retail banking.
