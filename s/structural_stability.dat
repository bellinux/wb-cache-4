40|$|The <b>structural</b> <b>stabilities</b> of bulk Si, Ge, and GaAs are {{discussed}} {{based on the}} total energy evaluated by the summation of the band structure energy and the short-range repulsive potential between ions.

The short-range-force is assumed to be of the exponential form and parameters are determined so as to reproduce an experimental value of bulk modulus. This treatment qualitatively well describes structural properties in spite of the simple computational procedure and roughly gives the known variation of the total energy for a uniaxial strain.

5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the <b>structural</b> <b>stability</b> of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

Determinants of VPg uridylylation efficiency suggest formation and/or collapse or release of the uridylylated product as the rate-limiting step in vitro depending upon the VPg donor employed. Precursor proteins also have an effect on VPg-CRE specificity and stability. The upper RNA stem loop, to which VPg binds, has a significant impact on both retention, and recruitment, of VPg and Pol. The stem loop of CRE will partially unwind, allowing the precursor components to bind and recruit VPg and Pol4. The CRE loop has a defined consensus sequence to which the initiation components bind, however; there is no consensus sequence for the supporting stem, which suggests that only the <b>structural</b> <b>stability</b> of the CRE is important.|$|E
25|$|If the two {{terminal}} repeats in a solenoid do {{not physically}} interact, {{it leads to}} an open or linear structure. Members of this group are frequently rod- or crescent-shaped. The number of individual repeats can range from 2 to over 50. A clear advantage of this topology is that both the N- and C-terminal ends are free to add new repeats and folds, or even remove existing ones during evolution without any gross impact on the <b>structural</b> <b>stability</b> of the entire domain. This type of domain is extremely common among extracellular segments of receptors or cell adhesion molecules. A non-exhaustive list of examples include: EGF repeats, cadherin repeats, leucine-rich repeats, HEAT repeats, ankyrin repeats, armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, etc. Whenever a linear solenoid domain structure participates in protein-protein interactions, frequently at least 3 or more repetitive subunits form the ligand-binding sites.
