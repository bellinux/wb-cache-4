40|$|<b>Sports</b> and <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> {{development}} have improved rapidly {{over the past}} years in Malaysia. However, such improvements are inadequate compared to the overall development of sports at international level. Through preliminary interview with the managers, it was learnt that the <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> are underutilised and people do not use them. In addition, an increase in the amount of public money being spent on the <b>sports</b> <b>facilities,</b> as well as {{the increase in the number}} of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities,</b> necessitates the demand to investigate issues surrounding <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> development. Universally, there is a current <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> development boom. Recent developments are providing new roles for <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in urban areas. However, it is accompanied by changing the cities strategies for large scale development. Although there are many research findings, there are still on-going debates on how to effectively use public money for <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> development. Through reviewing the current literature, it can be concluded that the impacts of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> and the ability to affect urban surrounding areas depend on a wide range of factors, including location, context, and usage of the facilities, as well as the culture of sports among people. The aim of this paper is through reviewing the current literature on <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> worldwide to identify the gap and address issues on the development of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in Malaysia. The paper argues that simultaneously with the current interest on <b>sports</b> and <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> development in Malaysia, there is a need for a new perspective and a new approach for <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> development in the future...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: One {{major issue}} on <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> {{construction}} {{is the question}} of their funding and justification for investment. Due to, requirement of huge money for construction, constant maintenance costs and ancillary needs, which are almost certainly with substantial public investment, therefore, <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> have been considered. Further, <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> construction boom have been started for more than two decades. Approach: Recent <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> construction was not primary aimed at getting the local community involved in sports, but was instead aimed at spur urban development, changing the image and economic redevelopment. However, there were facilities developed for hosting mega-events. <b>Sports</b> <b>facilities</b> had a wide range of impacts on their surrounding and wider city. Results: How and to what extend <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> construction were lead to urban generation were discussed in this study. Conclusion/Recommendations: Sport was getting more and more influential and it will continue to grow in importance as the world develops into global village. Cities cannot avoid investment in sports. However, there were growing demands for <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> development both for hosting and smaller scale facilities. Further development will take place in several considerations, with enhancing the ability of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> as urban generation tools...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{geographical}} distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands and evaluates the supply and proximity of such facilities {{in relation to}} area level deprivation and urbanity. In today?s context of financial austerity, many municipalities must critically assess their spending on sport provision. Most government funding to sports goes to construction and maintenance of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities,</b> so there is an increasing need for information and indicators by which to gauge the adequacy of such facilities. The current study draws on sports place theory and the deprivation amplification model to examine the presence, variety and proximity of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands {{as a whole and}} according to area level deprivation and urbanity. Data were provided by the <b>Sport</b> <b>Facility</b> Monitor, a national dataset offering geographical information on (nearly) all <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands. These data were linked with population statistics from Statistics Netherlands to allow spatial analyses. Our results indicate that by assessing the distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in a structured way, relevant information can be obtained for <b>sport</b> <b>facility</b> planning and <b>sport</b> participation policy. Furthermore, our results show that certain standard <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> are fairly evenly distributed throughout the Netherlands, irrespective of the local population size. For more specialised facilities, however, higher population thresholds appear to be required. We conclude that, even though there are inequalities in the distribution of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities,</b> the Netherlands overall provides a sufficiently dense sport infrastructure with various types of facilities offered in close proximity to most inhabitants...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there is}} {{tremendous}} interest in sport in Malaysia, although sport {{has only been}} considered as an industry {{in the last ten}} years. <b>Sports</b> <b>facilities</b> have improved rapidly, especially after the country hosted the 16 Commonwealth Games in 1998. Internationally, <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> are viewed as playing a new role in cities as catalysts for urban development or to regenerate decaying area of the cities. Such a role also provides better justification for public investment, since the provision of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> requires huge amounts of money for construction, ancillary needs and maintenance. The increase in the amount of public money being spent on <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in Malaysia and the proliferation of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in the country necessitate an investigation into the wider issue of potential benefits related to the development of <b>sports</b> <b>facilities.</b> The aim of this research was to study some existing <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in Malaysia and to examine the physical, economic and social impacts they have had on their surrounding areas. The research began with an overview of the main <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> at state level in Malaysia before focusing on selected <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; namely, the Bukit Jalil National Sports Complex and four selected facilities developed by Kuala Lumpur City Hall, one {{in each of the four}} management zones in the city.

40|$|Given that {{multiple}} regions {{have their own}} development speeds {{of supply and demand}} for public <b>sports</b> <b>facilities,</b> a dynamic supply and demand control model of multiple regional public <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> is built in this paper. With the range of residents' income increases and the public <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> supply investment as the control variables, we established a unified construction controlling means by using the Linear Matrix Inequality approach derived from Lyapunov stability theory. As such, this means guarantees that the systems of public <b>sports</b> <b>facilities</b> in multiple regions with various developments are asymptotically stable; meanwhile, it can lower the difficulty of the control. </p...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades the {{understanding}} of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> in North America and Europe has changed from governmental responsibility to capital requirement of a private business. This mind-shift has resulted in an increased private share in financing and public-private partnerships in stadium ownership and operation. As professional sport teams are the primary users of <b>sport</b> <b>facilities,</b> a user contribution to the financing is an evident suggestion. Additionally, sport clubs are faced with a variety of real estate decisions. Any corporate real estate decision, however, has to be aligned with the overall business strategy. This strategy alignment is even more mandatory for <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> that differ significantly from other commercial real estate types e. g. in terms of tradability, utilization and risk.

40|$|Title: Sport as a Public Service: Equity and Efficiency of Local <b>Sport</b> <b>Facilities</b> In the Czech Republic, clubs {{traditionally}} {{played a}} key role in providing <b>sport</b> <b>facilities.</b> In recent years, the role of local authorities in sport has strengthened.

The thesis analyzes and evaluates current modes of provision of public <b>sport</b> <b>facilities</b> as the consequence of these changes.
