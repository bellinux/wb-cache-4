25|$|In 2008, Harley {{added the}} {{anti-lock}} braking system as a factory installed option on all VRSC models. Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from , which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded with a 43mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders {{having a}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The rear shock {{is also a}} Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The swingarm is similar in design to the old one, but was strengthened. Front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch.</b> The final drive ratio was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.|$|E
25|$|The Ninja 300 {{is based}} on the Ninja 250R, a {{lightweight}} and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades. Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R. The Ninja 300 also has a LED tail lamp, 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional ABS.By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> with an assist mechanism that decreases clutch lever effort. Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable ergonomics (such as windscreen effectively protecting from wind blast) which promotes commuting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Slipper</b> <b>clutches</b> {{have been}} used in most high {{displacement}} four stroke road racing motorcycles since the early 1990s, having been introduced on the Honda NR500 in the early eighties in 500GP. <b>Slipper</b> <b>clutches</b> are now fitted to many current sport bikes.|$|R
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. <b>Slipper</b> <b>clutches</b> eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. <b>Slipper</b> <b>clutches</b> can also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|R
50|$|On {{motorcycles}} {{the clutch}} is {{operated by a}} hand lever on the left handlebar. No pressure on the lever means that the clutch plates are engaged (driving), while pulling the lever back towards the rider disengages the clutch plates through cable or hydraulic actuation, allowing the rider to shift gears or coast. Racing motorcycles often use <b>slipper</b> <b>clutches</b> to eliminate the effects of engine braking, which, being applied only to the rear wheel, can cause instability.|$|R
50|$|The Mille {{featured}} {{a type of}} <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> which worked by using a vacuum on a closed throttle from the inlet manifold to give the effect of <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> but only on a closed throttle.|$|E
5000|$|Differential-equipped {{transmission}} with adjustable <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{incorrect}} downshifting technique, producing excessive {{engine braking}} (even if the motorcycle has a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch).</b>|$|E
50|$|The gearbox {{differed}} {{little from}} the RC30’s; in fact, it {{even had the}} same gear ratios with only the primary and secondary ratios changed. The one-way sprag clutch was also carried over from the RC30 but was of NR750 design. This sprag clutch was a forerunner to today’s <b>slipper</b> <b>clutches</b> affording a slight amount of slip on overrun {{in the attempt to}} stop the back wheel from locking. The clutch plates were also from the NR750 and were much larger in diameter compared to the ones used in the RC30. The first gear was so tall that the increase in clutch plate diameter improved their longevity. All gears in the RC45’s gearbox were undercut to reduce the chance of a gear disengaging.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Regnart (1759-1844) was an English sculptor, specialising in funerary monuments. His {{masterpiece}} {{is said to}} be the 17th century-style recumbent {{figure of}} George Rush in the parish church in Farthinghoe. The figure shows Rush in old age, lying with his <b>slippers</b> on, <b>clutching</b> a Bible and staring to heaven. Regnart flourished from 1790 until 1830.His style has been described as [...] "pseudo-Classical" [...] and is typified by much folded drapery and an overall pattern of white (usually a draped funerary urn or casket) against a black background.|$|R
50|$|For 2017 Yamaha {{has updated}} the MT-09 with fully {{adjustable}} suspension, traction control, ABS, <b>Slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> LED lights and new styling.|$|E
5000|$|Suzuki {{introduced}} an all-new GSX-R600. Underslung exhaust and <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> introduced.Motor {{is a completely}} new, but with the same bore and stroke as before.|$|E
5000|$|Slipper {{clutches}} {{have also}} been used {{to a lesser extent}} on automobiles, primarily those powered by motorcycle engines. They can also be found on racing remote control cars. Some experimental aircraft use a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> to control torsional resonance in the drive train and protect the engine from shock {{in the event of a}} propeller strike. A <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> for an automobile was patented with a French priority date of 1953 to J.Maurice et al. [...] The principle of this slipper is identical to that used in modern motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|Both the {{original}} Concours and the Concour 14 have a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> that lets {{the rear wheel}} freewheel to lessen the risk of sliding when the rider uses excessive engine braking.|$|E
5000|$|Buggy/MB-010 (The {{precision}} chassis {{features a}} shaft driven 4WD with a two-differential drive train incorporating a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> to protect gears with oil shocks on the 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension) ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> (also {{known as}} a back-torque limiter) is a {{specialised}} clutch with an integrated freewheel mechanism, developed for performance oriented motorcycles to mitigate the effects of engine braking when riders decelerate.|$|E
50|$|By {{comparison}} with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller 17 L fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> with an assist mechanism that decreases clutch lever effort.|$|E
50|$|Adventure and Super Adventure {{bikes are}} powered by {{two-cylinder}} four-stroke motors (LC8) with a 75 degree cylinder and feature a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> electronically controlled riding modes (sport, street and rain) and a twin (analog plus LCD) display.|$|E
50|$|A multi-plate wet <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> {{transfers}} {{power to}} a six-speed, close-ratio transmission ideal for closed-course competition. The back-torque limiter automatically disengages the clutch (partially) under hard downshifting at high engine speeds to prevent rear wheel hop during corner entry.|$|E
5000|$|The CBX750P {{is based}} on a Japanese CB750SC [...] "Horizon". Which is like a CB750SC/CB700SC Nighthawk S, but with an 18inch front wheel.Unlike the Honda CB700SC, CBX750P uses a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> (back-torque limiter) and {{diaphragm}} spring to engage clutch.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Harley {{added the}} {{anti-lock}} braking system as a factory installed option on all VRSC models. Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from , which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|This {{new version}} has {{undergone}} changes {{as compared to}} the previous version in the cases of the updated bodywork and engine, now features VVA technology, assist and <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> hazard lamp, inverted front suspension fork, all-LED lighting system, full LCD panelmeter with shift indicator, and wider tyres.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} the [...] "Desmodue", a 90° L-twin, [...] {{air-cooled}} engine with desmodromic valve actuation. A <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> prevents locking {{of the rear}} wheel through clumsy down-shifting. Although Ducatis often use a dry clutch, this model has a 21-plate oil-bath [...] "wet clutch" [...] which weighs less, gives quieter operation, and needs less maintenance.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} improve {{stability}} under deceleration, a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> was added, with a center-cam-assist mechanism. The Honda Electronic Steering Damper was revised as well. Another significant change was the exhaust system, which {{was no longer a}} center-up underseat design. The new exhaust was a side-slung design in order to increase mass centralization and compactness while mimicking a MotoGP-style.|$|E
5000|$|MotoCzysz is an American {{motorcycle}} {{company based}} in Portland, Oregon that intended to compete in MotoGP. [...] The C1 prototype engine was designed with perfect balance not needing a balance shaft. Some of the patented innovations included a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> with twin clutches, and a unique front suspension. The business also developed a successful electric racing motorcycle, the E1pc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and clutch plates. In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|E
50|$|The CB1100 is styled as a Universal Japanese Motorcycle. The model {{underwent}} a revision in 2014, gaining a sixth gear and new gauge cluster. Honda also released the CB1100 Deluxe, an upgraded variant {{on the standard}} CB1100. The 2017 model was updated with front and back LED lights, a new lighter exhaust, a fuel tank curvier made of pressed aluminum, {{and the addition of}} a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first KTM street bike was the Duke 620 in 1994. Supermoto - KTM was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} to offer a competition-ready supermoto bike to the public. However, the company has stopped supermoto production in 2016, selling only stock 690 SMC R machines. The 141 kg light 690 SMC R model has a 48 kW liquid-cooled one-cylinder four-stroke motor (LC4) and a hydraulically actuated APTC <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 2013 {{triple motor}} is more compact {{and a little}} more powerful. The bike has a smaller, lighter and {{narrower}} frame. It has a bigger airbox, new swingarm, <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> and lighter wheels. Other changes include a fuel gauge and a side mounted exhaust instead of the underseat setup from previous models, rear brembo brakes on the Standard 675. ABS is an option on the standard bike.|$|E
50|$|Both models {{feature a}} <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> to reduce wheel spin during hard engine braking and a shaft drive system to {{transmit}} {{power to the}} rear wheel. The shaft drive system is bolted to the frame on a swinging pivot mount. Engineers developed a two part shaft connected by a spline which allows system to flex under load mimicking the feel and performance benefits of a traditional chain drive.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 Kyosho {{announced}} a re released version of Scorpion, beefed up and refined where needed {{so it can}} be outfitted with modern gear such as Lipo and brushless motor. Modern highlights include a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> 48-pitch geartrain, compatibility with the Ultima RB’s ball diff (as an upgrade from the supplied gear diff), and wide-track front suspension. The shocks are also improved, with the smooth action expected of modern oil-filled units.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 June 2008, Yamaha officially {{released}} a completely redesigned 2009 VMAX in North America and Europe. The {{features of the}} VMAX include an all-aluminium frame with its [...] liquid-cooled 65° V4 DOHC engine used as a stressed member of the chassis, an electroluminescent instrument readout, Yamaha Chip Controlled Intake (YCC-I), fully adjustable suspension, anti-lock brakes, <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch,</b> a fuel tank beneath the seat, and a distinctive key.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 the VRSCAW V-Rod's Revolution was {{increased}} from 1,131 cc to , producing a claimed [...] @ 7,000 rpm, and peak power of [...] at the crankshaft, a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> was also added, as was an {{anti-lock braking system}} option. For the 2009 model year the VRSCAW replaced the VRSCD, which was dropped from the line, as the [...] "base model" [...] for the VRSC family, and the suggested retail price was reduced.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 the VRSCD Night Rod's Revolution was {{increased}} from , producing a claimed [...] @ 7,000 rpm, and peak power of [...] at the crank, a <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> was also added, as was an ABS option. For the 2008 model year, the VRSCD {{was the only}} remaining VRSC model to still have a 180 mm rear tire or mid-pegs. 2008 was also {{the final year of}} production for the VRSCD Night Rod.|$|E
5000|$|As such, the 748R has a larger, two-part airbox {{and thus}} the frame was also {{different}} {{in order to accommodate}} this. The suspension choice was Ohlins for both the rear shock and front forks, although the very first models in 2000 used Showa titanium nitride (TiN) front forks and a Showa shock absorber. The engine included a very basic <b>slipper</b> <b>clutch</b> to ensure that this would then be homologated for use in racing, as well as an oil cooler.|$|E
