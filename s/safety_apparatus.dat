50|$|Having {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} a talented Russian pilot Lev Matsivich and been shocked by it, he became obsessed with the idea of constructing a parachute, to which he devoted several years of his life as well as all his personal savings. In 1911 he applied for a patent to the Committee on Inventions in France and was granted the patent under the number 438612, in which he summarized the function of his parachute:The working principle of the apparatus is as follows: in case of an emergency, a pilot, wearing it on his back, could throw himself out of an aircraft, opening a knapsack by pulling a cord attached to its lock. In case of an unexpected fall the device can work quite automatically. For that purpose the lock of the parapack is connected with a carriage of an aircraft by means of a cord which would open the lock of a parapack being stretched under the weight of a falling man.At first G.Kotelnikov called his invention a <b>safety</b> <b>apparatus,</b> a knapsack-parachute and later on it got the name of RK-1.|$|E

Optical ignition and initiation of explosives could thus far only be accomplished through lasers, (4) with specific characteristic of high power, pulse length, wavelength, and a small target area that greatly inhibit their applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Motor vehicle crashes are {{the second}} {{leading cause of}} death for on-duty firefighters. Firetruck crashes, {{occurring}} at a rate of approximately 30, 000 crashes per year, have potentially dire consequences for the vehicle occupants and for the community if the firetruck was traveling to provide emergency services. Data from the United States Fire Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that firefighters neglect to buckle their seatbelts while traveling in a fire apparatus, thus putting themselves at a high risk for injuries if the truck crashes, especially in rollover crashes. Despite national regulations and departmental guidelines aiming to improve <b>safety</b> on fire <b>apparatuses,</b> belt use among firefighters remains dangerously low. The results from this study indicate that further steps need to be taken to improve belt use. One promising solution would be to redesign firetruck seatbelts to improve the ease of buckling and to accommodate wider variations in firefighter sizes. _________________________________...|$|R
40|$|Based on the <b>safety</b> {{spark test}} <b>apparatus,</b> the {{short-circuit}} spark discharge (SCSD) {{characteristics of the}} simple capacitive circuit and switching converter are studied. It is pointed out that their SCSD process {{can be divided into}} four stages, that is, dielectric-breakdown stage, spark-generated stage, spark-maintenance stage, and spark-extinguish stage; moreover, there is different equivalent spark resistance in each stage. For the simple capacitive circuit, its spark resistance is larger and maintaining voltage is almost unchanged in the spark-maintenance stage. For the switching converter, its output short-circuit characteristics depend strongly on the load resistance and its maintaining voltage reduces rapidly with the decrease of the load resistance. The circuit model is proposed, which can simulate the output SCSD process of the switching converter. By using the least-squares method, the relationship expressions between the discharge duration and capacitance in each time-stage are derived and the corresponding equivalent resistance is obtained. The mathematical models are established, and the expressions of the discharge current and voltage are deduced. Experiment and simulation results are positive in the analysis showing the feasibility of the proposed models...|$|R

However, Pacific Island Countries have difficulty meeting ICAO international civil aviation safety and security standards because they lack the resources and technical expertise necessary to implement the standards contained within their legislation. PASO, a regional organisation, which was established to centralise regulatory oversight of civil aviation under the Chicago Convention, is beset by financial and organisational difficulties PASO must therefore secure alternative funding, or restructure so it no longer operates on a cost recoverable basis.

The result of the research showed that the average value of termites mortality ranged between 25. 45 ∼ 82. 27 % and the average value of termites filter paper consumption ranged between 8. 89 ∼ 39. 44 % for C. curvignathus Holmgren. On the other hand, for C. formosanus Shiraki, the average value of termites mortality was 100 % and the average value of filter paper consumption ranged between 14. 51 ∼ 20. 41 %. The frequencies of electromagnetic waves and irradiation time have a linier effect on the value of termites mortality and termites consumption. The magnitude field from apparatus ranged between 0. 069 ∼ 0. 1815, which means the apparatus is safe to be utilized around the human body. The optimum result was achieved on electromagnetic waves apparatus with frequency of 300 KHz and irradiation time around 60 minutes both for C. curvignathus Holmgren and C. formosanus Shiraki...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of chemical syntheses in batch or semi-batch reactor is generally {{limited by the}} removal or the supply of heat. A way to enhance thermal performances is to develop multifunctional devices like heat exchanger/reactors. Then, to improve yields, selectivity and <b>safety</b> in such <b>apparatuses,</b> mass transfer has to be enhanced. One of the interesting ways to intensify the mass transfer is to structure the wavy channel etched on each plate. A plate-type heat exchanger/reactor has been studied in this work. The influence of the geometrical parameters (corrugation angle, aspect ratio, curvature radius and straight length) of the etched wavy channel on residence time distribution (RTD), mixing performances and pressure drop has been experimentally investigated. Five geometries have been tested and a mock-up has been designed and built for each one. It was shown that reducing the curvature radius (from 4 to 1. 5 mm) is interesting to promote the mass transfer (development of Dean vortices) with a moderate increase of the pressure drop for low Reynolds numbers. The increase of the straight length (from 7 to 20 mm) allows a decrease of the pressure drop without any {{significant effect on the}} mixing performance. Moreover, it was shown that increasing the aspect ratio from 0. 5 (rectangular cross section) to 1 (square cross section) has a negative impact on the RTD but enhances the mass transfer. Finally, the corrugation angle seems not to have any effect on mass transfer, RTD and pressure drop. Keywords.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for mid-infrared reflectance imaging {{has been}} developed as means of inspecting for subsurface damage in thermal-barrier coatings (TBCs). The apparatus is designed, more specifically, for imaging the progression of buried delamination cracks in plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings on turbine-engine components. Progression of TBC delamination occurs by the formation of buried cracks that grow and then link together to produce eventual TBC spallation. The mid-infrared reflectance imaging system described here {{makes it possible to}} see delamination progression that is invisible to the unaided eye, and therefore give sufficiently advanced warning before delamination progression adversely affects engine performance and <b>safety.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> (see figure) includes a commercial mid-infrared camera that contains a liquid-nitrogen-cooled focal plane indium antimonide photodetector array, and imaging is restricted by a narrow bandpass centered at wavelength of 4 microns. This narrow wavelength range centered at 4 microns was chosen because (1) it enables avoidance of interfering absorptions by atmospheric OH and CO 2 at 3 and 4. 25 microns, respectively; and (2) the coating material exhibits maximum transparency in this wavelength range. Delamination contrast is produced in the midinfrared reflectance images because the introduction of cracks into the TBC creates an internal TBC/air-gap interface with a high diffuse reflectivity of 0. 81, resulting in substantially higher reflectance of mid-infrared radiation in regions that contain buried delamination cracks. The camera is positioned a short distance (. 12 cm) from the specimen. The mid-infrared illumination is generated by a 50 -watt silicon carbide source positioned {{to the side of the}} mid-infrared camera, and the illumination is collimated and reflected onto the specimen by a 6. 35 -cm-diameter off-axis paraboloidal mirror. Because the collected images are of a steady-state reflected intensity (in contrast to the transient thermal response observed in infrared thermography), collection times can be lengthened to whatever extent needed to achieve desired signal-to-noise ratios. Each image is digitized, and the resulting data are processed in several steps to obtain a true mid-infrared reflectance image. The raw image includes thermal radiation emitted by the specimen in addition to the desired reflected radiation. The thermal-radiation contribution is eliminated by subtracting the image obtained with the illumination off from the image obtained with the illumination on. A flat-field correction is then made to remove the effects of non-uniformities in the illumination level and pixel-to-pixel variations in sensitivity. This correction is performed by normalizing to an image of a standard object that has a known reflectance at a wavelength of 4 microns. After correction, each pixel value is proportional to the reflectance (at a wavelength of 4 -microns) at the corresponding location on the specimen. Mid-infrared reflectance imaging of specimens that were thermally cyc led for different numbers of cycles was performed and demonstrated t hat mid-infrared reflectance imaging was able to monitor the gradual delamination progression that occurs with continued thermal cycling. Reproducible values were obtained for the reflectance associated w ith an attached and fully delaminated TBC, so that intermediate refle ctance values could be interpreted to successfully predict the numbe r of thermal cycles to failure...|$|R
40|$|Violence is the {{intentional}} use of physical strength or power, actually or under threat, against oneself, someone else, or against {{a group or}} community, which results or has a high probability of resulting in injury, death or psychological damage, bad development or deprivation(1). In Brazil and in the world, a lot is told about violence, which is present in various forms in everyday life, whether in the country or in urban area. Cities have grown without proper planning, people have migrated, generating unsatisfied social demands in the large centers, television has invaded home and modified people’s thinking in great extension, families have loosen moral principles, governments do not set good examples [...] . Therefore, violence has spread into all aspects of life, revealing itself in economics (exploitation of man by man, state coercion, material dependence, discrimination against women’s work, child labour, unfair impositions etc.), in politics (control by one or various parties, authoritarianism, exclusion of citizens from decision-making, revolution, war and armed conflict etc.), in ideology (implementation of official criteria, prohibition of free thought, censorship, manipulation of public opinion, advertisements and issues of violent nature), in religion (submission to clerical interests, strict control of thought, prohibition of other beliefs and persecution of “heretics”, etc.), within the family (exploitation {{of women and children}} etc [...] ), in education (teachers and principals authoritarianism etc.), in the army (unquestioning obedience to commanders etc.), in the culture (excluding innovating trends, prohibiting publication of works, bureaucracies, etc.) [...] . (2) It is health’s responsibility dealing with people affected by physical or psychological violence, in hospitals, ambulatory facilities or clinics [...] . As researches in health are responsible for statistical data consolidation. In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report on violence and health, achieving a comprehensive review on the matter of violence (what it is, whom it affects and how to deal with it), bringing {{a closer look at the}} issue, which haunts governments of all countries(3). Since then, violence has advanced through the governmental and social sphere, onto its intersection with health, either in the resultant presented by mortality and morbidity indicators, or in the costs given rise by the public network of medical psychological and hospital support to the victims of violence, and also in the contribution for preventive strategies. The fact is that society has been losing its benchmark, while receiving an avalanche of information, not always filtered. Crime has become as commonplace in the fiction of soap operas as in people’s lives. Kindness in relationships and in attitudes is being lost. Slightly repeated rudeness become unbearable for those who are daily affected. The habit makes the addiction, physical violence strikes, which is a cowardice, because it always sets the strongest against the weakest, man against woman, the mighty against the humble, adult against child, characterizing interpersonal acts of violence(4), classified into two spheres: within the families and the community. Violence within the families is the one that takes place among intimate partners and relatives, mainly at household environment, but not solely. It includes different kinds of aggression against children, against man and woman and against the elderly(4). Many forms and levels of violence extend up to the most serious points – physical disability and homicide. Community violence(4) is defined as the one that occurs in general social environment, among acquaintances and strangers, represented by youth violence, physical aggression, rapes, sexual mistreatment and, also, institutional violence, which occurs in schools, working environments, prisons and shelters(4). However, violence means a void of the State and, as the law of matter rules, when a space is empty, something else occupies it - in this particular case, the criminal organizations. Collective violence arises(4), with violent acts that occur in macro-social, political and economic fields, and characterize the domination by groups and the State. In this category (4), from the social point of view, are included crimes committed by organized groups, crowns and acts of terrorism. In the political field, there are wars andannihilation processes perpetrated against certain people and nations by others(4). In addition to the classification established by the WHO Report (2002), there is another type of violence, called structural violence(4), referring to social, political and economic processes, which are responsible for reproducing hunger, poverty and inequality in social, gender and ethnics aspects, also rendering them chronic and maintaining the adult-centered dominance over children and adolescents. Hardly quantified and apparently without actors, the structural violence perpetuates itself into historical processes, becomes persistent and natural in the culture, taking in its account privileges and forms of domination. Most types of violence previously cited are based on the structural violence (4). Nowadays, one lives in fear and, being afraid, one does not live. Life is for the strong, for those who believe in it and react to adversities. Citizen is afraid to take a stroll in the streets; to flaunt a jewel; to drive a vehicle more powerful than usual, in order not to attract attention. Families fear for their children on the internet because of pedophiles and are afraid of the drug that has spread not only into the capital cities, but also into the countryside. The Brazilian State has neglected its boundaries, drug has come inside and got established, making victims each day and letting families unsettled, frightened, in pain, with nowhere to go. A public policy is needed to protect the youth, to recover theaddicts and safeguard our borders. How many young people have had their careers interrupted! How many abandoned children are in the hands of criminals committing crime?The damages, injuries, traumas and deaths caused by accidents and violence correspond to high emotional and social costs, and to expenses related to public <b>safety</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> They give rise to financial losses caused by absence to work, by incommensurable mental and emotional damage provoked in the victims and their families, and by wasted years of productivity and life. Into the health system, the consequences of violence, among other aspects, become evidenced by the increasing expenses of emergency, care and rehabilitation services, much higher than costs of regular medical proceedings(5). Research is fundamental to the development of programs and policies on violence prevention. It is crucial that the health sector involves the scientific community, including universities, research institutes, and science councils. To achieve success, a public health approach to violence prevention should be conducted and coordinated by a “leading agency” that could set the agenda for the prevention and strengthen the roles played by other partners(6). In order to collaborate to the prevention of violence, Brazilian Journal in Health Promotion presents relevant articles over the years, drawing the attention of students, professionals and health managers to such a strong and full of data issue, that grieves everyone. Because peace is everyone’s responsibility, a citizen’s right and a duty of the State. REFERENCES 1. World Health Organization - WHO. Health topics:Violence [acesso em 2012 Jan 20].
