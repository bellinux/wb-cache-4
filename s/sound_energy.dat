5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into <b>sound</b> <b>energy.</b> This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

25|$|Bass traps are {{acoustic}} energy absorbers which {{are designed to}} damp low frequency <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> {{with the goal of}} attaining a flatter low frequency (LF) room response by reducing LF resonances in rooms.

25|$|A typical sound {{reinforcement}} system consists of; input transducers (e.g., microphones), which convert <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> such as {{a person}} singing into an electric signal, signal processors which alter the signal characteristics (e.g., equalizers that adjust the bass and treble, compressors that reduce signal peaks, etc.), amplifiers, which produce a powerful version of the resulting signal that can drive a loudspeaker and output transducers (e.g., loudspeakers in speaker cabinets), which convert the signal back into <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> (the sound heard by the audience and the performers). These primary parts involve varying amounts of individual components to achieve the desired goal of reinforcing and clarifying the sound to the audience, performers, or other individuals.|$|E

25|$|Noise — <b>Sound</b> <b>energy</b> {{emitted by}} a cooling tower and heard (recorded) {{at a given}} {{distance}} and direction.

25|$|Earlier devices, such as ear {{trumpets}} or ear horns, were passive amplification cones {{designed to}} gather <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> and direct {{it into the}} ear canal.

Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E

500|$|The end-fire {{subwoofer}} method, {{also called}} [...] "forward steered arrays", places subwoofer drivers co-axially {{in one or}} more rows, using destructive interference to reduce emissions to the sides and rear. This can be done with separate subwoofer enclosures positioned front to back with a spacing between them of one-quarter wavelength of the target frequency, the frequency that is least wanted on stage or most desired in the audience. Each row is delayed beyond the first row by an amount related to the speed of sound in air; typically a few milliseconds. The arrival time of <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> from all the subwoofers is near-simultaneous from the audience's perspective, but is canceled out to a large degree behind the subwoofers because of offset sound wave arrival times. Directionality of the target frequency can achieve as much as 25dB rear attenuation, and the forward sound is coherently summed in line with the subwoofers. The positional technique of end-fire subwoofers came into widespread use in European live concert sound in 2006.|$|E
500|$|When echolocating, {{the sperm}} whale emits a directionally focused beam of {{broadband}} clicks. Clicks are generated by forcing air through {{a pair of}} phonic lips (also known as [...] "monkey lips" [...] or [...] "museau de singe") at {{the front end of}} the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ. Most of the <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon, whose lens-like structure focuses it. Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale's nose, where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time. This back and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi-pulse click structure. This multi-pulse click structure allows researchers to measure the whale's spermaceti organ using only the sound of its clicks. Because the interval between pulses of a sperm whale's click is related to the length of the sound producing organ, an individual whale's click is unique to that individual. [...] However, if the whale matures and the size of the spermaceti organ increases, the tone of the whale's click will also change. The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes. A continuous fat-filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear.|$|E

Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. These repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old [...] "candlestick" [...] telephone if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.|$|E

40|$|We present here an Harmonic+Noise Model (HNM) for speech synthesis. The noise part is {{represented}} by an autoregressive model whose output is pitchsynchronously modulated in energy.

2500|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{unsuccessful}} attempts and unverified claims to recover the power in the carrier of the received signal itself.

Given that the audio signal is unlikely to be at peak all the time, the ratio of energy is, in practice, even greater. Considerable effort was made to convert this DC voltage into <b>sound</b> <b>energy.</b> Some earlier attempts include a one-transistor amplifier in 1966.

2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{vacation}} at the Homestead in 1874, Alexander Graham continued to contemplate electrical sound reproduction while viewing the undulating {{surface of the}} Grand River from his [...] "dreaming place". He postulated that [...] "it {{would be possible to}} transmit sounds of any sort" [...] by the continuous variation of the intensity of the electric current. [...] This method of <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> to electrical signal transduction was fundamentally different from the on-or-off transmission methods used by other telephone experimenters. [...] Alexander Graham held lengthy discussions with his father explaining what he thought he could achieve with a sound-driven transmitter producing an electrical signal which would instantaneously travel an electrical circuit to a receiver at another location where it would be converted back to sound. His record of a discussion with his father in their home's living room, wrote [...] "If I could vary the intensity of the electric current in exact proportion to the variation of the air density in the production of words, I would be able to transmit speech by telegraph" [...] (using the telephone's technical analog, the telegraph, as the former name had not yet been adapted). On 26 July 1874 in their living room the younger Bell realized the technical principles of telephony, inventing the telecommunications device he is now closely identified with. Returning again to the Homestead the next summer in 1875 Bell wrote his first draft specifications of the telephone patent—commonly considered to be the most valuable patent in history—that September. He later built his first fully functional unit at Boston on 10 March 1876. Later that year, in August, Bell made the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance, between Brantford and Paris Ontario.|$|E
