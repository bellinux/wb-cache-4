5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, {{to aid in the}} peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E

500|$|Frogstomp was {{described}} as similar to Nirvana and Pearl Jam; Erlewine noted that it followed in [...] "the alternative rock tradition" [...] of those bands. Erlewine also stated that [...] "their songwriting abilities aren't as strong" [...] as those of their peers. However, Rolling Stone claimed that the band had risen above their peers, applauding Johns' [...] "ragged vocals". Herald Sun journalist Nue Te Koha praised Frogstomp for [...] "breaking the drought of Australian music making an impact overseas". However, he felt [...] "It is highly debatable whether the three teens {{have gone to the}} world with a new sound or something identifiably Australian ... Silverchair's image and sound are blatantly ... Nirvana meets Pearl Jam". Nimmervoll disputed Te Koha's view, [...] "It's not original, it's not Australian. Bah, humbug ...

500|$|A {{review in}} the Times Literary Supplement dated 4 September 1941 stated {{that there was a}} [...] "note of quiescence, even of bleak resignation" [...] in the poem and that it [...] "lost that spice of wit which was woven into the logic of the earlier poems". Later, Bernard Bergonzi claimed that [...] "The Dry Salvages is the least {{satisfactory}} of the sequence, though {{at the same time it}} contains some of its best lines. The opening lines are poor, in a weakly sub-Whitmanesque fashion. Yet the writing suddenly picks up at the words, 'The river is within us,' and from there to the end of the section we have a magnificently sustained sequence". F. B. Pinion believed that [...] "'The Dry Salvages' is a complicated, uneven, and rather prosy poem, in which Eliot continues to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> with some progression, mainly in maritime imagery".|$|E
500|$|In side plots, Nina has {{recovered}} different translations of the tomes about the First People, including one from William Bell's personal safe, and realizes {{that they all}} <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> in different languages. She identifies {{the name of the}} author of each book as an anagram of the name [...] "Sam Weiss", the bowling alley owner who she had directed Olivia to after her initial return from the parallel universe. She approaches Sam, who does not deny he wrote the books, and who explains that the doomsday device being constructed can either create or destroy a universe; how that will work will depend on Peter, who is biologically tuned to the device. Sam posits that Peter will most likely save the universe from which the Olivia he loves originates. The episode ends with Olivia reading the note from Simon, which states that Peter still has feelings for Fauxlivia.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E

And I made a joke , and I'll <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?" [...] Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.|$|E
2500|$|... "Yes, I {{could give}} you several examples. Near Quilali, at about 30 {{kilometers}} east of Quilali, {{there was a little}} village called El Coco. The contras arrived, they devastated it, they destroyed and burned everything. They arrived in front of a little house and turned their machinegun fire on it, without bothering to check if there were any people inside. Two children, who had taken fright and hidden under a bed, were hit. I could <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> of a man and woman who were hit, this was in the little co-operative of Sacadias Olivas. It was just the same. They too had taken fright and got into bed. Unlike El Coco, the contras had just been on the attack, they had encountered resistance and were now in flight. During their flight they went into a house, and seeing that there were people there, they threw grenade. The man and the woman were killed and one of the children was injured." ...|$|E

Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. I would prefer to let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows? It certainly doesn't seem like it's on the tip of anyone's lips, but I could have said the same thing - and in fact, I did <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> - about Faith No More, and that happened.
