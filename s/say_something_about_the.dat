25|$|The atheistic {{conclusion}} is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient {{reason to believe that}} any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has {{no reason to believe that}} a god exists.|$|E
25|$|Corry was {{associated}} with {{what came to be}} called the Tory Party after the death of William Pitt the younger in 1806. Up until the extension of the franchise in 1832, the borough was strongly Tory in representation. The fact that no Tory or Conservative was elected after 1832 may <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unrepresentative nature of the old franchise.|$|E

50|$|Some writers, e.g. Williams and Musgrave, make no {{distinction}} between the deceiving God and evil demon arguments and regard anything said <b>about</b> <b>the</b> deceiving God as being equivalent to <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> evil demon.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} the object can be {{increased}} by {{the way in which}} it is given and several authors have pointed to the fact that organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> moral character of the people who give them. Furthermore, the giving of organs without any form of compensation erases the possibility that the giver will have any form of vested interest in the transaction.|$|E
25|$|The ED {{period is}} the first {{for which it is}} {{possible}} to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ethnic composition of the population of Southern Mesopotamia. This {{is due to the fact}} that texts from this period contain sufficient phonetic signs to distinguish separate languages. They also contain personal names, which can potentially be linked to an ethnic identity. The textual evidence suggests that Southern Mesopotamia during the ED period was primarily occupied by Sumerians, who spoke Sumerian (a language isolate). It is still debated whether the Sumerian language was already in use during the Uruk period.|$|E
25|$|It is thus an {{extremely}} early {{witness to the}} reception of al-Tabari's text-indeed much earlier than the sources that are customarily pressed into service to improve {{our understanding of the}} Ta'rikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk, e.g., Miskawayh, Ibn 'Asakir, Ibn al-Athir, and Ibn Khallikan. Second, since al-Azdi was writing in the decades following al-Tabari, his Ta'rikh can <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reception of al-Tabari's Ta'rikh among those who immediately followed the great master. That al-Tabari's history was immensely significant we can all agree; but as to precisely how he became so significant there is no clear consensus.8 Third-and returning to Forand's insight-al-Azdi frequently drew on the same authorities tapped by al-Tabari, but whose works are for the most part now lost, such as Abu Ma'shar (170/786), Abu Mikhnaf (157/774), al-Haytham ibn 'Adi (207/822), al-Mada'ini (around 228/843), and 'Umar ibn Shabba (262/878).|$|E

500|$|Even the {{truncated}} {{version was}} met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. Dilys Powell in The Sunday Times complained [...] "...17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." [...] The Guardian felt the film was filled with [...] "gratuitous sadism." [...] Margaret Hinxman of The Sunday Telegraph dismissed it as a [...] "sadistic extravaganza." [...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else... There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film... Matthew Hopkins {{is the best of}} Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E

2500|$|In quantum mechanics, {{it often}} occurs that {{little or no}} {{information}} about the inner product [...] of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while {{it is still possible}} to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> expansion coefficients [...] and [...] of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.|$|E

50|$|A {{variant of}} Chinese whispers is called rumors. In {{this version of}} the game, when players {{transfer}} the message, they deliberately change one or two words of the phrase (often to something more humorous than the previous message).

2500|$|On December 17, 1944, another zonification was {{conducted}} in the town proper. The church was used as garrison and all suspected male residents involved in the guerrilla movement were brought {{at the back of}} the Dasmariñas Elementary School and were tortured. Some were hanged at the old mango tree near the school canteen, whipped and forced to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> movement. There were those who experienced the so-called [...] "tinutubig" [...] (wherein the head is immersed in a drum of water).|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} possible, however, to make precise and {{accurate}} {{statements about the}} likelihood of a future state in a chaotic system. [...] If a (possibly chaotic) dynamical system has an attractor, then there exists a probability measure that gives the long-run proportion of time spent by the system in the various regions of the attractor. [...] In the case of the logistic map with parameter [...] and an initial state in , the attractor is also the interval [...] and the probability measure corresponds to the beta distribution with parameters [...] and [...] Specifically, the invariant measure is [...] [...] Unpredictability is not randomness, but in some circumstances looks very much like it. [...] Hence, and fortunately, even if we know very little about the initial state of the logistic map (or some other chaotic system), we can still <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> distribution of states arbitrarily far into the future, and use this knowledge to inform decisions based {{on the state of the}} system.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Mendelsohn of The Huffington Post {{called the}} film a [...] "bitterly sad and angrily feminist mini-epic", {{and said that}} while it {{presents}} scenes of [...] "matter-of-fact lechery from men towards women that is an accepted norm in our society, both then and now", it [...] "earns kudos for daring to actually be about something relevant and interesting. It is actually very much about the sexualization of women in popular culture, rather than just using those tools to make pointless exploitation fare." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict posited that Sucker Punch uses the [...] "prism of popular culture to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> roles that women find themselves forced into—and {{not just in the}} fantasies of geeks and fanboys". Bromley further judged that the film is [...] "about fighting a losing battle. About using every tool at your disposal, be it sexuality or physical strength or wit or the ability to band together to fight a common enemy—the tool of Sisterhood—and about how that still isn't enough." ...|$|E
50|$|Many mathematicians such as Alfred Clebsch furthered Riemann's work on {{algebraic}} curves. These theories {{depended on}} the properties of a function defined on Riemann surfaces.

25|$|The Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} the complex web of fields around the village, {{but it does}} not reveal that many of the fields have local names.

The Field names therefore represent a valuable repository of social history.|$|R
5000|$|These {{advertising}} campaigns {{were from}} San Francisco's Goodby Silverstein & Partners were directed by Walter Williams {{in a style}} similar to his [...] "The Mr. Bill Show", an early series of Saturday Night Live skits.

40|$|This report {{emerges from}} the Pew Research Center's efforts to {{understand}} public attitudes about a variety of scientific and technological changes being discussed today. The time horizons of these technological advances span from today's realities [...] for instance, the growing prevalence of drones [...] to more speculative matters such as the possibility of human control of the weather. Part of the motive for doing this work is to explore Americans' comfort levels [...] their excitement, interest or wariness [...] {{in the face of}} a raft of scientific innovations that are emerging or being considered. Since much of the funding for scientific research comes from the government, these attitudes can give key signals to policy makers and <b>the</b> scientific community <b>about</b> where <b>the</b> public stands on crucial funding decisions. Another motive for doing this work is to test the state of <b>the</b> public's mood <b>about</b> <b>the</b> long-term future. Their relative optimism [...] or pessimism [...] <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current state of American culture.

Mr. Topes was <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Pastoral Symphony. Purple face powder in the daylight; it looked hideous.|$|R
40|$|For a {{while back}} in the later seventies and early eighties there was a {{tenacious}} stream of Australian films that chronicled rites of passage or coming of age.
