The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much <b>since</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E

[...] "In fact, my struggle with depression as a student was no secret. I had talked {{about it in a}} widely-covered news conference as early as 1977, when I was in the South Carolina State Senate. <b>Since</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> have often shared with appropriate groups the full story of my recovery to responsible adulthood as a professional, political and civic leader, husband and father. Teenage depression and suicide are major problems in the United States, and I believe that my life story offers hope to young people who are suffering with a constant fear of the future".|$|E
2500|$|As an example, Campbell {{believed}} {{one could}} create an eloptic receiver or similar device with the prisms and amplifiers represented by their cardboard or even schematic representations. Through {{the use of}} mental powers, such a machine would function {{as well as its}} [...] "real" [...] equivalent. In his autobiography, Hieronymus wrote, [...] "I appreciated Mr. Campbell's interest in my work, but over the years <b>since</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> have concluded that he set back the acceptance of my work at least a hundred years by his continual emphasis on what he termed the supernatural or 'magic' aspects of a mind-controlled device he built by drawing the schematic of my patented instrument with India ink. The energy flowed over the lines of this drawing because India ink is conducting, but it isn't worth a tinker's damn for serious research or actual treating." ...|$|E

Heynckes' {{comeback}} started well, with Gladbach in fifth {{position in the}} Bundesliga {{at the end of}} the seventh matchday after winning each of their opening four home matches. He resigned on 31 January 2007, however, after 14-straight Bundesliga matches without a win saw Borussia drop to 17th place in the table. with the coach requiring police protection for matches against VfL Bochum and Energie Cottbus in the previous month. On departing Borussia, Heynckes refused a pay-off and returned his company car to the club office freshly cleaned and with a full tank of petrol. In May 2013, upon returning to Borussia-Park for his final match as a Bundesliga coach, Heynckes said, [...] "This is my club. It's where I started as a 19-year-old professional, then worked as a coach. <b>Since</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have come full circle. Mönchengladbach is my home town, I spent 23 years at the club, so this will not be just a normal game for me." ...|$|E
