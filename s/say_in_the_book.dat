25|$|Raumer {{presented}} his ideas on public libraries, termed as Volksbibliotheken (people's libraries), in a memorandum in 1846, resonating his democratic opinions. As a result, in 1847 Berlin's magistrate (city government) established a standing {{committee for the}} establishment and administration of public libraries, consisting {{of members of the}} afore-mentioned Verein and of the City Representatives' Assembly (Stadtverordnetenversammlung; then Berlin's city parliament). The Bibliotheks-Kommission (Library Commission) was to appoint the chief librarian, control the library budget and have a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> purchases. In December 1848 King Frederick William IV approved the foundation of public libraries, however, his decision remained unpublished due to the repercussions of the March Revolution of that year. The Prussian government added the clause that all works suited to endanger ethical life, religion or the state were strictly to be withheld from the library, while books apt to strengthen traditions, faith and the king's subjects' fidelity were to be preferentially acquired. Starting in 1849 , the city's archivist, served as responsible city official for the Library Commission, and soon determined its acquisitions of books.|$|E

[...] In a recent book Andy Soltis lists [...] "Alekhine's 15 Improvements". The most famous example is his game with five queens in Moscow in 1915. In the actual game, Alekhine, playing as Black, beat Grigoriev in the Moscow 1915 tournament; but {{in one of his}} books he presented the [...] "Five Queens" [...] variation (starting with a move he rejected as Black in the original game) as an actual game won by the White player in Moscow in 1915 (he did not <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> who was who in this version, nor that it was in the tournament).|$|E
5000|$|The book doesn’t allege {{anything}} that hes stating there. The book shows clearly what happened. Maguire — as people read the book, they’re like, that statement doesn’t actually reflect what’s in the book. The book just shows him talking to Rob Richer - Maguire - about the letter, about its contents, about generally its origin. And at that point, Maguire was {{moving on to}} a new job, so I <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> it’s passed to Maguire’s successor for execution. So there’s an example where Maguire, who had not read the book at that point, had it characterized wrongly by Richer, whomever Richer was working with, and then responded to something not in the book. You know, it’s interesting, because {{this is part of}} a kind of practice of careful sort of kick-up-the-dust deception, in terms of statements like this that experienced reporters have seen from time to time.|$|E

50|$|Billos {{takes the}} books, {{overwhelmed}} by the power inside, and touches blood to one of them. Immediately both he and the books disappear into another world. Here, Billos climbs in a machine from our time, which is a virtual reality machine, though he doesn't know it(and it doesn't specifically <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> although it does say Dell, which can lead you to this conclusion). When he wakes up he is confronted by Marsuveus Black, a mysterious man who gives Billos 'suhupow,' short for 'superhuman power,' as {{in the ability to}} create objects at will and affect the world around. Billos goes on a killing spree in the nearby town, known as Paradise. He is killed, but wakes up again and re-tries to get the books, which are along the shelf of a saloon. In the Other Earth, the chosen Darsal, Billos' romance, tries to help him, but cannot without a book. She goes alone to Alucard's lair and trades him his book for all of theirs when they retrieve them, or—in the event she goes against her word—either her or Billos' life. He accepts and lets her travel to the world Billos is in, accompanied by Karas who snuck along. Inside they do not accept Black's powers and manage to bring Billos back with the books. With those four they are able to travel to Thomas' earth. In Alucard' lair they find that Johnis and Silvie have come to try and stop her and started a battle with thousands of Shaitiki. With no hope to escape they start to use the books—Alucard and Silvie by one, Karas by one, Johnis by one, and leaving only one for the last two—Darsal and Billos. By not giving the books to Alucard, one must give up their life. Billos sacrifices himself, and Darsal uses the last book to leave while the Shataiki break down the door.|$|E

Also, Bell has an entire backstory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> that doesn't make it into the film.

She continues to speak on the importance of Las Adelitas de Aztlán, saying that the group helped to give birth to Chicana feminism. As a group Las Adelitas de Aztlán discussed how they were talked to and treated as women, and talked about Machismo specifically the macho mentality. The group adopted the following slogan: “Porque somos una familia de hermana we are a family of sisters”.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to Shevek's journey {{to answer questions}} about his society's true level of freedom, the meaning of his theories themselves weave their way into the plot; they not only describe abstract physical concepts, but they also reflect {{ups and downs of the}} characters' lives, and the transformation of the Anarresti society.
