5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a <b>security</b> <b>token,</b> a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E
25|$|A Relying Party {{issues a}} request to an {{application}} for an identity, {{by means of a}} Policy that states what Claims it needs and what will be the physical representation of the <b>security</b> <b>token.</b> The application then passes on the request to Windows CardSpace, which then contacts a suitable Identity Provider and retrieves the Identity. It then provides the application with the Identity along with information on how to use it.|$|E
500|$|In February 2005, 800 {{players were}} {{banned from the}} card game Tetra Master and from Final Fantasy XI for monopolizing areas where high level items and monsters would spawn, making it {{impossible}} for other players to become stronger. In March 2009, Square Enix announced a new security system for players beginning April 6, 2009, involving a <b>security</b> <b>token</b> players could purchase for $9.99 and including an in-game bonus called a [...] "Mog Satchel". On April 9, 2005, a distributed denial of service attack against PlayOnline's servers shut down Final Fantasy XI access for players in North America and Europe for three hours: the attack continued for over a week, leading Square Enix to involve law enforcement. At the time, Square Enix did not reveal if the Japanese server which hosted Front Mission Online, Fantasy Earth, and Japanese players of EverQuest II were affected.|$|E

2500|$|The PIN/TAN {{system where}} the PIN {{represents}} a password, {{used for the}} login and TANs representing one-time passwords to authenticate transactions. TANs can be distributed in different ways, the most popular one is to send a list of TANs to the online banking user by postal letter. Another way of using TANs is to generate them by need using a <b>security</b> <b>token.</b> These token generated TANs depend on the time and a unique [...] secret, stored in the <b>security</b> <b>token</b> (two-factor authentication or 2FA).|$|E
2500|$|This attack, {{discovered}} in mid-2016, exploits {{weaknesses in the}} Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) to expose the URL that a web user is attempting to reach via a TLS-enabled web link. [...] Disclosure of a URL can violate a user's privacy, {{not only because of}} the web site accessed, but also because URLs are sometimes used to authenticate users. Document sharing services, such as those offered by Google and Dropbox, also work by sending a user a <b>security</b> <b>token</b> that's included in the URL. An attacker who obtains such URLs may be able to gain full access to a victim's account or data.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} {{of separation of}} mechanism and policy is the substantial difference between the philosophy of micro and monolithic kernels. Here a mechanism is the support that allows the implementation of many different policies, while a policy is a particular [...] "mode of operation". [...] For instance, a mechanism may provide for user log-in attempts to call an authorization server to determine whether access should be granted; a policy may be for the authorization server to request a password and check it against an encrypted password stored in a database. [...] Because the mechanism is generic, the policy could more easily be changed (e.g. by requiring {{the use of a}} <b>security</b> <b>token)</b> than if the mechanism and policy were integrated in the same module.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{migration}} of web applications to Cloud computing platform has {{raised concerns about}} the privacy of sensitive data belonging to the consumers of cloud services. The traditional form of <b>security</b> <b>tokens</b> like username/password used to access cloud services are prone to phishing attacks and hence do not provide complete security. In this work we propose to extend the Microsoft’s CardSpace identity management tool, to include more robust <b>security</b> <b>tokens</b> using the zero knowledge proof concept. These <b>security</b> <b>tokens</b> are {{in the form of}} SAML token supported by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and hence can prove interoperable with the existing security platforms...|$|R

50|$|<b>Security</b> <b>token</b> service (STS) is a {{cross-platform}} open standard {{core component}} of the OASIS group's WS-Trust web services single sign-on infrastructure framework specification. Within that claims-based identity framework, a secure token service is responsible for issuing, validating, renewing and cancelling security tokens. The tokens issued by <b>security</b> <b>token</b> services can then {{be used to identify}} the holder of the token to services that adhere to the WS-Trust standard. <b>Security</b> <b>token</b> service provides the same functionality as OpenID, but unlike OpenID is not patent encumbered. Together {{with the rest of the}} WS-Trust standard, the <b>security</b> <b>token</b> service specification was initially developed by employees of IBM, Microsoft, Nortel and VeriSign.|$|E
5000|$|With a <b>Security</b> <b>Token</b> Service (STS), the RP is {{redirected}} to an STS, which authenticates the RP {{and issues}} a <b>security</b> <b>token</b> granting access, {{instead of the}} application authenticating the RP directly. The claims are extracted from the tokens and used for identity related tasks.|$|E
