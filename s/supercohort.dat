30|$|The cohort Heterostigmata, {{one of the}} two cohorts {{placed in}} the <b>supercohort</b> Eleutherengonides (Acari: Prostigmata) (Walter et al. [2009]), mostly {{includes}} small mites associated with various arthropods. They are fungivores, parasites, parasitoids, and sometimes phytophages. Heterostigmata includes eight superfamilies and more than 2, 000 described species. Based on Khaustov ([2008]), the family Microdispidae (Acari: Heterostigmata) {{is a member of the}} superfamily Pygmephoroidea. These mites inhabit soil, litter, decaying plant materials, and similar substrates, and adult females have phoretic associations with arthropods (Rack [1979]; Kaliszewski et al. [1995]; Khaustov [2006], [2009 a]; Walter et al. [2009]; Hajiqanbar et al. [2012]). About 109 species of 17 microdispid genera have been described; however, the taxonomy of this family is highly problematic and perplexed by vague generic and species descriptions, particularly over the last decades of the twentieth century. Here, we describe the 18 th genus of this family that is associated with scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), collected from forests of Golestan Province, northern Iran, and redescribe the monotypic genus Vietodispus Mahunka, [1975] because of its similarity to the new genus and incomplete original description. In addition, the representatives of the family Microdispidae associated with arthropods are reviewed.|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} of the Zoraptera {{remains one of the}} most challenging and uncertain concerns in ordinal-level phylogenies of the insects. Zoraptera have been viewed as having a close relationship with five different groups of Polyneoptera, or as being allied to the Paraneoptera or even Holometabola. Although rDNAs have been widely used in phylogenetic studies of insects, the application of the complete 28 S rDNA are still scattered in only a few orders. In this study, a secondary structure model of the complete 28 S rRNAs of insects was reconstructed based on all orders of Insecta. It was found that one length-variable region, D 3 - 4, is particularly distinctive. The length and/or sequence of D 3 - 4 is conservative within each order of Polyneoptera, but it can be divided into two types between the different orders of the <b>supercohort,</b> of which the enigmatic order Zoraptera and Dictyoptera share one type, while the remaining orders of Polyneoptera share the other. Additionally, independent evidence from phylogenetic results support the clade (Zoraptera+Dictyoptera) as well. Thus, the similarity of D 3 - 4 between Zoraptera and Dictyoptera can serve as potentially valuable autapomorphy or synapomorphy in phylogeny reconstruction. The clades of (Plecoptera+Dermaptera) and ((Grylloblattodea+Mantophasmatodea) +(Embiodea+Phasmato-dea)) were also recovered in the phylogenetic study. In addition, considering the other studies based on rDNAs, this study reached the highest congruence with previous phylogenetic studies of Holometabola based on nuclear protein coding genes or morphology characters. Future comparative studies of secondary structures across deep divergences an...|$|E

40|$|A {{cladistic}} analysis {{aimed at}} understanding the phylogenetic relationships of basal (Early to Mid Ordovician) planktic graptolites {{resulted in a}} well-resolved majority rule consensus tree that displays a series of major monophyletic groups. This tree was used to produce a classification system for the planktic Graptoloida, {{one of the major}} groups of the Graptolithina. Resolution within the individual taxonomic units is low, however, as only few species of the individual groups were included in the analysis. Tree statistics such as the retention index show that the proximal end characters used in the analysis are more reliable indicators of synapomorphy, whereas distal rhabdosome characters show significantly more homoplasy on the consensus tree. This result supports previous qualitative assessments suggesting that the initial part of the colony appears to have been relatively conservative during the evolution of the graptolites, whereas the distal features are more easily modified. Thus, the proximal end structure is especially relevant for revealing shared common ancestry through the presence of distinct homologies. Based on the structure of the consensus tree, we recognize a series of nested holophyletic clades, primarily total clades (names of which are identified by the prefix Pan-) and crown clades. The proposed names conserve the traditional names applied to common graptolite higher taxa as much as possible and yet precisely describe the branching history of the clade. The Graptoloida is the clade that descended from the first graptolithine to possess a nematophorous sicula and planktic habit and comprises a stem lineage of “anisograptids” (e. g. , Rhabdinopora flabelliformis and Anisograptus matanensis), plus the crown clade <b>Supercohort</b> Eugraptoloida. The Eugraptoloida includes all the remaining graptoloids, which form the sister taxa, Cohort Pan-Reclinata nov. and Cohort Pan-Sinograpta. Many familiar genera formerly included among the Dichograptidea form a stem lineage to the crown clade Subcohort Reclinata nov. The Reclinata includes the sister clades, Superorder Pan-Tetragrapta nov. and Superorder Pan-Bireclinata nov. The Pan-Bireclinata comprises stem group bireclinatids (including Isograptus) and the crown clade Order Bireclinata nov., which in turn consists of the sister total clades Suborder Pan-Glossograpta nov. and Suborder Pan-Axonophora nov. The Pan-Axonophora are represented in this analysis only by stem lineage species (Arienigraptus gracilis to Exigraptus uniformis), but the group contains the roots of the diverse and well-known diplograptids and monograptids, which dominate subsequent Middle Ordovician to Early Devonian graptolite faunas...|$|E
