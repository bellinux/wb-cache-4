5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the remains were sold by his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, the remains were in a city garage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership of the remains and would like them returned to upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's aunt Julia Maesa took {{advantage}} of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, Elagabalus, recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in Chaceldon and later executed in Cappadocia. He sent his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> care of Artabanus V of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, lived, {{he would}} have steered his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Whig Party and the Union, rather than the Democratic Party and the Confederacy, but the Kentucky Secretary of State and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives died of a fever on September 1, 1823, months before his son's third birthday. Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her {{children}} moved to her in-laws' home near Lexington, Kentucky, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge. John Breckinridge believed {{the federal government was}} created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. A strict constructionist, he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1290, Edward's {{father had}} {{confirmed}} the Treaty of Birgham, {{in which he}} promised to marry his six-year-old <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> young Margaret of Norway, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. Margaret died later that year, bringing {{an end to the}} plan. Edward's mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence. Edward I was distraught at his wife's death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor on her death. Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure a lasting peace with France, but war broke out in 1294. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the Count of Flanders, but this too failed after it was blocked by King Philip IV of France.|$|E

5|$|In 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor {{appears in}} person {{to oversee the}} last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth Vader that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's <b>son,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark side. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Like most of {{this part}} of Borneo, this area was once {{under the control of the}} Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war in Brunei. The name Tawao was used on {{nautical}} charts by 1857, and there is evidence of a settlement by 1879. The East India Company had established a trading post in Borneo, though there was no significant activity by the Dutch on the east coast. In 1846, Netherlands signed a treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan, where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area. When the Dutch began to operate in 1867, the Sultan married his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan. Around this time, the Dutch sphere of influence reached Tawao. They controlled the area north of Tawao, overlapping an area controlled by the Sultan of Sulu.|$|E
5|$|John of Austria, {{the victor}} of Lepanto and {{replacement}} to Requesens, {{had no choice}} but to sign the Perpetual Edict in 1577, accepting the Pacification of Ghent, but later, frustrated by the intransigence of Orange and his supporters, he seized the citadel of Namur and recalled his troops. John's striking victory at the Battle of Gembloux in January 1578, was followed by a tactical defeat at Rijmenam in July, and John himself died of plague in October. However, despite the Spanish failure to exploit militarily the victory of Gembloux, it rendered important political benefits to the royal cause in the Netherlands, as it shattered the unity of the Dutch rebels. As a consequence of the battle's outcome, the leaders of the main families of the Southern provinces lost faith in Orange's cause and the promises of aid made by the English queen Elizabeth I, which meant an important setback to Orange. Aiming to restore the military capability of the Dutch rebels, Elizabeth arranged with John Casimir, <b>son</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Calvinist Elector Palatine, the raising of a German Army under English pay to assist the Dutch troops John Casimir brought to the Netherlands 11,000 men, but instead of fighting the Spanish, he sided with the Calvinist extremists at Ghent and widened the gap between the Catholic and Protestant rebels. The States General also called for help Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother and heir of the King of France, who entered Mons in July 1578, but was back in France in a short time.|$|E
