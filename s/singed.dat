5|$|On the April 5 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hardy was {{introduced}} {{as a member}} of Team Hogan for the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would face Team Flair. One week later, however, Hardy was injured when James Storm spewed a volatile liquid against a flame from his lighter, forming a fireball that <b>singed</b> most of Hardy's face. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Hardy, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm). At Sacrifice, Hardy defeated Mr. Anderson. After the event, Anderson turned face and eventually managed to convince the skeptical Hardy that he really had changed, after which the two went on to form a tag team. At Slammiversary VIII, Hardy and Anderson, now known as Enigmatic Assholes, defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The Master and Mistress take Lad {{on their}} annual fall camping {{trip to the}} {{mountains}} for two weeks. During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At {{the end of the}} trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners are returning to find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest fire. When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with <b>singed</b> fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering his paws on some coals.|$|E
25|$|Iceland offers wide {{varieties}} of traditional cuisine. Þorramatur (food of the þorri) is the Icelandic national food. Nowadays þorramatur is mostly eaten during the ancient Nordic month of þorri, in January and February, {{as a tribute}} to old culture. Þorramatur consists of many different types of food. These are mostly offal dishes like pickled ram's testicles, putrefied shark, <b>singed</b> sheep heads, <b>singed</b> sheep head jam, black pudding, liver sausage (similar to Scottish haggis) and dried fish (often cod or haddock) with or without butter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Singeing</b> {{machines}} can be {{of three}} types: plate <b>singeing,</b> roller <b>singeing,</b> or gas <b>singeing.</b> Gas <b>singeing</b> is widely used in the textile industry. In gas <b>singeing,</b> a flame comes into direct contact to the fabric and burn the protruding fiber. Here, flame height and fabric speed is the main concern to minimize the fabric damage.|$|R

When restored, parts of the lower deck ceiling {{were found to be}} <b>singed.</b> It has since undergone a further overhaul and remains in service.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, Carson met an Arapaho {{woman named}} Waanibe (Singing Grass, or Grass Singing) at a {{mountain}} man rendezvous held along the Green River in Wyoming. Singing Grass {{was a lovely}} young woman, and many mountain men {{were in love with}} her. Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage. Carson won, but he had a very narrow escape. The French trapper's bullet <b>singed</b> his hair. The duel {{was one of the best}} known stories about Carson in the 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>singe</b> is a {{treatment}} available at a barber's. A lit taper (candle) or other device {{is used to}} lightly burn and shrivel the hair. The practice of <b>singeing</b> was popular approximately a century ago; {{it was believed that}} hair had [...] "fluid" [...] in it and <b>singeing</b> would trap the fluid in. <b>Singeing</b> is supposed to have beneficial effects - sealing cut ends, closing up the follicles, preventing the hair from bleeding (This belief has since been debunked.) and encouraging it to grow. [...] <b>Singeing</b> is still sometimes used to bond natural hair to hair extensions.|$|R
25|$|Crash {{landing in}} no man's land, Stahlschmidt escaped the burning wreck {{with just a}} pair of <b>singed</b> eyebrows. Once again, as he ran on foot toward German lines, Stahlschmidt was fired on by an Allied truck convoy which he had just overflown. However he {{was picked up by}} a German {{reconnaissance}} unit. Back at Staffel HQ Stahlschmidt learned from Marseille and Homuth that the lead Kittyhawk had pulled up sharply and fired accurately. Both were of the opinion that it was a wonderful shot. The Allied pilot was the leading Australian ace, Squadron Leader Clive Caldwell, CO of No. 112 Squadron RAF.|$|E
25|$|Edgar Montrose (Graham Greene) is Possum Lodge's {{explosives}} enthusiast. He {{believes that}} any problem (including leaky roofs and invasive weeds) {{can be solved}} with explosives. He is usually seen wearing <b>singed</b> overalls, a cracked construction helmet {{and a pair of}} ear protectors, though he rarely covers his ears with them. According to himself, Edgar was born in Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and he started using explosives at a young age. He later enlisted in the Army and was dishonourably discharged after only three weeks, when he blew up the mess hall ("turns out they were only thinking of building a new one").|$|E
25|$|Much of Iceland's cuisine {{is based}} on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no {{utilization}} of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food. Þorramatur is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of Þorri, which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include skyr, hákarl (cured shark), cured ram, <b>singed</b> sheep heads, and black pudding, Flatkaka (flat bread), dried fish and dark rye bread traditionally baked in the ground in geothermal areas. Puffin is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.|$|E

Mel B felt that <b>Singe</b> was singing the song just to her, Guy Sebastian called his added rap in the song [...] "crazy", and Ronan Keating said it was a great audition song.|$|R
40|$|We present <b>Singe,</b> a Domain Specific Language (DSL) {{compiler}} for combustion chemistry that leverages warp specialization to pro-duce {{high performance}} code for GPUs. Instead {{of relying on}} tra-ditional GPU programming models that emphasize data-parallel computations, warp specialization allows compilers like <b>Singe</b> to partition computations into sub-computations which are then as-signed to different warps within a thread block. Fine-grain synchro-nization between warps is performed efficiently in hardware using producer-consumer named barriers. Partitioning computations us-ing warp specialization allows <b>Singe</b> to deal efficiently with the irregularity in both data access patterns and computation. Further-more, warp-specialized partitioning of computations allows <b>Singe</b> to fit extremely large working sets into on-chip memories. Finally, we describe the architecture and general compilation techniques necessary for constructing a warp-specializing compiler. We show that the warp-specialized code emitted by <b>Singe</b> is up to 3. 75 X faster than previously optimized data-parallel GPU kernels...|$|R
25|$|Exploding Snap is a wizarding {{card game}} in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron are held back from {{investigating}} why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because Fred and George delayed them with this game. Ron later <b>singed</b> his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In Cursed Child Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of Chamber of Secrets and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).|$|E
25|$|She {{was persuaded}} {{to return to}} work in 1914 for her company (Victor Film Company), which had been {{acquired}} by Universal Studios. During the filming of Pawns of Destiny in 1915, a staged fire got out of control. Lawrence was burned, her hair was <b>singed,</b> and she suffered a serious fall which fractured her spine. She went into shock for months. She returned to work, but collapsed after the film was completed. Blaming Solter for making her do the stunt in which she was injured, the two divorced. To add to her problems, Universal refused to pay her medical expenses, leaving Lawrence feeling betrayed. In mid-1916, she returned to work for Universal and completed another feature film, Elusive Isabel. However, the strain of working took its toll on her and she suffered a serious relapse. She was completely paralyzed for four months. In 1921, she traveled to Hollywood to attempt a comeback, but had little success. She received a leading role in a minor melodrama (The Unfoldment), and then two supporting roles. All her film work after 1924 would be in uncredited bit parts.|$|E

40|$|In this study, combed {{ring spun}} and compact spun cotton yarns with {{different}} counts {{were selected from}} different textile mills to conduct <b>singeing</b> treatment. Yarn properties including hairiness, fineness, unevenness and tensile properties were tested after the treatment {{and the results were}} compared with those before treatment. Hairiness was greatly removed after <b>singeing,</b> especially for short hairs with length less than 3 mm. Compact ring spun cotton yarns showed higher tex values and lower weight loss than combed ring spun cotton yarns under the same counts. Coefficient of variation of yarns increased slightly after <b>singeing</b> treatment. The unevenness of yarn was divided into two parts: basic unevenness of yarn body and hairiness unevenness, to explain the worse yarn evenness after <b>singeing</b> treatment. In this way, the effect of <b>singeing</b> on yarn properties was investigated thoroughly so as to improve yarn quality with less hairiness and good evenness. ...|$|R
