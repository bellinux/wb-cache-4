30|$|This study {{compared}} four mainstream classical {{machine learning}} methods and one deep learning method. The classical methods included random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and back-propagation {{artificial neural network}} (BP-ANN). We refer the readers to [32] for detailed introduction of the classical methods. The four classical methods were implemented using the functions of MATLAB R 2014 b. This study used 10 times 10 -fold cross-validation to evaluate the machine learning methods. For each of the cross-validations, the optimal parameters of each method were determined based on the nine folds of training samples, via grid search in the parameter space. Therefore, each cross-validation might have slightly different optimal parameters, and the average optimal values are reported here. The random forest contained 100 decision trees on average. The depth of each tree was controlled by a minimum leaf size of 1, the number of features used for each decision split was set to the square root of the total feature number. SVM used a Gaussian radial basis function as the kernel function, and the sequential minimal optimization method to find the separating hyperplane, its average kernel size was 2.0. AdaBoost used shallow decision trees as the weak classifiers, it included 300 shallow decision trees with a maximum <b>split</b> <b>number</b> equal to 1, the average learning rate was 0.1. ANN used two hidden layers with 50 and 26 neurons {{for the first and}} second layer, respectively, there were 1000 epochs, and the average learning rate was 0.04.|$|E
40|$|The {{constituents}} {{of the cosmic}} IR background (CIB) are studied at its peak wavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting Herschel/PACS observations of the GOODS-N, Lockman Hole, and COSMOS fields in the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) guaranteed-time survey. The GOODS-N data reach 3 sigma depths of ~ 3. 0 mJy at 100 um and ~ 5. 7 mJy at 160 um. At these levels, source densities are 40 and 18 beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um. Differential number counts extend from a few mJy up to 100 - 200 mJy, and are approximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mJy. The available ancillary information allows us to <b>split</b> <b>number</b> counts into redshift bins. At z<= 0. 5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (L(IR) ~ 1 e 11 Lsun), whose SEDs resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~ 130 um restframe and significantly colder than what is expected {{on the basis of}} pre-Herschel models. By integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, we obtain a surface brightness of 6. 36 +/- 1. 67 and 6. 58 +/- 1. 62 [nW m^- 2 sr^- 1] at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~ 45 % and ~ 52 % of the CIB, respectively. When stacking 24 um sources, the inferred CIB lies within 1. 1 sigma and 0. 5 sigma from direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50 % and 75 %. Most of this resolved CIB fraction was radiated at z<= 1. 0, with 160 um sources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones. Comment: Accepted for publication on the A&A Herschel Special Issu...|$|E
40|$|The <b>splitting</b> <b>number</b> of a link is {{the minimal}} number of {{crossing}} changes between different components required {{to convert it}} into a split link. We obtain a lower bound on the <b>splitting</b> <b>number</b> {{in terms of the}} (multivariable) signature and nullity. Although very elementary and easy to compute, this bound turns out to be suprisingly efficient. In particular, it makes it a routine check to recover the <b>splitting</b> <b>number</b> of 129 out of the 130 prime links with at most 9 crossings. Also, we easily determine 16 of the 17 <b>splitting</b> <b>numbers</b> that were studied by Batson and Seed using Khovanov homology, and later computed by Cha, Friedl and Powell using a variety of techniques.

40|$|AbstractSplitting a tree {{is defined}} as {{removing}} all edges of a chain and disconnecting {{one from the other}} edges incident with that chain.
