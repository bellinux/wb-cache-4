40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the failure {{probability}} of rubber sealing rings in reciprocating dynamic seal, a new structure of sealing ring based on bionics was designed. The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static seal and dynamic seal were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, medium pressure, speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed. The results show that von Mises stress of the biomimetic sealing ring distributed symmetrically in no-pressure <b>static</b> <b>sealing.</b> The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under medium pressure. Both von Mises stress and contact stress increase when precompression, medium pressure, and rubber hardness increase in <b>static</b> <b>sealing.</b> Biomimetic ring can avoid rolling and distortion in reciprocating dynamic seal, and its working life is much longer than O-ring and rectangular ring. The maximum von Mises stress and contact stress increase with the precompression, medium pressure, rubber hardness, and friction coefficient in reciprocating dynamic seal...|$|E

40|$|Leaking, {{friction}} and wear of seals are concerns for machine designers and users everywhere. Although perfect sealing {{may be the}} general aim, in practice, considering apparently identical seals in the same application, some may seal while some may not. This is due, at least in part, to surface-related random phenomena. Therefore, the importance of considering the reliability of sealed joints cannot be overemphasized. Up to now, there is no paper in the published literature about the reliability analysis of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints. All of these facts provide the motivation for the current research work. A computer simulation model for the leakage analysis of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints has been developed based on the percolation theory. The features of the leakage simulation model can be concluded as follows: (1) It reveals the effect of random properties of rough surfaces on the sealing performance and {{makes it possible to}} apply the statistical concepts in discussing the <b>sealing</b> reliability of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints; (2) It provides much simpler and more economic tool for the statistical analysis of leakage by computer simulation than by experiments; (3) It makes it possible to describe the leakage phenomenon more accurately using the leakage path model instead of the clearance between surface centre-lines; (4) It eliminates the need for individual asperity model of rough surfaces, because the actual digitized surface is used directly. The relationship between the leakage probability and the applied load, which is of great general interest to the designers of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints, has been predicted by the leakage simulation model. The simulated results show that for a given leakage probability, the required load will increase as the value of RMS o height a increases or the value of correlation length decreases. It is confirmed that a certain value of contact ratio can be used as the criterion for identifying the reliability of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints with a certain confidence level. The contact ratio criterion provides a simple, inexpensive and useful tool to evaluate the effects of rough surfaces, material properties and applied load on the <b>sealing</b> reliability of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints. However, in order to be of practical use, experimental work is required to evaluate its validity...|$|R

30|$|In {{cap rock}} research, most studies have {{concentrated}} on lithologic characterization, <b>static</b> <b>sealing</b> performance and mechanisms, or thickness and spatial distribution. Little has been published on dynamic cap rock evolution. Assessments of the sealing ability of the cover layer during the buried stage mainly correlate the porosity with the breakthrough pressure, only considering the effect of compaction on porosity. To consider only the rupture of rock caused by the change of formation, pressure in the uplift stage does not enable an accurate assessment of the sealing ability. For mechanistic studies on the microscopic sealing of different lithology covers, previous work has been conducted mostly on mudstone, with little attention to gypsum and dense carbonate rocks. For practical applications, more studies are required to investigate the relationships between different cover layers (regional cap rocks and direct cap rocks) {{and the distribution of}} oil and gas (Jin 2014).|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the concept of}} {{hydraulic}} amplification {{as a means of}} stroke amplification is explored for applications in MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). Building on the batch fabrication technologies of the semiconductor industry, MEMS technology could enable the simultaneous fabrication of multiple microhydraulic systems of which hydraulic amplifiers would form part. Precision lithography would furthermore make dense arrays of microhydraulic systems possible, with the eventual goal being to create high power density microscale actuation and power generation systems. This document provides an overview of the design considerations required for a successful microfabricated hydraulic amplifier, and proceeds to discuss the techniques developed to successfully fabricate, assemble and test such a device. Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) techniques were developed for creating strong tethered membrane structures using Silicon On Insulator (SOI) technology. Bonding techniques included silicon-silicon fusion bonding of fragile wafers and silicon-glass anodic bonding and alignment on the wafer and die level to produce multi-layered structures. Liquid filling of micromachined dead volumes through micron-size channels was performed. <b>Static</b> <b>sealing</b> techniques for leak-free sealing of micromachined, filled dead volumes with minimal seal compression and dynamic sealing techniques when quasi-static actuation is not a prerequisite were successfully developed. Using these techniques, several hydraulic amplification devices have been produced. Testing of these devices revealed good correlation with theoretical predictions. Stroke amplification ratios as high as 48 : 1 have been observed. In addition, natural frequencies of up to 10 kHz were measured. In conclusion, this work verifies the viability of hydraulic amplification for applications in microscale actuation systems. by J. Lodewyk Steyn. Thesis (S. M.)

5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the <b>static</b> interstage <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the <b>static</b> <b>seal.</b> If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the <b>static</b> and rotating <b>seal</b> elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|R
