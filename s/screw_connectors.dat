50|$|While wires may be crimped, {{they should}} not be heavily tinned with solder prior to {{installation}} in a screw terminal, since the soft metal will cold flow, resulting in a loose connection and possible fire hazard. <b>Screw</b> <b>connectors</b> sometimes come loose if not done up tightly enough at fitting time.

30|$|As {{the designs}} for timber {{structures}} grow larger and larger, contractors are increasingly using lag <b>screw</b> <b>connectors</b> in their projects [1]. The benefits of lag screw joints include less loosening and slippage when a load is first applied than bolted timber joints; however, they also require more caution, making construction management {{an important consideration}} [2]. For example, screwing in a lag screw without first drilling a pilot hole can cause the timber member to crack, or driven in using a hammer. In addition, overtightening beyond a lag screw’s pullout strength risks damaging the joint, weakening it compared with its original performance. One potential solution to prevent the latter scenario is to apply a torque control method to provide suitable torque {{by means of a}} torque wrench or other tool. However, no one has yet developed a torque control method for lag screw timber joints: contractors today rely on their own experiences and intuition when tightening lag <b>screw</b> <b>connectors,</b> an arbitrary judgment. Torque control methods involve different tightening speeds, because tools such as torque wrenches and nut runners are turned manually to provide torque. For metallic bolted joints, differences in tightening speed are known to result in different coefficients of friction and torque, important factors that determine the feasibility of a given torque control method as well as in variation in axial force (“clamp force” below) [3]. In a previous study on bolted timber joints, we discovered that the torque coefficient decreases at higher tightening speeds and were able to reduce fluctuations in the clamp force by setting the tightening speed to 20  rpm [4]. For lag screw timber joints, however, {{there appears to be no}} research that has clarified the effects of tightening speed on the torque coefficient. This point needs to be clarified, since construction management is more important for lag screw timber joints than for bolt joints, and because no torque control method has been established for lag screw timber joints. In a previous study, we developed a high damping shear wall in which timber members were joined together, or to steel plates, with lag screws or bolts. Tightening generates a clamp force, which in turn generates a frictional resistance force between two timber members, or between one and a steel plate [5]. Our later research investigated how to apply torque control methods to control this clamp force, a serious issue that must be addressed to control the expression of this frictional resistance force [6, 7]. One of the resulting challenges we faced in developing our high damping shear wall was how to determine the effects of lag screw tightening speed on the joint’s torque coefficient.|$|E

While a multitude of projects exist that simplify the electronics and software aspects of a robot, the same cannot be said for construction systems for robotics.

We have created three different construction systems (laser-cut <b>screw</b> <b>connectors,</b> printed friction-fit connectors, and printed hybrid connectors) using small aluminium T-slot extrusions, based on prior work done by Industrial Design college students. Eighty-six secondary school students and 35 teachers tested these three systems during a five-day robotics contest where they had to build firefighting robots. Follow-up questionnaires and an expert evaluation were {{used to measure the}} usability, affective appraisal and functionality of the three systems in order to determine which system should serve as a basis for further design iterations. Overall, a clear preference was shown for the hybrid system, which relies on its interlocking shape as well as on a screw connection to create robot frames that are both quick to construct and very rigid once assembled. We believe our work represents a solid first step toward an inexpensive, “hackable” construction system for educational robotics...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{behavior}} of the shear connections has a significant influence on both the load-carrying capacity and the bending stiffness of timber-concrete composite (TCC) beams. All the studies reported so far have concentrated {{on the performance of}} TCC connections in mature concrete. The performance of shear connections for TCC beams at early concrete ages, however, has not been investigated yet. This information is essential to evaluate the structural {{behavior of}} TCC floors or bridges during construction. In this paper, a total of 18 push-out tests with concrete ages ranging from 12 h to 28 days are performed, to investigate the early-age performance of lag screw shear connections in the lightweight concrete. Development of concrete strength with time is also analyzed. At the concrete ages shorter than 7 days, both the stiffness and strength of the <b>screw</b> <b>connectors</b> increase evidently with time, which follows the same growth trend with the concrete strength. After a 7 -day cure, screw shear connections reach almost 100 % of both the 28 -day serviceability slip modulus and shear strength. Material properties of the glulam and the screw fastener are decisive in the shear performance of connections when the concrete hardens to some degree. Based on the experimental results, the accuracy of the design methods proposed in Eurocode 5 is evaluated. In addition, by non-linear regression of the experiment data, expressions to predict the development of load-carrying capacity and serviceability slip modulus for screw shear connections before 28 days are established...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{load bearing}} steel deck {{is used in}} {{insulated}} metal deck roofing system for industrial buildings with low-pitched roof areas. The steel sheeting sections are manufactured with cold forming from thin steel strip and {{are attached to the}} underlying purlins or more commonly straight to the steel trusses by self-drilling or self-tapping screws. The behavior of sheeting connections is important in fire especially when the sheeting is in catenary action and tensile forces are devel-oped at supports where the <b>screw</b> <b>connectors</b> are located. A 3 D finite element model is created using ABAQUS software to simulate the single lap screw connections connecting thinner sheet (0. 8 mm) to thicker sheet (10 mm) under static shear at both room and high temperatures. This model considers the material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behav-ior. The connection model is analyzed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. The analysis reveals that the failure modes of the connection for both room and elevated temperatures are bearing failure of the thinner sheet. The load bearing capacity of the connections depends on the friction between the washer and the thinner sheet, the direct bearing of the screw shank against the thinner sheet and the postbuckling resistance of thinner sheet. Degradation of material at ele-vated temperature further reduces the strength and stiffness of the connections. This connection model can be taken as a component model in the analysis of the behavior of steel sheeting system in fire, which is highly non-linear so as to save the computing time...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of timber-concrete composite beams with mechanical shear connectors. The {{analysis of these}} structures is complex due to the discontinuity caused by slip at the interface between the timber and concrete and can only be achieved {{by the use of}} sophisticated analytical techniques. A literature review has been carried out highlighting the fact that only a limited amount of theoretical and experimental work exists on timber- concrete composite beams. The fundamental objectives of this study were to develop suitable analytical and experimental models so as to better understand the behaviour of these structures. Fifty seven push-out specimens and seven beams were tested {{in order to determine the}} load/slip characteristics of the coach <b>screw</b> <b>connectors</b> and how these influence the behaviour of the beams. It was found that the bond and friction at the timber-concrete interface had a significant effect on the behaviour of the joints and beams. Analyses were carried out using a fully non-linear finite element package, LUSAS. The finite element model developed consisted of standard two dimensional elements and the results from the beam tests were used in a validation exercise. In general, good agreement was obtained for the stiffness of the beams throughout their loading history. Studies were carried out using the analytical model to determine the influence of the main parameters on the stiffness of the beams. The connector stiffness and timber properties were found to have a strong influence while the concrete properties were not significant at working load level. Further analytical studies were carried out for a wide range of geometric properties. The information obtained was used in the formulation of a design procedure which allowed for slip at the interface of the beams. Recommendations are included for future research on timber-concrete composite beams...|$|E
40|$|A timber-concrete {{composite}} (TCC) combines {{timber and}} concrete, utilising the complementary properties of each material. The composite is designed {{in such a}} way that the timber resists combined tension and bending, whilst the concrete resists combined compression and bending. This construction technique can be used either in new build construction, or in refurbishment, for upgrading existing timber structures. Its use is most proliﬁc in continental Europe, Australasia, and the United States of America but has yet to be widely used in the United Kingdom. To date, the topping upgrades used have been 40 mm thick or greater. Depending on the choice of shear connection, this can lead to a four-fold increase in strength and stiffness of the ﬂoor. However, in many practical refurbishment situations, such a large increase in stiffness is not required, therefore a thinner topping can sufﬁce. The overarching aim of this study has been to develop a thin (20 mm) topping timber-concrete composite upgrade with a view to improving the serviceability performance of existing timber ﬂoors. Particular emphasis was given to developing an understanding of how the upgrade changes the stiffness and transient vibration response of a timber ﬂoor. Initially, an analytical study was carried out to deﬁne an appropriate topping thickness. An experimental testing programme was then completed to: characterise suitable shear connectors under static and cyclic loads, assess the beneﬁt of the upgrade to the short-term bending performance of panels and ﬂoors, and evaluate the inﬂuence of the upgrade on the transient vibration response of a ﬂoor. For refurbishing timber ﬂoors, a 20 mm thick topping sufﬁciently increased the bending stiffness and improved the transient vibration response. The stiffness of the <b>screw</b> <b>connectors</b> was inﬂuenced by the thickness of the topping and the inclination of the screws. During the short-term bending tests, the gamma method provided a non-conservative prediction of composite bending stiffness. In the majority of cases the modal frequencies of the ﬂoors tested increased after upgrade, whilst the damping ratios decreased. The upgrade system was shown to be robust as cracking of the topping did not inﬂuence the short-term bending performance of panels. Thin topping TCC upgrades offer a practical and effective solution to building practitioners, for improving the serviceability performance of existing timber ﬂoors...|$|E

In addition, the effect of friction at the interface between panels and with foundation can be taken into account.

40|$|In {{electrical}} engineering terminal connectors {{are commonly used}} for connecting and releasing electrical conductors. They are sophisticated mass products sufficient for high- and low power transmission or transmitting information. There are various applications for wiring in cars, control- or house installations and electrical power supply systems. Depending on the electrical current to be transmitted and consequently the wire diameter there are several approaches to realize a durable and safe mechanical connection between the conductors. The electrical contact resistance of such systems {{is defined by the}} constriction- and the film resistance. The constriction resistance heavily depends on the contact or load force. If the connection becomes loose, this force decreases or even disappears, which results in an extensive raise of the temperature in the contact area. The current density is locally increasing on certain connection points. The raised temperature may lead to unwanted operational states or even fire. There are a few mechanical solutions to realize a constant or re-adjusting contact force. However, these approaches are mechanically complex and hence cost intensive. In this paper we present the development and experimental investigation of a self-adjusting terminal connector based on shape-memory alloys (SMA) which is far less complex than currently known mechanical solutions. The compensation of the decreasing contact force is realized by a precompressed SMA cylinder, which is located in a drill hole {{at the bottom of the}} terminal <b>connector’s</b> <b>screw.</b> Under normal conditions the terminal works similar to a conventional <b>screw</b> <b>connector.</b> In case of decreasing contact forces, the increasing contact resistance results in a rising temperature. As soon as the austenite start temperature is reached the SMA cylinder starts to expand and resets the contact force. As a result the system cools down and the SMA cylinder keeps a desired contact force. In this paper we present the general design of such a system and ist limitations.

One {{of the advantages of}} LVL is high bending strength among the engineering timber due to the parallel {{laminated veneer}}. Thus it replaced the timber as joist in TCC to produce higher strength of flooring system and name as LVL-concrete composite (LCC). But due to the light-weight of LCC in long span, it might highly susceptible to vibration by service load. Therefore the main objective of this research is to study the vibration behavior of Malaysian LCC in various parameters such as concrete topping thickness, span length and stiffness connector; and full scale flooring system by using SAP 2000 finite element modeling.

40|$|The orthobiom™ non-fusion {{scoliosis}} correction system {{consists of}} two longitudinal rods, polyaxial pedicle screws, mobile and fixed connectors and a cross-connector. The mobile connectors can move along and around the rod, thus allowing length adaptation during growth. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of different features of this novel implant on intervertebral rotations, to calculate the movement of the mobile connectors along the rods for different loading cases and to compare the results with those of a rigid implant construct. A finite element analysis was performed using six versions (M 1 –M 6) of a three-dimensional, nonlinear model of a spine ranging from T 3 to L 2. The models were loaded with pure moments of 7. 5  N m in the three main anatomical planes. First, the validated intact model (M 1) was studied. Then, the orthobiom™ implant system was inserted, bridging the segments between T 4 and L 1 (M 2). The effect of pedicle screws only in every second vertebrae was investigated (M 3). For comparison, three connection variations of screws and rods were investigated: (1) an implant with rigid <b>screws</b> and mobile <b>connectors</b> (M 4), (2) an implant with non-locking polyaxial <b>screws</b> and fixed <b>connectors</b> (M 5) and (3) a completely rigid implant construct (M 6). For flexion, extension and lateral bending, intervertebral rotation was reduced at all implant levels due to the implants. A rigid implant construct (M 6) and an implant with non-locking polyaxial <b>screws</b> and fixed <b>connectors</b> (M 5) led to the strongest reduction of intervertebral rotation. The orthobiom™ non-fusion implant system (M 2, M 3) allowed much more intervertebral rotation than a rigid implant (M 6). Differences in intervertebral rotations were small when polyaxial screws were placed at every second level only (M 3) instead of at every level (M 2). For axial rotation, intervertebral rotation was strongly reduced by a rigid implant construct (M 6) and by an implant with rigid <b>screws</b> and mobile <b>connectors</b> (M 4). For rotation, an implant with non-locking polyaxial screws (M 2, M 3, M 5) led to nearly the same intervertebral rotations as in an intact spine without an implant (M 1). The predicted maximum translation of the mobile connectors along the rod was 4. 2  mm for extension, 3. 1  mm for lateral bending, 1. 6  mm for flexion and 0. 8  mm for axial rotation. The movement of the connectors was highest for those closest to the ends of the rods. With rigid screws, the maximum translation was significantly reduced. This study, conducted under a load-controlled loading protocol, showed that intervertebral rotation was reduced much less by the non-fusion orthobiom™ system than by a rigid implant.

The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may terminate cables. Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or insulation displacement. Female connectors have bail locks for a sturdy connection to the male <b>connector.</b> <b>Screws</b> may also be employed to secure connections.|$|R

Local and systemic effects such as tissue necrosis, osteolysis and malignant cell transformation caused by implants have been described. Increasing tissue concentration and whole blood levels of ions are necessary before a disease caused by a contaminant develops. The aim {{of the present study}} was the measurement of whole blood titanium levels and the evaluation of a possible correlation between these changes and the number of fused segments. Methods A prospective study was designed to determine changes in whole blood titanium levels after spinal fusion and to analyze the correlation to the number of pedicle <b>screws,</b> cross <b>connectors</b> and interbody devices implanted. Blood samples were taken preoperatively in group I (n[*]=[*] 15), on the first, second and 10 th day postoperatively, as well as 3 and 12 [*]months after surgery. Group II (n[*]=[*] 16) served as a control group of volunteers who did not have any metal implants in the body. Blood samples were taken once in this group. The number of screw-rod-connections and the length of the spinal fusion were determined using radiographic pictures. This study was checked and approved by the ethical committee of the University of Tuebingen. Results The mean age in group I was 47 [*]±[*] 22 [*]years (range 16 - 85 [*]years). There were three male (20 %) and twelve female (80 %) patients. The median number of fused segments was 5 (range 1 to 11 segments). No statistically significant increase in the titanium level was seen 12 [*]months after surgery (mean difference: - 7. 2 [*]μg/l, 95 % CI: - 26. 9 to 12. 5 [*]μg/l, p[*]=[*] 0. 446). By observing the individual titanium levels, 4 out of 15 patients demonstrated an increase in titanium levels 12 [*]months after surgery. No statistically significant correlation between fused segments (r[*]=[*]- 0. 188, p[*]=[*] 0. 503) length of instrumentation (r[*]=[*]- 0. 329, p[*]=[*] 0. 231), number of interbody devices (r[*]=[*]- 0. 202, p[*]=[*] 0. 291) and increase of titanium levels over the observation period was seen. Conclusions Instrumented spinal fusion does not lead to a statistically significant increase in whole blood titanium levels. There seems to be no correlation between the number of pedicle <b>screws,</b> cross <b>connectors</b> and interbody devices implanted and the increase of serum titanium levels. </p...|$|R
