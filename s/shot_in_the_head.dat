5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by a <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back.

Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames {{leading up to the}} frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene.
