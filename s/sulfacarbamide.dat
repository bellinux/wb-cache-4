40|$|Various {{sulfonamides}} and trimethoprim {{were given}} orally {{twice a day}} to healthy volunteers. The drug concentrations in serum and tissue fluid from skin blisters were determined concomitantly. Maximal serum concentrations were obtained after 1 to 3 h. Absorption of <b>sulfacarbamide</b> and sulfadimidine was more rapid than for sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. The penetration to blister fluid was delayed and maximal concentrations were usually reached after 4 to 8 h. The highest penetration to blister fluid was found for <b>sulfacarbamide,</b> sulfadiazine, and trimethoprim. During maintenance therapy sulfadiazine and trimethoprim gave blister fluid concentrations usually above 50 % of the serum level. However, {{on the basis of}} dosage the highest sulfonamide concentration both in serum and blister fluid was obtained with sulfamethoxazole...|$|E
