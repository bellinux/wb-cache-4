5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} the lake to explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lake.|$|E

5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E

50|$|Digestion {{begins in}} the mouth. First, the animal selects pieces of forage and picks up finer foods, such as grain, with sensitive, prehensile, lips. The front teeth of the horse, called incisors, nip off forage, and food is ground up for <b>swallowing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> premolars and molars.|$|R
5|$|Regulations for the {{performance}} of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000. While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures. When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades, Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square, only an orchestra would be used because voices would be <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> echo.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a {{neighborhood}} street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E

50|$|The pale-footed swallow has {{a flight}} call {{frequently}} {{described as a}} dzreet. Their call can be differentiated from the call of <b>the</b> similar blue-and-white <b>swallow</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that it is}} drier than that of the blue-and-white swallow. These swallows also have been known to use a call described as a trilled tre-e-e-ed. The song is a series of trills and thin warbles. The song is described as buzzy, but musical.|$|R
25|$|The {{myth of the}} Sun and Moon being {{swallowed}} by some kind of predator is also found throughout multiple Indo-European language groups. In Norse mythology, the Sun goddess (Sól) and Moon god (Máni) are <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wolves Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson. In Hinduism, the Sun god (Surya) and Moon god (Chandra) are <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demon serpents Rahu and Ketu, resulting in eclipses.|$|E

60|$|Of his shorter pieces, {{the three}} Elegies on Birds are well deserving of notice. That {{entitled}} the Blackbirds is so prettily imagined, and so neatly expressed, {{that it is}} worth a long poem. Thrice has Shenstone mentioned it in his Letters, {{in such a manner}} as to show how much it had pleased him. The Goldfinches is only less excellent. He has spoiled <b>the</b> <b>Swallows</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> seriousness of the moral.|$|R

25|$|No {{one thought}} that the actual {{isolated}} and long-abandoned original site at Jamestown Island would be suitable. Jamestown had no facilities for large crowds, and the fort housing the Jamestown Settlement was {{believed to have been}} long-ago <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> James River. However, there was an assumption {{in many parts of the}} state that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.|$|E
25|$|During the {{planning}} phase, {{virtually no one}} thought that the original site of Jamestown would be suitable, as it was isolated and long-abandoned. There were no local facilities to handle large crowds, and {{it was believed that}} the fort housing the settlement had long ago been <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> James River. No rail lines ran near Jamestown. Many Virginia residents thought that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.|$|E

25|$|As {{a celebration}} was planned, {{virtually}} no one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was {{believed to have been}} long ago <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> James River. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of rail travel before automobiles were common.|$|E
25|$|The Tainted – Where {{the other}} Nazgûl were slowly <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, {{vegetation}} withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope. The Tainted {{is one of}} the Nazgûl, representing their withering, abhorrent nature. His mounted model is built to look as though his horse were sickened and dying by merely being near him.|$|E
25|$|Sauron, who by {{the second}} {{millennium}} of the Second Age was nearly defeated by the Elves, {{took advantage of the}} division. He surrendered to the last Númenórean King, Ar-Pharazôn, and worked his way into the King's counsels. Ultimately, Sauron advised him to attack Valinor under the ruse that doing so would allow the king to claim immortality. This he foolishly did, and as punishment Númenor was <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sea. However, some of the Faithful escaped and founded the twin kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor.|$|E

25|$|Brittany {{is closely}} {{associated}} with the Matter of Britain and King Arthur. According to Wace, Brocéliande is located in Brittany and it is nowadays considered to be Paimpont forest. There, ruins of a castle surrounded by a lake are associated with the Lady of the Lake, a dolmen is said to be Merlin's tomb and a path is presented as Morgan le Fay's Val sans Retour. Tristan and Iseult are also said to have lived in Brittany. Another major Breton legend is the story about Ys, a city <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ocean.|$|E
25|$|The album {{consists}} of five tracks with song durations ranging from 7 to 17 minutes {{that deal with}} events and {{people who had been}} important in Newsom's life in the year previous to recording. These events include the sudden death of Newsom's best friend, a continuing illness and a tumultuous relationship. The album was named after the city of Ys, which according to myth was built on the coast of Brittany and later <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ocean. The albums' title was the last element to be confirmed and was a result of a dream that Joanna had which featured the letters Y and S and a book recommended by a friend that contained reference to the myth.|$|E
25|$|And amid this {{sorrow and}} heroism {{where so many}} {{brothers}} of Zeta Psi perished, so too were even whole chapters <b>swallowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> War. The Eta (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, chartered 1861), Psi Epsilon (Dartmouth), Upsilon (UNC), Epsilon (Brown), and Theta (Union) chapters had vanished {{by the end of}} the conflict, decimated by fallen brothers or disheartened campuses returning from the shadow of death. The Theta and Eta chapters would never survive the staggering losses they suffered, though the others ultimately recovered and reactivated. And the Gamma chapter—chartered 1861 at the Georgia Military Institute, the only new chapter during the War—was annihilated utterly by General Sherman's march, and existed thus only for those few years of tumult. But out of the shadow of war came regrowth and a time for Zeta Psi to expand once more.|$|E
