40|$|To {{determine}} whether susceptibility to motion sickness provoked by unexpected movement {{is associated with}} susceptibility to visually induced motion sickness in migraine <b>sufferers.</b> Migraine <b>sufferers</b> are unusually susceptible to motion sickness, but the mechanism of this susceptibility is not well understood. Possibilities include vestibular dysfunction secondary to vasomotor disturbances during migraine attacks, hyperexcitability of brainstem circuits that produce symptoms of motion sickness and migraine, and heightened susceptibility to visual illusions of movement. A motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire that listed common triggers of motion sickness was filled out by 42 migraine <b>sufferers</b> and 39 headache-free controls of similar age and sex distribution to migraine <b>sufferers.</b> A greater proportion of migraine <b>sufferers</b> than controls reported that traveling in cars and buses, reading in the car, using playground equipment, watching wide-screen movies and movement simulators, induced motion sickness. However, visually induced motion sickness appeared to be independent of motion sickness to most movement-related stimuli in migraine <b>sufferers.</b> The lack of association between susceptibility to movement-induced and visually induced motion sickness implies {{that more than one}} mechanism increases susceptibility to motion sickness in migraine <b>sufferers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity {{to light}} was {{investigated}} 5 and 8 h after consumption of an amino acid drink which contained L-tryptophan (balanced amino acid condition: 19 controls and 22 migraine <b>sufferers)</b> or which produced a short-term reduction in brain serotonin synthesis by omitting L-tryptophan (tryptophan depletion condition: 16 controls and 16 migraine <b>sufferers).</b> Migraine <b>sufferers</b> reported more intense nausea, headache, glare- and light-induced pain than controls. In addition, glare- and light-induced pain were {{greater in the}} tryptophan depletion condition than in the balanced amino acid condition, in both migraine <b>sufferers</b> and controls. Eight hours after the amino acid drink, after participants had completed tests of pain sensitivity and motion sickness provocation, tryptophan depletion augmented headache in migraine <b>sufferers</b> and aggravated nausea in migraine <b>sufferers</b> and controls. These findings suggest that a reduction in brain synthesis of serotonin intensifies photophobia and other migrainous symptoms and thus might contribute to the pathogenesis of migraine...|$|R

The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the <b>sufferer</b> to stoop.

40|$|Rosacea is {{a chronic}} skin disorder, {{characterized}} by redness and flushing of the cheeks, nose, chin or forehead. It {{has been proposed}} that rosacea {{is a result of}} frequent blushing (Miller, 1921; Klaber & Whittkower, 1939). However, the relationship between rosacea and blushing is uncertain. The aim of the present research was to investigate the relationship between psychological stress and vascular disturbances in rosacea. Five studies were conducted. The first study explored the relationship between rosacea and mental health while the next two investigated vascular responses in rosacea <b>sufferers</b> and controls to acetylcholine (which induces endothelial vasodilatation and axon reflexes) and psychological stress (embarrassment). The fourth study aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} psychological indicators and rosacea symptoms on a daily basis. The fifth study consisted of three case studies looking at the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Task Concentration Training (TCT) with rosacea <b>sufferers</b> presenting with social anxiety and fear of blushing symptoms. In study 1, sixty-two participants were asked to complete the Blushing Propensity Scale (BPS), Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS). Outcomes from the first study indicated that Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> (n= 12) perceived themselves as blushing more frequently and intensely than Type 1 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> (n= 19) or controls (n= 31). This suggested that Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> experiencing frequent blushing may have a lower sensitivity threshold to blushing episodes. In addition, Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> perceived themselves as more stressed than Type 1 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> or controls, possibly indicating that managing the condition can be stressful. Contrary to previous reports (Gupta et al., 2006; National Rosacea Society, 2005) severity of rosacea was not associated with depression, social anxiety or fear of negative evaluation. However, a few participants who reported high social anxiety and stress scores were offered psychological intervention (Study 5). The aim of the second study was to investigate vascular responses in rosacea <b>sufferers.</b> Cutaneous endothelial and axon reflex function was assessed using an acetylcholine dose response curve. The axon reflex was assessed by inducing a flare with ACh iontophoresis. Outcomes from this study indicated that Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> had a greater axon reflex response than Type 1 rosacea <b>sufferers.</b> Thus over-reactivity of the axon reflex in Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> might contribute to prolonged vasodilatation. However, cutaneous endothelial responses to ACh were similar in rosacea and control groups. The results suggested that neural pathways mediated the flushing response rather than cutaneous endothelial function. The third study investigated facial blood flow while participants attempted laboratory induced embarrassment tasks. Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> were found to have a greater blood flow in the facial region than Type 1 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> during singing and speech tasks, suggesting that Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> blushed more than type 1 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> or controls. Furthermore, Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> reported higher embarrassment and blushing ratings than Type 1 rosacea <b>sufferers.</b> This indicated that Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> perceived themselves as emotionally more aroused than other participants. Taken together, it would appear that a combination of physiological and cognitive factors increased facial blood flow in Type 2 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> in laboratory induced embarrassment tasks. The fourth study explored the relationship between stress and symptoms of rosacea. Using a diary, 15 rosacea <b>sufferers</b> recorded their stress, anxiety and mood and their intensity of rosacea symptoms daily. Stress was associated with increased stinging/facial redness on the same day for 1 to 2 months. Furthermore, it was associated with increased stinging ratings the next day. However, feeling anxious or having low mood was not related to increase stinging the next day. The presence of increased stress found in rosacea participants on the day where stinging and redness occurred should be taken into consideration when formulating psychological interventions for rosacea <b>sufferers.</b> In study 5, individual psychological intervention was provided to three participants experiencing stress, fear of blushing and social anxiety symptoms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Task Concentration Training (TCT) were helpful in managing stress, anxiety and fear of blushing symptoms in individual rosacea <b>sufferers.</b> Encouragingly, all participants reported a gain in their repertoire of strategies and showed a decrease in anxiety symptoms on assessment questionnaires following their intervention. Replication of the intervention protocol and investigation of other psychological approaches are required to establish best practise outcome for rosacea <b>sufferers</b> who require psychological interventions. The present findings suggest that over-reactivity of axon reflexes contributes to facial flushing. In addition, emotional flushing in rosacea <b>sufferers</b> appears to be maintained by a combination of cognitive and physiological factors. On a clinical level, the study recommends that emotional stress associated with facial flushing in rosacea <b>sufferers</b> to be targeted for psychological intervention...|$|R

As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a <b>sufferer</b> of insanity.|$|E
