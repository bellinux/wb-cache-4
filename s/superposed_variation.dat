30|$|The {{variations}} of superposed geomagnetic indices (SYM-H and AE) display significantly different features {{before the event}} initiation (zero epoch time) and little differences during the event interval between the SH- and the H-events. For the SH-events, the geomagnetic activity as displayed in the {{variations of}} SYM-H (~− 48 nT) and AE (~ 500 nT) is quite enhanced before zero epoch time due to the previous geomagnetic storm main phase. The low peak value of the <b>superposed</b> <b>variation</b> {{is due to the}} lack of coincidence of the peak storm phases of different storms. However, a signature of the end of storm main phase ~ 6 h prior to the HILDCAA initiation may be noted in the temporal display of the superposed SYM-H indices. For the H-events, variations of SYM-H and AE indicate weak enhancements of ring current and auroral activity only after zero epoch time (during the HILDCAA interval). The latter interval occurs after geomagnetic calm (Tsurutani et al. 1995). During the HILDCAA interval, the SYM-H and AE values are slightly enhanced for the SH-events (~− 43 and 570 nT, respectively) over those for the H-events (~− 27 and 530 nT, respectively).|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{the daily}} {{variation}} of cosmic ray intensity by power spectral techniques have been essentially limited {{in the past to}} demonstrating the existence of peaks at frequencies corresponding to the 24 -hour (diurnal) wave and its harmonics. The Fourier analysis technique has largely been used in many detailed investigations {{of the daily}} variation. A recent comparative study of both techniques over five solar rotations has revealed the correspondence between the two techniques and the suitability of the power spectral method in relating cosmic ray observations to interplanetary parameters. The study of the daily variation of the cosmic ray intensity over a long interval, extending, for example, over the 11 -year solar cycle, is complicated by other types of <b>superposed</b> <b>variations.</b> An analysis of real data can be considerably facilitated by a power spectral study using simulated input incorporating different artificial but physically based variations. The present study utilizes, in the simulation data, the known average characteristics of the daily variation as well as other variations present in real data. Power spectra are then calculated from a series of test data sets, each of which consists of hourly values for an interval of 27 days. The essential parameters relating to the peaks of the daily variation are tabulated. The study demonstrates the effects of <b>superposed</b> <b>variations</b> (starting from the simple case of a pure sinusoid) on power spectral features. The ambient power (background power level under the diurnal peak) is found to be dependent on the day-to-day phase changes in the daily variation. The realistic magnitude of the random noise is observed to have large observable effects in the power at the high frequencies only. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|A {{photometric}} {{study of}} the Near Contact Binary (NCB) system V 609 Aql reveals {{it to be the}} westernmost star of a close double, with brightness variations and implied parameters more extreme than those derived in an earlier photographic study, in which images of the variable and companion were almost certainly blended. The system's brightness variations exhibit deep primary eclipses (δ V = 1. 04) and secondary eclipses (δ V = 0. 44) matched to a model fit with a derived orbital inclination of i = 84. 8 ± 0. 2 degrees and estimated component spectral types of F 8 -F 9 and K 2 -K 3. The primary overfills its Roche lobe in the optimum eclipse solution, inconsistent with the definition of NCBs. Period changes in the system are studied from 23 published times of light minimum and 21 newly-established values: 18 from examination of archival Harvard plates, and 3 from ASAS data and new CCD observations. O-C variations from 1891 to 2007 exhibit a long-term parabolic trend indicative of a period decrease, dP/dt = -(7. 75 ± 1. 39) x 10 ^- 8 d/yr, corresponding to mass transfer to the secondary of (6. 5 pm 1. 2) x 10 ^- 8 SM/yr. <b>Superposed</b> <b>variations</b> may indicate fluctuations in the mass flow.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the time-dependent response of hot element wall shear stress gages in unsteady periodic air flows is reported. The study has focused on wall shear stress in laminar oscillating flows produced on a flat plate by a free stream velocity composed of a mean component and a <b>superposed</b> sinusoidal <b>variation.</b> Two types of hot element gages, platinum film and flush wire, were tested for values of reduced frequency ranging from 0. 14 to 2. 36. Values of the phase angle of the wall shear stress variation relative to the free stream velocity, {{as indicated by the}} hot element gages, are compared with numerical prediction.

40|$|The time {{dependent}} response {{characteristics of}} flush-mounted hot element gauges used as instruments to measure wall shear stress in unsteady periodic air flows were investigated. The study was initiated because anomalous results {{were obtained from}} the gauges in oscillating turbulent flows for the phase relation of the wall shear stress variation, indicating possible gauge response problems. Flat plate laminar oscillating turbulent flows characterized by a mean free stream velocity with a <b>superposed</b> sinusoidal <b>variation</b> were performed. Laminar rather than turbulent flows were studied, because a numerical solution for the phase angle between the free stream velocity and the wall shear stress variation that is known to be correct can be obtained. The focus is on comparing the phase angle indicated by the hot element gauges with corresponding numerical prediction for the phase angle, since agreement would indicate that the hot element gauges faithfully follow the true wall shear stress variation...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a project}} to better {{characterize}} comparatively bright but so far little studied cataclysmic variables in the southern hemisphere, we have obtained spectroscopic and photometric data of the nova-like variables LS IV - 08 ^ o 3 and HQ Mon, and of the Z Cam type dwarf nova ST Cha. The spectra of all systems are as expected for their respective types. We derive improved orbital ephemeris of LS IV - 08 ^ o 3 and map its accretion disk {{in the light of}} the Hα emission using Doppler tomography. We find that the emission has a two component origin, arising in the outer parts of the accretion disk and possibly on the illuminated face of the secondary star. The light curve of LS IV - 08 ^ o 3 exhibits a low level of flickering and indications for a modulation on the orbital period. Spectroscopy of HQ Mon suggests an orbital period of ≈ 5. 15 hours which is incompatible with previous (uncertain) estimates. The light curves show the typical low scale flickering of UX UMa type nova-like systems, <b>superposed</b> upon <b>variations</b> on longer time scales. During one night a modulation with a period of ≈ 41 min is observed, visible for at least 4 hours. However, it does not repeat itself in other nights. A spectroscopic orbital period of ≈ 5. 5 hours is derived for ST Cha. A previously suspected period of 6. 8 hours (or alternatively 9. 6 hours), based on historical photographic photometry is incompatible with the spectroscopic period.

40|$|Aims. For {{the past}} 25 years, BW Vulpeculae {{has been the}} topic of period {{analyses}} centered on a secular period change with a periodic <b>variation</b> <b>superposed,</b> presumed {{to be due to}} light time effects in a binary system. According to this paradigm, one would expect what seems like a period increase of about 0. 5 s during or soon after the year 2001. Methods. I have continued photometric monitoring through the year 2012, adding 35 new timings of maximum and minimum light. Results. This expected change in period did not occur, which rules out that interpretation of the period variation. As of 2012, the observed timings are about two hours early compared to those predicted by the quadratic ephemeris, but are very close to those predicted by the linear ephemeris. Conclusions. In fact, the period has remained constant for the last 32 years, indicating that the previous epochs of constant period are almost certainly the correct interpretation, though the cause of the period changes is still not clear. Continued photometric monitoring of BW Vul leads {{to the conclusion that the}} period changes are abrupt, followed by epochs of constant period lasting between 12 and at least 32 years...|$|R
40|$|A part of {{activities}} of Laboratory for low-level Radioactivities of the Ruđer Bošković Institute, Zagreb, Croatia, {{is devoted to}} monitoring 3 H in precipitation and 14 C in the atmosphere and biosphere. An overview of the results and comparison with the global trends {{is presented in the}} talk. Results of monitoring 14 C activity in the atmosphere and in biological samples {{in the vicinity of the}} Nuclear Power Plant Krško in Slovenia, about 30 km from Zagreb, are also presented. Activity concentration of 3 H was measured by gas proportional counting technique until 2007 and since 2008 by liquid scintillation counting after electrolytic enrichment. A gas proportional counting technique for 14 C was replaced by liquid scintillation counting following either benzene synthesis or direct absorption of CO 2. Long-term data on 3 H activity concentration in monthly precipitation in Zagreb and Ljubljana (Slovenia) exist for the period since 1976 and 1981, respectively, while for shorter periods of time the data exist for several stations along the Adriatic coast and for the continental station Plitvice Lakes (Croatia). The long-term data records show seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>superposed</b> on the basic decreasing trend of mean annual values. The data recorded during last 2 decades, however, show almost constant mean annual 3 H activity concentration of about 9 TU for the continental stations, while for coastal stations lower values were observed. Data for 14 C activity in the atmospheric CO 2 in Zagreb are available for period 1985 – 2016, while data for Plitvice Lakes are not continuous. A systematic decreasing trend of - 0. 46 ± 0. 04 pMC per year is observed for Zagreb atmospheric CO 2 in period 1993 – 2016 with seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>superposed</b> on the trend. The winter minima in atmospheric 14 CO 2 activity are systematically lower than 100 pMC, probably due to the contribution of fossil fuel combustion in the city area. Systematic and continuous monitoring 14 C activity in atmospheric CO 2 and biological samples (mostly apples, vegetable, cereals, corn) in the vicinity of the Nuclear Power Plant Krško (NEK) in Slovenia has been performed since 2006. The 14 C activity of atmospheric CO 2 at two locations inside the NEK area is on the average slightly higher than that in Zagreb. It depends on the 14 C activity released in air-born effluent. The influence of the 14 C releases has been observed also in plants. Higher 14 C activity in plants is most pronounced shortly after spring refuelling, when plants use atmospheric CO 2 that contains 14 C released from NEK. The influence of the released air-born 14 C activity is measurable in both atmospheric CO 2 and in plants; the higher the activity of gaseous effluent, the higher the atmospheric and plant 14 C activity. However, the influence is temporally and spatially limited. Average 14 C activity in plants at the control location Dobova does not differ from the average atmospheric 14 C activity in Zagreb...|$|R

The broadband fluxes (B, V, R, and I), the spectrophotometric optical continuum flux Fλ(5177 Å), integrated emission-line fluxes of Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He I λ 5876, and He II λ 4686 all show a nearly monotonic increase with episodes of milder short-term <b>variations</b> <b>superposed.</b> The amplitude {{of the continuum}} variations increases with decreasing wavelength (4400 - 9000 Å). The optical continuum variations follow the variations in the ultraviolet and X-ray with time delays, measured from the centroids of the crosscorrelation functions, typically around 5 days, but with uncertainties also typically around 5 days; zero time delay between the high-energy and low-energy continuum variations cannot be ruled out. The strong optical emission lines Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He I λ 5876 respond to the high-energy continuum variations with time delays typically about 20 days, with uncertainties of about 8 days. There {{is some evidence that}} He II λ 4686 responds somewhat more rapidly, with a time delay of around 10 days, but again, the uncertainties are quite large (~ 8 days).

We show that the underlying supernova 2003 dh evolved faster than, and was probably somewhat fainter than the type Ic SN 1998 bw, associated with GRB 980425. We find that our data can be described by a broken power-law decay perturbed by a complex variable component. The early- and late-time decay slopes are determined to be ~ 1. 1 and ~ 2, respectively. Assuming this single power-law model, we constrain the break to lie between ~ 3 and ~ 8 days after the burst. This simple, singly-broken power-law model, derived only from the analysis of our optical observations, may also account for available multi-band data, provided that the break happened ~ 8 days after the burst. The more complex double-jet model of Berger et al. provides a comparable fit to the optical, X-ray, mm and radio observations of this event. We detect a significant change in optical colors during the first day. Our color analysis is consistent with a cooling break frequency sweeping through the optical band during the first day.

40|$|Abstract The phenylpropenoid glycosides rosavin, rosarin, rosin {{summarised}} as ‘total rosavins’ are {{quality indicators}} of Rhodiola rosea L. Here we report the systematic quantification of these glycosides and the aglycon cinnamyl alcohol in various provenances cultivated homogenously at 1580 m altitude. (I) We examined rhizomes versus roots in cultivation year 9 (20 provenances). Extracts (70 % ethanol) contained 0. 5 – 4. 3 mg/mL (rhizomes) and 0. 4 – 2. 5 mg/mL (roots) total rosavins. The rosavin/cinnamyl alcohol ratio (average rhizomes 8. 1 : 1, roots 6. 2 : 1), was more influenced by plant origin than plant part. We additionally analysed salidroside including its aglycon tyrosol. The rosavins/salidroside ratios (including aglycons) of 6. 4 : 1 (rhizome) and 5. 5 : 1 (root) indicated authentic R. rosea independent of plant part and origin. (II) Rhizomes extracts (8 provenances) from various dates during years 6 and 7 contained 0. 4 – 4. 8 mg/mL total rosavins corresponding to 0. 2 – 3. 0 % {{in the dry}} drug. Age (decreasing trend) and provenance impact were <b>superposed</b> by seasonal <b>variation</b> with a phenylpropenoid peak in spring. Rosavin/cinnamyl alcohol ratios in North European plants were 3 – 8 : 1, for Alpine/Pyrenean plants 9 – 14 : 1. (III) Compared to our previous dataset from cultivation in South England, on average, there was no major difference between phenylpropenoid values from cultivation at 65 m and 1580 m apart from moderately more cinnamyl alcohol at higher altitude. As per provenance, absolute values were site dependent but phenylpropenoid glycoside/aglycon ratios consistent. In conclusion, {{this is the first}} systematic investigation for a high altitude cultivation of R. rosea demonstrating the major extent plant part, season and age influence absolute phenylpropenoid values. In contrary, relative phenolic compound profiles are mostly origin-determined, independent of cultivation conditions and site, and could be used for authentication in quality control...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} interaction between a series of progressive gravity waves and an overlying airflow. A critical review of the existing literature is made, from which it is concluded that although {{a large number of}} wind-wave interactions have been proposed, few have been verified experimentally. Furthermore, virtually no consideration has been given to the effect of the airflow on the underlying wave motion. A comprehensive experimental investigation of {{the interaction between}} wind and waves has therefore been undertaken. In respect of the airflow, a complete set of kinematics measurements, involving both horizontal and vertical velocity data, is presented. The mean, wave-induced and fluctuating velocities are presented in a wave-following frame of reference. The flow streamlines are deduced from the measured velocity data, and the structure of the airflow examined in detail. Analysis of the velocity profiles using boundary layer theory enables the effects of the flow structure identified above to be quantified and an assessment of the surfece stresses made. A corresponding set of kinematics measurements were undertaken in the underlying water flow. The wind-induced currents and wave kinematics are examined. Numerical models to predict the wave motion in combined wind-wave field are developed. The models incorporate the effects of a wind-induced current and the varying surface stresses, and allow the relative importance of each of these effects to be investigated. Furthermore, measurements of the water surface elevation are used to investigate the modification to the underlying long waves caused by the airflow, {{and the nature of the}} <b>superposed</b> wind-waves. The <b>variation</b> in the properties of the wind-generated waves with the phase of the long waves are also examined. Finally, the fundamental mechanisms of wind-wave interaction are considered, and the relative importance of the various mechanisms assessed. The implications for the oflfehore engineer, in terms of wind loading, gas ventilation and wave loading are outlined. Open Acces...|$|R

Augmented with published observations of this GRB, the compiled optical data set contains 2687 photometric measurements, obtained between 78 minutes and 79 days after the burst. This data set allows us to follow the photometric evolution of the transient with unprecedented detail. We use the data to constrain the light curve of the underlying supernova (SN) 2003 dh and show that it evolved faster than and was probably somewhat fainter than the Type Ic SN 1998 bw, associated with GRB 980425. We find that our data can be described by a broken power-law decay perturbed by a complex variable component. The early- and late-time decay slopes are determined to be alpha(1) approximate to 1. 1 and alpha(2) approximate to 2. Assuming this single-break power-law model, we constrain the break to lie between similar to 3 and similar to 8 days after the burst. This simple, singly broken power-law model, derived only from the analysis of our optical observations, may also account for available multiband data, provided that the break happened similar to 8 days after the burst. The more complex double-jet model of Berger et al. provides a comparable fit to the optical, X-ray, millimeter, and radio observations of this event.

40|$|Through the {{photometric}} {{observations of}} the near-contact binary, XZ CMi, new BV light curves were secured and seven times of minimum light were determined. An intensive period study with all published timings, including ours, confirms that the period of XZ CMi has varied in a cyclic period <b>variation</b> <b>superposed</b> on a secular period decrease over last 70 years. Assuming the cyclic change of period to occur by a light-time effect due to a third-body, the light-time orbit with a semi-amplitude of 0. 0056 d, a period of 29 y and an eccentricity of 0. 71 was calculated. The observed secular period decrease of - 5. 26 × 10 ^{- 11 } d/P was interpreted {{as a result of}} simultaneous occurrence of both a period decrease of - 8. 20 × 10 ^{- 11 } d/P by angular momentum loss (AML) due to a magnetic braking stellar wind and a period increase of 2. 94 × 10 ^{- 11 } d/P by a mass transfer from the less massive secondary to the primary components in the system. In this line the decreasing rate of period due to AML is about 3 times larger than the increasing one by a mass transfer in their absolute values. The latter implies a mass transfer of dot M_{s}= 3. 21 × 10 ^{- 8 } M_⊙ y^{- 1 } from the less massive secondary to the primary. The BV light curves with the latest Wilson-Devinney binary code were analyzed for two separate models of 8200 K and 7000 K as the photospheric temperature of the primary component. Both models confirm that XZ CMi is truly a near-contact binary with a less massive secondary completely filling Roche lobe and a primary inside the inner Roche lobe and there is a third-light corresponding to about 15 - 17 % of the total system light. However, the third-light source can not be the same as the third-body suggested from the period study. At the present, however, we can not determine which one between two models is better fitted to the observations because of a negligible difference of sum (O-C) ^ 2 between them. The diversity of mass ratios, with which previous investigators were in disagreement, still remains to be one of unsolved problems in XZ CMi system. Spectroscopic observations for a radial velocity curve and high-resolution spectra as well as a high-precision photometry are needed to resolve some of remaining problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of grooved composite laminates to out-of-plane contact loading is examined using numerical modeling through {{the consideration of}} contact pressure and stresses within the laminate, with particular focus on the area local to the groove. Finite element analysis is employed via ABAQUS, a commercial finite element modeling software. The indentor is modeled as a rigid body, and the validity of this approximation is assessed through comparison with a deformable, linear elastic indentor. The influence of ply angle is investigated through consideration {{of a family of}} [+/-[theta]/ 0] 13 s laminates for values of [theta] of 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °, along with a quasiisotropic [+/- 45 / 0 / 90] 10 s and a crossply [0 / 90] 20 s configuration, all using T 700 / 2510 graphite/epoxy. The linearity of the response is investigated, and two loading configurations are studied and compared: a two-dimensional, cylinder-loaded configuration, and a three-dimensional, sphere-loaded configuration. Results show that the Hertzian contact model for isotropic bodies cannot be used to determine contact pressure due to an inability of that model to analytically determine the appropriate contact length. The basic form of the contact pressure curve is similar to the Hertzian model, but with significant local <b>variations</b> <b>superposed</b> due to stiffness variation, particularly in the longitudinal direction, due to ply orientation angle. Thus, if the contact length is supplied, the Hertzian model can be a valid overall approximation. Total vertical load magnitude is determined to be a primary factor in the response, as it determines contact length, and thus the distribution of contact pressure and the form of the stress field. The response is found to vary with significant nonlinearity with respect to applied load due to the relationship with contact length. The rigid body approximation of the steel indentor is deemed sufficiently accurate to capture the overall behavior, due to the high difference in stiffness between the steel indentor and the through-thickness stiffness of the composite. There is significant variation between the two-dimensional models and the three-dimensional models, particularly in determining the magnitude of the response. However, the two-dimensional model is sufficient to observe trends, and could be of use in preliminary design and analysis, although the full three-dimensional model is required to accurately determine the response in the final analysis, largely due to important issues of variation along the groove. In general, stress behavior is dependent on the laminate and the particular stress, with stress fields between laminates showing some similar trends, but also high variability depending on the composition of the laminate. by Jaffar S.
