40|$|International audienceThe {{downstream}} migration of European <b>silver</b> <b>eels</b> in the River Frémur was examined {{to determine the}} potential effects of the numerous migration barriers that exist on waterways in western France. The Frémur has a 14 m high dam which creates a 3 × 106 m 3 water supply reservoir, 6 km from tidal limit. Based on 8 -year records (1996 – 2004) of migrant <b>silver</b> <b>eels</b> captured in a Wolf trap located about 1 km below the dam, the influence of this dam on the migration was examined. These records indicate that 91 % of <b>silver</b> <b>eels</b> were captured when the dam was overtopped (i. e. when the water reservoir was full). The timings of the overflow periods varied greatly between years mainly because they are function of {{the duration of the}} filling period which in turn is dependent on the level of summer water abstraction and annual hydrological conditions. Consequently, migration periods occurred at variable dates (between November and April) which is late in comparison with nonobstructed European river systems (generally between August and December). During overflow periods the migration of <b>silver</b> <b>eels</b> increased markedly during rain events (increasing river flow).

By comparing these results to what has already been shown in yellow eels, we point out that the effects of the silvering process on pressure resistance are similar to the effects of pressure acclimatization in yellow eels.

However the lake {{has experienced a}} decline in numbers of longfin eels due {{to the construction of}} the hydro- electric dam blocking eel migration. The outflow passage is blocked by the hydro-electric dam which means that eels can be killed when passing through the turbines. A vertical slot fish pass was installed in 1999 and trap and transfer of elvers (young eels) was started in summer 1998/1999. Since the trap and transfer operation commenced in 1998/99 more than 407,000 elvers have been transferred upstream of the Maraoa Control structure. Catch totals in the trap and transfer system can vary in correspondence to surface water temperatures falling below 15 C. The trap and transfer technique was successful in improving fish distribution however operations had to be stopped in 2004 due to the concerns that transferring elvers to upstream habitats would spread the exotic invasive algae Didymosphenia geminata. The operation now transfers elvers just past the dam due to these concerns. There is concerns also that the trap and transfer operation does not trap enough silvers eels (eels of breading age) with an average of 200-400 annually. This however equates to only one <b>silver</b> <b>eel</b> per hectare within the lake which is much lower than standards recommended overseas.

Previous studies have evidenced that eels are able to acclimatize to pressure through membrane fluidity adjustment. However these studies were performed on the premigratory stage (yellow stage), which never encounters high pressure.

40|$|Using Illumina sequencing, {{transcriptional}} changes occurring during silvering in swimbladder {{tissue of}} the European eel have been analyzed by comparison of yellow eel and <b>silver</b> <b>eel</b> tissue samples. Functional annotation analysis based on GO terms revealed significant expression {{changes in a}} number of genes related to the extracellular matrix, important for the control of gas permeability of the swimbladder, and to ROS (reactive oxygen species) defense, important to cope with reactive oxygen species generated under hyperbaric oxygen partial pressures. Focusing on swimbladder tissue metabolism, levels of several mRNA species encoding glucose transport proteins were several-fold higher in silver eels, while enzymes of the glycolytic pathway were not affected. The significantly higher steady state level of a transcript encoding for membrane bound carbonic anhydrase, however, suggested that CO 2 production in the pentose phosphate shunt and diffusion of CO 2 was of particular importance in <b>silver</b> <b>eel</b> swimbladder. In addition, the mRNA level {{of a large number of}} genes related to immune response and to sexual maturation was significantly modified in the <b>silver</b> <b>eel</b> swimbladder. The modification of several processes related to protein metabolism and transport, cell cycle, and apoptosis suggested that these changes in swimbladder metabolism and permeability were achieved by increasing cell turn-over. The impact of an infection of the swimbladder with the nematode Anguillicola crassus has been assessed by comparing these expression changes with expression changes observed between uninfected yellow eel swimbladder tissue and infected <b>silver</b> <b>eel</b> swimbladder tissue. In contrast to uninfected <b>silver</b> <b>eel</b> swimbladder tissue, in infected tissue the mRNA level of several glycolytic enzymes was significantly elevated, and with respect to extracellular matrix, several mucin genes were many-fold higher in their mRNA level. Modification of many immune related genes and of the functional categories ‘response to DNA damage stimulus’ and ‘cellular response to stress’ illustrated the damaging effect of the nematode infection.

Over the period 2008 - 2013 75 % (n = 630) of the eels were detected. Eel numbers reaching the North sea varied between 6 - 10 % yearly. Most eels migrated to sea by way of the Haringvliet. <b>Silver</b> <b>eel</b> migration showed much individual variation, with fish reaching the sea within several days after being released and fish postponing their downstream migration for more than one year. The onset of migration was stimulated by increasing river discharge. Fish from different maturation classes showed no significant differences in migration speeds. Average individual migrations speed ranged from 0, 3 to 1, 6 m/s, indicative for at least a partly active migration (average river flow being 1 m/s). Generally migration speed slowed when fish approached sluices and weirs in the Meuse. The influence of the hydro power station (HPS) Linne on the migration was examined.
