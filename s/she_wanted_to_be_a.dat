5|$|While in England, Godwin took {{a course}} in {{creative}} writing at the City Literature Institute, where she met her second husband, psychiatrist Ian Marshall. They were married two months later. The marriage was brief and they were divorced in 1966. After their breakup, Godwin returned to the United States. At age 29, she {{took a job as}} fact-checker in New York City for The Saturday Evening Post. She said the job was embarrassing, because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.|$|E
5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.|$|E
5|$|While {{growing up}} in Calgary, Sing {{attended}} numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother. She knew <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children. As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it {{had more to do}} with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information, and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.|$|E

5|$|Higgins {{was born}} in Melbourne, Victoria, to Christopher Higgins, an English-Australian general practitioner, and Margaret (née Morrison), an Australian {{childcare}} centre operator. Her sister, Nicola, is seven years older, and brother, David, is six years older. She learned to play classical piano from age six, {{following in the footsteps}} of Christopher and David, but realised <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> singer at about 12 when she appeared in an Armadale Primary School production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time. Hoping for more freedom, she urged her parents to send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school attended by her siblings. At Geelong she took up the piano again, this time playing jazz including performing with her brother David's group on weekends. She was introverted and found that piano practice helped her cope with living at boarding school.|$|E

25|$|In {{school she}} enjoyed clay-modeling class and decided {{at an early}} age that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sculptor.

She was able to afford the tuition only because a local sculptor, Lorado Taft, hired her to work as a studio assistant, on Saturdays. From 1890 to 1891 she studied with Taft at the Art Institute, as she completed its sculptor courses.|$|E

Her father had turned out some one-act plays for the stock company, and encouraged Anita {{to work in the}} field herself. She wrote The Ink Well, a successful piece for which she would receive periodic royalties.|$|E

When she was eleven years old, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> nun, but, at {{about the age of}} twelve, her parents forced her to marry Lorenzo Ponziani, commander of the papal troops of Rome and member of an extremely wealthy family. Although the marriage had been arranged, it was a happy one, lasting for forty years, partly because Lorenzo admired his wife, and partly because he was frequently away at war.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Belmonte and her {{siblings}} took their elementary studies at Kamuning Public School and Hope Christian High School, and {{their high school}} studies at the Philippine Christian Colleges and UP High School. She was often teased at school for having a boy's name, so her father started calling her Betty. When she was 19, she {{wanted to become a}} Protestant missionary and stay single. This upset her grandmother, who wanted her to marry. In college, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> painter and pursue a course in Fine Arts but her father thought she {{would not be able to}} make a living as a painter and enrolled her in an English degree at the University of the Philippines Diliman instead.|$|E

25|$|Davydova {{was born}} in Voronezh, 500 {{kilometres}} south of Moscow.

Deciding <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gymnast Elena went by herself to be enrolled in Voronezh's famous Spartak Gymnastics school, yet was turned away, as she was very small, and considered at the time to have the wrong physique for the sport."They would call me Kolobok after the little fairytale pancake". Rather than giving up however, she secretly watched the lessons through windows and tried to imitate in the schoolyard what she had observed."My Mom wanted me to do Piano and I would run away from it to do gymnastics".|$|E
25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> singer, and {{he was tired of}} people who just wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director. Her guiding principle was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E

At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E
