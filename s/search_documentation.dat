In November 2001, the Trilateral Offices released {{the results of a}} study of search tools and strategies. The report concluded that each Office’s ability to search the prior art for business method inventions was satisfactory but that the EPO and USPTO should make more use of the JPO <b>search</b> <b>documentation</b> and vice versa and that there should be more exchange of non-patent literature (NPL) searching information.|$|E
40|$|Software related inventions {{being not}} simply {{excluded}} from patenting [...] as {{confirmed by the}} recent amendments of the EPO Guidelines [...] the question arises whether DG 1 should adapt its <b>search</b> <b>documentation</b> in order to enable such inventions to be properly searched. As a matter of fact, the question concerns only the non-patent literature (NPL), mostly articles from journals and conference proceedings, because these documents are only selectively classified {{for inclusion in the}} <b>search</b> <b>documentation</b> [...] whereas patent documents are all systematically classified and included [...] and besides, software matters are rarely dealt with in the present patent literature. In view of the foregoing, the paper illustrates the importance of non-patent literature for search purposes and considers the selection criteria for articles and for the collection of technical journals. ...|$|E
40|$|Search {{examiners}} at DG 1 of the EPO {{are largely}} involved in documentation activities. They classify EP- and PCT-applications for publication using the International Patent Classification (IPC), and they classify new patent documents and non-patent literature for {{addition to the}} systematic <b>search</b> <b>documentation.</b> They use the European Classification (ECLA), an internal classification tool developed {{on the basis of}} the IPC but with further subdivisions and better adaptation to the different technical fields. For maintaining or improving the quality of the <b>search</b> <b>documentation,</b> the examiners continuously reorganise the internal classification system. In order to overcome the limitations of a classification system, secondary systems are in use or under development. A successful example of such systems is the ICO system. This system offers light indexing schemes for the identification of additional information contained in patent documents. The indexing codes are only available online; they are not used when filing actual patent documents. ...|$|E

We have built several systems to demonstrate and validate this idea in domains like searching documentation, GUI automation and testing, and cross-device information migration. In particular, Sikuli Search enables users to <b>search</b> <b>documentation</b> using screenshots of GUI elements instead of keywords. Sikuli Script enables users to programmatically control GUIs without support from the underlying applications. Sikuli Test lets GUI developers and testers create test scripts without coding. Deep Shot introduces a framework and interaction techniques to migrate work states across heterogeneous devices in one action, taking a picture. We also discuss challenges inherent in screenshot-based interactions and propose potential solutions and directions of future research. by Tsung-Hsiang Chang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} hybrid search, {{a search}} method supporting both document and knowledge retrieval via the flexible combination of ontology-based search and keyword-based matching. Hybrid search smoothly copes with lack of semantic coverage of document content, {{which is one}} of the main limitations of current semantic search methods. In this paper we define hybrid search formally, discuss its compatibility with the current semantic trends and present a reference implementation: K-Search. We then show how the method outperforms both keyword-based search and pure semantic search in terms of precision and recall in a set of experiments performed on a collection of about 18. 000 technical documents. Experiments carried out with professional users show that users understand the paradigm and consider it very powerful and reliable.

40|$|Auditors {{regularly}} {{make judgments}} regarding whether a client’s chosen accounting policy is appropriate and {{in accordance with}} generally accepted accounting Principles (GAAP). However, to form this judgment, auditors must either possess adequate topic-specific knowledge or must gain such knowledge through information search. This search is subject to numerous biases, including a bias toward confirmation of a client’s preference. It is important to further our understanding of bias in auditors’ information search to identify its causes and effects. Furthering our understanding is necessary to {{provide a basis for}} recommending and evaluating a potential debiaser, such as accountability. the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) annually inspects the audit files of selected engagements, which introduces a new form of accountability within the auditing profession. This new form of accountability has come at great cost, however, there is little empirical evidence regarding its effects on auditors’ processes. As such, {{it is important to understand}} whether the presence of accountability from the PCAOB is effective in modifying auditors’ search behaviors to diminish confirmation bias. Using an online experiment, I manipulate client preference (unknown vs. known) and PCAOB accountability pressure (low vs. high) and measure search type (information –focus or decision-focus), search depth (shallow or deep) and documentation quality. I investigate whether auditors’ information search behaviors differ based on knowledge of client’s preference and in the presence of accountability from an expected PCAOB inspection. I also investigate whether differences in auditors’ information <b>search</b> behaviors influence <b>documentation</b> quality, which is the outcome of greatest concern to the PCAOB. I hypothesize and find a client preference effect on information search type such that auditors with knowledge of the client preference consider guidance associated with the client’s preference longer than those without knowledge of the client’s preference. Contrary to expectations, PCAOB accountability pressure does not influence information search depth. with respect to documentation quality, I find that auditors engaged in a more information-focused <b>search</b> have higher <b>documentation</b> quality. Further, as expected, auditors who initially engage in a decision-focus and deep <b>search</b> have higher <b>documentation</b> quality than those auditors who initially engaged in a decision-focused but shallow search...|$|R

40|$|This thesis tackles the {{manipulation}} planning for documented objects. The {{difficulty of the}} problem is the coupling of a symbolic and a geometrical problem. Classical approaches combine task and motion planning. They are hard to implement and time consuming. This approach is different on three aspects. The first aspect is a theoretical framework to model admissible motions of the robot and objects. This model uses constraints to link symbolic task and motions achieving such task. A graph of constraint models {{the manipulation}} rules. A planning algorithm using this graph is proposed. The second aspect is the handling of constrained motion. In manipulation planning, an abstract definition of numerical constraint is necessary. A continuity criterion for Newton-Raphson methods is proposed to ensure the continuity of trajectories in sub-manifolds. The last aspect is object documentation. Some information, easy to define for human beings, greatly speeds up the <b>search.</b> This <b>documentation,</b> specific to each object and end-effector, is used to generate a graph of constraint, easing the problem specification and resolution...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{problems}} related to simulation model documentation and model exchange between users are discussed. Complex simulation models have gained popularity in the environmental field, but require extensive documentation to allow independent implementation. The existence of different simulation platforms puts high demands {{on the quality of}} the original documentation. Recent experiences from cross-platform implementations with the ASM 2 d and ADM 1 models reveal that error-free model documentation is difficult to obtain, and as a consequence, considerable time is spent on <b>searching</b> for <b>documentation</b> and implementation errors of various sources. As such, the list of errors and coding pitfalls provided for ASM 2 d and ADM 1 in this paper is vital information for any future implementation of both models. The time needed to obtain an error-free model implementation can be significantly reduced if a standard language for model documentation and exchange is adopted. The extensible markup language (XML) and languages based on this format may provide a remedy to the problem of platform independent model documentation and exchange. In this paper the possibility to apply this to environmental models is discussed, whereas the practical model implementation examples corroborate the necessity for a standardised approach...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{successful}} experiences of developing manufacturing strategy from five high-performing large-scale SOEs within China’s petrochemical industry. China’s petrochemical industry constitutes a basic heavy industrial sector, {{which has always}} been a strategic focus for reform and development by the Chinese government. Using a confirmation approach, the study has focused on exploring and conceptualising the empirical paradigm of manufacturing strategy development practiced by management. That is examining the ‘empirical specifics’ and surfacing the ‘managerial perceptions’ of content configuration, context of consideration, and process organization for developing a manufacturing strategy during the practice. The research investigation adopts a qualitative exploratory case study methodology with a semi-structural front-end research design. Data collection follows a longitudinal and multiple-case design and triangulates case evidence from sources including qualitative interviews, direct observation, and a <b>search</b> of <b>documentations</b> and archival records. Data analysis follows an investigative progression from a within-case preliminary interpretation of facts to a cross-case search for patterns through theoretical comparison and analytical generalization. The underlying conceptions in both the literature of manufacturing strategy and related studies in business strategy were used to develop theoretical framework and analytical templates applied during data collection and analysis.
