30|$|As {{demonstrated}} in [19], EV charging, which first may appear {{as an additional}} load to the grid, {{can be used as}} an effective storage solution. In the grids with PV, EVs represent a unique opportunity, as not only they can locally consume part of the produced PV energy, yet this energy reduces the charging energy from the grid and gives additional travel range for EV drivers. For an average size EV with a 24 kWh battery, the charging process can show an additional demand of about 3.7  kW with a <b>single–phase</b> <b>charging</b> option. EV charging, with coordination to PV generation, can help to mitigate the voltage issues.|$|E

Future shortage of fossil fuels and concerns about security of supply derived the idea of electrified mobility which requires a new approach to design a complex system for future transportation. This system will be based on existing infrastructures (electricity system, road infrastructure, etc.) but it can also partially be considered as a "green field" approach. In the paper new strategies and global trends in the development of an e-mobility system will be presented, including strategies to combine the power system with the information and communication systems as well as a logistics. Practical experiences and data based on few projects e. g. Harz. EE-Mobility in Germany. European research as well as industry projects with these aims will be introduced and results will be presented. The main focus is twofold: integrating the upcoming mobile loads into the grid and likely storage possibilities that can operate bidirectional within the power grid. Simulations show that <b>single-phase</b> <b>charging</b> (3. 7 kW) in the low and medium voltage grid does not lead to grid situations that require any significant adjustments in the power network regarding the loading of the assets. However, uncoordinated <b>single-phase</b> <b>charging</b> could create significant voltage deviations due to unbalanced loading of the three-phase low voltage grid. The different phases influence each other in unbalanced situations, through the common neutral conductor. These effects can already occur at low market penetration levels, due to the presence of local penetration levels being significantly higher than the average market level...|$|E
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the impact}} of <b>single-phase</b> {{on-board}} <b>charging</b> strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) in {{a case study of}} a heavily loaded unbalanced Flemish three-phase low-voltage residential grid. Voltage droop charging and EV-based peak shaving, which do not need communication with the distribution grid, are modeled and the results are compared. The grid voltages are analyzed according to the probabilistic and deterministic limits of the EN 50160 standard, for a 100 % EV penetration rate. The impact on the EV user comfort is evaluated in terms of charging time and electrically driven distances. The chosen voltage droop charging eliminates critical voltages below 0. 85 pu and reduces voltage unbalance, with a limited impact on the total charging time. EV-based peak shaving makes the grid fully compliant with EN 50160 and avoids the need for an infrastructure upgrade. The electrically driven distances are not influenced by the charging strategies. status: publishe...|$|R

Considering the potential future participation of EVs in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid environment, this paper presents a generalized synopsis on EV charging in a commercial hybrid AC/DC microgrid. Constituents of this paper encompass the charger configurations, vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) control strategies of individual chargers and their effects on the microgrid operations.

40|$|A fully {{integrated}} on-board battery charger for future electric vehicles (EVs) has been recently introduced. It re-utilizes all the propulsion components of an EV in charging/vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) modes, {{it does not}} require any additional components or hardware reconfiguration, and charging/V 2 G modes are realized with zero electromagnetic torque production. Both fast (three-phase) and slow (<b>single-phase)</b> <b>charging</b> are possible, with unity power factor operation at the grid side. The solution is based on the use of a triple three-phase machine and a nine-phase inverter/rectifier. This paper reports on the results of efficiency evaluation for the said system. Testing is performed using both a nine-phase induction machine and a nine-phase permanent magnet (PM) machine for a range of operating conditions in charging/V 2 G modes, with both three-phase and single-phase grid connection. Additionally, the impact of converter interleaving on the losses and efficiency is also studied. Losses are separated for different subsystems, thus providing an insight into the importance of optimization of different EV power train components from the efficiency point of view. Promising efficiencies, in the order of 90 %, are achieved although none of the system components have been optimized...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{integration of}} multiphase (more than three phases) machines and converters into a <b>single-phase</b> <b>charging</b> process of electric vehicles (EVs) and, thus, complements recently introduced fast charging {{solutions for the}} studied phase numbers. One entirely novel topology, employing a five-phase machine, is introduced and assessed jointly with three other topologies that use an asymmetrical nine-phase machine, an asymmetrical six-phase machine, and a symmetrical six-phase machine. In all topologies, both charging and vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) mode are viable. Moreover, all are capable of unity power factor operation. A torque is not produced in machines during charging/V 2 G process so that mechanical locking is not required. Hardware reconfiguration between propulsion and charging/V 2 G mode is either not required or minimized by using a single switch. Theoretical analysis of operating principles is given, and a control scheme, applicable to all topologies and which includes current balancing and interleaving strategy, is developed. Finally, operation of all topologies is compared by means of experiments in both charging and V 2 G mode, {{with a discussion of}} influence of current balancing and interleaving strategy on the overall performance...|$|E
40|$|An obvious {{obstacle}} {{to a wider}} utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) {{is the absence of}} a widely available charging network. Direct charging of EV batteries with dc voltage in charging stations requires deployment of expensive power electronics equipment. On the other hand, placing the same equipment on-board an EV would enable access to any three-phase grid outlet, but would substantially increase the vehicle cost, weight and volume. A multitude of solutions have been proposed to integrate the charger using the already existing equipment, which normally serves the propulsion operating mode of the vehicle. However, only a few of them have the advantage of torque-free fast charging that is accomplished without any hardware reconfiguration. The primary aim of these integrated on-board chargers is to provide fast charging by enabling connection to a three-phase grid. These structures also enable slower charging by connection to a single-phase grid. This paper examines <b>single-phase</b> <b>charging</b> capabilities of an integrated charger using a nine-phase machine. The charger does not require any reconfiguration or additional elements other than those used in propulsion mode and it does not produce torque during the charging. Additionally, the charger can provide energy recuperation to the grid. The operating principle relies on additional degrees of freedom of multiphase machines, to draw currents through non-flux and non-torque producing planes of the machines...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) impacts the power grid due to their high demand in power and energy, and uncertainties in the charging behavior. Typical PEVs are <b>charged</b> <b>single-phase</b> up to 32 A (7. 2 -kVA) or tri-phase up to 32 A (22. 0 -kVA). Both charging technologies have to be discussed {{in order to determine}} their impact on planning and operating of low-voltage distribution grids to assure a reliable and stable PEV charging. Traditional grid planning and analysis methods, which average and evenly distribute PEV loads on the distribution grid, fail in providing a realistic answer about the grid capacity to charge PEVs. The question; How many PEVs can be charged simultaneously on a distribution grid remains unanswered. Therefore, this paper describes a novel metho dology to realistically evaluate the grid capacity for PEV charging on 3 -phase 0. 4 -kV distribution grids. The proposed methodology is a modified Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique, which analyzes grid capacity with respect to charging location, technical distribution grid limitations, and PEV charging techniques. The MC technique is numerically optimized to analyze large distribution grids and scaled up PEV charging. Results will be compared to traditional analysis techniques...|$|R
30|$|To provide {{reactive}} power compensation without degrading PEV’s battery during charging, several research works on bidirectional PEV chargers have been reported. A bidirectional off-board charger proposed by [15] employs two linear controllers to track reference active power and {{reactive power}} {{in conjunction with a}} phase-locked loop algorithm. The proposed charger is capable of four quadrant operations but does not have RES integration, thus limiting its potential to be self-sufficient. Meanwhile, in a <b>single-phase</b> on-board bidirectional <b>charger</b> proposed by [25], proportional-integral (PI) controllers are employed in AC/DC converters and DC/DC converters to provide constant voltage and constant current charging as well as {{reactive power compensation}}. However, the proposed charger is only capable for two quadrants of operation. Reference [26] proposes a PEV DC charging station using a neutral point clamped converter. The proposed DC bus architecture allows the connection of distributed power systems such as RES and energy storage devices. The grid-connected converter in the system is regulated using voltage oriented control with multiple linear controllers and for the voltage balancing mechanism, another linear control is utilized. In a separate study, a unified single-phase and three-phase control of on-board PEV chargers proposed by [27] utilizes separate linear controllers with respective references to provide desired control for grid power flow and battery charging.|$|R

When connected to the power grid, the battery charger works with sinusoidal current in the AC side, for both G 2 V and V 2 G modes, and also regulates the reactive power. When the EV is disconnected from the power grid, the control algorithms are modified and the full-bridge AC-DC bidirectional converter works as a full-bridge isolated DC-DC converter {{that is used to}} charge the auxiliary battery of the EV, avoiding the use of an additional charger to accomplish this task.

The PHEV battery would be recharged from the power grid at home or at work and would thus allow for a reduction in the overall fuel consumption. This paper proposes an integrated power electronics interface for PHEVs, which consists of a novel Eight-Switch Inverter (ESI) and an interleaved DC/DC converter, {{in order to reduce the}} cost, the mass and the size of the power electronics unit (PEU) with high performance at any operating mode. In the proposed configuration, a novel Eight-Switch Inverter (ESI) is able to function as a bidirectional <b>single-phase</b> AC/DC battery <b>charger</b> / vehicle to grid (V 2 G) and to transfer electrical energy between the DC-link (connected to the battery) and the electric traction system as DC/AC inverter. In addition, a bidirectional-interleaved DC/DC converter with dual-loop controller is proposed for interfacing the ESI to a low-voltage battery pack in order to minimize the ripple of the battery current and to improve the efficiency of the DC system with lower inductor size. To validate the performance of the proposed configuration, the indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to optimize the efficiency of the AC drive system in PHEVs. The maximum efficiency of the motor is obtained by the evaluation of optimal rotor flux at any operating point, where the PSO is applied to evaluate the optimal flux.

Analiziranih in izmerjenih je bilo več prototipov enofaznih asinhronskih motorjev za pogon kompresorske enote v hladilniku. V okviru diplomske naloge je bil cilj izbrati tisti prototip, ki dosega najboljši izkoristek in vrednosti, ki so približno enake 1.

40|$|Many {{policies}} and programs adopted {{in the context of}} climate change mitigation and substitution of fossil fuels are contributing to the continuous development and growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in urban mobility systems, reaching 1. 26 million units on the roads through the end of 2015. Even though the increasing number of EVs will create problems in distribution systems, which can be mitigated using smart charging strategies, there will also be economic opportunities for EV owners to provide services to the grid while their vehicle are parked and plugged in, a concept known as Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G). Most of the studies on V 2 G have concentrated on the provision of services such as frequency regulation or spinning reserves, which may reduce the battery life because of the required extra charging/discharging cycles, and little {{attention has been paid to}} the possibility of providing reactive power control services to the grid by using the ac/dc converter and the dc link capacitor available in most advanced chargers, a practice that does not compromise the vehicle battery life. These kinds of chargers, which are known as four-quadrant EV chargers due to the capability of being operated in all quadrants of the P-Q plane, can be used in distribution networks to improve the power factor and help regulate voltage, thus facilitating larger EV penetrations, as discussed in this thesis. In the first part of this thesis, a new average model of a <b>single-phase,</b> four-quadrant EV <b>charger</b> is developed. The steady-state and step responses of the proposed model for different P-Q requests, corresponding to the operation in the four quadrants of the P-Q plane, are used to validate its performance against a four-quadrant EV charger prototype. The model is shown to be useful for efficient time-domain simulations and studies that include a number of EV chargers, such as EV integration studies in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution networks. A practical case study is presented to demonstrate and test the performances of the four-quadrant charger and its model, investigating the voltage interactions of several chargers in an LV residential network during the provision of three vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) strategies for active and reactive power. In the second part, a novel three-stage algorithm to coordinate the operation of four-quadrant EV chargers with other volt/var control devices in Medium-Voltage (MV) and LV distribution feeders is proposed. The first stage of the algorithm is operated on a day-ahead basis and defines the Load Tap Changer (LTC) and capacitor schedules while minimizing the peak load associated with EVs in the distribution system. The second and third stages update their operation every five minutes, to fairly allocate the aggregated and individual EV loads in the MV and LV feeders, respectively, while minimizing active power losses and voltage deviations. The proposed technique is applied to CIGRE's North-American MV and LV benchmark systems to demonstrate its ability to properly allocate EV loads, and improve distribution system performance in terms of losses and voltage profiles...|$|R
