40|$|While {{families}} that deviate from traditional, nuclear, and biologically-based arrangements are increasingly common, relatively little work {{has adopted a}} systems-based approach to understand parents’ experiences, and the psychological correlates of these experiences, in nontraditional families. To fill this gap, this dissertation employs a family systems and feminist model to examine the psychological outcomes, for both parents and children, associated with parenting in nontraditional or stressful contexts. In particular, this dissertation explores the role of dyadic support and communication among family members {{and the ways in}} which these two processes buffer both parents and children from depressive and other psychiatric symptoms. This dissertation also explores whether, and how, gender intersects with adopting a nontraditional parenting role. The first two of the three papers of this dissertation examine depression as an outcome of stepparenting, the ways in which social supports buffer stepparents against psychopathology, and gender as a potential moderator in stepparent well-being. To do so, the first of these studies used a sample of 75 step mothers and 60 biological mothers and the second study used a sample of 84 <b>stepmothers</b> and 41 <b>stepfathers,</b> all recruited online. Findings from these two studies suggest that low parenting stress (Study One), high dyadic support (Studies One and Two), and more experience stepparenting (Study Two) are important buffers against depressive symptoms among stepparents. Importantly, these effects seem to matter equally for <b>stepmothers</b> and <b>stepfathers.</b> The third study expands upon these findings by highlighting the significance of dyadic support for children in nontraditional families. Study Three examines the relational correlates of depressive symptoms in 26 recently widowed mothers and their 38 children between the ages of 3 - 12. Specifically, this study found that the quality of (observed) communication about the loss between parentally-bereaved children and their surviving mothers was associated with depression and maladaptive grief in children. Further, Study Three suggested that mothers’ blunted emotional response to the loss, characterized by atypically low depressive symptoms, may prevent them from effectively communicating with their children about the loss. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In Britain in {{the twenty-first}} century stepfamilies are numerically common but {{difficult}} to define since they may cross household boundaries. This has meant that stepmother families, who are often non-residential, are rarely included in research and there is a very limited literature which considers the perspectives of stepmothers themselves. However, there have been research findings suggesting greater stress for <b>stepmothers</b> than <b>stepfathers.</b> In a neoliberal climate there are increasing demands on parents, including fathers who do not live with the biological mother of their children, and this may contribute to particular stresses for stepmother families. This research used a synthetic narrative-discursive methodological approach, underpinned by feminist theory, to explore the identity work undertaken by stepmothers. In order to maximise the diversity of participants, data were drawn from a web forum for stepmothers and interviews with stepmothers of adult stepchildren. The analysis considers the discursive resources drawn upon as stepmothers negotiate potentially troubled identities. The empirical work is presented in three chapters: the first considers stepmothers talk about their (male) partners in which the men were often constructed as hapless, helpless or hopeless. The second looks at talk of home both as a physical and a relational space. In this stepmothers frequently demonstrated their own feelings of both invasion and exclusion, often not feeling ‘at home’. The third explores stepmothers’ talk in which the biological mothers of their stepchildren are often constructed as mad, bad and sometimes dangerous. The concluding chapter summarises the particular troubles with which stepmothers must contend highlighting the discursive resources that are drawn on and the constraints that these impose. Theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions are discussed including suggestions for policy. There are also discussions of future possibilities for extensions to this research exploring the experiences of the growing number of families with adult stepchildren...|$|R

40|$|As avaliações psicológicas de custódia aumentaram recentemente em função do crescente número de divórcios. Protocolos que orientam a avaliação em casos de custódia são raros no Brasil. Devido a essa demanda, esta pesquisa se propôs elaborar, aplicar e avaliar a eficácia de um protocolo de avaliação psicológica em processos de disputa de guarda. Foram avaliadas 11 famílias que entraram na justiça com o pedido de guarda, na Vara da Família de um município da região metropolitana de Curitiba/PR. Participaram do estudo os genitores, as famílias extensas (madrasta e padrasto), profissionais da área de saúde mental e escolar e as crianças envolvidas. O protocolo de avaliação foi composto por 10 instrumentos: sendo 7 básicos e 3 complementares. Constituíram o protocolo básico: (1) SARP, que avaliou o relacionamento parental, instrumento composto por três técnicas: (a) entrevistas semiestruturadas, (b) um protocolo de avaliação infantil, nomeado Meu Amigo de Papel e (c) uma escala pontuada pelo próprio avaliador; (2) Inventário de Estilos Parentais IEP, para identificar práticas parentais utilizadas pelos pais na educação de seus filhos; (3) Escala para {{investigar}} Alienação Parental - EAP; (4) Inventário de Sintomas de Stress para Adultos (ISSL); (5) Escala de Stress Infantil (ESI); (6) Inventário de Depressão de Beck (BDI); (7) Análise dos processos judiciais por meio de uma folha de registro. O Protocolo complementar foi composto por: (8) Protocolo NICHD (National Institute of Child Heath and Human Development) de entrevista forense para criança com suspeita de abuso sexual; (9) ASEBA, inventário que avalia aspectos sociais, emocionais e/ou comportamentais de crianças e adolescentes; (10) APSD, escala para indicativos de comportamentos antissociais graves em crianças. O tempo médio gasto para realização da perícia psicológica, desde a coleta de dados até a entrega de laudo foi de 38 horas. Foram feitas 12 entrevistas de uma hora, em média, por família. Os professores foram entrevistados em quatro casos e psicólogos em dois casos. O protocolo identificou dois genitores com estresse na fase exaustão, dois com intensidade grave de depressão e seis apresentaram alienação parental grave. Houve um caso de abuso sexual e uma criança com transtorno de conduta, que foi encaminhada para tratamento psicológico e psiquiátrico. Indicou-se tratamento psicológico para quatro genitores. A avaliação indicou a permanência da guarda com a mãe em sete casos e com o pai em três casos. Houve definição de sentença em 7 casos, nos quais o parecer da juíza acompanhou o laudo da perita. Psychological {{testing in}} custody cases has recently increased {{due to the}} growing number of separations. Protocols that guide the evaluation in such cases are rare in Brazil. Due to this demand, this study intended to develop, implement and evaluate the efficiency of a psychological assessment protocol in custody dispute situations. Eleven families who filed a petition for an order of custody in the Family Court of a municipality in the metropolitan region of Curitiba / PR were evaluated. The study included parents, extended families (<b>stepmother</b> and <b>stepfather),</b> mental health and educational professionals and the children involved. The protocol was composed of 10 instruments: 7 of which were basic and 3 complementary. The basic protocol was constituted of: (1) Parental Relationship Evaluation System (SARP), which evaluated the parental relationship; This tool consists of three techniques: (a) semi-structured interviews, (b) a child evaluating protocol called My Paper Friend and (c) a scale graded by the evaluator; (2) Parenting Styles Inventory (IEP) to identify parental practices used by parents in the education of their children; (3) A scale to investigate Parental Alienation (EAP); (4) Stress Symptoms Inventory for Adults (ISSL); (5) Infantile Stress Scale (ESI); (6) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); (7) The review of court proceedings through a record sheet. The Additional Protocol was composed of: (8) NICHD Protocol (National Institute of Child Heath and Human Development) of forensic interviews with children suspected of being abuse victims; (9) ASEBA, an inventory that assesses social, emotional and/or behavioral aspects of children and adolescents; (10) APSD, a scale indicative of serious antisocial behavior in childhood; The average time spent to perform the psychological assessment, from data collection to the delivery of reports was 38. 0 hours. Twelve interviews were conducted in an average of one hour per family. Teachers were interviewed in four cases and psychologists in two cases. The protocol identified two parents with stress exhaustion, two with severe depression and six had severe parental alienation. There was one case of sexual abuse and a child with conduct disorder, who was referred to psychological and psychiatric treatment. Psychological treatment was advised for four parents. The evaluation indicated that the mother should have permanent custody in seven cases and father in three cases. In seven cases there was a sentencing hearing, in which the opinion of the judge followed the opinion of the expert...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} program investigated actual and perceived functioning in stepfamilies and in biological families {{from the perspective}} of young adult members of such families. A substantial body of research has evaluated functioning in stepfamilies, and further literature has assessed the negative perceptions (or stereotypes) of stepfamilies; however, actual and perceived functioning have rarely been studied within the same framework. In the present studies, four specific aims were addressed: the first aim was to assess whether there are differences between young adults reports of stepfamilies and biological families on a number of key dimensions of (actual) family functioning; the second aim was to assess an integrative model of these family functioning variables; the third aim was to investigate whether and to what extent stepfamilies are stereotyped; and the final aim was to assess the theoretical perspectives (nuclear family ideology, biosocial perspective) that are most appropriate in explaining actual and perceived functioning in stepfamilies. A further aim (relating to the fourth aim) was to assess how attachment theory can be integrated as an explanation of actual and perceived functioning. The {{present research}} program also contained several important features. First, young adults in stepfamilies and biological families were compared on a number of key relationship dimensions, enabling a comprehensive coverage of important aspects of family functioning. Second, a broad overview of the negative perception of stepfamilies was obtained; this provided an overview of what the stereotype is, why people stereotype and whether those in stepfamilies have been subject to discrimination. Third, theoretical perspectives were used to explain actual and perceived functioning, and to determine whether potential discrepancies between actual and perceived functioning exist. Finally, quantitative data were complemented with short-response data, to obtain a broad picture of stereotypes of stepfamilies. These features are an important and novel contribution to further our understanding of stepfamilies. Study 1 assessed actual functioning in stepfamilies and in biological families as reported by a sample of young adult university students (&# 1048625; = 102) who belonged to one or other of these family types. (The principal stepfamily contained a biological mother and stepfather.) Overall, findings suggested that stepfamilies and biological families were similar on many dimensions of family functioning, particularly on individual and family adjustment. Further, participants in stepfamilies and in biological families were similar on many reports of parental relationships, although relationships with stepfathers were reported as being more avoidant, as having less mutual conflict resolution styles, and as being less satisfying than relationships with biological parents. However, where differences between the families existed, the effect sizes were generally not large; this supports the assertion that there is substantial overlap in functioning between the families. In addition, more support for the social stigma hypothesis of stepfamily functioning was obtained; the social stigma hypothesis argues that stepfamilies are stigmatised; however, actual functioning in stepfamilies may not be as negative as the stereotype. Study 1 also provided a comprehensive assessment of attachment in stepfamilies (i. e., attachment functions, attachment dimensions and attachment figures were assessed). In Study 2, a similar sample of young adults (&# 1048625; = 106) from stepfamilies and biological families were assessed on both actual and perceived functioning. (Participants in stepfamilies reported on relationships with up to four parents: biological mothers, biological fathers, <b>stepmothers</b> and <b>stepfathers,</b> where applicable.) Results largely replicated those of Study 1, with participants in stepfamilies and biological families reporting substantial overlap in functioning. Further, participants from these family types reported a negative stereotype of stepfamilies, particularly on perceived care, satisfaction, mental models, and conflict. These results generally suggest support for the social stigma hypothesis. That is, stepfamilies are perceived negatively but actual functioning is not as negative as the stereotype. Further, the attachment perspective was used to explain both actual and perceived functioning. The third study replicated and extended the previous studies by assessing actual functioning, stereotypes, and family identity. (Participants in stepfamilies again reported on relationships with up to four parents.) Data from young adults (&# 1048625; = 160) in biological and stepfamilies again suggested that differences between stepfamilies and biological families are generally minimal in terms of actual functioning. Regarding stereotypes, data again suggested that a negative perception of stepfamilies exists; participants suggested cultural issues and a negative emotional climate as the predominant reason for the stereotype. Finally, those in stepfamilies reported identifying with their own families, but not with stepfamilies in general. These results are addressed in regard to the theoretical perspectives. The social stigma hypothesis received more support than other hypotheses of stepfamily functioning. The combined results (obtained across the three studies) were also assessed. Results suggested that, in general, those in stepfamilies and those in biological families did not substantially differ on many variables (assessing reports of parental relationships and individual and family adjustment). An integrative model of these variables assessing differences between stepfamilies and biological families was also assessed. Satisfaction with the biological father was found to mediate the relationship between family type (stepfamily or biological family) and family cohesion, and to partially mediate the relationship between family type and model of other. These results highlight the need to study stepfamilies as a system and to study multiple relationships within this system. Overall, the present studies extend previous research by suggesting that stepfamilies are negatively stereotyped although actual functioning in stepfamilies may not reflect this stereotype. A more complete understanding of actual and perceived functioning {{from the perspective of}} young adults in stepfamilies and in biological families was achieved. Further, the findings on actual and perceived functioning are discussed in relation to theoretical perspectives (specifically, the social stigma and incomplete institutionalisation hypotheses), and implications for future research...|$|R
