30|$|Thus, {{the main}} {{conclusions}} {{from the first}} round of the DELPHI procedure were that there was a need for a new classification system, which had to be clear and accurate in its definitions, correlated with patients’ management and as simple as possible. The smooth transition from the old system, mainly that of AFS, to the new one was not important in the design and the acceptance of the new system. Furthermore, anatomy should be used as the basic <b>characteristic</b> <b>for</b> patients grouping. The degree of consensus among the participants regarding these statements was thought to be extremely high. Moreover, there was an indication that the uterus could be used as the key organ in the design of system’s categories and embryology could be used as a <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>for</b> patients’ grouping.|$|R

Moreover, in the case when g is the Lie algebra of formal vector fields and M supports a family of codimension one foliations, the image of a characteristic map from HL 4 (g) to H∗dR(M) is computed, where HL∗ denotes Leibniz cohomology and H∗dR denotes de Rham cohomology...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{temperature}} is a parameter {{that has been}} studied for a considerable time and from many different perspectives. However, relatively {{few studies have been}} conducted for taxonomic purposes and fewer still have focused on how changes in soil temperature related to global climate change may affect soil taxonomy. Soil temperature regimes are used to subdivide soils with similar properties that exist in dissimilar climate zones requiring different management practices depending on intended use. Seven sites with variable surficial features were used for this study within a cohesive sagebrush-steppe Eastern Sierra glacial moraine landform. Soil temperature was measured once a month for ten years, 50 cm below the soil surface. Vegetation density and subsequent plant litter on the soil surface were the most important factors controlling soil temperature and its annual and long term stability. Landscape position and slope shape also affected soil temperature, but may be primary factors determining vegetation type and vigor within a landform. Three of the seven sites had different temperature regimes, based on the ten-year average temperatures measured 50 cm below the soil surface, than was estimated by climate data {{at the beginning of the}} study. Typically, soil {{temperature is}} estimated by adding 1 ° C to the mean annual air temperature.

25|$|Puberty occurs {{through a}} long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of {{physical}} changes.

The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them {{into a state of}} rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals.

40|$|In mammals, Sry (sex-determining region Y gene) is {{the master}} {{regulator}} of male sex determination. It induces a cascade of gene expression that regulates the differentiation of the bipotential genital ridges into testicular tissue. In the absence of Sry, or if SRY function is impaired, the genital ridges develop into ovaries. Subsequently, hormones produced by the testes and ovaries direct the differentiation of all <b>secondary</b> sexual <b>characteristics</b> (<b>for</b> review, see Wilhelm and Koopman [1]). Largely {{as a consequence of}} the location of Sry on the Y chromosome, this gene is subjected to mutations that cannot be repaired by mechanisms that rely on pairing with a duplicate chromosome. These mutations degrade the structure of the encoded protein and also potentially compromise the regulatory sequences required for correct and robust gene expression. This vulnerability of Sry to mutations means that the mechanisms controlling male sexual development are fragile, a situation that has profound biological and medical implications.
