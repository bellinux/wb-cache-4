500|$|On June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, {{head of the}} American Family Association (AFA), {{alleged that}} [...] "The Littlest Tramp" [...] {{depicted}} cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. The AFA, during its incarnation as the National Federation for Decency, had previously targeted CBS as an [...] "accessory to murder" [...] after a mother killed her daughter following an airing of [...] Concerning Bakshi's involvement with Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, the AFA claimed that CBS [...] "intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then allowed him to insert {{a scene in which}} the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine." [...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> burning books and the Third Reich. It <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> McCarthyism. I'm {{not going to get into}} who sniffs what. This is lunacy!" [...] On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were [...] "a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine". Despite receiving an award from Action for Children's Television, favorable reviews, and a ranking in Time magazine's [...] "Best of '87" [...] feature, Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures was canceled by CBS following the controversy.|$|E

[...] NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel also took issue with the report, saying in May 1995 that [...] "the assumption that the Space Shuttle systems are now 'mature' <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps." [...] Nonetheless, NASA accepted the recommendations of the report, and in November 1995, responsibility for shuttle operations was turned over to the United Space Alliance.|$|E

As a result, [...] "Africa is an exception and therefore is the current focus of sentimentality about poverty". In this context he examines Gordon Brown's desire as prime minister to ensure that every child in Africa receive a primary education. Dalrymple questions {{whether there is a}} link between improving educational standards and increasing economic growth in the continent, and cites the experience of Tanzania under Julius Nyerere, Equatorial Guinea under Macias Nguema, and Sierra Leone's fate after a [...] "long history of historical effort and achievement" [...] as evidence that this may not be so, and argues that Africa's priority is access to markets.

500|$|Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times {{was more}} {{critical}} in his review. He praised {{the energy of}} the album, pointing out the, [...] "Booming groove," [...] of [...] "Apologize", and the [...] "disco-metal urgency," [...] of [...] "Levitate". Wood's biggest complaint of the album was that the band has, [...] "filtered out any sense of humor from its music, which makes American Tragedy virtually impossible to listen to for longer than a few songs at a time." [...] Alistair Lawrence of BBC Music said that the album is, [...] "The result is that they’ve ditched some of the early, growling quirkiness that at least gave them an initial, oddball appeal." [...] Lawrence finishes his review noting, [...] "Hollywood Undead are content to deliver clichés– more out of a lack of imagination than cynical opportunism, but it still <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> both. That's why to seasoned ears or any genre fan requiring more than more of the same, they’re very, very boring." ...|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès psychoanalysed The Shooting Star, {{describing}} it as [...] "the final attempt of the foundling [...] to rid {{himself of the}} bastard [...] and to preserve the integrity of his former values", {{pointing out that the}} first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter. He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two-halves of [...] "an ambivalent father figure" [...] within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus [...] "more than any other previous character". He suggests that when hiding on the Aurora, Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera, as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon. Apostolidès believed that the shooting star itself is [...] "more a religious mystery than a scientific one" [...] and that Tintin is therefore [...] "the perfect one to figure it out in some religious way—that is, unrealistically". Apostolidès analysed the political component of the story in terms of [...] "the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values", arguing that Hergé was adhering to [...] "a utopian vision that, in 1942, <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> pro-German propaganda".|$|E

500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration with George W. Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E
500|$|Many {{members of}} the Australian media alleged a {{conspiracy}} against Meckiff. Ian McDonald of Melbourne's Sporting Globe said the bowler's action had not changed in the previous eight years and stated: [...] "the whole affair <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> a set-up". Sydney's Mirror labelled the paceman [...] "the most obvious fall-guy in Australian cricket history". On the third morning of the match, former first-class cricketer Percy Beames, writing for Melbourne's The Age, claimed Meckiff had {{been used as a}} [...] "sacrificial goat" [...] and called for the selectors' resignation. Keith Miller wrote a column calling for Bradman's and Jack Ryder's removal from the selection panel, noting that they had watched Meckiff's performance against Western Australia which prompted his Test selection. Miller felt that if the selectors deemed the bowler illegitimate, then they should not have allowed him to be [...] "executed" [...] by the umpires. Jack Pollard said: [...] "there is little doubt Meckiff was sacrificed to end the long-running controversy and the way it was done irked many cricket-lovers." [...] Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington asserted that Benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up, claiming that the Australian captain knew of Bradman's views on Meckiff's action. Whitington further cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot. Others saw Bradman's tea-time conversation with Benaud after the no-balling as proof of a conspiracy. Benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set-up.|$|E
500|$|Many of Kavner's roles {{have been}} {{described}} by New York Times writer Hilary de Vries as a [...] "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny". Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, [...] "If it <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job." [...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] You {{never have to worry about}} giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This Is My Life, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This Is My Life, said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress - 'How big is my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her." ...|$|E

[...] Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted [...] "everything that <b>smacks</b> <b>of</b> sacrifice", and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread. He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony.|$|E
