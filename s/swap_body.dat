5|$|DB Cargo is {{a global}} freight {{operator}} with a large interest in freight over rail in Europe. While High Speed 1 was constructed with freight loops, no freight traffic had run upon the line since opening in 2003. On 16 April 2009 DB Schenker {{signed an agreement with}} HS1 Ltd, the owner of High Speed 1, for a partnership to develop TVM modifications for class 92 freight locomotives to run on the line. On 25 March 2011 {{for the first time a}} modified class 92 locomotive travelled from Dollands Moor to Singlewell using the TVM430 signalling system. A loaded container train ran for the first time on 27 May 2011, to Novara in Italy. Following further trials with loaded wagons DB is to upgrade five Class 92 locomotives to allow them to run on High Speed 1. From 11 November 2011 a weekly service using European-sized <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> containers has run between London and Poland using High Speed 1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Swap</b> <b>body</b> units {{usually have}} the same bottom corner {{fixtures}} as intermodal containers, and often have folding legs under their frame {{so that they can}} be moved between trucks without using a crane. However they frequently don't have the upper corner fittings of ISO containers, and are not stackable, nor can they be lifted and handled by the usual equipment like reach-stackers or straddle-carriers. They are generally more expensive to procure.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} where the railway loading gauge is sufficient, truck trailers are often carried by rail. Variations exist, including open-topped versions covered by a fabric curtain are used to transport larger loads. A container called a tanktainer, with a tank inside a standard container frame, carries liquids. Refrigerated containers (reefer) are used for perishables. <b>Swap</b> <b>body</b> units have the same bottom corners as intermodal containers but are {{not strong enough to}} be stacked. They have folding legs under their frame and can be moved between trucks without using a crane.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Swap</b> <b>bodies</b> take {{advantage}} of the large number of trailers used to carry standard ISO containers. The design of <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> and roller container is optimized to minimize empty weight, saving on trucking fuel cost (less dead weight to be transported).and cost of built of reloading terminals.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{unreliability}} of {{the rail}} transports COOP choose trailers and not <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> as cargo units. <b>Swap</b> <b>bodies</b> have a lower net weight (three tonnes; they can accommodate 18 pallets) than trailers (ten tonnes; they can accommodate 33 pallets). For COOP, in 90  % of all cases {{the volume of the}} products (rather than the weight) is the limiting factor when filling cargo units. The use of trailers with a higher net weight than <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> leads tentatively to higher energy costs per tonne-kilometre; these extra costs are negligible for COOP.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> (or swop body) {{is one of}} the {{standard}} freight containers for road and rail transport. This container type may also be called [...] "exchangeable container" [...] or [...] "interchangeable unit".|$|E
5000|$|On {{transporter}} wagons with a loading {{length of}} at least 14.50 m (Type 1 conforming to UIC norm 571-4) there are an A <b>swap</b> <b>body,</b> up to two C swap bodies or an ISO container with a corresponding total length place.|$|E
50|$|<b>Swap</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{typically}} {{more expensive than}} equivalent payload ISO containers. This is because the ISO containers used in Europe {{are typically}} manufactured in China, whereas <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> are made in Europe (central Europe and the UK). The lighter weight of the body offsets this cost in fuel savings during transport and increased cargo capacity.|$|R

50|$|The use of Kangaroo {{wagons and}} Wippenwagen {{remained}} restricted {{in the period}} from the 1960s to the 1980s, despite their utility in enabling horizontal cross-loading without cranes, because at that time facilities for <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> cross-loading were still widely available in western Europe.|$|E
50|$|Many {{swap bodies}} are fitted with four up-folding legs under their frame. These legs make it {{possible}} to change or “swap” their body from one carriage to another, or to leave the <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> at a destination, without using extra equipment such as a crane or hoist.|$|E
50|$|Although roller {{containers}} {{are very}} easy to load/unload they do have some problems. The steel rollers that contact the ground can cause damage to asphalt pavement, a concrete surface is more suitable. The angle that the container is tilted can cause loads to move {{if they are not}} secured. A <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> may be used where the container needs to be kept level.|$|E

50|$|Metrocargo is a fully {{automated}} technology developed for (un)loading containers horizontally from wagons to track-side stocking areas {{and vice versa}} operating under the catenary.

50|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} greater improved movement of bulk liquids, tank containers were invented in the mid 1960 by Bob Fossey who worked for Wiliams Fairclough in London. This first tank was a beam type designed in 1967 built onto a <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> design from Fossey in 1966. The eighties and early nineties saw two different trends. One was a quest to make the tank container both lighter and have a greater capacity. Through the following decades tanks have evolved to become a lighter and more space efficient means of transporting bulk liquids.|$|E

50|$|The tank {{container}} concept was also employed in Europe by Bob Fossey, an engineer {{who worked for}} Williams Fairclough in London. They improved on the 1950s framed American elliptical container tanks, oft noted carrying specified USA engine oils for the UK’s MoD aircraft built in Preston, Lancashire. In 1964 Fairclough made a <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> tank for combined transport by truck and train, but not yet constructed according to ISO standards. In 1966, commercial production began and one year later the first {{tank container}} to ISO dimensions was developed. The first mass-produced tank containers were purchased by Trafpak, a part of Pakhoed.|$|E
