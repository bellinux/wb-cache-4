5|$|October 24, 2005– A nor'easter fed by Hurricane Wilma brought heavy rain, wind, {{and snow}} to the state. Dozens of schools {{were closed and}} 12 inches of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> in western Maryland.|$|E
50|$|Heavy record-breaking <b>snow</b> also <b>fell</b> in Moscow {{in early}} January 2010. and light <b>snow</b> briefly <b>fell</b> in Greece and Turkey.|$|R

50|$|Heavy <b>snows</b> also <b>fell</b> {{across the}} northwestern {{quadrant}} of the storm. Heavy <b>snows</b> <b>fell</b> {{in parts of}} Nebraska and Colorado on the 13th and 14th, with more eastern areas such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick being on the 15th and 16th. Montreal and Sherbrooke received just over 8 inches (20 cm) of snow. Portions of Maine received as much as 10 inches of snow (25 cm).|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} played in {{extremely}} cold and icy conditions, still the worst in Sun Bowl history. Three inches of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> {{on top of a}} layer of frozen rain the day before the game, and at kickoff the teams took the field under cloudy skies and in below-freezing temperatures. Despite the inclement weather, 15,000-seat Kidd Field was approximately half full, and bowl officials estimated the crowd at around 10,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, {{a large amount of}} snow had {{accumulated}} on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for the riders. Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided {{to go ahead with the}} stage. As <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, heavy <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> in {{some areas}} of Yugoslavia, grounding the 52nd Fighter Group Hurricanes at Knić. In the north, a major air battle developed between Rovine and Bosanski Aleksandrovac, involving Hurricanes of both the 106th and 108th Squadrons. The Yugoslavs shot down one or two Bf 109s, but lost two Hurricanes in the process. By 10 April, the VVKJ was disintegrating quickly {{in the face of the}} successful German onslaught, but Hurricanes of the 105th Squadron were able to get airborne despite the continuing poor weather, patrolling for and engaging German aircraft without result. At Knić, rumours of the approach of German ground forces led the 164th Squadron to attempt to fly its Hurricanes to a safer airfield. Five machines got into the air, but almost immediately two of them collided, and another flew into a mountain wreathed in fog. The two surviving pilots returned safely to Knić. Meanwhile, the Hurricanes of the 163rd Squadron had been rendered unserviceable by their crews to prevent their capture and use by the Germans. When it became clear that the rumours of approaching German forces were unfounded, desperate attempts were made to return the aircraft to flying condition. The same day, Hurricanes of the 4th Regiment scored a victory over a Bf 109 while chasing reconnaissance aircraft over Bosnia.|$|E

50|$|A {{winter storm}} {{affected}} {{portions of the}} southeastern coast of Australia and South Island, New Zealand. Heavy <b>snows</b> <b>fell</b> in the mountain regions of the Blue Mountains west of Sydney as well as Oberon and Bathurst while it disrupted air travel in Otago, New Zealand while causing numerous accidents across the area due to slippery conditions.|$|R
25|$|As {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} Northeastern United States and {{portions}} of Ontario and Quebec on December 2, six inches (152mm) of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> in portions of central New York, while three inches (76mm) of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> across New Jersey with a dusting in several other areas. A second band of precipitation during the late hours produced areas of rain and freezing rain (of up to four-tenths of an inch of ice) across several valley areas from New York to Pennsylvania, with rain further {{to the east and}} south, while locally over a foot of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> across parts of Upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, causing several accidents which forced the shutdown of northbound Interstate 89.|$|E
25|$|Parts of the North West {{experienced}} a White Christmas in 2009, {{and again in}} 2010, where sleet and <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> on 25 December.|$|E
25|$|Frost {{and snow}} are rare {{phenomena}} {{in the city}} as temperatures are usually well above freezing. Yet, in December 1967, <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> {{in the city and}} in January 2007 feather light <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> in the east of the city. However, excessive amounts of snow fall have never been recorded in the city. On February 14, 2008 a winter storm caused an unusual snowfall in {{the upper reaches of the}} hills of the city. During this time heavy snowfall was also observed in the Cuyamaca Mountains of San Diego County.|$|E

50|$|Further north, {{significant}} <b>snows</b> <b>fell.</b> Earlier forecasts had {{the heaviest}} accumulations going through southern Alabama and middle Georgia, causing the Alabama DOT to send {{most of its}} snow removal to points around Montgomery and southward, and the Georgia DOT to bring its own resources down from north Georgia, whose mountain counties {{are the most likely}} of any in the deep South to get winter weather.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>snows</b> <b>fell</b> {{earlier than}} usual, in November, and were {{reported}} {{as some of the}} worst in memory. Extreme cold killed humans and animals. Some people got lost near their houses and froze to death very near their front doors. The winter weather even reached the West Coast, with snowfall of 3.7 inches in downtown San Francisco setting an all-time record on February 5, 1887.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} two days the snow {{continued}} to fall, leading to additional snowfall of one to two feet (30cm to 60cm). By the time the snow ended on November 3 the storm had dropped 36.9in (93.7cm) on Duluth, the largest single snow storm total in Minnesota history at that time. The Twin Cities received 28.4in (72.1cm), setting a single-storm record for the metropolitan area. In all, at least one foot (30cm) of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> in a swath approximately 100mi (160km) wide from south central Minnesota, northeastward into northwestern Wisconsin and into the Minnesota Arrowhead. A more narrow band of 2+ft (60+cm) of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> from the Twin Cities to Duluth and northward.|$|E
25|$|Our Lady of the Snow {{is based}} on a legend that during the pontificate of Pope Liberius, during the night of August the 5th, <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> on the summit of the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Based on a vision that night, a {{basilica}} was built in honour of Our Lady, on the spot that had been covered with snow.|$|E
25|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>fell</b> so {{fast that}} traffic came to a {{complete}} halt. Motorists had to be rescued the following day as snow continued to pile up and trap them on interstates and local streets, which themselves became completely impassable. Citizens began calling into news stations asking for help and giving reports, while plows and other emergency personnel became stuck everywhere. Newark Mayor Cory Booker notably used Twitter to help stranded residents and assure citizens.|$|E
50|$|Light <b>snow</b> briefly <b>fell</b> in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine {{and further}} snow was {{reported}} in Niigata, Japan.|$|R

Day by day they drifted while the spitting <b>snows</b> <b>fell</b> hissing into the cold water, and ice formed around the keel of the boat at night. They passed men camped and panning dirt, but continued resolute, halting only [...] "to pass the good word." ...|$|R
50|$|On January 17, 2007, {{an unusually}} cold storm brought {{snow in the}} Santa Monica Mountains. The hills above Malibu picked up three inches (eight centimeters) of snow - the first {{measurable}} snow in five decades (50 years). Snow was reported on Boney Peak, {{in the winter of}} 2005; and in March 2006, <b>snow</b> also <b>fell</b> on the summit of the mountain. <b>Snow</b> also <b>fell</b> on the peak of Boney Mountain in late December 2008.|$|R
25|$|During {{the night}} before Morgestraich 2006, about 50cm of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> within {{only a couple of}} hours and blocked the inner city of Basel. It took great effort to free the city from the snow and enable the Fasnacht to take place. Never before has a Fasnacht been celebrated with more snow, and {{especially}} not fresh-fallen snow. This 50cm of snow was the third-highest snow level ever recorded in Basel and the highest level of fresh-fallen snow within 24 hours for the city.|$|E
25|$|Cape May had {{reported}} nearly 15inches of snow {{after the storm}} had moved out to sea. The town had lesser snow amounts due to {{a break in the}} southern half of the snow bands pivoting toward New Jersey. The snow totals were only expected to reach 10 to 15inches at the highest. Instead, the highest amount was in Brick, New Jersey where 36 inches fell, nearly 3 feet of <b>snow</b> <b>fell.</b> I-95 Northbound was mostly covered in layers of snow, which was dangerous for some drivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{weather was}} not in itself a {{hardship}} for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as upstate New York. On June 6, <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine. In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five {{nights in a row}} in late June, causing extensive crop damage.|$|E

60|$|The <b>snows</b> <b>fell</b> deep in February {{and when}} at last the warm March winds began to blow, lakes {{developed}} with magical swiftness in the fields, and streams filled every swale, transforming the landscape into something unexpected and enchanting. At night these waters froze, bringing fields of ice almost to our door. We forgot all our other interests in {{the joy of the}} games which we played thereon at every respite from school, or from the wood-pile, for splitting firewood was our first spring task.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} light now. As light {{as it would}} ever be beneath this leaden sky. Rain and <b>snow</b> still <b>fell</b> in gusts, driven by the blast.|$|R
25|$|On November 11, 1933, a {{very strong}} dust storm {{stripped}} topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in {{just one of a}} series of severe dust storms that year. Beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day dust storm removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl. The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited 12 million pounds of dust. Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. That winter (1934–1935), red <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> on New England.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Ontario, {{some areas}} especially near the Niagara Peninsula received {{in excess of}} 50cm (19inches) of snow. Some areas in southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec saw in excess of 50cm (20inches) of snow with Ottawa receiving the highest amount with 48cm (19inches). Several areas across Ontario reported thundersnow with locally ice pellets and freezing rain closer to the Highway 401 corridor The storm also affected much of Atlantic Canada and New England with extensive freezing rain across most of New Brunswick although northern sections of the province received from 25cm (10inches) {{to as much as}} 50cm (20inches) in Campbellton. Heavy <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> on some areas that already had close-to-record-breaking amounts of snow for that winter.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the film}} is set in Washington, D.C., many {{interior}} scenes were shot {{in various parts of}} New York City. The MacNeil residence interiors were filmed at CECO Studios in Manhattan. The bedroom set had to be refrigerated to capture the authentic icy breath of the actors in the exorcism scenes. The temperature was brought so low that a thin layer of <b>snow</b> <b>fell</b> onto the set one morning. Blair, who was only in a thin nightgown, says to this day she cannot stand being cold. Exteriors of the MacNeill house were filmed at 36th and Prospect in Washington, using a family home and a false wall to convey the home's thrust toward the steps.|$|E

60|$|Although {{the ancient}} Asia Minor {{was in the}} same {{latitude}} as New York, there was yet very little winter there. <b>Snows</b> <b>fell,</b> indeed, upon the summits of the mountains, and ice formed occasionally upon quiet streams, and yet, in general, the imaginations of the inhabitants, in forming mental images of frost and snow, sought them not in their own winters, but in the cold and icy regions of the north, of which, however, scarcely any thing was known to them except what was disclosed by wild and exaggerated rumors and legends.|$|R
