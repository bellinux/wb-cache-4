The {{purpose of the study}} is the assess the feasibility of solar pumps for irrigation purposes in Budalangi, Kenya. This study is not only looking if solar pumps are technological feasible, but it looks into other aspects too. Such as economical feasible, environmental, social etc. Budalangi is a flood-prone, poor, food insecure constituency in Kenya. <b>Solar</b> <b>pump</b> has been suggested to help alliviate poverty and hunger. The water quality in Budalangi varies a bit, some of the ground water is simply not possible to use for agriculture. Out of 76 tests 7 found to have an EC of over 3 (dS/m). Which has an severe effect on applicability of the water. 10 out of 76 test had an E. coli concentration of 200 CFU/ 100 ml or more. Which is higher than the strictest guideline. The microbial water quality does not effect the productivity thus it does not receive a lot of attention. The economical capacity for the farmer is insufficent for them to buy a <b>solar</b> <b>pump</b> without subsidies or loans. It is also a completly unknown techonolgy to them, so some training is required. Luckily the <b>solar</b> <b>pump</b> is low maintenance.

They would collect water charge from the water user but during the survey the charge was not fixed and people were getting water at free of cost. The solar pumps in Borguna, Savar, Shibchar and Gomostapur were used to irrigate 16, 8, 4 and 4  ha of rice with the discharge capacity 800, 000, 500, 000 and 40, 000 L/day, respectively. <b>Solar</b> <b>pump</b> used for irrigation was chargeable in all locations except Gomostapur, Chapai Nowabgonj. This pump was installed by CARITAS, a charity organization for livelihood improvement of indigenous people. Irrigation charge of <b>solar</b> <b>pump</b> in Savar was higher than that of Borguna. The irrigation costs in Savar (95 US$/ha) was almost double than that of Borguna (192 US$/ha). This variation was due to surface irrigation, lower installation cost, higher discharge and more subsidy provided by the NGO (Resource Development Foundation) for Borguna pump. Beside this, Borguna is a remote area in Bangladesh and Savar is situated near the capital city. Irrigation charge of diesel- and electricity-operated pumps in Bangladesh is 256 – 320 US$ per hectare in boro session (January–April) which is higher than that of <b>solar</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation.
