5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ron Chernow is of {{the opinion}} that his frustrations in dealing with {{government}} officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations that he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton, and Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{a variety}} of mitochondrial and nuclear genes places the Noronha skink among the tropical African species of Trachylepis, a position also supported by morphological similarities. It may have arrived on its island on rafting vegetation from southwestern Africa via the Benguela Current and the South Equatorial Current, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace before 1888. Mausfeld and coworkers calculated that the journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> long for the skink to survive, they proposed that the Noronha skink instead arrived via Ascension Island, where a skink may have persisted into historical times.|$|E
5|$|Rehman {{originally}} represented England, {{and played}} {{for them at}} under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> far away, however, {{due to lack of}} first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, and because he possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play for them, as he considered it to be a more realistic option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Marquis became {{interested}} in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer. This interest became an obsession that was to last the rest of his life. The battle site was only twenty-five miles to the west on the Crow Indian Reservation. All the participants of the battle on the US side had died in action, but very little had been published in the way of Indian accounts. Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that {{there were a number of}} Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive on the reservation. However, interviewing them at length <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> difficult at this time. There was the language barrier, and Marquis was busy as a doctor trying to cover a large area.|$|E

5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. At {{the end of this}} phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E

Cosmological redshift is now conventionally understood to be {{a consequence of the}} expansion of space; a feature of Big Bang cosmology.|$|E
25|$|The Catholics in the Netherlands were an outlawed {{minority}} {{that had}} been suppressed by the Calvinists. After 1572, however, they made a striking comeback (also {{as part of the}} Catholic Counter-Reformation), setting up seminaries, reforming their Church, and sending missionaries into Protestant districts. Laity often took the lead; the Calvinist government often arrested or harassed priests who <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> effective. Catholic numbers stabilized at {{about a third of the}} population in the Netherlands; they were strongest in the southeast.|$|E
25|$|From Collingwood Tech, Fothergill was {{a gifted}} sportsman {{who made his}} VFL debut aged 16, for the Collingwood Football Club in 1937. Fothergill was a small midfielder/half-forward who <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> small at the start, at 172cm and 73kg, but his {{brilliance}} as a footballer was something that over-shadowed his liabilities. Fothergill made an impact straight away as he played brilliant football, winning a Copeland Trophy as Collingwood's best and fairest in his debut season, and kicking 56 goals being the club's leading goalkicker.|$|E

25|$|Gompers's {{trade union}} {{philosophy}} and {{his devotion to}} collective bargaining with business proved to be too conservative for more radical leaders such as Ed Boyce, president of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), and, later, WFM secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood. In 1905, Haywood and the WFM helped to establish the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, whose members were known as Wobblies), {{with the goal of}} organizing the entire working class. The IWW's long-term goal was to supplant capitalism with a workers' commonwealth. Nonetheless, when government abuses against the leaders of the WFM <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> egregious, Gompers relented and offered assistance.|$|E
25|$|As a professional, Gren was {{suspended}} from the Swedish national team. However, as the World Cup of 1958 was to be played on home soil and the Swedish team <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> weak for the competition, the Swedish Football Association changed this rule, and Gren, having now ended his professional career and playing in the Swedish Division 2, was again eligible. Gren went on to be the oldest player of this World Cup, 37 years old, and {{played an important role}} in the silver medal winning Swedish team. He played five matches during the World Cup and scored one goal, 2–1 against West Germany in the semi-final.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{prosperity}} returned {{during the}} war, agitation began {{to end the}} Commission. Newfoundland, {{with a population of}} 313,000 (plus 5,200 in Labrador), <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> small to be independent. Joey Smallwood was a well-known radio personality, writer, organizer, and nationalist who long had criticized British rule. In 1945 London announced that a Newfoundland National Convention would be elected to advise on what constitutional choices should be voted on by referendum. Union with the United States was a possibility, but Britain rejected the option and offered instead two options, return to dominion status or continuation of the unpopular Commission. Canada cooperated with Britain to ensure that the option of closer ties with America was not on the referendum.|$|E

25|$|In 1665, Robert Hooke {{published}} the first drawings of a microorganism. Hooke was followed in 1676 by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who drew and described microorganisms {{that are now}} {{thought to have been}} protozoa and bacteria. Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> simplistic for sexual reproduction, and asexual reproduction through cell division had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from putrefaction, and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.|$|E
25|$|The major {{sticking}} point {{for many in}} the question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> large, even for those who were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by {{an examination of the}} attacks on the Pentagon. The film opposes the official story of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, alleging that the path of destruction does not match what a 757 would leave. In particular it claims that the size of the hole in the Pentagon, a lack of debris and, little landscape damage seem inconsistent with prior airliner crashes. It also alleges that too few parts were recovered from the crash site to reliably ascertain that they were of a Boeing 757, and that a flywheel observed at the site <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> small to {{have been part of the}} aircraft's engine turbine. Experts officially declared that the wheel was part of the APU, but others say it didn't come from the APU of a 757 but likely from an E-3 Sentry aircraft. The film also claims that the alleged hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour had difficulty operating basic controls on a small Cessna that he rented at a flight school, and that perhaps not even an experienced pilot could have maneuvered the reflex angle of turn at the airspeed and altitude at which the aircraft approached without going into a high speed stall. The film mentions three cameras on nearby buildings that allegedly caught the entire incident at the Pentagon on film, which it says the government confiscated and has refused to release in full.|$|E
