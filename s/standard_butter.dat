40|$|International audienceTrans {{fatty acids}} are {{suspected}} {{to be detrimental}} to health, particularly to cardiovascular function. Trans fatty acids include {{a wide range of}} fatty acids, with isomers of C 18 : 1, conjugated and non-conjugated C 18 : 2 as major components. A vaccenic acid (trans 11 -C 18 : 1) + rumenic acid (cis 9,trans 11 -CLA) -rich butter has been shown previously to exhibit health beneficial effects, but less is known concerning another trans-C 18 : 1 present in hydrogenated vegetable oil-based products and sometimes in milk fat, the trans 10 -isomer. The present experiment was conducted to produce butters from milk of variable fatty acid composition for use in biomedical studies with rodents, with the overall aim of evaluating the specific effect of trans 10 -C 18 : 1 and trans 11 -C 18 : 1 + cis 9,trans 11 -CLA on cardiovascular function. Milks from lactating dairy cows fed two types of maize-based diets supplemented (5 % of dry matter) - or not - with sunflower oil were collected, and used to manufacture butters either rich in trans 10 -C 18 : 1 (14 % of total fatty acids, 64. 5 % of fat content) or rich in trans 11 -C 18 : 1 + cis 9,trans 11 -CLA (7. 4 and 3. 1 % of total fatty acids, respectively, 68. 5 % of fat content), or with standard fatty acid composition (70 % of fat content). Additionally, total saturated fatty acid percentage was reduced by more than one third in the enriched butters compared with the <b>standard</b> <b>butter.</b> An understanding of the role of nutrition on milk fatty acid composition in cows allows for the production of dairy products of variable lipid content and composition for use in biomedical studies in animal models and human subjects...|$|E
40|$|Feeding regimen may {{significantly}} affect milk fatty acid compo- sition, by modulating both rumen and mammary lipid metabo- lism. Hence, {{the aim of}} the present study was to evaluate milk fatty acid (FA) composition as a marker of the feeding regimen in dairy cow. Individual milk samples of 319 cows were collected from 24 commercial dairy herds (13 ± 4 cows per farm). The ani- mals were selected so as to have individuals homogeneously dis- tributed along the entire period of lactation. Using a standard questionnaire, management and nutritional parameters were recorded. On the basis of questionnaire results, farms were grouped into 4 different feeding regimens: group 1 (low level of forage and fat integration), group 2 (medium level of forage and fat integration), group 3 (high level of forage and fat integra- tion), group 4 (high level of forage and no fat integration). Methyl esters of FA were prepared by a direct extraction and alka- li catalyzed transmethylation procedure, followed by gas-chro- matographic analysis. A reference <b>standard</b> <b>butter</b> was used to estimate correction factors for short-chain FA. Data were ana- lyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to determine how the feeding regimen of the dairy cows and the composition of the milk were differentiated from each other. Data were analyzed by the GLM, with farm, days in milking, season of calving and diet group as main effects. Significance was declared at P< 0. 05. The mean value for the different variables was an average of all milk samples and was used directly in the PCA plot. In the present study, production data collected from 24 farms showed a large variation in feed intake between and within the 4 feeding regi- mens. The first (PC 1) and second (PC 2) principal component explained 28 % and 12 % of variation, respectively. The results showed that the different feeding regimens adopted by farmers, were significantly discriminated according to milk FA composi- tion. In particular, the low level of forage is associated with a higher content of n- 6 fatty acids and a high level of n- 6 /n- 3 ratio. Fat integration is related to increasing amount of vaccenic acid and CLA (+ 25 %) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} a new {{analytical}} method is {{proposed for the}} detection of extraneous fats fraudulently added to butter. The determination is carried out by gas chromatographic analysis of butter triglycerides on a capillary column having 65 % phenylmethylsilicone as stationary phase. Over the past 25 years, various methods for the evaluation of butter purity have been proposed. The detection of adulterating vegetable oils is based on sterol analysis and the presence of these vegetable sterols in butter represents clear evidence of fraud. The official EU method {{for the detection of}} animal fats such as lard and tallow is time consuming and tedious; there are also problems of reproducibility and accuracy at low concentrations of the additives. The method proposed in this article allows us to detect the presence of extraneous vegetable and animal fats in a simple, rapid and precise way even when the quantity added to butter is minimal. The analysis is based on the best currently achievable resolution of single triglycerides components and a comparison with the profile observed for reference samples of certifiably pure butters. Moreover, by comparing each single sample analyzed with the EEC ‘‘BCR 164 RM’’ <b>butter</b> <b>standard</b> taken as reference, the present procedure can be used not only to evaluate purity but also to introduce a new parameter, ‘‘quality. ’’ The latter is defined as the similarity between the sample percentages of single triglycerides with those in <b>butter</b> <b>standards.</b> The proposed method is simple and easy to execute, even by a nonspecialist technical staff...|$|R

30|$|Industrials {{interest}} in fats as raw material, resides in their exceptional quality and potentialities of exploitation in several fields. Hence cocoa butter, palm, palmist and coco oils are so widely exploited that the Codex Stan 210 (1999) established standards {{in order to}} guide traders/industrials. Many other fats like avocado, olive, illipe and jojoba are also involved in cosmetic or pharmaceutical products {{on the basis of}} their interesting characteristics (Pontillon 1996; Joanny 2005; AAK Global 2012) Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa, syn. Butyrospermum parkii, B. paradoxa) butter which represents an important socio-economical agro-resource for its producing countries, is more and more being exploited in several industrial fields (Hall et al. 1996, Schreckenberg 2004; PNUD 2010). This increasing importance is mainly linked to its properties which would justify the wide range of its empiric uses (Hall et al. 1996). Indeed, according to these authors, shea butter has long been used in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere for medicinal, culinary, and other applications (Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa 2012; Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa and Sliwa 2012). Nowadays, shea buter, mainly the traditional one (called BIO-shea butter) interests cosmetic and pharmaceutical firms (Pontillon 1996; Elias and Carney 2004; Nahm 2011; AAK Global 2012). Nevertheless these firms are highly exigent about shea butter quality. Whereas, the traditional processes often lead to shea butter non-conform to recommended standards (Hall et al. 1996; Mégnanou and Diopoh 2008). Several studies have been undertaken to improve shea butter properties; most of these studies just focused on one or two effecting factors. Those of Mégnanou and Niamke (2013 a) took into account many factors like nuts drying mode and time, kernels quality and roasting time, so did shea butter wrapper hygienic quality. The results drew the effects of such factors on shea butter physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and consequently induced the optimized traditional process (Bup et al. 2012; Pouliot and Elias 2013; Nsogning et al. 2014). The resulted shea butter was in conformity with the unrefined shea <b>butter</b> <b>standards</b> for trade as proposed by UEMOA (2011). Nevertheless, because of the exigencies of industrials which take into account many other properties, shea butter utilization as raw material (Cosmetic and pharmaceutical) might be linked to its exceptional quality and high potential of exploitation (Honfo et al. 2013, 2014).|$|R

40|$|Summary: Butter {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular dairy {{products}} that have been transformed from a cottage industry to successful large scale productions. In western countries, consumption of butter has slowly overtaken margarine as the most popular spread. Different kinds of butter are now available on the markets, of which sweet cream butter and salted butter constitute significant proportions. The popularity of cultured cream butter is mainly attributed to its unique flavour and nutritional properties. Butter contains large amounts of β-carotene (provitamin A carotenoid) and is characterised by the buttery flavour due to the presence of diacetyl as well as other organic aroma compounds. Although butter has been produced successfully in large scale commercial processing, small scale productions still exists in small communities and for use in specialised products. New Zealand, like in many other western countries, is dominated by small to medium scale food processing enterprises which produce speciality foods for discerning markets. The domestic market in New Zealand enjoys a variety of dairy products which includes cultured butter. Some small food processing enterprises in outlying areas of New Zealand produce their own cultured butter to cater for the local businesses and their inhabitants. Thus, the main objective of this project was to standardise small scale production of cultured butter using kitchen/domestic scale equipment. Fresh cream (40 % fat) used to produce cultured butter was fermented by a mixed lactic starter culture (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis and Leuconostoc cremoris) following a modified standard method. The cream was pasteurised at 95 °C/ 5 min, rapidly cooled to 8 °C, and then starter culture (2 %) was added. The cream was held at 8 °C/ 2 h to initiate the formation of low melting point fat crystals. The temperature of the cream was then increased to 20 - 21 °C, and held at this temperature for further 2 h to melt fat crystals with high melting point and recrystallise the crystals. The temperature was then decreased to 16 °C/ 2 h to form pure fat crystals. This was then followed by slightly decreasing the temperature to 15 °C for butter churning in a K 5 SS KitchenAid Heavy Duty (USA) churning mixer. Buttermilk (100 mL) was collected and stored at 4 ºC for analysis and the remained buttermilk in the butter churn was drained. The butter grains were washed with distilled water to remove any residual buttermilk. Final cultured butter (product) was packed in heavy duty aluminium foil and stored at 4 ºC for 21 days. Cultured butter was produced on three different occasions commencing in August 2014 (batch 1), September 2014 (batch 2), and October 2014 (batch 3). Various analyses and measurements were conducted during processing and storage to monitor the shelf life stability of the <b>butter.</b> <b>Standard</b> methods were used to measure chemical, physical, consumer sensory acceptance of the products and presence of coliforms were enumerated by Violet Red Bile Agar. Thus, fat content in buttermilk was determined by the Mojonnier test to calculate churning efficiency. Colour was measured by colourimetry, while texture analysis was determined by the TA. XT 2 Texture Analyser. Water droplet size of butter was examined by confocal laser scanning microscope after staining with Nile Red and Acridine Orange. The cultured butter samples were also evaluated by consumer sensory panellists using hedonic scaling of six sensory attributes (smoothness, hardness, spreadability, melting rate, buttery flavour, and overall acceptance). Data were plotted on graphs and also analysed by analysis of variance (P< 0. 05), linear regression and interaction plot. There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) in moisture content of the three batches of butter which ranged from 13. 90 to 19. 19 %. Although the moisture content of two batches (1 and 3) of butter was slightly higher than the standard (16 %), it was within expected range. Manual washing butter grains after churning to remove water droplets may be inefficient to remove water droplets on the surface of butter. Most of the water droplets had a diameter of 5 μm which is desirable to inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms. No coliforms were detected in the cultured butter, indicating good hygiene standard during production. There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) in hardness of the three batches of cultured butter. Batch 2 had higher hardness than the other two batches, probably attributed to its low moisture content. The fat content of cultured butter of the three batches ranged between 75 % and 80 %, which was slightly lower than the expected 80 %. However, the results were reasonable, considering the higher moisture content of the butter. The cultured butter was well accepted by sensory panellists. Linear regression and interaction plot showed that spreadability and buttery flavour had significant effects (P< 0. 05) on the overall acceptance of the butter. The products were spreadable, presumably due to higher moisture content. The buttery flavour could be attributed to the aroma compounds produced by lactic acid bacteria through citrate metabolism during cream ripening. The dominant hue in the butter was yellowness, which slightly decreased during storage, presumably due to the loss of β-carotene. The pH of butter samples (5. 3 to 5. 8) during storage was slightly higher than in previous studies (4. 7 - 5. 2). The higher pH may be caused by poor acid production of the leuconostoc in the mixed culture. Cultured butter was successfully processed using a kitchen/domestic churning mixer. The churning efficiency of the equipment was lower than the expected range. The butter had good keeping quality and was well accepted by sensory panellists. The quality of the butter during storage was probably attributed to the optimal size of water droplets, which were successfully measured by the confocal laser scanning microscope method modified in this study...|$|R
