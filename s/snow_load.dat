2500|$|Just before opening, the {{director}} {{noticed that the}} porte-cochere planned for {{the west side of}} the building, where the Indian room now sits, would allow exhaust fumes from automobiles to invade the premises. A hastily designed Douglas Fir pole porte-cochere entry and parking area were erected on the east side of the hotel to correct this. (The logs were replaced in the 1990s.) Almost immediately after opening, the next of many alterations were made to the hotel. In 1928, a roof garden and dance hall were converted into a private apartment after the dance hall failed to draw an audience. It was found that the load-bearing trusses in the dining room were barely adequate to support the <b>snow</b> <b>load</b> on the roof and potential earthquake stresses. [...] This led to the trusses' being reinforced in 1931-32.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 17, 2003, heavy snow from the Presidents' Day Storm {{collapsed}} half of {{the roof of the}} museum's roundhouse. [...] Although the structure's central support columns remained standing, the supporting iron struts and ties of the destroyed roofing sections failed under the <b>snow</b> <b>load.</b> The museum suffered heavy damage not only to the roundhouse itself but also to the collection within the roundhouse. Some of the items were damaged beyond repair. Reporting on the devastation the following day, The Baltimore Sun said, [...] "...hours after the collapse, columns of mangled steel stuck out from the roundhouse ... Locomotives and passenger cars in the museum's collection, some dating from the 1830s, could be seen covered with snow and debris." [...] The roundhouse, with a newly repaired roof, reopened to the public on November 13, 2004, with the damaged locomotives and cars were surrounded by a plexiglass barrier. As of September 2015, all damaged exhibits have been restored to their original appearance.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impacts of projected climate change on heavy <b>snow</b> <b>loads</b> on Finnish forests, where snow-induced forest damage occurs frequently. For snow-load calculations, we used daily data from five global climate models under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5, statistically downscaled onto a high-resolution grid using a quantile-mapping method. Our results suggest that projected climate warming results in regionally asymmetric response on heavy <b>snow</b> <b>loads</b> in Finnish forests. In eastern and northern Finland, the annual maximum <b>snow</b> <b>loads</b> on tree crowns were projected to increase during the present century, as opposed to southern and western parts of the country. The change was rather similar both for heavy rime <b>loads</b> and wet <b>snow</b> <b>loads,</b> {{as well as for}} frozen <b>snow</b> <b>loads.</b> Only the heaviest dry <b>snow</b> <b>loads</b> were projected to decrease over almost the whole of Finland. Our results are aligned with previous snowfall projections, typically indicating increasing heavy snowfalls over the areas with mean temperature below − 8  °C. In spite of some uncertainties related to our results, we conclude that the risk for snow-induced forest damage is likely to increase in the future in the eastern and northern parts of Finland, i. e.  in the areas experiencing the coldest winters in the country. The increase is partly due to the increase in wet snow hazards but also due to more favourable conditions for rime accumulation in a future climate that is more humid but still cold enough...|$|R

40|$|While the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) {{provides}} engineers with suitable <b>snow</b> <b>loading</b> {{guidelines for}} structural design, the strict {{application of the}} code may not lead to an optimized structural design. Generalizations {{have been made to}} ensure the applicability of the code to the majority of potential structures within Canada, which result in conservative estimates in certain situations. In particular, the interaction between region-specific prevailing wind directionality, climate and roof orientation are not accounted for. However, the development of advanced physical and numerical snow simulation approaches allows for the investigation of building-specific variables that affect <b>snow</b> <b>loading.</b> The Finite Area Element (FAE) process simulates the hour-by-hour accumulation and depletion of snow on a specific building design. This tool provides detailed quantification of the probabilistic <b>snow</b> <b>loading</b> accounting for region-specific long term meteorological conditions and building-specific variables such as roof size, exposure to prevailing winds, thermal capacity and local aerodynamics. While providing a detailed assessment of the <b>snow</b> <b>loads,</b> a full FAE assessment can be both time consuming and relatively costly for many applications. This parametric analysis approach has been developed using a variety of simple building geometries to provide an approach to assess the relative impacts of many of the key variables needed to inform a design.

He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept and/or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions. The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the <b>snow</b> <b>load</b> until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.|$|E

40|$|The National Building Code of Canada 2010 (NBCC) defines several loading {{combination}} {{scenarios for}} use in structural design. Appropriate combination factors are provided based on the probability of failure due to the simultaneous occurrence of the specified loads. Load Combination Cases 3 and 4 of Table 4. 1. 3. 2.

However, in reality, the probability of the simultaneous loading due to wind and snow depends on the local meteorological climate. This probability can be more accurately simulated through the Finite Area Element (FAE) process, which studies the hour-by-hour accumulation and depletion of snow based on historical meteorological records. It takes into account variables such as wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, water retention in a snow pack and many others. In the present work, the accumulation and depletion of snow on a modelled ground patch and the corresponding wind speeds were computed on an hourly basis to determine the correlation of wind and <b>snow</b> <b>loads.</b> Using this process, this paper investigates the interaction between wind and <b>snow</b> <b>loads</b> for 25 distinct regions in Canada, for both ground and roof <b>snow</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
