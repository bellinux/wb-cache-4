5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie <b>Sleepless</b> <b>in</b> <b>Seattle</b> brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
25|$|Ryan {{subsequently}} established herself, both {{nationally and}} internationally, {{as one of}} the most successful actresses in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly in romantic comedy films such as <b>Sleepless</b> <b>in</b> <b>Seattle</b> (1993), French Kiss (1995), You've Got Mail (1998), and Kate & Leopold (2001). Her other films include The Doors (1991), When a Man Loves a Woman (1994), Courage Under Fire (1996), Addicted to Love (1997), City of Angels (1998), Proof of Life (2000), and The Women (2008). In 2015, she made her directorial debut with Ithaca, a film in which she also acted.|$|E
25|$|Ephron began {{background}} {{interviews with}} McAlary's colleagues such as Jim Dwyer, {{in the months}} after McAlary's Christmas 1998 death. In 2005, the film idea was floated again, but Ephron claimed she could not get her preferred leading actor. It was not until 2011 that Ephron succeeded in attracting Hanks to the project. Hanks had previously starred in Ephron's popular films, <b>Sleepless</b> <b>in</b> <b>Seattle</b> and You've Got Mail, but he had last performed live in the theatre in 1979 for Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of The Mandrake. The play is the final and posthumous work of Ephron, who died the year before its production.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Hanks' {{next project}} {{was no less}} expensive. For Saving Private Ryan, he teamed up with Steven Spielberg {{to make a film}} about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring back a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public. It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination. Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with his <b>Sleepless</b> <b>in</b> <b>Seattle</b> co-star Meg Ryan for You've Got Mail, a remake of 1940's The Shop Around the Corner.

She was originally considered {{for the role of}} Mary Sanderson in Disney's Hocus Pocus, but it was ultimately given to Kathy Najimy. O'Donnell claimed on her blog that she turned down the offer to work with Bette Midler because she refused to portray a frightening evil witch. Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in <b>Sleepless</b> <b>in</b> <b>Seattle</b> as Meg Ryan's character's best friend; as Betty Rubble in the live-action film adaptation of The Flintstones with John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins and Rick Moranis; as one of Timothy Hutton's co-stars in Beautiful Girls; as a federal agent comedically paired with Dan Aykroyd in Exit to Eden; as the voice of a tomboyish female gorilla named Terk in Disney's Tarzan; and as a baseball-loving nun in M.
