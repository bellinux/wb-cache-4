5|$|After {{living in}} his new house for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, {{lived in the house}} until after the Civil War. In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823â€“1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial <b>stress</b> <b>from</b> which the family could not recover.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interlaminar {{stresses}} {{that arise in}} composite laminates where gradients exist in in-plane stress fields are investigated. Two distinct mechanisms give rise to interlaminar stresses in generic problems, the presence of free edges and in-plane gradients. It is shown that the latter mechanism should be considered separately from the former and that interlaminar <b>stresses</b> <b>from</b> such in-plane gradients can be significant. A methodology to approximate these stresses through direct integration of the equilibrium equations is presented. The methodology {{involves the use of}} closed-form expressions of the in-plane stress field obtained by solving two-dimensional elasticity problems using homogenized material properties. As an example, the methodology is applied to the case of a laminate with a circular hole through which the importance of interlaminar <b>stresses</b> <b>from</b> in-plane gradients is demonstrated. The results show that the characteristics of the interlaminar <b>stresses</b> <b>from</b> in-plane gradients are very different from those of interlaminar <b>stresses</b> arising <b>from</b> free edges. Specifically, the parameters that affect the decay rates and magnitudes of the interlaminar <b>stresses</b> <b>from</b> the two mechanisms are found to be different. The current investigation provides new insights into interlaminar stress problems, in general, and offers a simple method for calculating the interlaminar stresses due to in-plane gradients...|$|R

X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted.

5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional <b>stress</b> <b>from</b> the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E

As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name.

She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, <b>stress</b> <b>from</b> her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box.

5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical <b>stress</b> <b>from</b> the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to <b>stress</b> <b>from</b> organic toxicity.|$|E
