40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a methodology for detecting and isolating multiple sensor faults in large-scale interconnected nonlinear systems. The backbone of the proposed decentralized methodology is {{the design of a}} local <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis agent dedicated to each interconnected subsystem, without the need to communicate with neighboring agents. Each local <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis agent is responsible for detecting and isolating multiple faults in the local set of sensors. The local <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis agent consists of a bank of modules that monitor smaller groups of sensors in the corresponding local sensor set. The detection of faults in each of the sensor groups is conducted using robust analytical redundancy relations, formulated by structured residuals and adaptive thresholds. The multiple <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> isolation in each local <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis agent is realized by aggregating the decisions of the modules and applying a diagnostic reasoningbased decision logic. The performance of the proposed diagnostic scheme is analyzed with respect to <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> detectability and multiple <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> isolability. A simulation example of two interconnected robot manipulators is used to illustrate the application of the multiple <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> detection and isolation methodology...|$|E
40|$|A {{descriptor}} system {{approach is}} introduced to investigate <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> reconstruction and sensor compensation {{for a class}} of nonlinear state-space systems with Lipschitz constraints. Letting the <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> term be an auxiliary state vector, an augmented descriptor system is constructed.

Accurate asymptotic estimates of the original system state vector and the <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> term are thus obtained readily. By subtracting the estimated <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> term from the measurement output, sensor compensation is performed, allowing the existing controller for the original plant (without sensor faults) to continue to function normally even when a <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> occurs. Robust <b>sensor</b> <b>fault</b> reconstruction and sensor compensation are also discussed in detail for systems with simultaneous sensor faults, input disturbances and output noises.
