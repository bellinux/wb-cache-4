The Cascadia Bioregion claims the entire watershed of the Columbia River (as far as the Continental Divide), as well as the Cascade Range from Northern California well into Canada. It's also considered to include the associated ocean and seas and their ecosystems out to the continental slope.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{talk about}} {{water and energy}} use taken from nine {{interviews}} with citizens of Perth, Western Australia.

The study had four specific objectives to: (1) review the policy, legal and institutional environment for equitable sharing of benefits from natural resources; (2) map out relevant stakeholders directly or indirectly concerned with equitable sharing of benefits; (3) identify the best practices applied in equitable benefit sharing; and (4) prepare a policy brief on the best practices on equitable sharing of benefits of the <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> in the Mara River Basin.
