5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who {{was hit by a}} rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 8 a {{depression}} formed in the south-central Bay of Bengal. It moved very <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, becoming a cyclonic storm the next day. It continued to intensify as it approached {{the head of the}} Bay, becoming the third severe cyclonic storm of the season on November 11. That evening it reached its peak with winds of 185km/h (115mph) with a well-developed eye and became the strongest storm of the season. It then made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan during the night of November 12. The cyclone weakened rapidly as it moved inland and dissipated the next day over south Assam.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-northwest {{through a}} break in the subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{began to}} slowly weaken and lose tropical characteristics on early September 12 {{as it moved}} over colder waters and encountered increasing wind shear. However, the storm was moving quickly enough to make landfall over Cape Breton, Nova Scotia as a Category1 hurricane on September 12. Later that morning, Gustav made a second landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical shortly after. The extratropical low continued moving <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast before dissipating over the Labrador Sea on September 15.|$|E
5|$|The storm peaked {{early on}} July24 with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a {{barometric}} pressure estimated at 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). The following day, unknown factors caused the storm to suddenly weaken before increasing wind shear took over. The storm gradually weakened {{for the duration}} of its existence, turning <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest. Late on July28, the storm brushed Johnston Atoll, bringing gusty winds and light rainfall to the region. Gilma persisted until July31 at which time it was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over open waters.|$|E

5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain some signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an {{area of low pressure}} that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch's {{meteorological}} history {{began with}} its origins over Africa as a tropical wave and lasted until its dissipation as an extratropical cyclone {{north of the}} United Kingdom. Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that threatened}} Bermuda but remained at sea during early September 2005. The fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane {{of the annual}} Atlantic hurricane season, Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a Category1 hurricane on September 8. After {{moving away from the}} island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable wind shear, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system.|$|E
5|$|On August25, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted on {{satellite imagery}} on August25. The thunderstorms pulsed and became better organized by August27. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed southeast of the Japanese island of Okinotorishima, or about 520km (325mi) northwest of Guam. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also estimated a tropical cyclone formed on August27. With a ridge to the north, the depression tracked <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest. The system gradually organized while developing improved outflow to the south, although a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the north caused wind shear. On August29, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Dujuan, although the JTWC had upgraded a day prior. That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the region, naming it Onyok.|$|E
5|$|On November17, a typhoon {{originated}} west of Guam, which moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west or west-northwest.

Another storm appeared on November22 to the northwest of the previous storm, just to the northeast of Samar. It moved northwestward at first, but recurved to the northeast away from Luzon, and was last reported on November24. On that same day, a typhoon was observed southeast of Guam and proceeded westward. The storm passed near Yap on November25 and later turned to the north. Two days later, a passing United States Navy ship encountered the storm. On November29, a storm passed near the Bonin Islands, but it was uncertain {{whether it was the}} first typhoon of the month near the Philippines or the storm that affected Yap. This storm was last observed on November30.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, a large {{elongated}} extratropical cyclone extended {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean with a pressure of at most 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg). The following day, the low-pressure area became more narrow and well-defined, with its central pressure deepening to 1000 mph (hPa; 29.53 inHg). On October 9, the extratropical system was analyzed {{to have become}} a tropical depression. The low moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast and gradually weakened before dissipating on October 10. On October 14, offshore observations indicated that a tropical depression had developed north of The Bahamas. The following day, however, the depression became less defined and degenerated into a trough of low pressure. On October 16, two ships listed in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. However, since these reports occurred in a higher pressure gradient, the system was not included in HURDAT.|$|E

5|$|Upon developing, the {{depression}} {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, still connected to the monsoon rough, and it moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest. The thunderstorms continued to be sheared {{to the west of the}} circulation, which limited strengthening. On August12, the JTWC briefly upgraded the system to a tropical storm after a temporary increase in thunderstorms, although the system soon weakened. A ridge to the north caused a general westward track toward the Philippines. With a fully exposed circulation, {{the depression}} made landfall at 0800UTC on August13 near Infanta on the Philippine island of Luzon. It soon dissipated due to continued shear and land interaction. The remnants continued westward into the South China Sea, and PAGASA and JMA both discontinued advisories early on August14. However, on August15, a tropical depression re-developed halfway between Vietnam and the Philippines, with a circulation exposed from the convection due to moderate wind shear. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 20W.|$|E
5|$|While moving <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east-southeast, Haruna re-intensified {{early on}} February22 to its {{previous}} MFR peak intensity. At around 0230UTC that day, the cyclone made landfall about 55km (35mi) south of Morombe in southwestern Madagascar. Haruna quickly weakened below cyclone status, and while over land it accelerated to the southeast. On February23, Haruna weakened to an overland depression with 10minute winds of around 45km/h (30mph). A few hours later, the system emerged into the Indian Ocean near Fort Dauphin as a tropical disturbance. With generally favorable conditions, convection reorganized slightly {{and the system}} redeveloped outflow to the south. Early on February24, Haruna re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm, although soon after it weakened again due to cooler waters, increasing shear, and dry air. At 1200UTC, MFR issued its last advisory after Haruna began losing tropical characteristics, designating it as a subtropical depression. The next day, the JTWC also discontinued advisories on the storm, noting that Haruna was dissipating about 665km (415mi) south-southwest of Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Fässler {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Jani was delayed by a Porsche LMGTE car at Brooklands corner. Jani {{was able to}} reduce the time deficit to ten seconds before Fässler made a pit stop for new tyres. Jani recorded the fastest lap of the race in response, at one minute and 30.303 seconds. Jani made his pit stop for new tyres with over a minute lead with Fässler retaking the first position. After five minutes Jani's front-right tyre was punctured, necessitating an unscheduled pit stop to change the wheel, and for extra fuel. Fässler made his final scheduled pit stop for fuel to {{reach the end of}} the race and remained in the lead with a seven-second lead over Jani. Bachler suffered a front-right suspension issue on his car. Smoke bellowed {{out of the back of}} Richie Stanaway's Aston Martin heading into Copse corner and he retired from the event. Joël Camathias took over the LMGTE Am lead but slowed with a car problem and returned <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane, allowing the No. 83 AF Corse into first place. Pantanici lost sixth place in LMP2 to Merhi at the loop and Rast moved into third place in category at Copse corner. The final period of pit stops began when Bruni made a stop, followed by Filipe Albuquerque who gained the LMP2 lead from co-driver Senna earlier in the race. Jani and Kobayashi both stopped for fuel which enabled the pair to reach the end of the event.|$|E
