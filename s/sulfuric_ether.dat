40|$|The {{number of}} cases of {{poisoning}} in workers in plastics industry has shown an increase in recent years with the remarkable advance of plastics industry. The workers in a chemical plant in Tokyo developed marked symptoms of poisoning while they were engaged in the manufacture of vinyl chloride sheets. The author performed clinical examinations of the patients and animal experiments, as well as an identification of the substance causing poisoning, colorimetrical determination of the substance in the air and an investigation on the effects of various drugs on poisoning. The results of the studies are summarized as follows: 1. The substance that caused poisoning has been identified as a chemical called stabilizer # 52 containing tin which is used as a stabilizer in the manufacture of vinyl chloride sheets. 2. Main clinical symptoms of poisoning are marked symptoms caused by irritation of the upper respiratory tract and disturbances of hepatic functions of a high degree. Clinical tests have revealed that the patients are positive for both urobilin and urobilinogen, and that they show marked tendency to anemia. 3. Experiments on toxicity performed in rats by evaporation method have revealed that the inhalation of 0. 5 p. p. m. fume of for 6 hours at a stretch causes histologically positive reactions in every part of the body, and the inhalation of over 5 p. p. m. causes instant death at a temperature of 30 ℃. The repeated inhalation of 0. 3 p. p. m. of fume every day at a temperature of 25 ℃ causes histologically positive reactions in 4 days. 4. The amount of tin in the solution of stabilizer # 52 produced by hydrolizing it with <b>ether,</b> <b>sulfuric</b> acid and nitric acid was estimated colorimetrically by comparing it with tin solution using dithiol. The amount of tin in 1 g of stabilizer # 52 was about 40 mg. 5. The amount of tin was measured from the following formula: X p. p. m. = 1 / 160 a. n, where a: the amount of tin in a test tube of tin solution with corresponding hue n: dilution of the solution of stabilizer # 52 showing color corresponding to standardtin solution. 6. Administration of vitamin B (100 γ/kg.) hardly had any curative or prophylactic effect on poisoning by stabilizer # 52. Intravenous injection of 20 % glucose (1 cc/kg.) had a little effect in alleviating the symptoms of poisoning...|$|R
50|$|Following Morton's use of ether as an anesthetic, James Simpson {{conducted}} his own obstetric anesthetic {{trial on}} January 19, 1847 using an open-drop approach to administer ether. However, {{due to its}} post-analgesic effect of nausea and vomiting, he later switched to using chloroform instead. Simpson's later personal discovery of chloroform's anesthetic properties inspired subsequent trials with chloroform that {{he went on to}} make public in November, 1847. The Medico Surgical Society publication of Simpson's findings was not well received and required significant defense thereafter. Three months later, on April 7, 1847, ether was used {{for the first time in}} American obstetrics. Following that initial administration documented in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal by N.C Keep, Walter Channing described several obstetric cases in which he successfully employed <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether</b> in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|After an 18 month {{internship}} in New York, Long {{returned to}} Georgia. He {{took over a}} rural medical practice in Jefferson, Jackson county in 1841. After observing the same physiological effects with diethyl ether ("ether") that Humphry Davy had described for nitrous oxide in 1800, Long used ether {{for the first time}} on March 30, 1842 to remove a tumor from the neck of a patient, James M. Venable. He administered <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether</b> on a towel and simply had the patient inhale. [...] He performed many other surgeries using this technique for the next few years, introducing the technique to his obstetrics practice as well. Long subsequently removed a second tumor from Venable and used ether as an anesthetic in amputations and childbirth. Despite his continued use of the ether anesthetic, Long did not immediately publish his findings. The results of these trials were eventually published in 1849 in The Southern Medical and Surgical Journal. An original copy of this publication is held in the U.S. National Library of Medicine.|$|E

5000|$|The Ether Dome is a {{surgical}} operating amphitheater in the Bulfinch Building at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. It {{served as the}} hospital's operating room from its opening in 1821 until 1867. It {{was the site of}} the first public demonstration of the use of inhaled ether as {{a surgical}} anesthetic on October 16, 1846, otherwise known as Ether Day. Crawford Long, a surgeon in Georgia, had previously administered <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether</b> in 1842, but this went unpublished until 1849. The Ether Dome event occurred when William Thomas Green Morton, a local dentist, used ether to anesthetize Edward Gilbert Abbott. John Collins Warren, the first dean of Harvard Medical School, then painlessly removed part of a tumor from Abbott's neck. After Warren had finished, and Abbott regained consciousness, Warren asked the patient how he felt. Reportedly, Abbott said, [...] "Feels as if my neck's been scratched". Warren then turned to his medical audience and uttered [...] "Gentlemen, this is no Humbug". This was presumably a reference to the unsuccessful demonstration of nitrous oxide anesthesia by Horace Wells in the same theater the previous year, which was ended by cries of [...] "Humbug!" [...] after the patient groaned with pain.|$|E

40|$|É grande o número de pessoas que inalam nicotina diariamente através do hábito de fumar e eventualmente têm que ser submetidos a intervenção cirúrgica no aparelho digestivo. Sendo a nicotina um agente que tem sido implicado no retardo da cicatrização das feridas, foi realizado estudo {{experimental}} em ratos com o objetivo de testar o seu efeito na evolução histológica da cicatrização de anastomoses intestinais. Foram utilizados 17 ratos Wistar com média de peso 275 ± 14 g, divididos aleatoriamente em grupo I (n= 9) e grupo II (n= 8), anestesiados com éter sulfúrico e operados com técnica asséptica. A nicotina foi administrada por via subcutânea na dose de 5 mg/kg em dias alternados, durante 17 dias nos ratos do grupo I e foi usado placebo no grupo II. Após sete dias de uso da nicotina e do placebo, foi feita secção transversal do jejuno a 5 cm do duodeno e anastomose com polipropileno 6 - 0. No décimo dia os ratos foram mortos com superdose de éter sulfúrico e foi feita biópsia da anastomose. Após processamento dos cortes histológicos e coloração pela hematoxilina-eosina, os dados foram quantificados por escores. A análise histológica revelou que o grupo I atingiu o escore 135 (média 15 ± 4, 41) e o grupo II, 218 (média 27, 25 ± 4, 89).

Seventeen Wistar rats weighting 275 ± 14 g were used. They were randomly divided in group I (n= 9) and group II (n= 8), anesthetized with <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether</b> and operated with aseptic technique. The nicotine was administered subcutaneously in the dose of 5 mg/kg in alternate days, during 17 days in the group I rats, and placebo was used in the group II.

In the 10 th day the rats were killed with overdose of <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether</b> and a biopsy of the anastomosis was made. The seccions were processed and colored with hematoxiline-eosine and the histological data were quantified through scores. The histological analysis revealed that the group I reached the score 135 (average 15 ± 4, 41) and the group II 218 (average 27, 25 ± 4, 89). In agreement with the t test, the difference was significant (p < 0, 05).

40|$|On {{examination}} of the correspondence among the principals involved, {{as well as the}} original patent application being prepared by Morton, it has become possible to reconstruct some of the remarkable details attending the first use of ether anesthesia at the Massachusetts General Hos pital in the autumn of 1846. At the time that Warren invited Morton to demonstrate the use of his "ethereal vapor" for anesthesia in a minor operation on Oct. 16, 1846, the exact chemical composition of the agent used was being held secret by Morton; Warren was clearly disturbed by this unethical use of a secret "nostrum. " When the time arrived 3 weeks later for its possible use for a serious "capital" operation, Warren employed a simple stratagem of public confrontation to discover from Morton {{the true nature of the}} substance to be used. On being informed that it was pure unadulterated <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether,</b> not some mysterious new discovery labeled "Letheon," Warren gave approval for its first use in a "capital" operation (low thigh amputation) on Nov. 7, 1846. Despite this revelation to the immediate participants, a veil of secrecy continued to surround the substance for many months, an anomalous situation evidently traceable to Morton's desire for personal reward from the discovery. It was this matter of secrecy, rather than priority for its discovery, that surrounded the early use of ether anesthesia with controversy and recrimination both in this country and abroad...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the action of streptokinase, a streptococcal derivative with fibrinolytic capacity, in the prevention of intraperitoneal adhesions in rats. Eighty animals were divided into four groups of 20 each; group A (control) received isotonic saline by the intraperitoneal route, group B received streptokinase by the intraperitoneal route at the dose of 60. 000 units/kg body weight diluted in 2 ml isotonic saline, group C received 60. 000 streptokinase units diluted in 1 ml isotonic saline by the intravenous route, and group D received 30. 000 streptokinase units in 2 ml isotonic saline by the intraperitoneal route and 30. 000 streptokinase units diluted in 1 ml isotonic saline by the intravenous route. The animals were submitted at random to median laparotomy for the preparation of stitches inducing adhesions of the ischemic type according to the model of FERRAZ-NETO et al. (1991) modified, and sacrified with a lethal dose of <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether</b> on the 3 rd and 7 th postoperative day. Streptokinase was found to be effective in the prevention of adhesions when used by the intraperitoneal route (p= 0, 0349) or when administered both intraperitoneal and intravenously (p= 0, 0073). Comparison of the 3 rd and 7 th posteperative day within the same group showed no significant difference, suggesting that the drug acts during the early period of the healing process. We conclude that streptokinase is effective in the prevention of adhesions formation when injected by the intraperitoneal route or by the combined intraperitoneal and intravenous routes at the dose employed in rats...|$|E

RESULTADOS: Verificou-se diminuição (p OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} influence of propafenone associated with propofol on myocardial contractility (dP/dt and heart rate), coronary flow, and the incidence of arrhythmia in isolated rat hearts. METHODS: Forty albino rats were anesthetized with <b>sulfuric</b> <b>ether,</b> a modified Langendorff method was performed, and the rats were fed with Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) solution, (95 % O 2, 5 % CO 2, pH 7. 4 ± 0. 1, perfusion pressure between 90 and 100 cm of water, and temperature 37 ± 0. 5 ºC). Control records were obtained after a stabilization period and rats were distributed into the following 4 groups: I (control), II (100 mcg propafenone), III (25 mcg propofol), and IV (propafenone-propofol). RESULTS: A decrease (P< 0. 05) in the heart rate in groups II and IV was observed, with a greater decrease in group II. A decrease was noted in the dP/dt ratio (P< 0. 05) in groups II and IV, during all periods. Group III experienced depression from the 1 st to the 3 rd minute. Coronary flow had a decrease (P< 0. 05) in all groups, compared with the control group, especially in group IV with a decrease from 14 mL/min to 11 mL/min. Arrhythmogenic effects of propafenone (pro-arrhythmia) were verified in 50 % of group II. In the association with propofol (group IV), no significant difference occurred, and arrhythmias (pro-arrhythmic effect) were observed in 40 % of the hearts.
