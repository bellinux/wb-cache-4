Aimed at increasing awareness, <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> and co-ordinating responses to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations, the action plan is the first comprehensive plan in Asia to address the threat of adverse heat on health. It also focuses on community participation, building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat, training medical and community workers to respond to and help prevent heat-related illnesses, and co-ordinating an interagency emergency response effort when heat waves hit.|$|E

5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a cypher {{clerk at}} the Soviet Union's embassy in Ottawa, and his family {{defected}} to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing Soviet intelligence (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and uranium-235 to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; Fred Rose, a member of parliament; and NRC scientists Israel Halperin, Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith. Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence {{that he was a}} Soviet agent has ever been established, but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn May could not have been the source, and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect. When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more cautious about <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> with Britain and Canada.|$|E
40|$|This study proposes {{and tests}} an {{integrative}} model {{to examine the}} relationships among customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information,</b> satisfaction, perceived value, and loyalty in a retailing context. This study extends research on customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> from trust and privacy concerns toward key outcome measures such as perceived value, customer satisfaction, and loyalty, and is thus {{among the first to}} model customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> with companies in robust theoretical retailing frameworks. The proposed relationships were tested using data from two retailing contexts – groceries (N = 429) and do-it-yourself (DIY) (N = 895). Findings from the two samples suggest that both perceived value and satisfaction are significant determinants of customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> with a company. Although some differences emerge in the two studies, structural modeling largely supports the hypothesized framework and positions customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> as an important antecedent of their loyalty intentions and behavior. This study provides practitioners with preliminary insight into the relationship between willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> and perceived value, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. This study advances retailing research, as {{it is one of the}} few empirical studies investigating the role of customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> in driving loyalty and its relationship with perceived value and satisfaction in a retailing context...|$|R

25|$|The {{decline in}} {{advertising}} revenues affected both the print and online media {{as well as}} all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (<b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.|$|E

In the report, he mentioned Unomásuno, Diario Amanecer, and Aerolineas Amanecer, but gave no mention to his investment group Valgo Grupo de Inversión. He stated that it was likely that Mexican officials wanted to censor Unomásunos anti-organized crime publications by providing U.S. officials with false information to link them to drug trafficking and thereby discredit their information. He concluded his statement by saying that he was open to <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> on his businesses because the accusations affected his integrity.|$|E

25|$|When she {{got back}} to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state for}} African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955.

25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone marketing is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to non-financial services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E
