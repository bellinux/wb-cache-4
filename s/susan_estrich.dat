40|$|This article {{challenges}} common {{conceptions of}} the 1980 s as simply a period of ‘backlash’ for feminism. Instead it argues that remediatory cultural activism by feminists shifted discussion and understandings of rape in this decade in complex and contradictory ways. While more space was given to feminist and survivor voices, survivors continued to be denied cultural authority. In addition, a lack of intersectional awareness allowed feminist understandings of rape to be incorporated within criminal justice discourses. The article illustrates these arguments through a 1990 media event, the publication by the Des Moines Register (Iowa) of a five-day series based on the experiences of a local rape survivor, Nancy Ziegenmeyer. The series was made possible through cultural antecedents, such as actor Kelly McGillis’ public disclosure of her own rape {{as part of the}} publicity for the avowedly feminist rape film, The Accused, and academic and Democratic political figure <b>Susan</b> <b>Estrich’s</b> writing about her own rape prior to becoming the manager of Michael Dukakis’ failed 1988 election bid. Consideration of three media events help to outline the complex cultural legacy left by feminist media activism around sexual violence in this decade...|$|R
