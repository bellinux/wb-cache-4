50|$|Airless {{tires are}} {{attractive}} to cyclists, as bicycle tires {{are much more}} vulnerable to punctures than motor vehicle tires. The drawbacks to airless tires depend on the use. Heavy equipment operators who use machinery with solid tires will complain of fatigue whereas lawn mowers that use solid or airless tires have no drawbacks. Bicycle riders who use airless tires may complain that the tire is harder than a comparable pneumatic tire. Only anecdotal evidence exists that airless tires may cause broken spokes on a bicycle wheel. Any airless tire will be heavier than the rubber tire {{it is meant to}} replace; however, many rubber pneumatic tires are also heavy. Rubber tires vary in rolling resistance and an airless tire or <b>solid</b> <b>insert</b> may only marginally increase rolling resistance if at all.|$|E
40|$|The {{detrimental}} {{results of}} whole-body vibration (WBV) and {{their effect on}} humans in the seated position have been documented. Although wheelchair users are subjected to WBV {{little research has been}} conducted to assess these vibrations or attempt to reduce them. Sixteen able bodied subjects tested two powered wheelchairs: a Quickie S- 626 and an Invacare 3 G Torque SP. Each subject tested all of the configurations of the suspension wheelchairs and solid inserts to represent a non-suspension wheelchair. In each of the configurations of the wheelchairs, the subjects traversed an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) course. Vibrations were collected from a tri-axial accelerometer mounted to a Â¼ inch aluminum seat plate during driving over the activities course. Root Mean Square Values and Vibration Dose Values were analyzedStatistical analyses of the RMS and VDV data revealed significant differences between the six different suspensions over each of the obstacles in the activities of daily living course. Post-hoc analyses revealed that for each of the obstacles, significant differences existed between the Invacare suspension and the Invacare <b>solid</b> <b>insert.</b> For the Quickie power wheelchair the <b>solid</b> <b>insert</b> setting was not significantly different from the most-stiff setting for each of the obstacles except the smooth surface. The <b>solid</b> <b>insert</b> setting was significantly different than the lowest and mid stiffness settings for all of the obstacles except the smooth surface and the deck surface. Without significant periods of rest the effects of WBV are cumulative throughout the course of the day, and the longer the exposure time the lower the threshold of non-harmful vibrations. Although most of the suspension systems are capable of reducing the amounts of vibration transmitted to the users the results of the vibration dose values seem to indicate that they may not reduce them enough to reduce probability of injury in powered wheelchair users. Future work should move towards examining these vibrations to evaluate what actual levels of WBV wheelchair users are experiencing over the course of an entire day and examining relationships between suspension and user weight to make data available to clinicians and wheelchair companies for suspension tuning...|$|E
40|$|Although {{wheelchair}} {{users are}} regularly subjected to whole-body vibrations {{little research has}} been conducted to assess these vibrations or attempt to reduce them [2, 3, 5]. Most of the wheelchair and whole-body vibration research done to this point has been conducted on manual wheelchairs. Van Sickle et al showed that manual wheelchair propulsion over a simulated road course produces vibration loads that exceed the ISO 2631 - 1 standards for the fatigue-decreased proficiency boundary at the seat of the wheelchair as well {{as the head of the}} user [6]. In a study by Boninger et al [1], 66 % of wheelchair users reported neck pain since acquiring their wheelchair. One of the key reasons believed to be the cause of pain, was the exposure to whole-body vibration. Kwarciak et al [4] and Wolf et al [7] performed similar studies using two methods of analysis to evaluate vibrations on suspension and non-suspension wheelchairs while descending curbs of varying heights. Both studies revealed no significant difference in the abilities of the wheelchairs to reduce the amounts of vibrations transferred to the wheelchair user. Although the efforts of wheelchair companies to reduce the amounts of whole-body vibration transmitted to wheelchair users through the addition of suspension systems is encouraging, the technology is not yet ideal. Additionally, the research to date has focused on manual wheelchairs exclusively, while little attention has been shown to powered wheelchairs. Methods This study includes the use of two suspension electric powered wheelchairs: The Quickie S- 626 and the Invacare 3 G Torque SP Storm Series. Each subject tested all of the configurations of the suspension wheelchairs. These included the Invacare with suspension, the Quickie with suspension set to three settings (most stiff, least stiff, and 50 % stiffness), and both wheelchairs with solid inserts to act as non-suspension wheelchairs. Sixteen able bodied subjects have been recruited for this study so far. In each of the configurations of the wheelchairs, the subjects traversed an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) course. Vibrations were collected from a tri-axial accelerometer attached to a seat plate beneath the cushion during driving over the activities course. A mixed model ANOVA was used to determine if there were differences between suspensions based on Vibration Dose Value (VDV). Results Statistical analyses of the VDV data revealed significant differences between the six different suspensions over each of the obstacles in the activities of daily living course.

40|$|AbstractThe surface {{properties}} of <b>solid</b> <b>inserts</b> {{are critical to}} the development of a reaction zone in compound castings. In contrast to prior works (based on Al 99. 5) the goal of this paper is to apply the zincate treatment to different aluminum wrought alloys. This enables the possibility to create compound structures with enhanced mechanical properties. During zincate treatment the aluminum oxide layers are dissolved and a thin layer of zinc (< 500 nm) prevents reoxidation. Coating parameters are optimized especially for compound castings: maximum coverage of the surface and high coating adhesion implemented by double zincate treatment. The pretreated inserts are embedded in an aluminum component by high pressure die casting. A sound metallic bonding between both aluminum alloys develops due to diffusion and reaction zones. Mechanical tests confirm a sound metallic bonding. Depending on the integrated wrought alloy enhanced mechanical properties of the compound structure can be achieved. Microprobe and fracture analysis provide detailed information about the interface properties of the compound structure, which can be enhanced by thermal treatment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the failure modes of undamaged and damaged graphite-epoxy cylindrical tubes subjected to internal pressure. Some tubes were intentionally damaged by either a longitudinal-line cut or a single-point impact. Both types of damage were intended to simulate fiber breakage caused by a local damage. The objectives of the program were to investigate the failure modes of graphite-epoxy cylindrical tubes subjected to internal pressure, with and without local damage, and to qualitatively determine the relative burst pressure degradation associated with preexisting local damage to the tubes. A high-speed motion analyzer was used to record images of the fractures. The images provide the failure mode information that was not available in existing literature. Testing was conducted under three conditions: hydraulic pressurization, pneumatic pressurization with <b>solid</b> <b>inserts,</b> and pneumatic pressurization with inert propellant inserts. A tube with a longitudinal cut can fail by three different modes: a local leakage mode, a bursting mode with fracture initiating from the cut, or a bursting mode with complete tube disintegration. In testing of impact-damaged tubes, {{the results show that}} the burst pressure decreases with increasing impact load. At an impact load of 1493 N (335 lb), the burst pressure decreases by 33 % compared to the undamaged condition.
