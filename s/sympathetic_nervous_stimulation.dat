SHRs exposed to nitrogen did not exhibit any significant change in SBP or HR, but SHRs exposed to nitrous oxide exhibited a generally concentration-related reduction in both SBP and HR. WKYs, however, displayed reductions in SBP and HR when exposed to either nitrous oxide or nitrogen.

The failing heart might depend more on beta- 2 receptors for positive inotropic support than the normal heart. Suppression of both beta- 1 and beta- 2 adrenoceptors by a non-selective beta-blocker, such as carvedilol, is likely to eliminate the failing heartâs much needed inotropic support, resulting in an exacerbation of symptoms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-medical use of {{methylphenidate}} is increasing. Little {{is known}} about potential acute medical complications associated with recreational use of methylphenidate. STUDY AIM: To identify medical problems associated with methylphenidate abuse. METHODS: Retrospective case series of methylphenidate abuse cases presenting to an inner city emergency department. RESULTS: We identified 14 cases of methylphenidate abuse between 2003 and 2010. Ten of these patients abused methylphenidate alone while four co-ingested other drugs, mainly alcohol. The route of ingestion was oral in nine patients, nasal in one and intravascular in four. Severe toxicity was exclusively observed in users who injected the drug. Two cases involved accidental intra-arterial injection and resulted in tissue necrosis leading to the amputation of a forearm and of fingertips, respectively. Clinical findings in the non-serious cases included mild to moderate symptoms and signs of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>stimulation</b> such as agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, hallucination, headache, tremor and dizziness. Nine of the fourteen patients were taking methylphenidate as a prescribed drug. Eight patients were former or current multiple substance abusers.

However, injection of crushed methylphenidate pills lead to serious local toxicity. Most patients with methylphenidate abuse had a prescription for the drug indicating deviation from medical use.

40|$|Eight open chest dogs {{underwent}} 25 min {{of coronary}} occlusion {{to determine whether}} brief myocardial ischemia disrupts the normal myocardial inotropic response to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>stimulation.</b> If so, this could represent a mechanism contributing to postischemic myocardial dysfunction. Myocardial segment shortening was measured using ultrasonic dimension crystals before and after coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Left ansa subclavia stimulation and systemic norepinephrine (NE) infusion were {{used to test the}} myocardial inotropic response to neural stimulation and direct exposure to the sympathetic mediator, respectively. Before coronary artery occlusion, base-line preischemic segment shortening (12. 5 +/- 1. 6 %) (SEM) increased during both sympathetic stimulation (20. 2 +/- 1. 4 %) and NE infusion (19. 7 +/- 1. 1 %). The control segment responded similarly. After ischemia and reperfusion there was no significant change in heart rate, aortic or left ventricular pressures, nor changes in control segment shortening. In contrast, shortening in the postischemic segment was markedly reduced compared to baseline (4. 1 +/- 2. 4 %), and no longer responded to sympathetic stimulation (2. 4 +/- 2. 8 %), while responsiveness to systemic NE was maintained (12. 9 +/- 2. 0 %), P less than 0. 001, which suggested injury to the sympathetic-neural axis during the period of ischemia. This reduced response to neural stimulation was persistent for up to 2 h after reperfusion. Left atrial or intracoronary infusion of bretylium tosylate, which releases norepinephrine from nerve terminals, resulted in an immediate inotropic response in the postischemic segment, which indicated that total depletion of NE from nerve terminals during the ischemic period had not occurred. Disruption of sympathetic neural responsiveness is likely a component of the mechanism of postischemic myocardial dysfunction whenever there is appreciable sympathetic drive to the heart...|$|E

40|$|Renal and neurohormonal {{responses}} to increasing levels of lower body negative pressure in men. BackgroundThe stimulation of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity induces sequential changes in renin secretion, sodium excretion, and renal hemodynamics that are {{proportional to the}} magnitude of the stimulation of sympathetic nerves. This study in men investigated the sequence of the changes in proximal and distal renal sodium handling, renal and systemic hemodynamics, as well as the hormonal profile occurring during a sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system induced by various levels of lower body negative pressure (LBNP). MethodsTen healthy subjects were submitted to three levels of LBNP ranging between 0 and - 22. 5 mm Hg for one hour according to a triple crossover design, with a minimum of five days between each level of LBNP. Systemic and renal hemodynamics, renal water and sodium handling (using the endogenous lithium clearance technique), and the neurohormonal profile were measured before, during, and after LBNP. ResultsLBNP (0 to - 22. 5 mm Hg) induced an important hormonal response characterized by a significant stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and gradual activations of the vasopressin and the renin-angiotensin systems. LBNP also gradually reduced water excretion and increased urinary osmolality. A significant decrease in sodium excretion was apparent only at - 22. 5 mm Hg. It was independent of any change in the glomerular filtration rate and was mediated essentially by an increased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule (a significant decrease in lithium clearance, P < 0. 05). No significant change in renal hemodynamics was found at the tested levels of LBNP. As observed experimentally, there appeared to be a clear sequence of {{responses to}} LBNP, the neurohormonal response occurring before the changes in water and sodium excretion, these latter preceding any change in renal hemodynamics. ConclusionsThese data show that the renal sodium retention developing during LBNP, and thus <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>stimulation,</b> is due mainly to an increase in sodium reabsorption by the proximal segments of the nephron. Our results in humans also confirm that, depending on its magnitude, LBNP leads to a step-by-step activation of neurohormonal, renal tubular, and renal hemodynamic responses...|$|E

The effects of drugs on nervous stimulation and the electrocardiographic changes after the resection of the cardiac nerves were investigated in 45 closed chest dogs. The following results were obtained: 1. The amplitude of the Twave decreased in Y lead and increased in Z lead in 20 out of 34 {{cases in which}} the right stellate ganglion [R. S. G.

Spatial maximum T vector displaced anteriorly and superiorly. The magnitude of spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. 2. An increase in the amplitude of T waves in Y lead was seen in all cases in which the left stellate ganglion (L. S. G.), and the left ventrolateral cervical cardiac nerve (L. V. L. C. N.) had been stimulated, and in 14 out of 34 cases in which the right stellate ganglion [R. S. G. (B) ] had been stimulated. The spatial maximum T vector was displaced inferiorly. The magnitude of the spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. 3. The amplitude of the T wave increased in Y lead with simultaneous stimulation of both right and left stellate ganglia. The spatial maximum T vector was displaced inferiorly and the magnitude of the spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. These electrocardiographic changes were similar to the changes which occurred with single L. S. G. stimulation. 4. Rotation of the T loop in the left saggital plane was clockwise in more than 80 % of cases with R. S. G. stimu-lation. However, rotation of the T loop in left saggital plane was counter clockwise in more than 75 - 80 % of cases with L. S. G. and simultaneous stimulation of both right and left stellate ganglia. These results suggest that right and left cardiac sympathetic nerves innervate different myocardial areas and affect the local myocardial action potentials to cause these electrocardiographic changes. 5. In more than 40 % of cases with stimulation of left cardiac sympathetic nerves (L. S. G., L. V. L. C. N.). arrythmias such as A-V dissociation and A-V junc-tional rythm were recognized. In more than 90 % of cases with stimulation of right cardiac sympathetic nerves (R. S. G., R. Rec. C. N.), marked increase of sinus rythm occurred. 6. These electrocardiographic changes resulting from nervous stimulation decreased or disappeared after the use of propranolol. These results suggest that these electrocardiographic changes were caused by Î² -effects of catecholamines. 7. The QT ratio corrected by the formula of Bazett increased in all cases of right and left cardiac <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>stimulation.</b> 8.

And if so, does this effect on blood pressure occurs at rest or during periods of activation of the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system? In view of the data of Vincent et al (43), we hypothesized that the latter would be the case. 2 If the questions under number 1 are positively answered, does intravenous administered noradrenaline have the same effect?

Twenty patients had unilateral chronic parenchymal renal disease (UCPR) and 25 patients had unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). The RVRR procedure was performed according to a strict protocol which included sodium restricted diet (40 mmol daily) and hospital admission, with one set of unstimulated samples collected after overnight recumbency, {{and at least one}} further set collected after <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system <b>stimulation</b> induced by tilting or i. v. diazoxide. In only 3 of 12 patients with serum creatinine 0. 15 mmol/l or higher and presumed bilateral renal disease was hypertension improved. If these 12 patients are excluded, RVRR was a good predictor of outcome, but only if the question of unstimulated and stimulated ratios was considered. Whereas inclusion of stimulated ratios increased the predictive accuracy to 81 % in RAS, and avoided two false-negatives, in UCPR the stimulated ratio created four false-positives. Since there were no false-negatives and six true-negatives in UCPR, overnight recumbent RVRR was a perfect predictor of outcome in this sub-group. It appears that RVRR without sympathetic stimulation is most reliable in UCPR, and RVRR during sympathetic stimulation in RAS, raising the question that renin regulation may be different in these two conditions...|$|R

Our previous studies with a thyroid hormone receptor-Î² (TRÎ²) isoform-selective agonist demonstrated that after TRÎ² stimulation alone, adaptive thermogenesis was markedly impaired, although UCP- 1 expression in BAT was normal. We used mice with a dominant-negative TRÎ² PV mutation (frameshift mutation in resistance to thyroid hormone patient PV) to determine the role of TRÎ² in adaptive thermogenesis and UCP 1 expression. Wild-type and PV mutant mice were made hypothyroid and replaced with T 3 (7 ng/g Â· d) for 10 d to produce similar serum thyroid hormone concentration in the wild-type and mutant mice. The thermogenic response of interscapular BAT, as determined by heat production during iv infusions of norepinephrine, was reduced in PVÎ² heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. The level of UCP 1, the key thermogenic protein in BAT, was progressively reduced in PVÎ²+/â and PVÎ²â/â mutant mice. Brown adipocytes isolated from PV mutant mice had some reduction in cAMP and glycerol production in response to adrenergic stimulation. Defective adaptive thermogenesis in TRÎ² PV mutant mice is due to reduced UCP 1 expression and reduced adrenergic responsiveness.

40|$|Obesity, lipid disorders, type 2 diabetes, {{high blood}} {{pressure}} and coronary heart disease are frequently encountered in wealthy populations. All these disorders frequently occur as clusters, constituting the metabolic syndrome. It is currently admitted that insulin resistance plays {{a central role in the}} pathogenesis of this syndrome. Stress responses include activation of the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system and <b>stimulation</b> of epinephrine and cortisol release. These hormones may over the long term reduce insulin sensitivity. Cortisol may also favour the development of central obesity. In healthy individuals, mental stress increases heart rate, but simultaneously decreases vascular resistance in skeletal muscle. This results in a moderate increase in blood pressure, and an acute increase in insulin-mediated glucose disposal. In obese patients, mental stress elicits responses which differ widely from those of healthy individuals. While mental stress enhances catecholamine-mediated energy expenditure in obese patients to the same extent as in lean subjects, it fails to decrease systemic vascular resistance due to endothelial dysfunction. This leads to enhanced blood pressure responses and the absence of stimulation of glucose disposal in obese subjects during mental stress. It can be hypothesized that repeated professional or social stress may activate the sympathoadrenal system, resulting in high cortisol levels, <b>stimulation</b> of the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system, and epinephrine secretion.

40|$|The {{heart is}} capable of rapid changes in cardiac output: these are caused {{in large part by}} changes in the {{activity}} of the autonomic nervous system that alter heart rate, force and time course of contraction. While studies of autonomic control have focussed on heart rate and contractile mechanisms, fewer studies have considered the influence of electrical propagation across the chamber. Conduction velocity (CV) of the action potential (AP) is an important variable, which ensures efficient pumping action of the heart and, along with AP duration, is a determinant of the electrical stability of the myocardium. CV depends on multiple factors, including tissue excitability and intercellular resistance: the latter is controlled by the number and arrangement of gap junctions (GJs) linking adjacent cardiac cells. Whole heart studies (in vivo and in vitro) report variable effects of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system <b>stimulation</b> on ventricular CV, a major complication in interpretation being the accompanying increase in heart rate. At the cellular level, changes in cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, mediated via Î²-adrenoreceptor (Î²-AR) activation, alter the AP shape and amplitude but the influence of these effects on the CV is unclear. Alternatively, CV changes may occur via altered GJ conductance, but despite detailed knowledge of the underlying channel protein (connexin), little consensus exists on the extent and time course of the change in GJ conductance induced by AR activation.

Prolonged stimulation of Âµ, Îº and Î´ receptors by opioids in the central nervous system and in the peripheral tissues leads to down-regulation of intracellular second-messenger signaling, thus inducing tolerance. If the inhibitory stimulus is abruptly removed, a set of symptoms including central <b>nervous</b> <b>stimulation</b> (e.g., agitation, irritability, tremors, increased wakefulness), <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system hyper-activation (e.g., fever, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating) and gastrointestinal disturbance (e.g., vomiting, nausea, diarrhea) can occur. This phenomenon is known as acute iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) [3].|$|R
40|$|The type 1 ryanodine {{receptor}} (RyR 1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is {{the major}} calcium (Ca 2 +) release channel required for skeletal muscle excitationâcontraction (EC) coupling. RyR 1 function is modulated by proteins that bind to its large cytoplasmic scaffold domain, including the FK 506 binding protein (FKBP 12) and PKA. PKA is activated during <b>sympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> system (SNS) <b>stimulation.</b> We show that PKA phosphorylation of RyR 1 at Ser 2843 activates the channel by releasing FKBP 12. When FKB 12 is bound to RyR 1, it inhibits the channel by stabilizing its closed state. RyR 1 in skeletal muscle from animals with heart failure (HF), a chronic hyperadrenergic state, were PKA hyperphosphorylated, depleted of FKBP 12, and exhibited increased activity, suggesting that the channels are âleaky. â RyR 1 PKA hyperphosphorylation correlated with impaired SR Ca 2 + release and early fatigue in HF skeletal muscle. These findings identify a novel mechanism that regulates RyR 1 function via PKA phosphorylation in response to SNS stimulation. PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR 1 may contribute to impaired skeletal muscle function in HF, suggesting that a generalized EC coupling myopathy {{may play a role}} in HF...|$|R
