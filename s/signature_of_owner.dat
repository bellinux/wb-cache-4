40|$|Abstract. In a {{traditional}} signature scheme, a signature σ on a message m is issued under a public key PK, {{and can be}} interpreted as follows: “The <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> the public key PK and its corresponding secret key has signed message m. ” In this paper we consider schemes that allow one to issue <b>signatures</b> on behalf <b>of</b> any NP statement, that {{can be interpreted as}} follows: “A person in possession of a witness w to the statement that x ∈ L has signed message m. ” We refer to such schemes as <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. We formally define the notion <b>of</b> a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. We begin by extending the traditional definition <b>of</b> digital <b>signature</b> schemes, captured by Canetti’s ideal signing functionality, to the case <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. We then give an alternative definition in terms of games that also seems to capture the necessary properties one may expect from a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. We then gain additional confidence in our two definitions by proving them equivalent. We construct <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> knowledge under standard complexity assumptions in the common-random-string model. We then extend our definition to allow <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> knowledge to be nested i. e., a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> knowledge (or another accepting input to a UC-realizable ideal functionality) can itself serve as a witness for another <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. Thus, as a corollary, we obtain the first delegatable anonymous credential system, i. e., a system in which one can use one’s anonymous credentials as a secret key for issuing anonymous credentials to others. ...|$|R
