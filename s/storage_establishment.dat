Sediment yields from the debris avalanche were calculated for four water years, 1980 - 1983. During 1980, the North Fork Toutle River reestablished a main channel from RM's 20 to 27, yielding 15 million cubic yards (mcy). In 1981 the channel network lengthened by head cutting, and the network was further integrated to pond and lake breaches on the debris avalanche. Channel length and width increased with winter storms. Within the channel area, braiding and incision were the major processes which yielded 31. 5 million cubic yards of sediment. Channel widening, associated with braiding, incision, and bank failure were the dominant geomorphic processes during 1981 and 1982. By 1982, the North Fork Toutle headwaters had extended to the topographic divide at Spirit Lake. Related to this headward growth, sediment yields from the upper 7 river miles of the debris avalanche increased. This accelerated erosion induced a cascading hydrologic effect, increasing sediment yields to 34. 1 mcy during 1982. By 1983, channel widening slowed and aggredation increased in the lower 8 river miles, facilitating an overall increase in sediment <b>storage.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of a stable ground water table within the debris avalanche and reduced channel incision induced a decreased bank failure and sediment transport promoting channel stabilization. This increased stability resulted in a 15. 1 million cubic yard reduction in sediment yield, producing a net yield of 19. 0 mcy. The North Fork Toutle River long profile showed rapid incision from 1980 - 1982. While 1982 - 1983 showed definite smoothing and concave profile development. Profile plots for 1982 and 1983 show that the system adjusted toward the sediment load and hydrologic conditions in the study area. A total of 99. 4 million cubic yards of sediment was calculated to have been derived from the debris avalanche between 19 May 1980 - September 1983...|$|E

Therefore, {{the authors have}} assembled the pertinent Laws of Thermodynamics and other first principles that govern physical and physiological heat exchanges. The resulting review is aimed at providing theoretical and empirical justifications for collecting and interpreting these data. The primary emphasis is upon deep-body temperatures, with discussions of intramuscular, subcutaneous, transcutaneous and skin temperatures included. These are all turnover indices resulting from variations in local metabolism, tissue conduction and blood flow. Consequently, inter-site differences and similarities may have no mechanistic relationship unless those sites have similar metabolic rates, are in close proximity and are perfused by the same blood vessels. Therefore, it is proposed that a gold standard deep-body temperature does not exist.

Information on waste generation, willingness to minimise, socio-economic characteristics, and behaviour of the households towards solid waste management were obtained from interviews with 402 households in Dhaka city. Of these, 103 households regularly practised recycling activities. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the dominant factors that might influence the waste generation and households' willingness to minimise solid waste, respectively. The results found that the waste generation of the households in Dhaka city was significantly affected by environmental consciousness, income groups, particularly the middle-income earners, and willingness to separate. The significant factors for willingness to minimise solid waste were environmental consciousness, income groups particularly the middle-income earners, young adults mainly those aged between 25 to 35 years and <b>storage</b> facility. <b>Establishment</b> of a solid waste management programme could be an effective strategy for implementing sustainable waste management in Bangladesh.

40|$|By 2003, 97 % {{autologous}} transplants and 65 % of allogeneic transplants in Europe used mobilised {{peripheral blood}} stem cells (PBSC). Soon after their introduction in the early 1990 's, PBSC were associated with faster haemopoietic recovery, fewer transfusions and antibiotic usage, and a shorter hospital stay. Furthermore, ease and convenience of PBSC collection made them more appealing than BM harvests. Improved survival has hitherto been demonstrated in patients with high risk AML and CML. However, the advantages of PBSC come at a price of {{a higher incidence of}} extensive chronic GVHD. In order to be present in the blood, stem cells undergo the process of “mobilisation” from their bone marrow habitat. Mobilisation, and its reciprocal process – homing – are regulated by a complex network of molecules on the surface of stem cells and stromal cells, and enzymes and cytokines released from granulocytes and osteoclasts. Knowledge of these mechanisms is beginning to be exploited for clinical purposes. In current practice, stem cell are mobilised by use of chemotherapy in conjunction with haemopoietic growth factors (HGF), or with HGF alone. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor has emerged as the single most important mobilising agent, due to its efficacy and a relative paucity of serious side effects. Over a decade of use in healthy donors has resulted in vast experience of optimal dosing and administration, and safety matters. PBSC harvesting can be performed on a variety of cell separators. Apheresis procedures are nowadays routine, {{but it is important to}} be well versed in the possible complications in order to avoid harm to the patient or donor. To ensure efficient collection, harvesting must begin when sufficient stem cells have been mobilised. A rapid, reliable, standardized blood test is essential to decide when to begin harvesting; currently, blood CD 34 + cell counting by flow cytometry fulfils these criteria. Blood CD 34 + cell counts strongly correlate with the apheresis yields. These are, in turn, predictive of the speed of haemopoietic recovery after transplantation, which has helped establish the adequate cell dose for transplantation. Following collection, PBSC may be transfused unmanipulated, processed to select specific cell subtypes, or stored for future use. Cryopreservation techniques allow long term storage of stem cells without significant loss of viability. Increasingly demanding calls for safety led to introduction of vapour phase storage, separate storage of infected material, and mandatory quality control measures at all stages of the cryopreservation process and subsequent thawing and transfusion. At the same time, safety of the personnel working in stem cell processing and storage laboratories is safeguarded by a set of regulations devised to minimize the risk of infection, injury or hypoxia. Requirements for quality and safety have been shaped into a number of documents and directives in Europe and USA, emphasising the importance of product traceability, reporting of adverse reactions, quality management systems (standard operating procedures, guidelines, training records, reporting mechanisms and records), requirements for cell reception, quarantine, process control, validation and <b>storage.</b> <b>Establishments</b> that collect, process and store stem cells must be accredited or licensed by appropriate national or international authorities on a regular basis.

AC is a form of translocation and translocation protocols for threatened species, mostly for reintroduction, are well established in Australia.

While the risks associated with AC are potentially greater than those of reintroductions, AC {{is likely to be the}} only available method, other than germplasm <b>storage</b> and <b>establishment</b> of captive populations, of conserving many taxa under future climate change. AC may also be necessary to maintain ecosystem services, particularly where keystone species are affected. Current policies and procedures for the preparation of Translocation Proposals will require modification and expansion to deal with Assisted Colonization, particularly in relation to risk management, genetic management, success criteria, moving associated species and community consultation. Further development of risk assessment processes, particularly for invasiveness, and guidelines for genetic management to maintain evolutionary potential are particularly important in the context of changing climate. Success criteria will need to respond to population establishment in the context of new and evolving ecosystems, and to reflect requirements for any co-establishment of interdependent species. Translocation Proposals should always be subjected to independent peer review before being considered by regulators. We conclude that consistent approaches by regulators and multilateral agreements between jurisdictions are required to minimize duplication, to ensure the risk of AC is adequately assessed and to ensure the potential benefits of AC are realized...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of this article the significance of storage for the correct development of industry and for the commodity circulation has been stated. One of the important problems concerning <b>storage</b> is the <b>establishment</b> of some factors which influence the concentration of commodity circulation. This concentration makes possible the introduction of various organizational and technical solutions the application of which (with a small storage turnover) would not be economically justified. Worth mentioning is the fact that the concentration of storage turnover is influenced by different factors which produce different effects and which have different (or even opposite) impact directions. That is why it is necessary to define the force and direction of every factor on which the degree of concentration of storage turnover economically depends. There is a large number of factors influencing the concentration of storage turnover but the article mentions only the most important ones. After the discussion of these factors their influence on the concentration of storage turnover has been proved.

For dynamics without this storage effect the effective mutation rate reduces, and the pace of evolution slows down, when the fluctuations grow.

Therefore {{the present study was}} carried out to estimate the biomass and carbon storages of the main stem of Eucalyptus grandis using allometric relationships using the plantations of Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts in Sri Lanka. Tree diameter and total height were measured for the samples trees and stem volume was estimated using a previously built individual model for the same species. Stem biomass was estimated using core samples and carbon was determined using Walkley-Black method. Finally the biomass values were converted separately to the carbon values. Non-liner regression analysis was employed for the construction of models which had age as the explanatory variable. Linear regression was used in order to build the models to predict the above ground and stem biomass and carbon using volume as the explanatory variable. For both linear and non-linear types, the model quality was tested using R 2 and fitted line plots. According to the results, stem biomass and carbon values at the 7 th year were 110. 8 kg and 68. 7 kg respectively.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{conditions}} for underground gas <b>storage</b> (UGS) objects <b>establishment</b> {{is the presence of}} hydrogeologically isolated structures. These are mainly exhausted hydrocarbon deposits and aquifers in the Cenozoic fill and the basement of the Danube Basin. The geochemical indicators used to determine the aquifer isolation level of potential underground gas storage objects are based on the ratio of stagnant and dynamic water components. The most widely used indicator is the rHCO 3 /rCl molar ratio, assuming that the HCO 3 - concentration represents the dynamic origin of dissolved rock material by meteoric water and that the Cl- concentration is the stagnant marine component. To distinguish these two components of the water in the aquifers the rHCO 3 /rCl indicator was combined with other parameters, such as rCl/rSO 4 and rCl/rBr molar ratios. As for more aquifers of the Danube Basin contain higher amounts of carbon-dioxide we attempted to quantify the influence of the carbon dioxide on the water chemistry. The numerical model simulating rock-marine water interactions under different PCO 2 temperature and ion-exchange conditions proved the rHCO 3 /rCl molar ratio increase caused higher carbon dioxide partial pressure for this purpose. Consequently under the conditions of higher partial carbon dioxide pressure the rHCO 3 /rCl ratio is indicating a lower isolation level of the structure. Taking in account signs of the higher carbon dioxide pressure based on the numerical model combined with the abovementioned geochemical indicators the most convenient aquifers for UGS establishment were identified within the Slovak part of the Danube Basin. These are located within Badenian sediments in the Trakovice and Sereď areas, due to the presence of hydrogeologically isolated structures buried at depth intervals of 800 to 1150 m below ground level. Other potential convertible aquifers are present in the Lower and Middle Badenian sediments in the Komjatice and Želiezovce Depressions, especially in the following localities: Modrany at 1145 to 1670 m below the surface, Vráble approximately up to 2110 m and Zlaté Moravce at 1364 to 1374 m below surface...|$|R

Understanding these effects is important to addressing issues relevant to ecosystem function and productivity, and to global balance of carbon. The study investigated the effects of the created coniferous plantations on former beech and pasture sites on the soil organic carbon storage. The major forest-related land-uses in the high mountainous regions of central Stara Planina Mountain were investigated: mountainous pasture, coniferous plantations (planted on previous pasture and beech forests between four and five decades ago) and natural beech forests. The experimental data of soil properties, conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007, were used in determining the variations in organic carbon storage in forest litter and in mineral soil under different land-use patterns. At each site five representative soil profiles were opened and described giving a total 75 soil samples from the soil layers respectively at 0 - 10, 10 - 30 and 30 - 50 cm depth. A total of 55 samples from forest floor layers (Aol, Aof, Aoh and greensward) were collected with 25 : 25 cm plastic frame. The main soil properties were determined in accordance with the standardized methods in the Laboratory of soil science at the Forest Research Institute - BAS. The IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry was used to estimate the soil organic carbon stock in soil and litter. The results obtained showed that the SOC stock was quite similar among forest land-uses. The conversion of natural beech forests to coniferous plantations in studied region is related with slightly expressed decrease in soil carbon storage. The values of SOC stocks in 0 - 50 cm soil layer in these sites were 8. 5 (± 2. 1) tones/ha for pine and 11. 0 (± 1. 4) tones/ha for spruce, while under the natural beech forest it was 14. 8 (± 1. 0) tones/ha. The SOC stock in mountainous pasture was 20. 7 (± 6. 5) tones/ha, while in spruce plantation created on previous pasture it was 13. 5 (± 2. 7) tones/ha. Our finding showed that forest conversions effect in central Stara Planina Mountain is expressed by decrease in SOC stock related with losses of carbon from the upper mineral soil decades after creation of coniferous plantations. Nevertheless the relatively large organic carbon storage in forest litter in the spruce plantations compensated C lost from mineral soil after the land-use change. The overall carbon stock both in forest litter and soil under plantations ranged from 56 tones/ha (pine) to 77 tones/ha (spruce), while under natural beech forest and pasture the values were 70 and 81 tones/ha respectively. But in terms of stability C sequestrated in mineral soil is more desirable than C sequestrated in forest floor which are more vulnerable to decomposition following disturbances. The application of silvicultural activities in coniferous plantations created by conversion of forest lands or grasslands in the region of central Balkan is desirable to improve the carbon sequestration in soils...|$|R

Though vital, field collections are prone to losses through climatic catastrophes and the action of pests and diseases and the recalcitrant nature of cocoa seed with regard to <b>storage</b> make the <b>establishment</b> of a cryopreserved collection of key cocoa germplasm a sensible precaution. To this end approximately 600 accessions of cocoa are being cryopreserved at Reading University through the encapsulation-dehydration of floralderived somatic embryos (SEs) and a newly-developed PVS 2 -based approach. These vitrification-based procedures involve the rapid cooling of the prolific secondary SEs obtained from cultured cotyledonary explants of primary SEs. With a view to maintaining the genetic fidelity of cryopreserved plant germplasm, shoot tip culture has become the propagation system of choice. In the case of cocoa in vitro shoot regeneration has proved problematic though rapid clonal multiplication can be achieved via somatic embryos derived from the floral tissues. Primary SEs can be induced from petal bases and staminodes and multiplication rates can be further increased through the production of secondary SEs from cotyledonary explants of primary embryos. Due to concern about somaclonal variation arising through the protracted callus phase involved in the generation of these propagules, their genetic fidelity has been tested and primary SEs have been found to exhibit a significant number of mutations. In this study nuclear microsatellite-based screening has been applied to each of the cocoa linkage groups in SEs sampled from sequential stages of the cryopreservation procedure (i. e. following culture, sucrose pretreatment, dehydration over silica and thawing after storage in liquid nitrogen) and compared with profiles for the donor tree. For all 48 regenerants tested in duplicate none exhibited aberrant profiles with respect to the donor tree for any of the 12 microsatellites screened. Furthermore, the use of microscopy techniques involving only minimal sample preparation (i. e. confocal and environmental scanning EM) have provided convincing evidence that post-cryo? regenerants are derived from epidermal rather than callus cells, minimising any additional mutation risk. We conclude that, within the limits of this test population, no gross chromosomal changes occurred during cryopreservation and given the recent demonstration of virus elimination as a result of somatic embryogenesis, secondary SEs constitute an acceptable target tissue for cocoa germplasm conservation.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the behavior of relevant foodborne and spoilage microbiota in Beira rice morcela (MB) and Monchique rice morcela (MM) in relation to the industrial processing and storage. In order to understand the behavior of foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes) in Beira rice morcela paste, two trials were designed. In the first it was studied the effect of thermal process (72 °C in the thermal center), cooling rate (quick and slow) and storage temperature (4 and 15 °C) in the behavior Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Bacillus cereus, previously grown in normal media and under designated stress conditions (modified media supplemented with 1 % NaCl, 0, 75 mg/L NaNO 2 and 5 % of glycerol). With Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes it was also studied the effect of high and low inoculum level. Enterococcus faecium was used in the same conditions to validate the thermal processing efficiency. The second trial, design as complementary to the first, it was evaluated the industrial process and recovery ability of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 :H 7 survive and outgrown in MM produced under the same conditions as it is in a local industry. Generally, it was observed that the heat treatment used in the industry is enough to ensure a reduction of 5 D in the population of non sporulated pathogens. The designated slow cooling rate (the more similar to that achieved in the industry) revealed to be more effective in the reduction of these pathogens. The sporulated pathogens tested revealed to have a poor ability to outgrowth in the morcela, probably due to the biological state of the spores when the heat treatment was applied. The spoilage microbiota of MM packaged in MAP 60 : 40 was monitored during 49 days of storage in refrigeration temperature and under temperature abuse (15 °C). LAB was the main v specific spoilage microorganism enumerated. Enterococcus spp. and coagulase negative Staphylococcus was also involved. Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp.) associated to spoilage due to its catabolic activities and sensory negative impact decrease during the <b>storage.</b> Aiming to <b>establishment</b> the risk of growth of relevant foodborne pathogens in MB – a ready-to-eat product – a microbial challenge test was designed challenging of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. The challenge test was performed in morcela slices packaged (MAP 60 : 40, vacuum and aerobic) and stored at refrigeration temperature (4 °C) and under conditions of temperature abuse (15 °C) during 35 days. Independently of the storage conditions the outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes occurred in the early period of storage, resulting in a hazardous product. The hazard associated to the other pathogens challenged was generally only significative if the samples were stored under temperature abuse. The spoilage microbiota of slices of Monchique morcela was very abundant and composed mainly by LAB, but also by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp., that have important negative impact in the sensory characteristics of the product. The aerobic package was always the worst solution.

40|$|This report {{analyses}} the agriculture, {{health and}} tourism sectors in Saint Lucia {{to assess the}} potential economic impacts of climate change on the sectors. The fundamental aim of this report is {{to assist with the}} development of strategies to deal with the potential impact of climate change in Saint Lucia. It also has the potential to provide essential input for identifying and preparing policies and strategies to help advance the Caribbean subregion closer to solving problems associated with climate change and attaining individual and regional sustainable development goals. Some of the key anticipated impacts of climate change for the Caribbean include elevated air and sea-surface temperatures, sea-level rise, possible changes in extreme events and a reduction in freshwater resources. The economic impact of climate change on the three sectors was estimated for the A 2 and B 2 IPCC scenarios until 2050. An evaluation of various adaptation strategies for each sector was also undertaken using standard evaluation techniques. The key subsectors in agriculture are expected to have mixed impacts under the A 2 and B 2 scenarios. Banana, fisheries and root crop outputs are expected to fall with climate change, but tree crop and vegetable production are expected to rise. In aggregate, in every decade up to 2050, these sub-sectors combined are expected to experience a gain under climate change with the highest gains under A 2. By 2050, the cumulative gain under A 2 is calculated as approximately US$ 389. 35 million and approximately US$ 310. 58 million under B 2, which represents 17. 93 % and 14. 30 % of the 2008 GDP respectively. This result was unexpected and may well be attributed to the unavailability of annual data that would have informed a more robust assessment. Additionally, costs to the agriculture sector due to tropical cyclones were estimated to be $ 6. 9 million and $ 6. 2 million under the A 2 and B 2 scenarios, respectively. There are a number of possible adaptation strategies that can be employed by the agriculture sector. The most attractive adaptation options, based on the benefit-cost ratio are: (1) Designing and implementation of holistic water management plans (2) Establishment of systems of food <b>storage</b> and (3) <b>Establishment</b> of early warning systems. Government policy should focus on the development of these adaption options where they are not currently being pursued and strengthen those that have already been initiated, such as the mainstreaming of climate change issues in agricultural policy. The analysis of the health sector placed focus on gastroenteritis, schistosomiasis, ciguatera poisoning, meningococal meningitis, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and malnutrition. The results obtained for the A 2 and B 2 scenarios demonstrate the potential for climate change to add a substantial burden to the health system in the future, a factor that will further compound the country’s vulnerability to other anticipated impacts of climate change. Specifically, it was determined that the overall Value of Statistical Lives impacts were higher under the A 2 scenario than the B 2 scenario. A number of adaptation cost assumptions were employed to determine the damage cost estimates using benefit-cost analysis. The benefit-cost analysis suggests that expenditure on monitoring and information provision would be a highly efficient step in managing climate change and subsequent increases in disease incidence. Various locations in the world have developed forecasting systems for dengue fever and other vector-borne diseases that could be mirrored and implemented. Combining such macro-level policies with inexpensive micro-level behavioural changes may have the potential for pre-empting the re-establishment of dengue fever and other vector-borne epidemic cycles in Saint Lucia. Although temperature has the probability of generating significant excess mortality for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, the power of temperature to increase mortality largely depends on the education of the population about the harmful effects of increasing temperatures and on the existing incidence of these two diseases. For these diseases it is also suggested that a mix of macro-level efforts and micro-level behavioural changes can be employed to relieve {{at least part of the}} threat that climate change poses to human health. The same principle applies for water and food-borne diseases, with the improvement of sanitation infrastructure complementing the strengthening of individual hygiene habits. The results regarding the tourism sector imply that the tourism climatic index was likely to experience a significant downward shift in Saint Lucia under the A 2 as well as the B 2 scenario, indicative of deterioration in the suitability of the island for tourism. It is estimated that this shift in tourism features could cost Saint Lucia about 5 times the 2009 GDP over a 40 -year horizon. In addition to changes in climatic suitability for tourism, climate change is also likely to have important supply-side effects on species, ecosystems and landscapes. Two broad areas are: (1) coral reefs, due to their intimate link to tourism, and, (2) land loss, as most hotels tend to lie along the coastline. The damage related to coral reefs was estimated at US$ 3. 4 billion (3. 6 times GDP in 2009) under the A 2 scenario and US$ 1. 7 billion (1. 6 times GDP in 2009) under the B 2 scenario. The damage due to land loss arising from sea level rise was estimated at US$ 3. 5 billion (3. 7 times GDP) under the A 2 scenario and US$ 3. 2 billion (3. 4 times GDP) under the B 2 scenario. Given the potential for significant damage to the industry a large number of potential adaptation measures were considered. Out of these a short-list of 9 potential options were selected by applying 10 evaluation criteria. Using benefit-cost analyses 3 options with positive ratios were put forward: (1) increased recommended design speeds for new tourism-related structures; (2) enhanced reef monitoring systems to provide early warning alerts of bleaching events, and, (3) deployment of artificial reefs or other fish-aggregating devices. While these options had positive benefit-cost ratios, other options were also recommended based on their non-tangible benefits. These include the employment of an irrigation network that allows for the recycling of waste water, development of national evacuation and rescue plans, providing retraining for displaced tourism workers and the revision of policies related to financing national tourism offices to accommodate the new climate realities [...] 1.
