40|$|Rural {{agricultural}} {{banks are}} similar in legal and operating structure to their urban counterparts yet they face several institutional and environmental conditions that are dissimilar from urban banks. Some of these are the rural banks relative inability to tap the national money markets with their financial instruments and their <b>seasonal</b> <b>loan</b> demand and liquidity requirement resulting from the seasonal agricultural crop production cycle. Because of seasonality of operations, the agricultural bank has normally {{found it necessary to}} remain more liquid by holding additional assets as investments, especially during the winter months. These investments, since they are short-term, usually yield a lower return than long-term investments. The lower yield can make many rural banks less profitable than similar-sized urban banks...|$|E

Using agricultural insurance, the farmers in emerging markets can makes the jump from subsistence farming to sustainable farming. Subsidising agricultural insurance, in economic crisis, offers the benefit of encouraging farmers to access credit (<b>seasonal</b> <b>loans)</b> and invest in enhanced production and achieve increased yields. In many emerging markets where infrastructure is still underdeveloped, {{it can also be}} leveraged to encourage investment in storage and transportation, distribution and other logistics services. In the context of developed economies, the low and middle income countries, this article examines the evolution of agricultural insurance markets. The analysis of the agricultural insurance market highlighted the necessity of applying measures of improving the insurers’ activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Borrowing {{money is}} a common {{strategy}} to cope with health care costs. The impact of borrowing on households can be severe, leading to indebtedness and further impoverishment. However, the available literature on borrowing practices for health is limited. We explore borrowing practices for paying for health care by the poor in Cambodia and provide a typology, associated conditions, {{and the extent of}} the phenomenon. Methods In addition to a semi-structured literature review, in-depth interviews were conducted with representatives of 47 households with health-related debt and 19 managers of formal or informal credit schemes. Results A large proportion of Cambodians, especially the poor, resort to borrowing to meet the cost of health care. Because of limited cash flow and access to formal creditors, the majority take out loans with high interest rates from informal money lenders. The most common type of informal credit is locally known as Changkar and consists of five kinds of loans: short-term <b>loans,</b> medium-term <b>loans,</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>loans,</b> loans for an unspecified period, and loans with repayment in labour, each with different lending and repayment conditions and interest rates. Conclusion This study suggests the importance of informal credit for coping with the cost of treatment and its potentially negative impact on the livelihood of Cambodian people. We provide directions for further studies on financial protection interventions to mitigate harmful borrowing practices to pay for health care in Cambodia. </p...|$|R

25|$|Small landholders and sharecroppers {{were still}} {{required}} to pay rent and taxes and pay off their debts, which were characterised by usurious rates of interest. Any poor harvest thus exacted a heavy toll, given their lack of legally defined security. The accumulation of consumer debt, <b>seasonal</b> <b>loans,</b> and crisis loans began a cycle of spiraling, perpetual indebtedness. This dynamic was reinforced by laws, originally designed to alleviate usury, that restricted access to credit and discouraged or prevented the practice of using farmlands as collateral for loans. This had the unintended effect of making creditors less willing to accept farmlands as a pledge against a debt, {{and more likely to}} simply wait until their debtors were unable to repay their loans. Then it was relatively easy for the jotedars to use litigation to force debtors to sell all or part of their landholdings at a low price or forfeit them at auction. Debtors then became landless or land-poor sharecroppers and labourers, usually working the same fields they had once owned. The credit-driven slide into poverty converted farmers from smallholders into dwarfholders, and from dwarfholders into sharecroppers or agricultural labourers. The accumulation of household debt to a single, local, informal creditor (who also held power over land and sometimes grain or jute) also bound the debtor nearly inescapably to the creditor/landlord; it became nearly impossible to settle the debt after a good harvest and simply walk away. In this way, the jotedars effectively dominated and impoverished the lowest tier of economic classes in several districts of Bengal.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} with main objective of performance of NPA of DCCB, Nagpur. For this the data provided by the bank {{for the period of}} 30 years, i. e., from year 1981 - 2010 were analyzed. The performance of the bank is found good as noticed by paid-up share capital, Own funds, Total deposits, Working capital having significant growth during the study period. The <b>Loan</b> Advances, <b>Seasonal</b> Agricultural Operation <b>loan</b> found increasing growth rate. Bank's incremental CD-ratio resulted to create an asset-liability mismatch for the bank. Increasing growth of loan outstanding and overdues amount shows poor repayment capacity of the borrowers. As regard to growth in NPA amount, the repayment of loan in agriculture sector is comparatively better than non-agriculture sector. The effective follow-up of loan, eliminate loan and interest waivers schemes, incentives to prompt payers of loan, training to the staff, awareness program for the borrowers to repay the loan on time, etc., are some of the measures to combat the NPA of the bank...|$|R
40|$|Since July 2003, the Banque de France {{has been}} using {{seasonally}} adjusted (SA) data for the monthly reporting of national monetary developments, with renewed statistical tools. Before {{the start of the}} single currency in 1999, the Banque de France already calculated seasonally adjusted data, using a rather old method, X 11 -ARIMA. Due to the shortcomings of this means, the Banque de France has developed a new method of seasonal adjustment, using both TRAMO-SEATS and X 12 -ARIMA, and defining a specific revision policy for each SA series. his paper aims at presenting and explaining the choices made by the Banque de France regarding the implementation of the new production process of seasonally monetary and loans series. In the meantime, the theoretical background related to the concept of seasonality and to various seasonal adjustment methods is shown in order to throw light on these choices, thus not from a research angle. The paper firstly provides information about the concept of seasonality as well as the existing methods of seasonal adjustment. The new production process of SA monetary data at the Banque de France is then described. Two examples related to the <b>seasonal</b> adjustment of <b>loans</b> to enterprises and to housing loans are included in order to stress the difficulties implied by the monthly production of SA data, as well as the impact on then output of the choices made by the producer regarding the modelling of the seasonality.

40|$|Most of {{the rural}} {{population}} in Mozambique operates totally outside the reach of any financial sector operator. Nearly all {{of the rural}} districts have no formal banking facilities at all. The microfinance sector is small and has an urban and peri-urban orientation, while both the community-based financial arrangements and development credit institutions have a very limited outreach in rural areas. This institutional situation makes {{it very difficult for}} the financial sector to respond to the increasing demands for rural financial services in the country and today practically all seasonal agricultural credit to smallholders is provided by marketing and processing companies under interlocking arrangements. These interlocking arrangements vary from the contract farming to the farmers’ cooperatives. This study focuses on the contract farming type of coordination. It refers to a situation where the contractor agrees on providing inputs and extension services, and expects that the farmer in return provide the input for the agro-processing industry. The contractor can be from the small commercial entity to the enormous agro-processing industry. This arrangement has the potential, according to the literature reviewed, to alleviate the problems arising in the contractual arrangements, like moral hazard and asymmetric information that generates market failures. It also is considered as potential credit channel to the smallholders in rural areas, once they are targeted by the credit market failure. The operations and traditional production technology of the typical family farm, and its associated credit needs, are too small to warrant the economic extension of the formal credit system. In the short term it can not be expected that the commercial banks would reconsider their strategies of market expansion into agricultural commerce. This study aims to assess to what extent contract farming can be considered as one attenuating instrument of the hindered rural financial sector. The study draws upon the contract farming scheme practiced by the MLT – Mozambique Leaf Tobacco Ltd and DIMMON – Tabacos de Moçambique, in the Tete province. The data was collected using standard and simple, but credible, methodology. The data was obtained through the Ministry of Agriculture, Centro de Promoção de Investimentos (CPI) and some private institutions and individuals. For the confirmation and additional information on the CF scheme, the company’s management were contacted. In terms of the data analysis three main approaches were taken to gradually increase confirmation of the proposed hypothesis. One was a triangulation of positivism, post positivism and logical empiricism in order to consider both quantitative and qualitative information. Secondly, Econometrics approach was used. It helped to inspect the sample, through sample mean tests, student t-test and one-way analysis of variance. In addition to this, regression analysis were also used, namely Linear and Logistic (Logit), in order to assess the hypotheses derived for the topic of the study. And finally the case study method which allowed the analysis of a specific case from Mozambique, already mentioned above, being the case of the Tete province’s tobacco agro-industrial companies. The results it’s of the regressions ran, suggest that the location (district), the land proportion reserved for each type of crop, the hand tools endowment, level of credit in terms of value are important determinants for the success of the CF’s credit scheme as alternative source of credit for the tobacco growers of Tete province. The regressions showed also that there is a relation between the income per member of the household and their characteristic, but it is not as strong to support the idea that their characteristics explain why they are better off under the CF scheme. But it also does not reject the idea that growers characteristics, like the household size, their core activities, whether is farming or/and outside farming, do show some important effects on their well being. As to conclusions, the agro-industrial CF scheme was shown to be a good alternative to alleviate the credit constraint problem. The results also suggest that CF {{can be used as a}} way to link small-scale farmers with agribusiness, on condition that the correct governance structures, good relation between the parties and reduction of transaction cost are taken into account. But at the same time it is also clear that company credit is not, and does not aim to be, a substitute for the operations of the financial institutions. The range of financial services provided by the marketing companies is very narrow, consisting in most cases only of small in-kind <b>seasonal</b> <b>loans.</b> From different alternatives of coordination options that came up, it was clear that not a unique one of them could be considered as the most appropriate one in order to attenuate the problem analysed. The problem of the agriculture development goes beyond the credit issue to inputs and technology availability, access to markets, transportation and stocking facilities are few among the many existents. Thus there should by an integrated analysis of these issues in order to compute a strategic plan comprising both sectors, financial and agricultural, for the development of the agricultural sector...|$|R
