40|$|The {{application}} of cognitive neuropsychological theories {{to the design}} and implementation of treatment programmes remains relatively unexplored, especially in children. In addition, cognitive neuropsychological treatment programmes for dyslexia to date have focused on specific dyslexias such as phonological and surface dyslexia and have ignored the large subgroup of children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>impairments</b> of the reading system, those with mixed dyslexia. This study evaluates a sublexical treatment programme designed for a child with dyslexia of the mixed type. The treatment approach is based on sublexical treatment programmes that {{have been reported in}} cases of adult acquired dyslexia (Berndt & Mitchum, 1994; De Partz, 1986; Nickels, 1992). The focus of treatment is on nonword reading and includes training in grapheme parsing, grapheme-to-phoneme knowledge, and phoneme blending. Treatment outcome is measured through extensive pre- and post-treatment assessment of sublexical and lexical processing, semantics, and general phonology. The treatment design enables an objective assessment of treatment efficacy, stability of treatment effects over time and generalisability of the treatment to untreated stimuli and related language processes. The study illustrates the validity of the use of models and methods derived from work with adults with acquired impairments to paediatrics, and the usefulness of analytical models in cases of severe mixed dyslexia. 31 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} "general education classrooms" promote {{progress for}} students with severe disabilities (Wehmeyer, 2006, pp. 323). However, most students with significant challenges, which is the more appropriate term {{used to refer to}} students with <b>severe</b> cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>impairments,</b> continue to be educated in substantially separate classrooms, which further limits their access to the general curriculum among many other features of an education provided in the least restrictive environment. The information sought from {{this study was to determine}} if the implementation of Pitt County's pacing guides paired with professional development would increase the grade appropriate core curriculum content taught to students with significant challenges in Pitt County. The lack of current research on approaches to improving teachers' capacity to ensure that students with significant challenges are taught general curriculum content drove the interest and potential findings of this study.   A new Low-Incidence Instructional Coach process was implemented with all low-incidence teachers. As part of this process, lesson plans were collected before and after the implementation of pacing guides and professional development. The purpose of the lesson plan analysis was to study what core curriculum content was being taught in these classrooms. The pacing guides are a tool that suggests a sequence that teachers could use to teach core curriculum content in their classrooms throughout the school year. The study examined baseline lesson plans collected at the beginning of the Low-Incidence Instructional Coach process and the lesson plans collected after the pacing guides had been implemented. There was hope that the tool, training, and continuous coaching (Low-Incidence Instructional Coach process) would help the teachers enhance the education of students with significant challenges.   M.

40|$|As the {{inclusive}} education {{for students with}} disabilities has been expanded recently, the number of special class and {{the number of students who}} are given {{inclusive education}} in regular schools have increased. In spite of the current tendency in South Korea, the children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities have been frequently isolated or neglected from education and the inclusive education has focused on the physical inclusion; the educational supports are not sufficient. In this context, this study aims to find the tasks for educational supports in order to successfully realize inclusive education by understanding the actual situation of children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities <b>and</b> clearly identifying the problems of inclusive education for children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities. The literature review focusing on the analyses for the precedent studies on related areas is employed for this study. The inclusive education for children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities has difficulties caused by problem behaviors of children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities, the lack of systematic education and administrative support and the insufficient expertise and knowledge of teachers for disabilities. To solve these difficulties, several tasks need to be accomplished; the school curriculum and reinforcement of individualized education customized for children with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities, the reinforcement of expertise of teachers in charge of inclusive classes and special classes, and the collaboration with other professionals including psychiatrists, physical therapists and nurses...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{multiple}} disabilities causes {{difficulties in the}} area of communication. Individuals with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> handicaps often have no verbal language as a result of serious physical impairments. This population may show little obvious response and it is therefore difficult to know if they are engaged and for the person him or herself to maintain engagement when involved in activities. The {{purpose of the study was}} to find out what happens in a normal music therapy session, during moments of perceived engagement. Four individuals experienced in the field of multiple disabilities were invited to take part in semi-structured interviews where they observed a half hour video of a therapist and a student with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> handicaps participating in music therapy. Data was analyzed in two steps, firstly through participants observing and explaining their reactions to video of music therapy and secondly by the researcher interviewing the participants and writing up a transcript of their commentaries about the video.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} peer tutoring on physical, instructional, and social interaction behaviors between elementary school age students with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities (SMD) <b>and</b> peers without disabilities. Addi-tional measures addressed the activity time of students with SMD. The {{study was conducted in}} inclusive general physical education settings under three instructional support conditions for students with SMD: (a) teacher-directed, (b) peer-mediated, and (c) voluntary peer support. During peer-mediated and voluntary peer support conditions, the instructional and physical interaction behaviors between students with SMD and their peers increased, while social interactions remained low. The activity engagement time data increased for all target students throughout intervention sessions. Interactions between students with SMD and teachers decreased toward the end of intervention. In the United States, there are about 6. 5 million students with disabilities served in general education schools (U. S. Department of Education, 2003). Specifically, students with <b>severe</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> disabilities (SMD) are included in general edu-cation settings with growing frequency (U. S. Department of Education). A major stimulus is to allow students with SMD opportunities for social and academic benefits afforded their peers without disabilities (Block, 2007; Causton-Theoharis & Malmgren, 2005; Cullinan, Sabornie, & Crossland, 1992; Johnson & Johnson, 1991). Because of unique and specific needs of these students, however, inclusion in general education settings can be extremely challenging for both special and general educators. Moreover, the challenge is perhaps heightened in physical education due to the active nature of the education environment and increased opportunities of peer interactions (Ellis, Wright, & Cronis, 1996). Therefore, the more critical proble...|$|R
