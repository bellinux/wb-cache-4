25|$|Attenborough {{points out}} that because of natural forces, the Earth's {{temperature}} has been fluctuating for millions of years, long before humans arrived. However, it is the additional carbon dioxide, leading {{to an increase in}} the greenhouse effect, which must also be taken into account. When fossil fuels are burnt, such as coal, fuel oil or natural gas, the carbon emissions combine with oxygen to further thicken the Earth's atmospheric 'blanket' and thus warm the planet. An analysis of ice cores can provide information from thousands of years ago. Comparisons of carbon dioxide levels show that those of today are far beyond anything <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The scientists interviewed are convinced that humans are responsible.|$|E
25|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} (and in {{particular}} the right hemisphere) is also involved {{in the formation of}} new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal recognition of an object they had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> but fail to recollect when or where it had been viewed. Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps organize information for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in executive function. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies semantic strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking about the meaning of the study material or rehearsing it in working memory.|$|E
25|$|Conifers are {{the largest}} and {{economically}} most important component group of the gymnosperms, but nevertheless they comprise {{only one of the}} four groups. The division Pinophyta consists of just one class, Pinopsida, which includes both living and fossil taxa. Subdivision of the living conifers into two or more orders has been proposed from time to time. The most commonly <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> was a split into two orders, Taxales (Taxaceae only) and Pinales (the rest), but recent research into DNA sequences suggests that this interpretation leaves the Pinales without Taxales as paraphyletic, and the latter order is no longer considered distinct. A more accurate subdivision would be to split the class into three orders, Pinales containing only Pinaceae, Araucariales containing Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae, and Cupressales containing the remaining families (including Taxaceae), but there has not been any significant support for such a split, with the majority of opinion preferring retention of all the families within a single order Pinales, despite their antiquity and diverse morphology.|$|E

50|$|Janus {{clinical}} trial data repository is a {{clinical trial}} data repository (or data warehouse) standard as sanctioned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was named for the Roman god Janus (mythology), who had two faces, one that could <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and one that could <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. The analogy is that the Janus data repository would enable the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry to both look retrospectively into past clinical trials, and also relative {{to one or more}} current clinical trials (or even future clinical trials thru better enablement of clinical trial design).|$|R
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the riots}} in England in August 2011, Miliband {{called for a}} public inquiry into the events, and insisted society had [...] "to avoid simplistic answers". The call for an inquiry was {{rejected}} by David Cameron, prompting Miliband to say he would set up his own. In a BBC Radio 4 interview shortly after the riots, Miliband spoke of an irresponsibility that applied {{not only to the}} people involved in the riots, but [...] "wherever we find it in our society. We've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few years...MPs' expenses, what happened in the banks". Miliband also said Labour did not do enough to tackle moral problems during its 13 years in office. In December 2011 Miliband appointed Tim Livesey, a former adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to be his full-time chief of staff.|$|E
500|$|Fightstar's third album, Be Human (2009), {{featured}} choral and orchestral elements. Emma Johnston of Kerrang! emphasised this in her review: [...] "Fightstar throw as many orchestral and choral flourishes {{at their}} muscular, solemnly heavy rock {{as it could}} take without drowning". Anton Djamoos of AbsolutePunk wrote that the album has a [...] "certain symphonic quality" [...] which is [...] "a departure from the general body of work we've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> They break from their own norm with several orchestral elements to make the album sound more full and let the music hit even harder". Matt Shoemaker of 411mania.com described the album as typical Fightstar (" [...] range from pure metal to alternative rock to bordering on emo at times"), influenced by progressive rock, acoustic and country pop {{in addition to its}} orchestral and choral elements.|$|E
500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> though we have had fights {{and most of the time}} I was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
40|$|Background There is a {{consensus}} that <b>the</b> large fluctuations <b>in</b> mortality <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Russia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two decades {{can be attributed to}} trends in alcohol consumption. However, the precise mechanisms linking alcohol to mortality from circulatory disease remain unclear. It has recently been argued that a substantial number of such deaths currently ascribed to cardiovascular disorders are misclassified cases of acute alcohol poisoning...|$|R

Historically close extended Palaiyar family groups foraged and hunted at least 128 forest species for subsistence. In the past century they increasingly depended on shifting cultivation and collection and trading of non timber forest products of over 60 species for: food (14), incense & toiletries (11) medicines (13), construction materials & precious woods (9) and miscellaneous (13) honey, tubers, fruits, herbs, flowers, bark, seeds, fibers, gum, leaves, logs and oils.|$|E
2500|$|Medical staff {{tried to}} take an x-ray of Alder's head injury {{but he would not}} remain still and they {{abandoned}} the effort. PC Dawson wrote in his note book at this time that Alder was [...] "heavily in drink" [...] and [...] "typical of people I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> on amphetamine." [...] Staff eventually decided that they could not administer further treatment to Alder without his cooperation, and the police officers asked if he was well enough to be detained in police custody. The attending doctor agreed that he was. A subsequent (2005) Healthcare Commission report into the medical treatment Alder received described this decision as [...] "flawed...he doctor had yet to make a diagnosis. He was unable to carry out his plan of treatment for Christopher Alder, for example to admit him for observation, x-ray his skull and refer him to a maxillo-facial surgeon. Despite this he decided to discharge him without seeking advice from a senior colleague." [...] This may also have contributed to the police officers' assumption that Alder's condition was not serious. Alder was forcibly removed from the hospital by PCs Dawson and Blakey, with medical staff stating that he was dragged out by his arms, backwards and with his legs trailing on the floor. The police officers, however, stated that Alder had walked out unaided although they had kept a gentle grip on him to prevent him falling and to [...] "guide" [...] him.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw {{gave the}} film four stars in September 2001, {{choosing}} {{it as the}} best film of the week. He praised Takeshi Kitano's performance as the teacher {{and some of the}} scenes as [...] "a stunningly proficient piece of action film-making, plunging us into a world of delirium and fear." [...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I suggest you try hard not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie." [...] In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two decades, stating that, [...] "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it’s that one." ...|$|E
