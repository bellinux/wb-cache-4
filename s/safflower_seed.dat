The experiment was designed with 350 commercial one-day-old male broiler chickens using completely randomized design with 5 dietary treatments and 5 replications. Prior to the study, a commercial starter diet was fed to broiler chickens for 3 weeks. On day 21 of age 14 birds were allocated to each experimental unit (1. 5 × 1. 5 m floor pen). Experimental diets for the five treatments were prepared to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous. Broiler chickens were provided with feed and water ad libitum. Data on weight gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency were recorded weekly basis. At the end of the experiment (42 days of age) one bird from each replication was selected randomly, blood sample was collected and the birds were slaughtered to determine carcass parameters. Inclusion of full fat <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> in experimental diets, did not significantly affect weight gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency.

The oleic acid content in the classic safflower oil is normally 10 - 15 % while a natural mutant (ol) accumulates elevated oleic acid up to 70 % in seed oil. As a part of our investigation into the molecular features of the high oleic (HO) trait in safflower we have profiled the microRNA (miRNA) populations in developing <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds</b> expressing the ol allele in comparison to the wild type high linoleic (HL) safflower using deep sequencing technology.

From these two small RNA populations we have found 55 known miRNAs and identified two candidate novel miRNA families to be likely unique to the developing <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Target genes with conserved as well as novel functions were predicted for the conserved miRNAs.

Especially {{the role of}} bacteria, archaea, fungi and protozoa in mediating the lipid effects is unclear. In the present in vitro study, archaea, fungi and protozoa were selectively inhibited by specific agents. This was fully or almost fully successful for fungi and protozoa as well as archaeal activity {{as determined by the}} methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit gene. Five different microbial treatments were generated: rumen fluid being intact (I), without archaea (-A), without fungi (-F), without protozoa (-P) and with bacteria only (-AFP). A forage-concentrate diet given alone or supplemented with crushed full-fat oilseeds of either safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) or poppy (Papaver somniferum) or camelina (Camelina sativa) at 70 g oil kg- 1 diet dry matter was incubated. This added up to 20 treatments with six incubation runs per treatment. All oilseeds suppressed methane emission compared to the non-supplemented control. Compared to the non-supplemented control, -F decreased organic matter (OM) degradation, and short-chain fatty acid concentration was greater with camelina and <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Methane suppression per OM digested in -F was greater with camelina seeds (- 12 vs. - 7 % with I, P = 0. 06), but smaller with poppy seeds (- 4 vs. - 8 % with I, P = 0. 03), and not affected with <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> With -P, camelina seeds decreased the acetate-to-propionate ratio and enhanced the methane suppression per gram dry matter (18 vs. 10 % with I, P = 0. 08). Hydrogen recovery was improved with -P in any oilseeds compared to non-supplemented control. No methane emission was detected with the -A and -AFP treatments. In conclusion, concerning methanogenesis, camelina seeds seem to exert effects only on archaea and bacteria. By contrast, with <b>safflower</b> and poppy <b>seeds</b> methane was obviously reduced mainly through the interaction with protozoa or archaea associated with protozoa.

The used {{biological}} material consists of <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds</b> in different germination stages (seeds – S I, seedlings- S II, plantlets – S III, plants without roots- SIV, roots – S V). The extracts were obtained using phosphate buffer pH 7. Plant extracts {{were subjected to}} the following analysis: spectrophotometrically determination of total protein content, phenolic and flavonoid content. With regard to the total protein content of the analyzed extracts, the highest values were and 9. 1 g/ 100 g FW, recorded in S III stage. Also, the total flavonoid content during the germination stages ranged between 0. 08 g and 0. 21 g rutin equivalent (RE) / 100 g FW. The highest value of phenols during seed germination was performed in the S III with 1. 08 g gallic acid equivalent (GAE). The obtained {{results show that the}} bioaccumulation of phenolics and protein content in <b>safflower</b> during <b>seed</b> germination is influenced by the germination stage, impunand investigatii viitoare asupra procesului de germinatie si a posibilitatii de valorificare in domenii conexe...|$|R

The applicability of ionic liquid-methanol cosolvent system to both extract bio-oil and simultaneously pretreat the carbohydrate fraction of jatropha and safflower biomass for enzymatic hydrolysis to fermentable sugars is presented. Although pretreatment with either the cosolvent or pure ionic liquid yielded comparable hydrolysis kinetics and fermentable sugar yields on <b>safflower</b> whole <b>seeds,</b> the addition of alcohol to the ionic liquid was necessary to optimally recover both bio-oil and fermentable sugars. The ionic liquid [C 2 mim][Ac] was far more effective than [C 2 mim][MeSO 4] with optimum processing conditions occurring at a cosolvent concentration of 70 – 30 wt % of [C 2 mim][Ac] to methanol and a processing temperature of 120 ∘C. Under these conditions, {{the majority of the}} bio-oil was extracted and 25. 4 wt % (safflower) and 14. 3 wt % (jatropha) of the whole seed biomass were recovered as fermentable sugars. The recovery of fermentable sugars from the carbohydrate fraction was as high as 74 % and 78 % for jatropha and <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds,</b> respectively, when using [C 2 mim][Ac] cosolvent. A preliminary theoretical analysis of two potential oil seed processing pathways using the cosolvent system suggested that the corecovery of bio-oil, fermentable sugars, and a protein rich meal can recover a majority of the energy contained in the original biomass—a result that improves upon the traditional approach of solely extracting bio-oil. 1...|$|R
