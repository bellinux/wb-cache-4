The field of anthropometrics (human measurement) has unanswered questions, but it's still true that human physical characteristics are fairly predictable and objectively measurable. Buildings scaled to human physical capabilities have steps, doorways, railings, work surfaces, <b>seating,</b> <b>shelves,</b> fixtures, walking distances, and other features that fit well to the average person.|$|R

50|$|The Daniel O'Connell House is a {{historic}} house located at 115 North Union Street in Vermont, Illinois. Daniel O'Connell, a local banker and lumber salesman, had the house built in 1928. The house, which was built by contractor Fred Rankin, has an American Foursquare plan with American Craftsman elements. The Foursquare plan, which had become popular at the time for its simplicity, {{is reflected in the}} house's square shape and massiveness. The brick piers at the entrance and the horizontal emphasis of the exterior design both reflect the Craftsman style; the style also inspired several interior elements, such as <b>seating</b> and <b>shelves,</b> which are built into the home.|$|R
2500|$|Moskvin {{was arrested}} on 2 November 2011 by police {{investigating}} a spate of grave desecrations in cemeteries in and around Nizhny Novgorod. Investigators from the Center for Combating Extremism discovered the twenty-six bodies (initially reported as twenty-nine) in Moskvin's flat and garage. [...] released by police shows the bodies <b>seated</b> on <b>shelves</b> and sofas in small rooms full of books, papers and general clutter. Although only twenty-six bodies were discovered in his home, Moskvin was suspected of desecrating as many as 150 graves after police found numerous grave accoutrements such as metal nameplates removed from headstones. Police also discovered instructions for making the [...] "dolls", maps of cemeteries in the region, {{and a collection of}} photographs and videos depicting open graves and disinterred bodies, though none of these photos or videos could conclusively be connected to bodies found in the apartment. According to the investigation, the bodies were removed from cemeteries in the Nizhny Novgorod region as well as cemeteries in Moscow and the surrounding region. Moskvin actively cooperated with investigators.|$|R

40|$|The Web’s {{central role}} in {{providing}} entertainment content {{is not a matter}} of “if,” it is “when, ” with many claiming “now, ” as the Internet emerges as the place where trends in content selection and delivery are coalescing. Music, movies and television shows are all available online with consumers exercising greater control in the methods and convenience with which they obtain and enjoy this content. The ubiquitous PC and spreading broadband connections have driven the online entertainment boom, but even this digital umbilical may be severed as people look for diversion in their hands where mere mobile phones formerly resided. Choice is a major factor in the growing popularity of online entertainment content. Wired magazine editor Chris Anderson asserts, “Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it in service after service, from DVDs at Netflix to music videos on Yahoo! Launch to songs in the iTunes Music Store and Rhapsody ” (2004, p. 1). Anderson builds a case that traditional media distribution systems—from movie theaters, to record stores, to television networks—only have so much space, measured in physical dimensions such as <b>seats</b> and <b>shelves,</b> or time...|$|R

5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear.

60|$|The air {{was very}} raw and chill; but after supper the clouds cleared away, and a {{pleasant}} evening tempted the travellers out. The portier dissembled any slight which their eagerness {{for the only}} amusement {{he could think of}} inspired, and directed them to a popular theatre which was giving a summer season at low prices to the lower classes, and which they surprised, after some search, trying to hide itself in a sort of back square. They got the best places at a price which ought to have been mortifyingly cheap, and found themselves, with a thousand other harmless bourgeois folk, in a sort of spacious, agreeable barn, of a decoration by no means ugly, and of a certain artless comfort. Each <b>seat</b> fronted a <b>shelf</b> {{at the back of the}} seat before it, where the spectator could put his hat; there was a smaller shelf for his stein of the beer passed constantly throughout the evening; and there was a buffet where he could stay himself with cold ham and other robust German refreshments.|$|R

60|$|The party went {{to half a}} dozen spreads, some {{of which}} were on a scale of public {{grandeur}} approaching that of the Gymnasium, and others of a subdued elegance befitting the more private hospitalities in the students' rooms. Mrs. Pasmer was very much interested in these rooms, whose luxurious appointments testified to the advance of riches and of the taste to apply them since she used to visit students' rooms in far-off Class Days. The deep window nooks and easy-chairs upholstered in the leather that seems sacred alike to the <b>seats</b> and the <b>shelves</b> of libraries; the aesthetic bookcases, low and topped with bric-a-brac; the etchings and prints on the walls, which the elder Mavering went up to look at with a mystifying air of understanding such things; the foils crossed over the chimney, and the mantel with its pipes, and its photographs of theatrical celebrities tilted about over it--spoke of conditions mostly foreign to Mrs. Pasmer's memories of Harvard. The photographed celebrities seemed to be chosen chiefly for their beauty, and for as much of their beauty as possible, Mrs. Pasmer perceived, with an obscure misgiving of the sort which an older generation always likes to feel concerning the younger, but with a tolerance, too, which was personal to herself; it was to be considered that the massive thought and honest amiability of Salvini's face, and the deep and spiritualized power of Booth's, varied the effect of these companies of posturing nymphs.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, BT, having {{acknowledged}} the negative {{reaction to the}} original KX models, made an attempt to win the public over and revisited the KX100 and built upon its design to improve its appeal and add some character. The new updated version was named the KX+, {{also known as the}} KXplus, the KXPlus, the KX100 Plus or the KX100+. It is essentially an updated and taller version of the KX100. It differs from the KX100 in that the 'waistband' in its door and sides is lower, and the colour used in the midsection trim panel and remodelled door handle also now matches the newly introduced trim panel at the top. In a nod to earlier Post Office kiosks and following the negative feedback on the KX100's design, it features a domed, plastic roof (modelled on those of the K2 and K6). This said, the dome also brought other benefits to BT. The enhanced model was now taller and more visible than the boxes of BT's competitors, and it also offered valuable extra space for future developments, such as public wi-fi hotspot equipment. The earliest KX+ kiosks carried signage on the door and side lintels and the domed roof. The interior of the booths are fitted with a large illuminated display panel. They also contained a small <b>seat</b> and a <b>shelf</b> for writing or placing property. They featured a lower handle on the door to help customers with disabilities and a new closing mechanism to make the door more robust.|$|R

60|$|Persons of the {{education}} of Mrs. Dutton and her daughter, had not dwelt so long on that beautiful head-land, without leaving on the spot some lasting impressions of their tastes. Of the cottage, we have already spoken. The little garden, too, then bright with flowers, had a grace and refinement about it that we would hardly have expected to meet in such a place; and even the paths that led athwart the verdant common which spread over {{so much of the}} upland, had been directed with an eye to the picturesque and agreeable. One of these paths, too, led to a rustic summer-house--a sort of small, rude pavilion, constructed, like the fences, of fragments of wrecks, and placed on a shelf of the cliff, at a dizzy elevation, but in perfect security. So far from there being any danger in entering this summer-house, indeed, Wycherly, during his six months' residence near the Head, had made a path that descended still lower to a point that was utterly concealed from all eyes above, and had actually planted a <b>seat</b> on another <b>shelf</b> with so much security, that both Mildred and her mother often visited it in company. During the young man's recent absence, the poor girl, indeed, had passed much of her time there, weeping and suffering in solitude. To this seat, Dutton never ventured; the descent, though well protected with ropes, requiring greater steadiness of foot and head than intemperance had left him. Once or twice, Wycherly had induced Mildred to pass an hour with him alone in this romantic place, and some of his sweetest recollections of this just-minded and intelligent girl, were connected with the frank communications that had there occurred between them. On this bench he was seated {{at the time of the}} opening of the present chapter. The movement on the Head, and about the cottage, was so great, as to deprive him of every chance of seeing Mildred alone, and he had hoped that, led by some secret sympathy, she, too, might seek this perfectly retired seat, to obtain a moment of unobserved solitude, if not from some still dearer motive. He had not waited long, ere he heard a heavy foot over his head, and a man entered the summer-house. He was yet debating whether to abandon all hopes of seeing Mildred, when his acute ear caught her light and well-known footstep, as she reached the summer-house, also.|$|R
