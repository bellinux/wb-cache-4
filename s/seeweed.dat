In 1995 they {{released}} the album Vodorosl (<b>Seeweed).</b> The song Tolko s Toboy (With You Only) {{was included in the}} Putumayo World Music compilation (featuring also Peter Gabriel, Gipsy Kings, Bob Marley, Johnny Clegg among others) which led to Farlanders’ traveling to the USA when they toured the East Coast, starting in Washington DC. The tour's high point was the band’s performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics' opening ceremony.|$|E
5000|$|To make hirayachi, {{one should}} mix wheat flour, an egg, salt, and soup stock lightly, while letting water in little by little. Next, put leeks cut around three centimeters, and stretch it out thinly in {{the frying pan}} in oil on medium fire. Finally, when holes appear on the surface, bake it light brown. Tuna, corned beef, Mozuku (a family of <b>seeweed),</b> Goya, and so on can be added. It is also made with very simple {{materials}} such as leeks and green onions at home. The surface is crisp and fragrant, and the texture is chewy. It is classic to eat hirayachi with the Worcestershire sauce in Okinawa. Because it is made easily by using one frying pan, Okinawan people often make it if they cannot go out, such as when a typhoon hits. The taste is not decorated, and not flashy, so many people of Okinawa feel the [...] "home of taste" [...] or [...] "mother of taste" [...] in Hirayachi.|$|E
40|$|The film {{thickness}} dependence of crystal growth is investigated for isotactic polystyrene (it-PS) in thin films, {{the thickness of}} which is from 20 nm down to 4 nm. The single crystals of it-PS grown at 180 in the ultrathin films show the morphology typical in the diffusion-controlled growth: dense branching morphology (DBM), fractal <b>seeweed</b> (FS). The characteristic length of the morphology, i. e. {{the width of the}} branch, increases with decreasing {{film thickness}}. The thickness dependence of the growth rate of crystals shows a crossover around the lamellar thickness of the crystal, 8 nm. The thickness dependences of the growth rate and morphology are discussed in terms of the diffusion of chain molecules in thin films. Comment: Latex 2 e files; 7 pages, 6 figures; submitted to J.

40|$|In New Zealand, {{the rate}} of {{registered}} cancer cases increased significantly in recent years especially for breast, melanoma, colorectal cancer and lung cancer (Ministry of Health, 2008 b). The success rate of cancer chemotherapy is generally low mainly due to cytotoxic side effects and multi-drug resistance of current anti-cancer drugs (Szakács, Paterson, Ludwig, Booth-Genthe, & Gottesman, 2006). Two major components of U. pinnatifida, fucoxanthin and fucoidan, have recently been found to induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines (Nishibori, Itoh, Kashiwagi, Arimochi, & Morita, 2012). The primary objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether fucoxanthin could inhibit proliferation of different types of cancer cells in a time- and concentration-dependant pattern. The secondary objective {{of this study was to}} determine other potential anti-cancer compounds from both New Zealand and Japanese U. pinnatifida. In addition, a novel extraction method has been developed by Japanese scientists to isolate fucoxanthin and fucoidan by supercritical carbon dioxide and subcritical water in a single process. The third purpose was to evaluate biological activities of these two major components isolated by using the novel extraction method. Based on the particular statistical reported several types of human cancer cell lines were used in this study including lung carcinoma A 549, NCI-H 522, colon adenocarcinoma WiDr, Lovo, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep G 2, breast adenocarcinoma MCF- 7, malignant melanoma Malme- 3 M, cervix squamous carcinoma SiHa, and neuroblastoma SK-N-SH. Anti-proliferative effects were determined by 24 hr- 72 hr MTT (3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays. Pure fucoxanthin showed anti-proliferative effects in all types of cancer cell lines in dose- and time- dependent manners. The ranking of anti-proliferative sensitivity to fucoxanthin is in the order of SiHa > MCF- 7, Lovo, NCI-H 522 > Hep G 2, A 549, WiDr, SK-N-SH, and Malme- 3 M. Similarly, anti-proliferative effects of fucoxanthin extracted from New Zealand <b>seeweeds</b> were found in all types of cancer cell lines in dose- and time- dependent manners. These three fucoxanthin extracts (purity of fucoxanthin: 0. 2 %, 43. 5 % and 60. 77 %) were achieved through a series of fucoxanthin isolation and purification procedures. Compared with anti-proliferative IC 50 of pure fucoxanthin standards, the significant anti-proliferative effects of fucoxanthin extracts were found in some cancer cell lines including WiDr, Lovo, and NCI-H 522. Similar results were also found from the determination of anti-proliferative effects fucoxanthin extracts by the novel extraction method. However, SiHa and Malme- 3 M were special cases, suggesting some of compounds might effectively inhibit growth of those cancer cells. In comparison to other published studies, similar anti-proliferative effects from Japanese fucoidan fraction were found in dose- and time dependence, but its anti-proliferative effects were much lower. In conclusion, fucoxanthin as a type of marine carotenoid possessed effectively anti-proliferative effects to multiple types of cancer cell lines. Thus, fucoxanthin can be the important phytochemical with chemopreventive effects. Furthermore, some of novel compounds with potential anti-cancer effects might be contained in New Zealand and Japanese U. pinnatifida. This suggested U. pinnatifida as part of a human diet could possibly decrease the risk of cancer especially for human cervix, colon and lung cancer. Finally, crude fucoxanthin was successfully isolated by supercritical carbon dioxide from novel extraction method. However, fucoidan fraction which possessed biological anti-cancer activity might not be obtained from extract using subcritical water...|$|R
30|$|The {{obtained}} Planctomycete sequences (13 % {{of classified}} sequences) could {{be divided into}} 9 groups (Additional file 1); Gemmata, Pirellula, Schlesneria and Zavarzinella were the most abundantly found groups. Gemmata and Pirellula are aerobic chemo-heterotrophs, Schlesneria are chemo-organotrophic facultative aerobes and Zavarzinella are aerobic heterotrophs. The presence of Planctomycetes has been shown before in gut microbiota of fish and other organisms (Ley et al. 2008; Rawls et al. 2006). The exact function of these bacteria in the GI tract is not clear, possibly these bacteria live from products of the metabolism of other bacteria. However, the relatively high abundance of Planctomycetes in close association with other organisms such as kelp, marine sponges and prawn (Bengtsson and Ovreas 2010; Pimental-Elardo 2003; Fuerst et al. 1997; Lahav et al. 2009) suggests a more important role. Possibly, these bacteria {{are involved in the}} metabolism of complex compounds. In a recent study, in which the close association of Planctomycetes with the brown <b>seeweed</b> kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) was investigated, it was hypothesized that these bacteria are degraders of sulfated polysacharides produced by kelp (Bengtsson and Ovreas 2010). The organisms found in the biofilm at the plant's surface were mainly members of the lineage Pirellulae (which includes Pirellula, Rhodopirellula and Blastopirellula). The genome sequence of Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1 revealed many genes involved in the breakdown of sulfated polysaccharides (Glockner et al. 2003). Possibly, the heterotrophic Planctomycetes found in carp gut confer a similar ability of polysaccharide breakdown to the host. Furthermore, a separate lineage within the Planctomycetes, the anammox bacteria, were present in the carp gut (Figure 1). These anaerobic bacteria, described before in fish gut (Lahav et al. 2009), are involved in nitrogen cycling. Together with the Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira species (also present within the obtained sequences, Figure 1), ammonium can be converted into dinitrogen gas. The removal of nitrogenous compounds from aquaculture systems {{is one of the most}} important challenges in aquaculture. The presence of nitrogen cycling bacteria in fishes could offer new in situ solutions for the removal of nitrogen from aquaculture systems.|$|E
