5|$|A last {{group of}} <b>sheep</b> breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair <b>sheep,</b> which do not grow wool at all. Hair <b>sheep</b> {{are similar to the}} early domesticated <b>sheep</b> kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair <b>sheep,</b> such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair <b>sheep</b> are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair <b>sheep</b> are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{are crucial}} {{players in the}} {{contemporary}} <b>sheep</b> industry, and <b>sheep</b> are an iconic part of both countries' culture and economy. New Zealand has the highest density of <b>sheep</b> per capita (<b>sheep</b> outnumber the human population 12 to 1), and Australia is the world's indisputably largest exporter of <b>sheep</b> and cattle. In 2007, New Zealand even declared 15 February their official National Lamb Day to celebrate the country's history of <b>sheep</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Being a key {{animal in}} the history of farming, <b>sheep</b> have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, <b>sheep</b> are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. <b>Sheep</b> figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, <b>sheep</b> are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E

5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep <b>sheep</b> together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. <b>Sheep</b> are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in <b>sheep</b> soliciting people for food. Those who are moving <b>sheep</b> may exploit this behavior by leading <b>sheep</b> with buckets of feed.|$|E
5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in <b>sheep</b> {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer <b>sheep</b> may not react as expected when alone or with few other <b>sheep.</b> Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of <b>sheep</b> is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered <b>sheep</b> may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E
5|$|Hog Island <b>sheep</b> are a {{breed of}} <b>sheep</b> descended from animals first brought to Virginia's Hog Island in the 18th century.

5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to <b>sheep</b> and the profitability of <b>sheep</b> raising. <b>Sheep</b> have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if <b>sheep</b> survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of <b>sheep</b> deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of <b>sheep</b> predators, particularly islands known for extensive <b>sheep</b> husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most <b>sheep</b> deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on <b>sheep</b> include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sheep</b> can {{recognize}} individual human and ovine faces, and remember them for years. In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, <b>sheep</b> can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. If worked with patiently, <b>sheep</b> may learn {{their names and}} many <b>sheep</b> are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. <b>Sheep</b> have also responded well to clicker training. <b>Sheep</b> {{have been used as}} pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.|$|E
5|$|The First Fleet {{brought the}} initial {{population}} of 70 <b>sheep</b> from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia in 1788. The next shipment was of 30 <b>sheep</b> from Calcutta and Ireland in 1793. All {{of the early}} <b>sheep</b> brought to Australia were exclusively used for the dietary needs of the penal colonies. The beginnings of the Australian wool industry were due {{to the efforts of}} Captain John Macarthur. At Macarthur's urging 16 Spanish merinos were imported in 1797, effectively beginning the Australian <b>sheep</b> industry. By 1801 Macarthur had 1,000 head of <b>sheep,</b> and in 1803 he exported 111 kilograms (245lb) of wool to England. Today, Macarthur is generally thought of as the father of the Australian <b>sheep</b> industry.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{government}} encouraged {{farmers to}} raise <b>sheep</b> throughout the 19th-century. Sheep-rearing programs began to import Yorkshire, Berkshire, Spanish merino, and numerous Chinese and Mongolian <b>sheep</b> breeds, encouraged by government promotion of <b>sheep</b> farming. However, {{a lack of}} knowledge on the farmer's part of how to successfully keep <b>sheep,</b> and the government's failure to provide information to those importing the <b>sheep</b> they promoted, led to the project's failure, and in 1888 it was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the domesticated <b>sheep</b> goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC, and the {{domestication}} of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia. <b>Sheep</b> are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, and {{there is evidence of}} <b>sheep</b> farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period. These <b>sheep</b> were primarily raised for meat, milk, and skins. Woolly <b>sheep</b> began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran, and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep's wool for trading. They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{class of}} <b>sheep</b> are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool <b>sheep</b> {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These <b>sheep</b> produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy <b>sheep</b> vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect <b>sheep.</b> Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young <b>sheep.</b> Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting <b>sheep</b> and goats.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald <b>sheep</b> {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis (Genesis 30:3143), Jacob took every speckled and spotted <b>sheep</b> from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock and bred them. Due to the resemblance to the animal described in Genesis, the Jacob <b>sheep</b> was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} <b>sheep</b> reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A flock of <b>sheep</b> is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most <b>sheep</b> have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these <b>sheep</b> were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the <b>sheep</b> of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining <b>sheep</b> on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' <b>sheep,</b> {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified <b>sheep</b> that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s half a dozen of them were exported to form the basis of a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino <b>sheep,</b> and the breed continues to dominate the world <b>sheep</b> industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of <b>sheep,</b> with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool <b>sheep</b> are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other <b>sheep</b> types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
