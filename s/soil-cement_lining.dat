40|$|A {{memorandum}} of Agreement {{has been written}} between the Soil Conservation Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, relative to the experimental installation of test section of soil-cement and asphaltic canal lining to determine their durability and permeability. These test sections are to be installed at the Experimental Station, Logan, Utah. The Bureau of Reclamation requests two types of soil for the soil-cement studies, a fine sandy soil, poorly graded {{with little or no}} silt (Classification Symbol SP) and a find sandy soil with excess silt (Classification Symbol SF-Silty). The gradation limits for these two soil types are shown of Figures 1 and 2. Three soil samples were transmitted by letter of November 12, 1947, from DR. C. W. Lauritzen. Gradation tests on these soils revealed that two of the samples were too fine to provide suitable <b>soil-cement</b> <b>lining</b> but that the Trenton find sandy loam would satisfy the 2 ̆ 2 SF-Silty 2 ̆ 2 requirement. The soil-cement tests have been completed on this material and additional soil of the 2 ̆ 2 SP 2 ̆ 2 type has been reported by letter from R. F. Blanks to the Soil Conservation Service, Dated January, 16, 1948. Summary The laboratory tests indicate that the Trenton fine sandy loam, Laboratory Soil NO. 11 H- 24, can be mixed with portland cement to produce a canal lining of satisfactory hardness, durability, and permeability. A standard soil-cement mixture containing a minimum of 12 percent cement by volume) 3. 24 sacks of cement per cubic yard) compacted to maximum density at optimum moisture content should produce a suitable canal lining...|$|E
40|$|Earth Materials Laboratory Report No. EM- 170 {{covers the}} {{laboratory}} tests made on {{one type of}} soil from Logan, Utah, {{for the purpose of}} using the soil in <b>soil-cement</b> canal <b>lining</b> experiments. The intention was that two types of soil would be used for experimental linings at Logan, Utah; a fine sandy soil, poorly graded with little or no silt (Classification Symbol SP) and a fine sandy soil with excess silt (Classification Symbol SF-silty). These field test sections which will provide durability and permeability information gathered under natural conditions were carried out as part of a joint lower-cost canal lining experiment by the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, the Soil Conservation Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation. When Report EM- 170 was written (April 19, 1948) only materials of the 2 ̆ 2 SF-silty 2 ̆ 2 type were available for testing. This material was identified as Laboratory Sample No. 11 H- 24. A second shipment of samples on June 11, 1948, included a material of the SP type (Laboratory Sample No. 11 H-X 65) and laboratory tests were begun on this material...|$|R
