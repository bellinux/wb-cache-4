5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma <b>suffix</b> may {{be related}} to a coverbial <b>suffix</b> in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb <b>suffix</b> bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma <b>suffix</b> and the continuous aspect <b>suffix</b> -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E
5|$|English has {{two primary}} tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected {{by using the}} preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs {{includes}} the <b>suffix</b> -ed, and for the strong verbs either the <b>suffix</b> -t or {{a change in the}} stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the <b>suffix</b> -s.|$|E
5|$|The <b>suffix</b> is {{sometimes}} missing, {{which has been}} interpreted as a zero <b>suffix.</b> Words with zero <b>suffix</b> are termed root verbs and root nouns.

50|$|It {{is useful}} to {{classify}} Ogea verbal <b>suffixes</b> into two major categories: endocentric and exocentric, {{following the lead of}} Staalesen and Wells. Endocentric <b>suffixes</b> occur between the verb root and the exocenter. Endocentric <b>suffixes</b> include manner, object, and benefactive <b>suffixes,</b> among others. The same set of endocentric <b>suffixes</b> are used with varying sets of exocentric <b>suffixes.</b> The endocenter is composed of the verb root plus the endocentric <b>suffixes.</b> Exocentric <b>suffixes</b> encode inter-clausal temporality, tense, mood, subject, and switch reference. They are termed exocentric because they may contain <b>suffixes</b> that relate to the clause that follows. That is, the inter-clausal temporality and switch reference relate the current clause to the one that follows it.|$|R
