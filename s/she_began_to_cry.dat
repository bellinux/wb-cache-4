[...] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another séance was held. [...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep. [...] The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was a deception.
