2500|$|... "It is {{a widely}} held opinion that {{dyslexia}} is associated with remarkably artistic creativity." [...] This leads to {{us to look at}} art schools to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> high numbers of people who have dyslexia. The answer is yes, there is an unusually high correlation between people with dyslexia and art students. The question should be why? [...] There are speculations that dyslexics have differing brain structures and functions. There tends to be a lack of objective studies that confirm the art and dyslexia relationship. The Wolff and Lundberg article implies that it isn't that easy to get into art school; that people with dyslexia earn their entrance into the art schools on artistic merit, as an easy way out of conventional academics. Corlu, Ã–zcan, and Korkmazlar suggest that further research is a valid research concern. There are studies that seemingly coincide with the concept that people with dyslexia see the world differently. There seems to be evidence that dyslexics have a superior level of visuospatial skill. Gross and Bornstein think that dyslexia might be due to a difficulty in treating mirror images as the same stimulus, when taking into consideration words that are commonly switched, such as god and dog, no and on, and saw and was.|$|E
