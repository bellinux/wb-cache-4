Furthermore, it was investigated whether cyclic loading affects the static envelope curve. A qualitative model is presented which illustrates the effect of prepeak cyclic loading on deformation and stress distribution in a specimen. The results show that nonlinear fracture mechanics can be applied to concrete. The loadbearing capacity of a cracked plate can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.

The {{effect of}} soaking time and {{temperature}} of {{post weld heat treatment}} on the micro-properties of the welded joints of ASTM 4130 steel was investigated by using micro-shear test. The results show that micro-shear test can be adopted to evaluate the mechanical properties of uneven materials such as the welded joint. The micro-strength of the weld, fusion line and base metal is not obviously affected by the soaking time. The width and strength loss of the <b>softened</b> <b>zone</b> slightly decrease with increasing soaking time. The micro-shear strength of the weld firstly decreases and then significantly increases with increasing PWHT temperature. But the BM shows the opposite trend. The width and strength loss of the <b>softened</b> <b>zone</b> are not obviously affected by PWHT temperature.

Mechanical properties of the base metal and welded blanks were assessed by uniaxial tensile and biaxial LDH tests, and related to measured microhardness distributions across the welds. The formability ratio of laser welded dual phase sheet steels generally decreases with increased base metal strength.

40|$|When the {{distributed}} rock stress {{around the}} roadways exceeds {{the strength of}} the rock, the rock is failed and a <b>softening</b> <b>zone</b> is formed. Roof deformation developed in the roof and ribs of the roadways are highly controlled by the depth of softening zones. The rock failure process starts from a point ahead of the face and grows into the roof, floor and ribs by advancing roadway. The maximum stress that can be transferred through the failed rocks would be equal to its residual confined strength. Therefore, rock stress is moved above failed zone and will create new failure zone if it is higher than the confined strength of rock at that depth. This process continues until the confined strength of the rock becomes higher than stress components. Bedding and lamination planes play a big role into the failure pathway of rocks around roadways. The thickness of <b>softening</b> <b>zone</b> is significantly influenced by the shear and tensile strength of bedding planes and laminations.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{for the analysis}} of crack propagation in brittle materials is proposed, which is based on a combination of fracture mechanics and continuum damage mechanics {{within the context of the}} finite element method. The approach combines the accuracy of singular crack-tip elements from fracture mechanics theories with the flexibility of crack representation by <b>softening</b> <b>zones</b> in damage mechanics formulations. A super element is constructed in which the typical elements ape joined together. The crack propagation is decided on either of two fracture criteria; one criterion is based on the energy release rate or the J-integral, the other on the largest principal stress in the crack-tip region. Contrary to many damage mechanics methods, the combined fracture/damage approach is not sensitive to variations in the finite element division. Applications to situations of mixed-mode crack propagation in both two- and three-dimensional problems reveal that the calculated crack paths are independent of the element size and the element orientation and are accurate within one element from the theoretical (curvilinear) crack paths, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For both strength and corrosion, {{the transition from the}} thermo-mechanically affected to the heat affected zone (TMAZ/HAZ) {{turned out to be the}} most critical site.

SEM examinations of the top surface of FSW 2024 -T 3 joints revealed the presence of constitutionally melted Al 2 MgCu (S-phase) particles in that region. The S-phases were mainly localized to the advancing side of the joint, and their volume fraction increased with growing welding speed.

40|$|Abstract: The typical {{cause of}} {{flexural}} failure of prestressed beams is compression crushing of concrete, {{which is a}} progressive softening damage. Therefore, according to the amply validated theory of deterministic (or energetic) size effect in quasi-brittle materials, a size effect must be expected. A commercial finite-element code, A TEN A, with embedded constitutive equations for softening damage and a localization limiter {{in the form of}} the crack band model, is calibrated by the existing data on the load-deflection curves and failure modes of prestressed beams of one size. Then this code is applied to beams scaled up and down by factors of 4 and I / 2. It is found that the size effect indeed takes place. Within the size range of beam depths of approximately 152 -I, 220 mm, the size effect represents a nominal strength reduction of about 30 % to 35 %. In the interest of design economy and efficiency, a size effect correction factor could be introduced easily into the current code design equation. However, this is not really necessary for safety since the safety margin required by the code is exceeded for the normal practical size range if the hidden safety margins are taken into account. The mildness of the size effect in the normal size range is explained by the fact that the compression <b>softening</b> <b>zone</b> occupies a large portion of the beam and that, at peak load, the normal stress profiles across the <b>softening</b> <b>zone</b> exhibit only a minor stress reduction below the strength limit. Fitting the type 2 size effect Jaw to the data can provide a simple extrapolation to much deeper beams, for which a stronger size effect is expected. But the extrapolation has some degree of uncertainty because of higher scatter of the test data used for calibrations. DOl: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) ST. 1943 - 541 X. 0000983. © 2014 American Societ...|$|E

40|$|Closed-form {{solutions}} for the plastic response of a symmetric double-lap joint are presented. The adherents are assumed to behave linear elastically in pure tension, whereas the adhesive {{is assumed to be}} in a state of pure shear. The shear stress-strain behavior of the adhesive is approximated by a bilinear curve, and both hardening plasticity approximating ductile adhesive behavior, and softening plasticity approximating brittle adhesive behavior, are considered. The main emphasis is given to the softening behavior, as it includes some particularly intriguing features of joint behavior, e. g., limited ductility, limited bearing capacity, and the occurrence of local failure in the adhesive. For softening plasticity, two fundamentally different behaviors are identified depending on the joint parameters: one in which no local failure will occur before the bearing capacity of the joint has been completely exhausted, and another where local failure will begin at the boundary of the joint and spread until the <b>softening</b> <b>zone</b> has reached the center of the joint.

40|$|The advance-and-relieve method {{benefits}} from lateral destressing associated with mining in laminated rocks {{and a high}} horizontal stress regime. This stress control method is based on measurements showing that occurrence of rock failure in the roof and floor of an entry (or caving of roof strata in a panel gob) results in redistribution of stresses in adjacent entries. By locating other entries within the shadow zone of the first entry (or gob), improvements in stability can be achieved. Numerical modeling proved useful in studying the basic mechanics of lateral relief while investigating the sensitivity of results to different geologic and mining parameters using controlled experiments. It was shown that failure of rocks near an entry results in redistribution of horizontal stress and shifting of the stress to higher horizons. Measurements from two mines are consistent in showing significant horizontal stress reductions {{in comparison with the}} far-field stress regime within the destressed zone. Although the far-field stress regime is very anisotropic, these measurements show near-equal secondary principal horizontal stresses, or perhaps a switch in orientation, as a result of destressing. Stress relief is achieved through lateral movement and relaxation of rocks along weak bedding planes toward adjacent caved <b>zones</b> (or <b>softened</b> <b>zone).</b> Because of cave geometry in the advancing panel, horizontal stress concentrations occur near the cave line both in front of the face and to the sides. The horizontal stress concentration reaches 1. 7 times the far-field stress ahead of the face. This stress increase is significant and may cause structural damage in this zone benefiting from additional support. In the next advancing panel located within the shadow zone of the gob, horizontal stresses are significantly reduced in the roof (by 50 %). Thus, the stability of future advancing panel can be improved through prudent layout designs and sequencing.

40|$|The {{fusion zone}} of laser beam welded steels {{is very small}} due to the low heat input. Typical cooling rates amount between 1 s and 10 s. Thus, {{shrinkage}} and deformation are quite low. On the other hand, high carbon steels with a content of about (C) = 0. 18 % tend to form a hardened fusion zone. The maximum hardness can be reduced {{by means of an}} appropriate choice of the welding parameters or a suitable modification of the chemical composition of steel. It has been shown that the reduction of carbon from 0. 18 % to 0. 10 % for steels of the same strength level (two different kinds of StE 355 steels) causes a lower hardness combined with enhanced impact energy values. The increasing application of modern steels with a lower carbon content but with solid solution hardening elements or micro-alloying elements promotes the use of the laser welding technique. Thermomechanically treated steels are more and more applied in e. g. steels structures and in the shipbuilding industry. Their carbon content is about 0. 10 % or less and the tolerance in their properties is very limited compared to normalized steels.

40|$|AbstractFriction stir welding {{is solid}} state welding and {{involves}} heating the metal with a suitable {{amount of pressure}} so that homogeneous and complete microstructural welding is possible without melting of the parts to be joined. The process uses a rotating tool with a profiled pin that penetrates the parts to be joined; the tool then starts to travel along the join line. By keeping the tool rotating and moving it along the join line to be welded, the softened material due to the frictional heat is stirred and mixed together by the rotating pin forming a weld in solid state without melting. Frictional heat generated by rotation of the tool due to the high compressive pressure and shearing action of the shoulder along the joint line causes a <b>softened</b> <b>zone</b> of material without melting. Localized severe deformation around the tool results in refinement of the microstructure and the material flow produces coalescence and formation of a weld.

Moreover, the fracture toughness of materials for determining the final displacement of complete decohesion is kept constant.

40|$|Mode I {{fracture}} {{experiments were}} conducted on brittle bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples and the fracture surface features were analyzed in detail to understand the underlying physical processes. Wollner lines, which result from {{the interaction between the}} propagating crack front and shear waves emanating from a secondary source, were observed on the fracture surface and geometric analysis of them indicates that the maximum crack velocity is similar to 800 m s(- 1), which corresponds to similar to 0. 32 times the shear wave speed. Fractography reveals that the sharp crack nucleation at the notch tip occurs at the mid-section of the specimens with the observation of flat and half-penny-shaped cracks. On this basis, we conclude that the crack initiation in brittle BMGs is stress-controlled and occurs through hydrostatic stress-assisted cavity nucleation ahead of the notch tip. High magnification scanning electron and atomic force microscopies of the dynamic crack growth regions reveal highly organized, nanoscale periodic patterns with a spacing of similar to 79 nm. Juxtaposition of the crack velocity with this spacing suggests that the crack takes similar to 10 (- 10) s for peak-to-peak propagation. This, and the estimated adiabatic temperature rise ahead of the propagating crack tip that suggests local softening, is utilized to critically discuss possible causes for the nanocorrugation formation. Taylor's fluid meniscus instability is unequivocally ruled out. Then, two other possible mechanisms, viz. (a) crack tip blunting and resharpening through nanovoid nucleation and growth ahead of the crack tip and eventual coalescence, and (b) dynamic oscillation of the crack in a thin slab of <b>softened</b> <b>zone</b> ahead of the crack-tip, are critically discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{calibrate}} the material properties including strength and strain values for different material zones of ultra-high strength steel (UHSS) welded joints under monotonic static loading. The UHSS is heat sensitive and softens by heat due to welding, the affected zone is heat affected zone (HAZ). In this regard, cylindrical specimens were cut out from welded joints of Strenx® 960 MC and Strenx® Tube 960 MH, were examined by tensile test. The hardness values of specimens’ cross section were measured. Using correlations between hardness and strength, initial material properties were obtained. The same size specimen with different zones of material same as real specimen were created and defined in finite element method (FEM) software with commercial brand Abaqus 6. 14 - 1. The loading and boundary conditions were defined considering tensile test values. Using initial material properties made of hardness-strength correlations (true stress-strain values) as Abaqus main input, FEM is utilized to simulate the tensile test process. By comparing FEM Abaqus results with measured results of tensile test, initial material properties will be revised and reused as software input to be fully calibrated {{in such a way}} that FEM results and tensile test results deviate minimum. Two type of different S 960 were used including 960 MC plates, and structural hollow section 960 MH X-joint. The joint is welded by BöhlerTM X 96 filler material. In welded joints, typically the following zones appear: Weld (WEL), Heat affected zone (HAZ) coarse grained (HCG) and fine grained (HFG), annealed zone, and base material (BaM). Results showed that: The HAZ <b>zone</b> is <b>softened</b> due to heat input while welding. For all the specimens, the <b>softened</b> <b>zone’s</b> strength is decreased and makes it a weakest zone where fracture happens while loading. Stress concentration of a notched specimen can represent the properties of notched zone. The load-displacement diagram from FEM modeling matches with the experiments by the calibrated material properties by compromising two correlations of hardness and strength...|$|R
