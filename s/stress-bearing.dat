5000|$|A {{possible}} {{method of}} limiting a product's durability {{is to use}} inferior materials in critical areas, or suboptimal component layouts which cause excessive wear.

For example, small, brittle plastic gears in toys are extremely prone to damage if the toy is played with roughly, which can easily destroy key functions of the toy and force the purchase of a replacement. The short life expectancy of smartphones and other handheld electronics is a result of constant usage, fragile batteries, and the ability to easily damage them.|$|E

50|$|The D-28 was a wood-framed {{aircraft}} with a high, cantilever, single-spar wing, Akaflieg's established layout.

The structure also followed Akaflieg's previous use of wooden frames and <b>stress-bearing</b> plywood skin on the fuselage and leading edges of flying surfaces, with fabric covering elsewhere, but with greater attention to precision, the removal of unneeded material and metering of adhesives. The wing leading edge ply was only 1 mm (0.039 in) thick, and the fuselage was constructed without longerons. Instead of the standard aircraft linen, for lightness the Windspiel was covered in silk.

5000|$|The unusual {{appearance}} of the Parnall Imp was entirely due to its wings, for it was otherwise a conventional two-seat, single-engined biplane of its time. Harold Bolas stated that he designed them to be simple and to allow the best possible view from {{either of the two}} cockpits. The simplicity came from the complete absence of the rigging wires that braced conventional biplanes and needed constant attention. Instead, the Imp had a cantilever lower wing which had not only to support itself but also most of the forces on the upper wing. These lower wings were unswept and rectangular, with an aspect ratio of about 4.9, though the ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edge and about 40% of the chord. Since as cantilevers they had to be internally braced, the airfoil section was fairly thick, a variation on RAF31. Rather than the usual (in Britain) double-spar and rib construction, Bolas used multiple spanwise stringers or false spars, with longitudinal formers or airfoil shaped ribs, the whole covered in <b>stress-bearing</b> spruce veneer. [...] This stressed skin chiefly carried the bending loads. The Imp was a single-bay biplane, with a single, strongly outward-leaning wide chord streamlined strut on each side, connecting the centre of the lower wing to the upper one. [...] Though the upper wing was not a cantilever, it was constructed {{in the same way as}} the lower and joined to the fuselage from below at mid wing with a pair of N-shaped cabane struts. This upper wing was also straight and parallel-edged, with the same chord as the lower one, but greater in span and strongly swept at about 14.5o. [...] As a result, the leading edge at the centre was above the engine bulkhead, and the trailing edge at the tips beyond and aft of those of the lower plane. With the assistance of a large cutout in the trailing edge, this arrangement provided a clear upward view from both cockpits.The wings did not fold, but two people could dismantle both sets in about two minutes, first unclipping the bottom of the interplane strut, folding it and unhooking the centre section from the cabane for each upper wing in turn. The absence of ailerons on the upper plane simplified this procedure. The lower wings could then be detached with the release of catches and the removal of pins.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} and linear viscoelasticity of interacting polymer nanocomposites based on mixtures of poly(ethylene oxide) and fumed silica particles.

Extending a two-phase model used to describe weakly interacting systems, we show that above Φc the melt-state elasticity of the composites arises from the independent contributions of a polymer–particle network and a viscous matrix. We also find that, although Φc depends on the initial state of dispersion, the network elasticity scales with volume fraction following a universal power-law, with an exponent ν ≈ 1. 8. Such a scaling law has been recently predicted for the <b>stress-bearing</b> mechanism governed by polymer-mediated interactions...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Contemporary resin {{composites}} used {{in large}} restorations still demonstrate limitations {{due to their}} limited mechanical properties. Resin composite reinforced with short randomly oriented glass fibres exhibit improved mechanical properties regarding flexural strength, fracture toughness and polymerisation shrinkage in comparison to particulate filler composite (PFC). Therefore short fibre-reinforced composite (SFRC) can be beneficial in <b>stress-bearing</b> applications. The aim of this case series is to assess the usefulness of SFRC within different restorative indications. Materials and Methods: Four patients presenting different restorative problems were selected. Direct composite restorations were used in each situation: a cusp-replacement, a post-and-core, an endocrown and a fibre-reinforced composite resin-bonded fixed dental prosthesis. For all indications biomimetic principles were applied i. e. dentin was replaced by SFRC that was entirely embedded with enamel-replacing PFC. Results: Handling and aesthetic characteristics of SFRC proved to be appropriate for application in biomimetic restorations. SFRC easily adapted to the dentine by additional use of {{a small amount of}} low viscosity PFC and did not interfere with the aesthetic outcome of the restorations. The obtained clinical results were highly assessed by each patient. No restoration failed after six months of function. Conclusion: It seems reasonable to use SFRC in a biomimetic treatment approach for <b>stress-bearing</b> applications. The benefits of SFRC-based biomimetic direct composite restorations needs to be investigated in a properly designed long-term random clinical trial. Clinical Relevance: The use of SFRC as dentin replacement within a biomimetic treatment approach provides a rationale for extended use of direct resin composite restorations in <b>stress-bearing</b> applications...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Despite {{the good}} sealing ability and {{biocompatibility}} of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), its slow setting, high degradation, and weakness limit {{its use in}} surgical endodontics and high <b>stress-bearing</b> areas. This study aimed to develop two new liquids to control these drawbacks. They were prepared from calcium chloride, fumed silica, and hydroxyapatite or calcium phosphate and coded “H” and “P,” respectively. Methods. Portland cement, Grey ProRoot® MTA, and white ProRoot MTA were mixed with distilled water (control) or liquid “H” or “P. ” The pH, setting time, degradation rate, leachant/precipitate’ composition, compressive strength, and morphology were assessed. Results. Both liquids maintained MTA’s high alkalinity and reduced the setting time by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. Both liquids, H in particular, significantly reduced the degradation rate of Grey ProRoot and White ProRoot MTA®. Calcite {{has been identified as}} the main phase of the leachant or precipitate formed during the cement’s degradation. Calcium hydroxide or hydroxyapatite was also identified with Grey ProRoot MTA mixed with H liquid. These liquids also significantly increased the compressive strength with no statistical differences between them; this was associated with the production of dense, consolidated structures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose: To {{compile a}} survey of the {{longevity}} and reasons for failure of stainless steel crowns, amalgam, glass-ionomer, composite and compomer restorations in <b>stress-bearing</b> cavities of primary molars. Methods: This work reviewed the dental literature of 1971 up to July 2003 for longitudinal, controlled clinical studies and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Only studies investigating the clinical performance of restorations in primary teeth with an observation period of at least 2 years were included. Annual failure rates of stainless steel crowns, amalgam, glass-ionomer, composite and compomer restorations were determined and failure reasons were discussed. Results: Annual failure rates in <b>stress-bearing</b> cavities of primary molars were determined to be: 0 - 14 % for stainless steel crowns, 0 - 35. 3 % for amalgam restorations, 0 - 25. 8 % for glass-ionomer restorations, 2 - 29. 1 % for atraumatic restorative treatments, 0 - 15 % for composite restorations, and 0 - 11 for compomer restorations. Main reasons for failure were secondary caries, marginal deficiencies, fracture, and wear. (Am J Dent 2005; 18 : 198 - 211).

40|$|Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram-negative deltaproteobacterium {{that has}} evolved {{the ability to}} {{differentiate}} into metabolically quiescent spores that are resistant to heat and desiccation.

In this study, we characterize the spore coat composition and describe the machinery necessary for secretion of spore coat material and its subsequent assembly into a <b>stress-bearing</b> matrix. Chemical analyses of isolated spore coat material indicate that the spore coat consists primarily of short 1 – 4 - and 1 – 3 -linked GalNAc polymers that lack significant glycosidic branching and may be connected by glycine peptides. We show that 1 – 4 -linked glucose (Glc) is likely a minor component of the spore coat with the majority of the Glc arising from contamination with extracellular polysaccharides, O-antigen, or storage compounds. Neither of these structures is required for the formation of resistant spores. Our analyses indicate the GalNAc/Glc polymer and glycine are exported by the ExoA-I system, a Wzy-like polysaccharide synthesis and export machinery. Arrangement of the capsular-like polysaccharides into a rigid spore coat requires the NfsA–H proteins, members of which reside in either the cytoplasmic membrane (NfsD, -E, and -G) or outer membrane (NfsA, -B, and -C).

Methods: Two-hundred anaesthesiology students were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the factors they considered important while opting for anaesthesiology, also enumerated in order of importance the three most important factors that led to opting this career. Students also answered the questions in Antonovsky′s sense of coherence (SOC) scale. Results: Economic security was considered by maximum number of students (67. 7 %), while intellectual stimulation/challenge offered by anaesthesiology was rated first in order of importance. Influence of doctor−patient relationship was not considered by large number of students. The weak SOC score (55) (25 th percentile) was not greatly different than the mean SOC score (60) in the survey.

40|$|To {{withstand}} the high intracellular pressure, the cell wall of most bacteria is stabilized by a unique cross-linked biopolymer called murein or peptidoglycan. It {{is made of}} glycan strands [poly-(GlcNAc-MurNAc) ], which are linked by short peptides to form a covalently closed net. Completely surrounding the cell, the murein represents a kind of bacterial exoskeleton known as the murein sacculus. Not only does the sacculus endow bacteria with mechanical stability, but in addition it maintains the specific shape of the cell. Enlargement and division of the murein sacculus {{is a prerequisite for}} growth of the bacterium. Two groups of enzymes, hydrolases and synthases, have to cooperate to allow the insertion of new subunits into the murein net. The action of these enzymes must be well coordinated to guarantee growth of the <b>stress-bearing</b> sacculus without risking bacteriolysis. Protein-protein interaction studies suggest that this is accomplished by the formation of a multienzyme complex, a murein-synthesizing machinery combining murein hydrolases and synthases.
