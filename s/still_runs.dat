5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it <b>still</b> <b>runs</b> along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E

5|$|The route {{remained}} intact until {{the construction of}} the Southern Tier Expressway (STE) through Red House in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unwanted tourism in Jimerson Town, a newly built settlement northeast of Red House, prompted Seneca leaders to seek ways to reduce through traffic in the settlement; to do so, the state built a trumpet interchange off the expressway where NY382 used to be, which, coupled with the flooding of the roadway of old Route 17 to the west, effectively cut Jimerson Town off from the highway system. The construction of the highway also allowed the state to claim eminent domain over most of the hamlet of Red House, leading to the hamlet's destruction; the few remaining private residences in the town as of 2015 are located southwest of what was Route 382. When the interchange at exit19 of the STE was constructed , NY382 was disconnected from Allegany State Park Route2, which was realigned to meet the new exit (as was Bay State Road, much of which was moved to a route south of and parallel to the expressway). The NY382 designation was removed around this time as a result. The roadway <b>still</b> <b>runs</b> from the former NY17 (now NY951T, which terminates near the former NY382's end at a dilapidated bridge) to the Exit 19 on/off ramp, but due to safety concerns, the road was blocked off at its eastern terminus.|$|E
