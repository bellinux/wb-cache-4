The plethora of existing telematic information services suffer from inflexibility {{in the sense of}} restricting the types of business models they allow. Thus the providers of such services are forced to assume predefined business models and processes that are fixed and thus inflexible. The paper discusses a framework, which enables the intelligent integration of <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> exploiting the release of web services and the dynamic exchange of data offered by peer to peer communication models. The framework provides flexibility and better process integration, since it allows the open communication of different service providers in the maritime sector.

Also the future prospects of SSS are discussed. Secondly, our dataset needs are described and the characteristics of the resulting actual dataset are given. Thirdly, a regression analysis is performed on the country level to analyze the SSS growth potential in the respective European countries. Several different regression analyses are performed, and also different segments are analyzed. In order to check the results, a DEA analysis is performed to see which countries are efficient in SSS and which countries are less efficient. Last of all, several hypothesis are tested.

30|$|The {{operations}} of international businesses {{have become very}} much linked. These linkages are related to international trade activities as goods are produced in one country and consumed in another country. Shipping and trading centres are located in TCEs. Connectivity, which measures {{the extent to which}} the components of a network are connected to one another, is a key factor that affects the importance of TCEs. The strategic importance of TCEs is affected by the factors of location, accessibility, and infrastructure (Lun et al. 2010). A TCE comprises a set of transport infrastructures that take advantage of their corresponding geographical location to provide a high level of accessibility for connecting with trading partners. Accessibility, which refers to the extent to which a user can obtain the required resources at the time that they are needed, is the cornerstone of the competitiveness of TCEs. For instance, a TCE needs to access water to provide <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Connection with the hinterland, which is “the area where the demand for cargo movement is generated” and foreland, which is “the cargo destinations that are connected by shipping services from the cargo sources” (Rodrigue & Notteboom 2010) is also essential for nurturing the development of TCEs.|$|E
30|$|The growing {{importance}} of global competition in international business has stimulated {{research in the}} areas of business studies to economic geography on the topic of location decision (Anokhin & Wincent 2012). From the perspective of international business management, location decision is an important strategic decision as it involves a significant amount of resource commitment when investing in a particular region. Some researchers have also conducted studies on location avoidance {{to reduce the risk of}} wrong decisions (Schotter & Beamish 2013). The concept of location (i.e., why and where firms conduct business activities in a particular region) has been a topic of interest (see Alcacer & Chung 2007 Lorenen & Mudambi 2013). Since the 1920 s (Marshall 1920), topics such as economic agglomeration and location strategy have been examined from various perspectives. The growth of regions and economic development are also linked to external economies of scale when co-location is taken into consideration. Some studies have also taken a step further to examine co-located buyers and suppliers. According to Ganotakis & Love (2012), global actors (e.g., traders involved in trading activities, logistics service providers who provide logistics related supporting services, liner shipping companies that provide regular <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> terminal operators who handle containers and ships) who conduct their trading activities internationally have higher levels of growth and productivity.|$|E

40|$|Domestic sea {{transport}} {{is critical to}} all aspects {{of life in the}} Pacific, providing access to markets and health and education services, as well as enabling cultural and social connectivity. Current <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> are entirely dependent upon use of increasingly expensive fossil fuels. Whilst there has been increasing research on international shipping, very little focus has been given to date to domestic shipping in the Pacific, and in particular at the local, village level. Recent studies have highlighted lack of data, particularly at a village level, as being a major impediment to progressing a shift to more sustainable transport. The importance of transport in achieving sustainable development and “green growth” is being increasingly highlighted by Pacific Leaders as a key priority, and particularly the need to find alternatives to reduce the region’s crippling dependency on imported fossil fuels. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in other regions also face similar challenges. This paper provides a summary of the findings of a village-based assessment of transport and fossil fuel use in Solodamu village, Kadavu, Fiji carried out in 2009 and 2011. The objectives of the surveys were to gauge the overall sea, land and air transport use by the village and the fossil fuel footprint of the village by collecting data on a household by household basis. We then go on to outline how this assessment methodology has been expanded for an island group and highlight the potential of using this in other SIDS, so building the data sets available for more accurate analysis of both transport need and fossil fuel use to better address the issues of fossil fuel dependency and sustainable transport for the Pacific. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present paper is to analyse the progress of data in shipping demand between 1993 and 2002 in the most important spanish ports, in the others words, those ports that are under State Ports protection, and their relation with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as Freight Index. The methodology {{that has been used}} to draw the shipping demand function up is the traditional one, due to we use added variables, i. e. they mean the global behaviour of a certain group of individuals. To prepare this paper, the demand account of <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> has been divided in three groups, in function of cargo types: General Merchandise, Solid Bulks and Liquid Bulks. The reason why we use this kind of division is that Principals Institutions in Sea Transport bring their statistics down in this way. Similarly, we pretend to analyse the evolution in the share of different cargos in the whole shipping demand in the period mentioned before (1993 / 2002). The particular demand function for each cargo type in a certain year {{is going to be in}} function of the GDP and the freight rate in that year. The Freight Index used depends on the cargo analysed. So, in case of general merchandise it has been used the liner freight index, since this cargo type use to be transported in liner terms. Usually, Freight Conferences fix prices in this navigation. In case of Solid and Liquid Bulks, we have chosen dry cargo and tanker cargo freight index respectively. The standard procedure to transport these kind of bulks is by "tramp" navigation. In "tramp" navigation, prices use to be fixed by time freight, when ships services are contracted for a limited period of time, or travel freight, when ship services are contracted for a particular trip. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{overview}} of relevant market definition in the sea transport sector. The author examines the sea transport sector {{through the eyes of}} Article 82 EC and its inherent concept of relevant market definition. Two main questions are answered in this thesis: 1) How is the relevant market in the sea transport sector defined in EC competition law? 2) What must shipping companies take into consideration when defining it? The Community’s goal for the future of EC maritime trade is to – {{with the help of the}} Marco Polo programme –shift billions of tonnes kilometres from land transport services to <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> making transport in the Community more environmentally sound. The shifting consists of tens of per cent of tonnes kilometres which will naturally increase the frequency and thus importance of sea transport. It is the author’s view that along with this increase in sea borne trade will follow an increased amount of cases before the Commission, the Community Courts with regard to shipping and competition. Due to this future increase and due to the lack of Community case law on relevant market definition as regards the sea transport sector, the author’s finds that there is an acute need for an analysis with regard to this area. The thesis encompasses both relevant product market definition and relevant geographic market definition and encompasses six chapters. The first four chapters offer the reader an introduction to the concept of competition, {{an overview of}} competition law in the EC especially with regard to relevant market definition. The fifth chapter shows how the relevant market may be defined in the sea transport sector by examining how relevant markets have been defined in the case law of the Community Courts and how this market has been assessed by the Commission. The discussion is both analytical as well as speculative. The study ends with conclusions in chapter six...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} thirty years {{segmentation}} has been recognised as a fundamental concept in the understanding of a market. This research undertakes a benefit segmentation of the passenger and freight, sea and air transport markets between Great Britain and Ireland (both Northern Ireland and Eire). In so doing, two areas which have been under-researched are addressed; segmentation in a transport market and the Irish sea passenger and freight market. The dominant features of the Irish sea passenger and freight markets are identified; seasonality in the passenger market and imbalance in the freight market. The concept of segmentation is applied to the short-sea passenger and freight market and a conceptual model for the research is developed. Extensive data collection in the passenger markets takes place over a twelve month period. Four surveys are conducted on board ferries (on the Larne- Stranraer, Holyhead-DunLaoghaire and Fishguard-Rosslare routes) and in airport departure lounges (Belfast City airport, Belfast International airport and Dublin airport) at three monthly intervals. Two postal surveys are conducted in the freight market, one addressed to shippers of goods and the other to carriers. Two sets of analyses are conducted. The first is concerned with presenting an overall profile of the markets and identifying areas where differences occur in the markets. This structural variation is found to exist in the ferry passenger market and to a lesser extent, in the air passenger market. The second set of analyses undertakes a benefit segmentation of the markets. Benefit segments (groups of passengers and freight customers who choose the service for similar reasons) are constructed for car and foot passengers on each route, business and non-business passengers at each airport, freight shippers, freight agents purchasing air transport services and freight agents purchasing <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> The differing transport service needs of the segments are discussed and comparisons made. The segments are profiled in terms of independent variables. Travel behaviour, buying behaviour and demographic characteristics are used to profile segments in the passenger market. Product characteristics, transport service characteristics and company characteristics are used to profile benefit segments in the freight market. The benefit segments may be used to guide resource allocation for the ferry company by suggesting how the results of the benefit segmentation may influence the marketing mix variables.
