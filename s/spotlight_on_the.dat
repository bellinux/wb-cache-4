By finishing second, Webber jumped from fifth to third in the final championship standings, overtaking both Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who did not compete {{in the final two}} races of the season.

25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E

Both Ansons were repaired; the top aircraft (N4876) returned to flight service, and the lower (L9162) was used as an instructional airframe. Hewson was treated for his back injury at Albury District Hospital and returned to active duty; he graduated from No.2 SFTS in October 1940. He was discharged from the Air Force as a flight lieutenant in 1946. Sinclair was discharged in 1945, also a flight lieutenant. Fraser was posted to Britain and flew as a pilot officer with No.206 Squadron RAF, based in Aldergrove, Northern Ireland.

500|$|The book is {{categorized}} as non-fiction science but some commentators emphasize {{it may be}} better described as speculative fiction. The World Without Us is grounded in environmental and science journalism. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet. Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which [...] "throw the <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth itself", {{was found to be}} creative and objective. There have been other books that address similar topics, such as Gregory Benford's 1999 book Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia. Science fiction writers such as H. G. Wells (The War of the Worlds, 1898) and John Wyndham (The Day of the Triffids, 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Berkeley English professor George R. Stewart, Earth Abides.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy.

[...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E

Pitchfork writer Carrie Battan wrote that Beyoncé was [...] "exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music" [...] and rejecting [...] "traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere". Spins Anupa Mistry felt it was [...] "more textured than its predecessors in both sound and content", and applauded the singer's transition to a maturer sound of [...] "big-hook message pop, multi-directional, mood-shifting suites and delicately resonant R ballads". Noting the lack of [...] "guaranteed hits", NME believed that the [...] "low-key, moody production throws the <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> words and the images brought to play" [...] and described it as her most experimental work to date. Rolling Stones pop critic Rob Sheffield found Beyoncés boldness among its best attributes, believing the album is at its [...] "strongest when it goes for full-grown electro soul with an artsy boho edge". Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times highlighted a desire to push creative boundaries among the tracks and admired [...] "how the music similarly blends the intimate and the extravagant", while Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci concluded that the album was characterized by [...] "clashing impulses—between strength and escape, megapop and fresh sounds, big messages and resonant lyrics".|$|E
