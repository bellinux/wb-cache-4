2500|$|In {{order to}} {{maximise}} {{the number of}} selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers {{to spend more time}} in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times. The overall aim of designing a retail environment is to have customers enter the store, and explore the totality of the physical environment engaging in a variety of retail experiences– from browsing through to sampling and ultimately to purchasing. [...] The retail <b>service</b> <b>environment</b> {{plays an important role in}} affecting the customer's perceptions of the retail experience.|$|E

Therefore, it can hardly be guaranteed that the quality of Web service (QoWS) attributes of Web services do not fluctuate with the dynamic Web <b>service</b> <b>environments.</b> When a composite service is planned in the context of dynamic <b>service</b> <b>environments,</b> there is another aspect which has not been taken into account by existing works, namely, concurrency- the fact that multiple requests to a composite service may arrive at the same time. Considering the dynamics of Web <b>service</b> <b>environments</b> and concurrency of requests, we propose in this paper a service selection scheme which adopts top-k dominating queries to generate a composition solution rather than only select the best composition solution for a given request.

40|$|Visual {{appeal is}} an {{important}} consideration {{in the design of}} interior <b>service</b> <b>environments</b> because attractiveness influences consumer behavior. Employing both an experiment and a field study, we show that visual complexity reduces a <b>service</b> <b>environment’s</b> attractiveness. Furthermore, we find that the complexity-attractiveness relationship is mediated by processing fluency and its instantaneous affective companion, pleasure. Our findings provide novel insights into the underlying process mechanism involved in channeling the effect of visual complexity on attractiveness. Furthermore, both studies confirm that customers’ field dependence moderates the complexity-fluency relationship and that shopping motivation (i. e., hedonic vs. utilitarian shopping goals) moderates the fluency-pleasure relationship. Our findings suggest that it is generally better to reduce the complexity of interior <b>service</b> <b>environments.</b> To achieve this, service firms should reduce the number of objects in the environment, enhance the visual organization and symmetry of their arrangement, and use fewer colors, textures, and materials.
