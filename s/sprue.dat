5|$|Following {{his study}} in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads {{was chosen to}} lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in {{clinical}} hematology, to study diseases of the blood-forming organs. He built on his research on anemia and tropical <b>sprue.</b> In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical <b>sprue</b> (and relieve anemia). Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field.|$|E
5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical <b>sprue.</b> An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical <b>sprue</b> has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the <b>sprue</b> out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spruing.</b> The wax copy is <b>sprued</b> with a treelike {{structure}} of wax {{that will eventually}} provide paths for the molten casting material to flow and for air to escape. The carefully planned <b>spruing</b> usually begins at the top with a wax [...] "cup," [...] which is attached by wax cylinders to various points on the wax copy. The <b>spruing</b> {{does not have to}} be hollow, as it will be melted out later in the process.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Magic Tracks' are {{individual}} {{track links}} {{that come in}} a bag, ready to be assembled without the tedious work of removing them from <b>sprues.</b> Magic Tracks are designed to snap together through a tight friction fit, so that the track can be more easily assembled than tracks molded with <b>sprues.</b> However, glue is still needed after the assembly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sprues</b> {{in model}} kits often include {{engravings}} {{to identify the}} parts by number.|$|R
5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical <b>sprue.</b> But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E
5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical <b>sprue,</b> or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E
25|$|Suárez Calderon {{identified}} the proper and effective {{treatment of a}} type of anemia known as tropical <b>sprue,</b> the application of complex methods, such as electrocardiography and radioisotope, {{to be used in}} clinics and the identification and treatment of the disease which causes heart rheumatism. Suárez Calderon continued Ashford's work and investigations on anemia after the latter’s death. In 1938, he published his scientific findings on tropical <b>sprue.</b>|$|E

50|$|Model makers {{sometimes}} use <b>sprues</b> or runners as {{raw material}} to fabricate additional parts, such as railings on model ships, antenna wires on airplanes, or greebles on fictional spacecraft.|$|R
25|$|Gastrointestinal causes: {{the distal}} tractus digestivus secretes {{high levels of}} magnesium. Therefore, {{secretory}} diarrhea can cause hypomagnesemia. Thus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Whipple's disease and celiac <b>sprue</b> can all cause hypomagnesemia.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the {{intestinal}} lining. Examples of causes {{of this kind}} of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like Crohn's or celiac <b>sprue</b> which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{overlap in}} {{findings}} between tropical <b>sprue,</b> post-infectious {{irritable bowel syndrome}} and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in the pathophysiology of the three conditions and also SIBO can similarly sometimes be triggered by an acute gastrointestinal infection.|$|E

40|$|Four alloys {{were tested}} {{which are being}} {{considered}} for use in making partial denture castings. The procedure was varied by using three <b>spruing</b> methods, two different waxes, two melt temperatures, and two different directions of filling. Statistical analysis techniques {{were used to determine}} the significance of the results. <b>Spruing</b> method was the most highly influencial of the variables and the flat method gave the best results. This method also is most relevant to clinical procedure. The effect of temperature, in fewer instances, was also in fluential.

25|$|In 1931, William B. Castle and his {{assistant}} Cornelius P. Rhoads studied hookworm and tropical <b>sprue</b> in relation to anemia. They were able to treat some patients with liver extract, which efficacy was being studied. Dr. George C. Payne continued to study anemia in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{diseases}} of malabsorption {{may affect the}} small intestine, including the autoimmune coeliac disease, infective Tropical <b>sprue,</b> and congenital or surgical short bowel syndrome. Other rarer diseases affecting the small intestine include Curling's ulcer, blind loop syndrome, Milroy disease and Whipple's disease. Tumours of the small intestine include gastrointestinal stromal tumours, lipomas, hamartomas and carcinoid syndromes.|$|E
25|$|From 1920 to 1933, the Bucks {{made their}} home in Nanjing, {{on the campus of}} the University of Nanking, where they both had {{teaching}} positions. She taught English literature at the private, church-run University of Nanking, Ginling College and at the National Central University. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with phenylketonuria. In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, <b>sprue,</b> and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her master's degree from Cornell University. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of product it may then be cut or sanded to remove any casting {{artefacts}} like <b>sprues</b> and seams. Some products are also assembled and painted, while some models and kits, which are intended for the consumer to assemble, are left unfinished.|$|R
50|$|Another cost {{advantage}} with rotational molding is the minimal {{amount of material}} wasted in production. There are no <b>sprues</b> or runners (as in injection molding), no off-cuts (thermoforming), or pinch off scrap (blow molding). What material is wasted, through scrap or failed part testing, can usually be recycled.|$|R
50|$|Metal-chasing. Just as the wax copies were chased, {{the casting}} is worked until the {{telltale}} {{signs of the}} casting process are removed, so that the casting now looks like the original model. Pits left by air bubbles in the casting and the stubs of the <b>spruing</b> are filed down and polished.|$|R
25|$|Approximately 10 {{percent of}} IBS cases are {{triggered}} by an acute gastroenteritis infection. Genetic defects {{relating to the}} innate immune system and epithelial barrier as well as high stress and anxiety levels appear to {{increase the risk of}} developing post-infectious IBS. Post-infectious IBS usually manifests itself as the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Evidence has demonstrated that the release of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines during acute enteric infection causes increased gut permeability leading to translocation of the commensal bacteria across the epithelial barrier resulting in significant damage to local tissues, which can result in chronic gut abnormalities in sensitive individuals. However, increased gut permeability is strongly associated with IBS regardless of whether IBS was initiated by an infection or not. A link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and tropical <b>sprue</b> has been proposed {{to be involved in the}} aetiology of post-infectious IBS.|$|E
500|$|The mould {{consists}} of two primary components, the injection mould (A plate) and the ejector mould (B plate). These components are {{also referred to as}} moulder and mouldmaker. Plastic resin enters the mould through a <b>sprue</b> or gate in the injection mould; the <b>sprue</b> bushing is to seal tightly against the nozzle of the injection barrel of the moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow from the barrel into the mould, also known as the [...] The <b>sprue</b> bushing directs the molten plastic to the cavity images through channels that are machined into the faces of the A and B plates. These channels allow plastic to run along them, so they are referred to as runners. [...] The molten plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into the cavity geometry to form the desired part.|$|E
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the <b>sprue</b> (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the <b>sprue</b> or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E
50|$|Students {{of bronze}} casting will usually work in direct wax, where {{the model is}} made in wax, {{possibly}} formed over a core, or with a core cast in place, if the piece is to be hollow. If no mould is made and the casting process fails, the artwork will also be lost. After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing {{an image of the}} wax form, including core pins, <b>sprues,</b> vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where <b>sprues</b> and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.|$|R
50|$|Alongside {{the gaming}} is a dealer's area which {{commonly}} includes products from Citadel Miniatures, particularly, armies {{for all the}} game systems scheduled for release. Another attraction is the Golden Demon, a painting competition of miniatures. There is also a competition of varying degrees of seriousness, the Scrap Demon competition, in which competitors create a models from plastic <b>sprues.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Repositioning {{body parts}} {{such as the}} head, arms or torso of a {{miniature}} figure {{is one of the}} simplest types of conversion. [...] Another simple technique is weapon swapping. [...] Weapons can be taken from <b>sprues</b> or other miniatures and used to replace whatever weapon the converted miniature is holding to create any variety of distinctive commanders.|$|R
500|$|Rhoads was {{to assist}} Castle, and they {{established}} {{a base in}} San Juan at the Presbyterian Hospital. Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests. In Puerto Rico, the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that, while referred to as patients, they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research. Because {{of the effects of}} anemia and the suspicion that tropical <b>sprue</b> was related to diet, Rhoads experimentally controlled patients' diets. Lederer notes that in letters from this time, Rhoads referred to his patients as [...] "experimental 'animals'." [...] He wrote: [...] "If they don’t develop something they certainly have the constitutions of oxen." [...] Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them. If they did develop tropical <b>sprue,</b> he could treat it with liver extract.|$|E
500|$|A parting line, <b>sprue,</b> gate marks, and {{ejector pin}} marks are usually {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (<b>sprue</b> and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|E
500|$|The {{amount of}} resin {{required}} {{to fill the}} <b>sprue,</b> runner and cavities of a mould comprises a [...] "shot". Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that are ground into the parting line of the mould, or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped air {{is not allowed to}} escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming material and squeezed into the corners of the cavity, where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects. The air can even become so compressed that it ignites and burns the surrounding plastic material.|$|E
5000|$|As {{would be}} expected, given these origins, greebling is most {{commonly}} associated with the particular kind of large city-like spaceships made popular in Star Wars, but has been generalized to refer to any dense covering by different (usually mechanical) components. Similarly, Borg starships (and drones) in Star Trek appear heavily [...] "greebled" [...] using leftover <b>sprues</b> from previous kitbashing and photoetched bits.|$|R
50|$|Mobile Suit Gundam {{debuted in}} 1979 {{and the first}} Gunpla kits came in 1980, {{following}} the show's cancellation. Nearly every mecha in the series {{was made into a}} model kit, from mobile suits to support aircraft and space battleships. Parts came in up to three different colored <b>sprues.</b> These kits lacked articulation and detail, and required glue and paint to build and finish.|$|R
5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of <b>sprues,</b> gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|R
