5|$|Many Public <b>Storage</b> {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public <b>Storage</b> representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their <b>storage</b> units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public <b>Storage.</b> For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the <b>storage</b> unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public <b>Storage.</b> An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public <b>Storage</b> misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public <b>Storage.</b> Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

40|$|Photodegradation {{has been}} known to break down toxic {{compounds}} in potable water <b>storages</b> as well as degrading pesticides and herbicides in agricultural water <b>storages.</b> In this study, the concentration and reactivity of humic substances (HS) present in natural microlayers on water <b>storages</b> in South East Queensland (SEQ) was investigated. Microlayer and subsurface samples were taken from eight water <b>storages</b> with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) used to quantify HS concentration. The E 2 /E 3 ratio (ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm) was used to indicate the molecular weight of DOC compounds, and absorbance at 253. 7 nm and the permanganate index were used to compare the reactivity of humified DOC. The concentration of carbonyl compounds in the microlayer was also investigated as carbonyls are considered the most photoreactive functional group present in HS. Preliminary results indicate that the concentration of humic substances and their chemical reactivity in SEQ water <b>storages</b> are highly variable, reflecting the characteristics of the water catchments...|$|R
5|$|<b>Storage</b> Equities {{was founded}} by Public <b>Storage</b> in 1980 to {{purchase}} self-storage facilities. It was one of 17 self-storage REITs that Public <b>Storage</b> held an interest in. Between 1992 and 1995, <b>Storage</b> Equities paid Public <b>Storage</b> $31 million in management and consulting fees. In 1995, Public <b>Storage</b> and its subsidiaries were merged with its self-storage REIT, <b>Storage</b> Equities Inc., and re-structured as a single REIT called Public <b>Storage</b> Inc. One analyst said the acquisition capitalized on conflict of interest concerns, while Hughes said the merger {{was set up to}} alleviate them.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy <b>storage</b> such as compressed air energy <b>storage</b> and thermal energy <b>storage</b> can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of <b>storage</b> needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily <b>storage,</b> and high penetration requires both short and long term <b>storage</b> – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of <b>storage.</b> For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to understand the economic value of future market information, as energy <b>storages</b> mitigate market uncertainty by forward-looking strategies. At a system level, we evaluate different information management policies to coordinate storages' actions and improve their aggregate profitability: (1) providing a publicly available market forecasting channel; (2) encouraging decentralized <b>storages</b> to share their private forecasts with each other; (3) releasing additional market information to a targeted subset of <b>storages</b> exclusively. We highlight the perils of too much market information provision and advice on exclusiveness of market forecast channel...|$|R
