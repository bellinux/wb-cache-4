40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces the}} georisk and reliability design approach {{to predict the}} sustainability of development on or near mountainous terrains. A field study was conducted on fifty two <b>slopes</b> to identify the most frequent factor that trigger <b>slope</b> instability in sedimentary <b>slope</b> formation. The classification level of risk also identified in this study. Parameters such as <b>slope</b> geology, mode of <b>slope</b> failure, <b>slope</b> geometry, <b>slope</b> distress, rainfall, and drainage system and <b>slope</b> stabilization technique <b>slope</b> were studied. Further parametric study was carried out using SLOPE/W to determine the internal instability factor of <b>slope</b> failure. The results from <b>slopes</b> assessment show that the weathering Grade V and Grade VI become the most favorable georisk factor of <b>slope</b> instability that effect {{the reliability of the}} <b>slope.</b> While, for the reliability of <b>slope</b> design, <b>slope</b> height, <b>slope</b> angle and factor of safety become the main factor that contributed to low reliability of <b>slope.</b> In addition, further statistical analysis found that drainage structure contributed to major instability factor of <b>slope</b> stability.

40|$|Continental <b>slope</b> {{sedimentation}} is in generally {{driven by}} climate and the oceanographic setting along a margin. This work compares <b>slope</b> {{architecture of the}} glaciated Scotian <b>Slope</b> to the nonglaciated northern Argentine <b>slope.</b> On the Scotian <b>Slope,</b> a new seismic stratigraphy was used to identify variations in patterns of <b>slope</b> sedimentation. The Early Quaternary is characterized by few mass transport deposits (MTDs) and deposition occurs at the lower <b>slope,</b> whereas towards the younger glaciated sequence, much larger MTDs characterize <b>slope</b> sedimentation. On the Argentine <b>Slope,</b> sedimentation patterns are driven by along- and downslope processes. At times of large Pleistocene storm events at the shelf break, sediment may be supplied to the <b>slope</b> from the shelf. By comparing these <b>slope</b> systems, general ideas of <b>slope</b> deposition were developed.

The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and <b>sloped</b> backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput <b>sloped</b> backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E

40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} in large scale open pit <b>slopes</b> {{are more complex}} than could be considered through conventional <b>slope</b> design methods. Pit <b>slope</b> behaviour must be predicted accurately, because for very deep open pits, a small change of <b>slope</b> angle can have serious technical and economic consequences. Failure of hard rock <b>slopes</b> often involves both failure along naturally existing weakness planes and failure of intact rock. Without an advanced understanding of combined rock <b>slope</b> failure mechanisms, the validity of commonly applied methods of large scale <b>slope</b> analysis is questionable. The problem was investigated {{by means of a}} toolbox approach, in which a wide range of <b>slope</b> stability analysis methods were used and compared to address specific problems arising during <b>slope</b> design optimisation of the Cadia Hill Open Pit, NSW. In particular, numerical modelling is an advanced tool to obtain insight into potential failure mechanisms and to assist the <b>slope</b> design process. The distinct element method was employed to simulate complex rock <b>slope</b> failure, including fracture extension, progressive step-path failure and brittle failure propagation, which were previously often considered unimportant or too difficult to model. A new, failure-scale-dependent concept for the categorisation of <b>slope</b> failures with six categories ranging from 0 (stable) to 5 (overall <b>slope</b> failure) was suggested to assist risk-based <b>slope</b> design. Parametric <b>slope</b> modelling was conducted to determine the interrelationship between proposed categories and critical slope/discontinuity parameters. Initiation and progression of complex <b>slope</b> failure were simulated and described, which resulted in an advanced understanding of combined <b>slope</b> failure mechanisms and the important role of rock bridges in large scale <b>slope</b> stability. A graphical presentation of the suggested <b>slope</b> failure categories demonstrated their interrelationship to varied slope/discontinuity parameters. Although large scale <b>slope</b> analyses will always involve data-limited systems, this investigation shows that comprehensive, conceptual modelling of <b>slope</b> failure mechanisms can deliver a significantly improved insight into <b>slope</b> behaviour, so that associated <b>slope</b> failure risks can be judged with more confidence. The consideration of combined <b>slope</b> failure {{mechanisms in}} the analysis of large scale open pit <b>slopes</b> is essential if <b>slope</b> behaviour is to be realistically modelled...|$|R
40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer a {{cost-effective}} way {{to analyze and}} inventory land and environmental resources. There are many attributes that can be displayed and analyzed in GIS. One of these attributes is <b>slope,</b> which can be calculated from a digital elevation model (DEM). <b>Slope</b> {{is an important factor}} in a variety of models used in land analysis as well as land use and management. There are several different mathematical computational algorithms used to calculate <b>slope</b> within a GIS. Eight different <b>slope</b> calculation methods were investigated in this study. These methods were used to calculate <b>slope</b> using 10 -m, 30 -m, and 100 -m DEMs. There were two phases of analysis in this study. The first phase was a cell-by-cell comparison of the eight <b>slope</b> algorithms for all three DEMs to obtain an understanding of differences between the calculated <b>slope</b> methods. The second phase was to determine the method that calculated the most accurate <b>slope</b> from a 10 - m, 30 -m, and 100 -m DEM, by comparing calculated <b>slope</b> to actual <b>slope</b> value. All methods underestimated <b>slope</b> for the 100 -m DEM with a mean <b>slope</b> difference ranging from 9. 28 % to 11. 085 %. For the 30 -meter DEMs all the <b>slope</b> methods underestimated <b>slope,</b> with a mean <b>slope</b> difference range from 0. 21 % to 4. 18 %. The 10 -meter DEM mean <b>slope</b> difference ranged from - 2. 63 % to 1. 82 % for the cell <b>slope</b> methods.

30|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} and total {{nitrogen}} were significantly (P[*]<[*]. 05) influenced with <b>slope</b> positions, the highest amount {{was found at}} gentle <b>slope</b> and lowest at steep <b>slope.</b> This {{could be due to}} the removal of organic matter through erosion and surface runoff from steep <b>slope</b> and deposition in gentle <b>slope,</b> and presence of better soil moisture at gentle <b>slope.</b> Earlier study show, soil organic carbon content increases with moisture content and clay deposition at lower <b>slope</b> position (Hailu et al. 2012). Aytenew (2015) reported, soil nitrogen content decrease with increasing slope; the content is low at steep <b>slopes</b> and high at gentle <b>slope</b> position.

The highest CEC at gentle <b>slope</b> was associated with high soil clay and organic carbon content.

40|$|Risk-based <b>slope</b> {{stabilization}} planning integrates {{the failure}} probability {{and the failure}} consequence systematically and shows promise {{for use in the}} practice. This paper attempts to develop a risk-based methodology for stabilization planning for deteriorating soil cut <b>slopes.</b> First, a framework of risk-based stabilization planning for <b>slopes</b> is proposed. Then the time-dependent reliability of deteriorating <b>slopes</b> is analyzed based on observed performance. Thereafter, the <b>slope</b> failure consequence is assessed in terms of expected numbers of fatality. After obtaining the time-dependent risk of <b>slope</b> failure, the time for <b>slope</b> stabilization is determined according to selected risk criteria. Finally, the effect of <b>slope</b> maintenance on the reliability of <b>slopes</b> is evaluated. Based on the analyses, the annual probability of failure of soil cut <b>slopes</b> would increase exponentially in the early stage of service if no maintenance were implemented. As a <b>slope</b> deteriorates, the risk of <b>slope</b> failure increases with time and may reach an intolerable level at a certain time. The risk of <b>slope</b> failure may also reach an intolerable level due to a change of elements at risk. The derived stabilization time depends on the factors that cause the <b>slopes</b> to deteriorate, consequence of <b>slope</b> failure, selected risk criteria, and vulnerability of the affected population...|$|R
