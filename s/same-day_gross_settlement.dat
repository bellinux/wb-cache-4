40|$|While net {{settlement}} systems {{make more}} {{efficient use of}} liquidity than <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> systems, they are known to generate systemic risk. What does that tendency imply for {{the stability of the}} payments (or financial) system when the two settlement systems coexist? Do liquidity shortages induce banks to settle more transactions in the net settlement system, thereby increasing systemic risk? Or do banks require their counterparties to send payments through the <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> system when default risks are high, increasing the need for liquidity and the money market rate but reducing overall systemic risk? This paper studies the factors that drive the relative importance of net and <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> systems over the short run, using daily data on transaction volumes from the large- volume payment systems of all euro area countries that have had both a net and a <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> system at the same time. Applying a large portfolio of different econometric techniques, we find that it is actually the transaction volumes in <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> systems that affect the daily price of liquidity and the credit risk spread in money markets.

This article evaluates the effectiveness of alternative methods of settling Fedwire payments in reducing intraday credit extensions. The authors simulate three deferred settlement mechanisms that complement RTGS systems: one-hour netting, six-hour netting, and a mechanism called a receipt-reactive <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> (RRGS) system. Their results suggest that in conjunction with RTGS systems, the RRGS mechanism could significantly reduce daylight credit extensions while modestly delaying the average time of payment settlement. Moreover, certain features of RRGS systems may encourage banks to submit payments earlier in the day. Further research on RRGS systems may shed light on whether they {{could prove to be}} a true liquidity-saving complement to real-time <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> systems.

Net settlement economizes on the costs of holding non-interest-bearing reserves but increases moral hazard problems. The "put option" value of default under net settlement can also distort banks' investment incentives.; Absent these distortions, net <b>settlement</b> dominates <b>gross,</b> although the optimal net settlement scheme may involve a positive probability of default. Net settlement becomes more attractive relative to <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> if bank assets have to be liquidated at less than book value.

40|$|Using a neoclassical {{monetary}} model, {{we investigate}} the welfare {{cost of a}} payment system that operates as a real-time <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> (RTGS) system. We illustrate how the cost of such systems does not ultimately derive from factors such as "payments gridlock" but instead from the credit constraints imposed by RTGS. We also investigate the welfare consequences of various approaches to the allocation of daylight credit by central banks. The two most popular approaches, collateralization and charging an administered intraday interest rate, are shown to be effective along some dimensions but flawed in others.

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} Real-Time <b>Gross</b> <b>Settlement</b> and hybrid payment {{systems that}} are based on payment offset, using a two-period, multi-bank model. The comparison is performed according to two criteria: liquidity needs and speed of settlement. We assume that the existence of a payment is common knowledge but that the specific degree of time-criticality of a payment is the private information of the bank sending the payment. Hybrid payment systems are shown to outperform Real-Time <b>Gross</b> <b>Settlement</b> when payments are offset in the first period and when they are offset in both periods. This suggests that in a hybrid system, the offsetting facility should be in operation all day, or, at the very least, for some time after the system opens in the morning. A system in which the offsetting facility was only switched on late in the day would not necessarily be preferred to Real-Time <b>Gross</b> <b>Settlement.</b> These results are shown to be robust to changes in the transparency of the central queue of payments awaiting offset. However, this robustness may not hold with different forms of information asymmetry. ...|$|R

Intraday payments-related credit in net settlement systems has been reduced by restructuring payment systems into real-time <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> systems with collateralized overdrafts, while in the existing real-time <b>gross</b> <b>settlement</b> systems, the risk-abatement program currently in effect has taken the form of caps and charges on uncollateralized daylight credit. ...|$|R
