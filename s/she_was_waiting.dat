25|$|Jan Pieterszoon Coen left Batavia for {{the last}} time on 28 June 1939 and was {{stationed}} in Amsterdam on 29 July 1939 where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> to be scrapped. However, due to the outbreak of the Second World War, the ship was needed again and she made two short voyages to Lisbon, Portugal in order to retrieve passengers from the MS Oranje.|$|E

The Greek cargo ship M/V Evriali (10,000 DWT) was transporting 7,400 tons steel from Mariupol, Ukraine (formerly Zhdanov) to Italy, and had already passed the strait southwards.|$|E
25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so he knew that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E

25|$|Prior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger Albert Belle {{unleashed}} a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> in the Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, {{she became the}} first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6 she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions. However, she was not the first female sportscaster to cover the World Series: that honor fell to CBS Sports reporter Lesley Visser, who served as a field reporter for the Series from 1990 to 1993. She would also cover that same World Series but for a different network, ABC Sports.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, who said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for {{the right time and}} insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E
500|$|Marge {{believes}} she has higher morals {{than most other}} characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent The Itchy & Scratchy Show and being a prominent member of the [...] "Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene." [...] She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, {{but many of the}} townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her frequent failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms. Marge is {{the only member of the}} family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him [...] "don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.". Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with her daughter, Lisa, who is a feminist. For example, in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] (season one, 1990) When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for Ms. Botz, the babysitter, Bart, Lisa and Maggie asked Marge for some grub, but she quickly refused and they ran away.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2010, Billboard {{published}} an article stating that Apple was planning on releasing a new album in spring 2011, with musician Michelle Branch claiming to have {{heard some of the}} new tracks. Drummer Charley Drayton also told Modern Drummer magazine that he was co-producing the record. However, the album was not released in the spring and Billboard reported later that Epic was not aware of a record. Apple delayed the album's release until 2012, explaining that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> [...] "until her label found a new president and that she didn't want her work to be mishandled amid corporate disarray." [...] In January 2012, after its new record label head, LA Reid hinted at new music from Apple, Epic Records announced that the album would be released later in the year. Apple announced performances at the South by Southwest Festival and a spring 2012 tour soon after.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Suu Kyi {{was accused}} of failing to protect Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims during the 2016–17 persecution. State crime experts from Queen Mary University of London warned that Suu Kyi is “legitimising genocide” in Myanmar. Despite {{continued}} persecution of the Rohingya well into 2017, Suu Kyi was “not even admitting, let alone trying to stop, the army’s well-documented campaign of rape, murder and destruction against Rohingya villages.” On 4 September 2017, Yanghee Lee, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, criticised Suu Kyi’s response to the “really grave” situation in Rakhine, saying: “The de facto leader needs to step in – {{that is what we}} would expect from any government, to protect everybody within their own jurisdiction.” The BBC reported that “Her comments came as the number of Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh reached 87,000, according to UN estimates”, adding that “her sentiments were echoed by Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, who said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> to hear from Ms Suu Kyi – who has not commented on the crisis since it erupted.” The next day George Monbiot, writing in The Guardian, called on readers to sign a change.org petition to have the Nobel peace prize revoked, criticising her silence on the matter and asserting “whether out of prejudice or out of fear, she denies to others the freedoms she rightly claimed for herself. Her regime excludes – and in some cases seeks to silence – the very activists who helped to ensure her own rights were recognised.” The Nobel Foundation replied that there existed no provision for revoking a Nobel Prize. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a fellow peace prize holder, also criticised Suu Kyi’s silence: in an open letter published on social media, he said “If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep ... It is incongruous for a symbol of righteousness to lead such a country.” On September 13 it was revealed that Suu Kyi would not be attending a UN General Assembly debate being held the following week to discuss the humanitarian crisis, with a Myanmar government spokesman stating “perhaps she has more pressing matters to deal with”.|$|E
