40|$|AbstractInfluenza virus mRNAs {{contain a}} 5 ′-cap {{structure}} followed by short cell-derived heterogeneous oligonucleotides {{and they are}} polyadenylated. However, <b>selective</b> <b>translation</b> of viral mRNAs occurs upon infection. Thus, we have studied whether differential requirements for the eIF 4 F components on viral and cellular translation could mediate this selectivity. We have previously reported that influenza virus infection proceeds efficiently upon functional impairment of the cap-binding factor eIF 4 E. Now, the requirements for the eIF 4 A helicase and the eIF 4 G scaffolding factor have been examined. The two proteins are essential for viral translation both in in vivo and in vitro analysis. Consequently, viral mRNAs do not contain cis-acting signals that could mediate eIF 4 A and eIF 4 G independence and trans-acting viral proteins do not replace their function. Thus, eIF 4 A and eIF 4 G proteins {{are not responsible for}} the <b>selective</b> <b>translation</b> of viral mRNAs and the translational shut-off of cellular protein synthesis observed in influenza virus infected cells...|$|E

In yeast exposed to hydrogen peroxide, there is a Trm 4 methyltransferase-dependent increase in the proportion of tRNA[superscript Leu(CAA) ] containing m[superscript 5]C at the wobble position, which causes <b>selective</b> <b>translation</b> of mRNA from genes enriched in the TTG codon.

Cell-free systems prepared from mock- and VSV-infected cells reflected this phenomenon; protein synthesis was reduced in the virus-infected cell lysate by approximately 75 % {{compared with the}} mock-infected (control) lysate. This effect appeared to be specific to protein synthesis initiation since (i) methionine incorporation into protein from an exogenous preparation of initiator methionyl-tRNA gave completely analogous results and (ii) {{the addition of a}} ribosomal salt wash (containing protein synthesis initiation factors) stimulated protein synthesis by the infected cell lysate but had no effect on protein synthesis by the control. Micrococcal nuclease-treated (initiation-dependent) VSV-infected cell lysates were not able to translate L-cell mRNA unless they were supplemented with a ribosomal salt wash; a salt wash from ribosomes from uninfected cells effected a quicker recovery than a salt wash from ribosomes from infected cells. When salt wash preparations from ribosomes from uninfected and infected cells were tested for initiation factor 2 (eIF- 2) -dependent ternary complex capacity with added GTP and initiator methionyl-tRNA, we found that the two preparations contained equivalent levels of eIF- 2. However, initiation complex formation by the factor from virus-infected cells proceeded at a reduced initial rate compared with the control.

In plants, different isoforms of eIF 4 E and eIF 4 G form the antigenically distinct eIF 4 F and eIF(iso) 4 F complexes proposed to mediate <b>selective</b> <b>translation.</b> Using a microarray analysis of polyribosome- and non-polyribosome-purified mRNAs from 15 day-old Arabidopsis thaliana wild type [WT] and eIF(iso) 4 E knockout mutant [(iso) 4 E- 1] seedlings we found 79 transcripts shifted from polyribosomes toward non-polyribosomes, and 47 mRNAs with the opposite behavior in the knockout mutant. The translationally decreased mRNAs were overrepresented in root-preferentially expressed genes and proteins from the endomembrane system, including several transporters such as the phosphate transporter PHOSPHATE 1 (PHO 1), Sucrose transporter 3 (SUC 3), ABC transporter-like with ATPase activity (MRP 11) and five electron transporters, as well as signal transduction-, protein modification- and transcription-related proteins. Under normal growth conditions, eIF(iso) 4 E expression under the constitutive promoter 35 S enhanced the polyribosomal recruitment of PHO 1 supporting its translational preference for eIF(iso) 4 E. Furthermore, under phosphate deficiency, the PHO 1 protein increased in the eIF(iso) 4 E overexpressing plants and decreased in the knockout mutant as compared to wild type. In addition, the knockout mutant had larger root, whereas the 35 S directed expression of eIF(iso) 4 E caused shorter root under normal growth conditions, but not under phosphate deficiency.

40|$|SummaryFighting viral infections is {{hampered}} by the scarcity of viral targets and their variability, resulting in development of resistance. Viruses depend on cellular molecules—which are attractive alternative targets—for their life cycle, provided that they are dispensable for normal cell functions. Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we identify the ribosomal protein RACK 1 as a cellular factor required for infection by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) -containing viruses. We further show that RACK 1 is an essential determinant for hepatitis C virus translation and infection, indicating that its function is conserved for distantly related human and fly viruses. Inhibition of RACK 1 does not affect Drosophila or human cell viability and proliferation, and RACK 1 -silenced adult flies are viable, indicating that this protein is not essential for general translation.

40|$|Cell {{survival}} in changing environments requires appropriate regulation of gene expression, including translational control. Multiple stress signaling pathways converge on several key translation factors and rapidly modulate mRNA translation {{at both the}} initiation and the elongation stages. Here, I discover that intracellular proteotoxic stress reduces global protein synthesis by halting ribosomes on transcripts during elongation. Deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments reveals an early elongation pausing, roughly at the site where nascent polypeptide chains emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel. Inhibiting endogenous chaperone molecules by a dominant-negative mutant or chemical inhibitors recapitulates the early elongation pausing, suggesting a dual role of molecular chaperones in facilitating polypeptide elongation and co-translational folding. My results further support that trapped chaperone under stress may prevent the release of elongation factors from ribosomes. My study reveals that translating ribosomes fine-tune the elongation rate by sensing the intracellular folding environment. The early elongation pausing represents a co-translational stress response to maintain the intracellular protein homeostasis. Correspondingly, repression of global protein synthesis is often accompanied with <b>selective</b> <b>translation</b> of mRNAs encoding proteins that are vital for cell survival and stress recovery. Understanding the selective translational control in gene expression relies on precise and comprehensive determination of translation initiation sites (TIS) across the entire transcriptome. Here, I develop an approach (global translation initiation sequencing, GTI-seq) to achieve simultaneous detection of both initiation and elongation events on a genome-wide scale. With single nucleotide resolution, I show an unprecedented view of alternative translation initiation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, I uncover a robust translational reprogramming of protein catabolic process, in particular the proteasome system, in response to starvation. This regulatory mode of TIS selection indicates that the scope of <b>selective</b> <b>translation</b> under stress conditions is much broader than anticipated.

40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>translation</b> of {{influenza}} viral mRNAs occurs after influenza virus superinfection of cells {{infected with the}} VAI RNA-negative adenovirus mutant dl 331 (M. G. Katze, Y. -T. Chen, and R. M. Krug, Cell 37 : 483 - 490, 1984). Cell extracts from these doubly infected cells catalyze the initiation of essentially only influenza viral protein synthesis, reproducing the in vivo situation. This <b>selective</b> <b>translation</b> is correlated with a 5 - to 10 -fold suppression of the dl 331 -induced kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eucaryotic initiation factor eIF- 2. This strongly suggests that influenza virus encodes a gene product that, analogous to the adenoviral VAI RNA, prevents the shutdown of overall protein synthesis caused by an eIF- 2 alpha kinase turned on by viral infection. Adenoviral mRNA translation was restored to the extract from the doubly infected cells {{by the addition of}} the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF- 2 B, which is responsible for the normal recycling of eIF- 2 during protein synthesis. This indicates that the residual kinase in the doubly infected cells leads to a limitation in functional (nonsequestered) eIF- 2 B and hence functional (GTP-containing) eIF- 2 and that under these conditions influenza viral mRNAs are selectively translated over adenoviral mRNAs. Addition of double-stranded RNA to the extracts from these cells restored the eIF- 2 alpha kinase to a level approaching that seen in extracts from cells infected with dl 331 alone and caused the inhibition {{of influenza}} viral mRNA translation. This suggests that the putative influenza viral gene product acts against the double-stranded RNA activation of the kinase and indicates that influenza viral mRNA translation is also linked to the level of functional eIF- 2. Our results thus indicate that a limitation in functional eIF- 2 which causes a nonspecific reduction in the rate of initiation of protein synthesis results in the preferential translation of the better mRNAs (influenza viral mRNAs) {{at the expense of the}} poorer mRNAs (adenoviral mRNAs) ...|$|E
