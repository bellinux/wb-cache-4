5|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High and the South Pacific High both {{influence}} {{the pattern of}} winds in Argentina. Owing to the greater high of the Andes at latitudes north of 40oS, much of Argentina is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High. The <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High transports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina. This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean. Much of the north and central {{parts of the country}} are affected by the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west. This is due to the eastern parts being more frequently affected by the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards.|$|E
5|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{environment}} for formation of subtropical cyclones has both stronger vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures, yet subtropical cyclogenesis is regularly {{observed in the}} open ocean in the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> A second mechanism for formation has been diagnosed for <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> subtropical cyclones: lee cyclogenesis {{in the region of}} the Brazil Current.|$|E

5|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean is {{generally}} inhospitable {{to the formation}} of a tropical storm. Although rare, a growing number of subtropical cyclones have developed in the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean near Brazil, such as the unofficially-named Hurricane Catarina of 2004 that made landfall as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Since 2011, certain storms have official names, such as Subtropical Storm Arani. At least one storm has formed near the West Coast of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{regulations}} include catch {{limits and}} gear restrictions to prevent {{damage to the}} species habitat and population. There are different gear restrictions for commercial and recreational fishers. In 2007, regulations were imposed to reduce the harvesting by one third, {{as a response to}} overfishing in the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> catch limit was later increased in October 2012 {{as a response to the}} increased population. The 2013 limits in the southern U.S. Atlantic waters for the species, measured in gutted weight, is currently 405,971 pounds for longline and 135,324 pounds for hook-and-line fishing.|$|E
5|$|In the North Atlantic, feeding areas {{range from}} Scandinavia to New England. Breeding {{occurs in the}} Caribbean and Cape Verde.

In the <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea.
