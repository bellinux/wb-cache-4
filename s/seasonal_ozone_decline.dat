40|$|Constituent {{observations}} from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) {{in combination with}} estimates of the residual circulation are {{used to examine the}} transport and chemical budgets of HF, CH 4 and O 3 in the summer Northern Hemisphere. Budget calculations of HF, CH 4 and O 3 show that the transport tendency due to the residual circulation increases in magnitude and is largely opposed by eddy motions through the summer months. Ozone budget analyses show that between 100 and 31 hPa, the magnitudes of the mean circulation and eddy transport terms increase through the summer months, producing tendencies that are factors of 2 to 3 times larger than the observed ozone change in the stratosphere. Chemical loss dominates the observed ozone decrease only at the highest latitudes, poleward of about 70 °N. A comparison of {{observations from}} the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer with UARS-calculated total ozone suggests that poleward of 50 °N, between 35 % and 55 % of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>decline</b> during the summer occurs at altitudes below 100 hPa. The overall uncertainties, associated primarily with calculations of the residual circulation and eddy transport, are relatively large, and thus prevent accurate and useful constraints on the ozone chemical rate in the lower stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Photochemistry of Ozone Loss in the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) field mission was to obtain data to better characterize the summertime seasonal decrease of ozone at mid to high latitudes. The decrease in ozone occurs mainly in the lower stratosphere {{and is expected to}} result from in situ chemical destruction. Instrumented balloons and aircraft were used in POLARIS, along with satellites, to measure ozone and chemical species which are involved with stratospheric ozone chemistry. In order to close the seasonal ozone budget, however, ozone transport must also be estimated. Comparison to a global chemistry and transport model (CTM) of the stratosphere indicates how well the summertime ozone loss processes are simulated and thus how well we can predict the ozone response to changing amounts of chemical source gases. Moreover, the model gives insight into the possible relative magnitude of transport contributions to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>decline.</b> Initial comparison to the Goddard CTM, which uses transport winds and temperatures from meteorological data assimilation, shows a high ozone bias in the model and an attenuated summertime ozone loss cycle. Comparison of the model chemical partitioning and ozone catalytic loss rates to those derived from measurements shows fairly close agreement both at ER- 2 altitudes (20 km) and higher. This suggests that the model transport is too active in resupplying ozone to the high latitude region, although chemistry failings cannot be completely ruled out. Comparison of ozone and related species will be shown along with a full diagnosis of the model ozone budget and its possible sources of error...|$|E

The occurrences of such episodes represent ozone deviations of about one-third from the pre- 1976 Oct-Nov-Dec monthly mean! By using primarily quality checked Dobson data, a clear identification was made of more than three dozen short spells with extremely low ozone in the 1957 – 1978 period. In the following twenty-two years (1979 – 2000), using mainly TOMS data, one can identify ~ 46 cases with ozone values falling below 220 matm-cm for longer than 1 day, with each time over an area greater than 500, 000 km 2. The Ozone Mass Deficiency (O 3 MD) from the pre- 1976 average ozone values over the affected area was ~ 2. 8 Mt per day, i. e. four to seven times greater than it would be, assuming only a long-term trend in the Oct-Nov-Dec period.

Using these loss estimates and the observed March mean 63 - 90 N column O 3, we quantify the sensitivity of the ozone dynamical resupply to wave driving, separating it from the sensitivity of ozone depletion to wave driving. The results show that about 2 / 3 of the deviation of the observed March Arctic O 3 from an assumed climatological mean is due to variations in O 3 resupply and 13 is due to depletion. Winters with a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) before mid-February have about 1 / 3 the depletion of winters without one and export less depletion to the midlatitudes.

The applied structural model in state space form is flexible enough to isolate a statistically significant decrease in the estimated seasonal component for May ozone concentrations over the last 10 years, in both the original JFJ and ZUG ozone records.

In contrast, at Barrow, springtime <b>ozone</b> has been <b>declining.</b> All coastal stations experience springtime episodes with rapid depletion of ozone in the boundary layer, attributable to photochemically catalyzed ozone depletion from halogen chemistry. This effect is most obvious at Barrow, followed by Alert. Springtime depletion episodes are less pronounced at Antarctic stations. At South Pole, during the Antarctic spring and summer, photochemical ozone production yields frequent episodes with enhanced surface ozone. Other Antarctic stations show similar, though less frequent spring and summertime periods with enhanced ozone. The Antarctic data provide evidence that austral spring and summertime ozone production in Antarctica is widespread, respectively, affects all stations at least through transport events. This ozone production contributes to a several ppbv enhancement in the annual mean ozone over the Antarctic plateau; however, it is not the determining process in the Antarctic <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle. Although Summit and South Pole have many similarities in their environmental conditions, this ozone production {{does not appear to be}} of equal importance at Summit. Amplitudes of diurnal, summertime ozone cycles at these polar sites are weaker than at lower latitude locations. Amplitudes of <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> changes are larger in the Southern Hemisphere (by 5 ppbv), most likely due to less summertime photochemical ozone loss and more transport of ozone-rich air to the Arctic during the NH spring and summer months...|$|R
40|$|The <b>decline</b> in stratospheric <b>ozone</b> at {{northern}} midlatitudes in wintertime {{may be caused}} by chlorine photochemistry that has been enhanced by heterogeneous reactions. The possibility that the heterogeneous reaction of N 2 O 5 on sulfate aerosols is the cause of this decadal <b>ozone</b> <b>decline</b> is examined by comparing ClO and O 3 measurements made in the lower stratosphere during February, 1988, with results from a 2 D model. At midlatitudes, the abundances, latitudinal, and seasonal gradients of the observed ClO are similar to the results of a model with heterogeneous chemistry, but are in strong disagreement with the results from the model with only gas-phase chemistry. At low latitudes, agreement is best with the results of the model with only gas-phase chemistry. Limited observations indicate that the amount of reactive chlorine is being enhanced, and that heterogeneous chemistry is a likely cause...|$|R
40|$|Geomagnetic {{activity}} {{is thought to}} affect ozone and, possibly, climate in polar regions via energetic particle precipitation (EPP) but observational evidence of its importance in the <b>seasonal</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> variation on long time scales is still lacking. Here we fill this gap by showing that at high southern latitudes, late winter ozone series, covering the 1979 - 2014 period, exhibit an average stratospheric depletion of about 10 - 15...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{samplers}} {{are useful}} tools {{for helping to}} describe the ozone distribution in complex terrain situations. They are also a good complement to continuous monitoring stations. This paper discusses {{the results of a}} pilot study that used ozone passive samplers to describe the spatial and annual temporal distribution of ozone in several forested areas around the city of Madrid. The ozone concentrations around Madrid were found to be higher on the elevated sites located at a certain distance from the city�s urban zone. A <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> cycle was observed, with maximum concentrations found in the basin in late spring or summer depending on the location. The information obtained allowed us to group the locations into four classes. Altitude and distance to the city during the summer and winter explained the observed ozone concentrations. However, during the transition periods, especially in early spring {{and to a lesser extent}} in autumn, there was not a good correlation between ozone levels and elevation or distance from precursor sources. These data strongly suggest that altitudinal gradients for ozone are not always the case in the Madrid Basin...|$|R
