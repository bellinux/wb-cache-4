50|$|Thunder has {{the ability}} to {{increase}} her body's mass while preserving volume, which effectively increases her density. In this state she is near-immovable, almost completely invulnerable. A mob enforcer once suffered a compound fracture after trying to punch Thunder in the face. Notably, she can make her skin strong enough to withstand bullets. Just by <b>stomping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> she can create massive shockwaves.|$|R

5000|$|Khan, {{one of the}} co-writers, {{notes that}} the Tap Griot is {{especially}} important as a backdrop for the character of Chet, who functions as a narrator for the story: [...] "When Chet’s feeling anger or rage, the tap-dancer uses hard heels to <b>stomp</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> However, when he feels a moment of beauty or excitement, the tap dancer can express that, too, in a much different way." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{is known}} from the [...] "Sumerian Farmer's Almanac", after the flood season and after the Spring Equinox and the Akitu or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen <b>stomp</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with pickaxes. After drying, they plowed, harrowed, and raked <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> three times, and {{pulverized}} it with a mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principal crop.|$|R
50|$|Poundcakes (Marian Pouncy) is an ex-convict {{who joined}} the Grapplers despite her record. She was given seismic boots by Roxxon, which enabled her to create shockwaves and tremors by <b>stomping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Slightly overweight, Poundcakes was the strongest member of the Grapplers. After Titania and Letha {{had been killed by}} the Scourge of the Underworld, Poundcakes became a {{freelance}} mercenary. She battled Captain America several times and eventually joined the Femizons, though her stay with Superia was short-lived. She later returned to mercenary work, and rejoined the Grapplers when Titania (now called Lascivious) and Letha were resurrected by the Hood.|$|R
50|$|Stompa is {{a massive}} woman and the strongest member of the Female Furies, she has super-strength and durability. She uses her anti-matter boots to crush her victims, and can create {{earthquakes}} or tremors by <b>stomping</b> onto <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Battletoads in Battlemaniacs also {{features}} a handful of bonus stages in which the player can earn extra lives. These stages appear after the second and fifth stages, respectively, and feature Rash or Pimple on a circular disc as the screen scrolls to the right, allowing the player to collect red and blue colored bowling pins and avoid the black ones. In addition, the game features a handful of boss fights, ranging from a massive stone pig named Rocky, who jumps high in <b>the</b> air and <b>stomps</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> to <b>the</b> Dark Queen herself, who teleports around her tower and shoots magic missiles at the player.|$|R
5000|$|Marian Pouncy {{was born}} in Garden City, New Jersey. She began {{her career as a}} {{professional}} wrestler known as Poundcakes, until she was imprisoned for extortion. There, she met Screaming Mimi, and told her about her teammates in the Grapplers. After they escaped from prison, they rejoined Poundcakes' teammates Letha and Titania. The group was then contracted by the Roxxon Oil Company to become professional criminals, and given special powers by the Power Broker. Poundcakes was given superhuman strength along with her teammates, but also a pair of [...] "seismatic boots", which gives her the ability to create tremors and minor earthquakes by <b>stomping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

50|$|In prehistoric times, buffalo herds {{wandering}} through the area stopped {{in the shade of}} the cypress grove, pawing and <b>stomping</b> at <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Eventually a depression in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> formed from <b>the</b> buffalos. The grove, called a trou de taureau in Cajun French, or “bull hole,” began to retain water and form a pond.|$|R
5000|$|The flank gland {{is located}} {{laterally}} {{on each side}} of the abdomen. It is often present in both males and females, though this varies by species, and is usually larger in males. In some species, self-scratching of the flank gland, typically with a hind foot, causes secretion of an oily substance that leaves the surrounding hair visibly matted and emits a chemical odor. [...] These chemicals vary in composition within the same species as well as within an individual as it progresses through sexual maturity. [...] Scent marking via secretions of the flank gland has been observed: for example, some male microtene rodents will perform “drum-marking,” in which they repeatedly scratch their flank gland with their foot and proceed to <b>stomp</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> several times.|$|R
5|$|Link can {{transform}} at will into different creatures: the Deku Mask transforms Link into a Deku Scrub, the Goron Mask into a Goron, and the Zora Mask into a Zora. Each form features unique abilities: Deku Link can perform a spin attack, shoot bubbles from his mouth, skip on water, and fly {{for a short}} time by launching from Deku Flowers; Goron Link can roll at high speeds (and grow spikes at higher speeds), punch with deadly force, <b>stomp</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with his massive, rock-like body, walk in lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim rapidly, throw boomerang-like fins from his arms, generate a force field, and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water. Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities.|$|R
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on plant matter and animals both {{on land and}} in water. It eats prey such as beetles, millipedes, and slugs. Also, wood turtles consume {{specific}} fungi (Amanita muscaria and Leccinum arcolatum), mosses, grasses, various insects, and also carrion. On occasion, {{it can be seen}} <b>stomping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with alternating hits of the left and right front feet. This behavior is thought to imitate the sound of falling rain, sometimes causing earthworms to rise to the surface where they quickly become easy prey. When hunting, the wood turtle pokes its head into such areas as dead and decaying logs, the bottoms of bushes, and in other vegetation. In the water, it exhibits similar behavior, searching algae beds and cavities along the sides of the stream or river.|$|R

50|$|Though they {{mate and}} {{reproduce}} year-round, sambar calving peaks seasonally. Oestrus lasts around eighteen days. The male establishes a territory {{from which he}} attracts nearby females, {{but he does not}} establish a harem. <b>The</b> male <b>stomps</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> creating a bare patch, and often wallows in the mud, perhaps to accentuate the colour of his hair, which is typically darker than that of females. While they have been heard to make a loud coarse bellow, rutting stags are generally not vocal. Large dominant stags will defend non-exclusive territories surrounded by several smaller males which they have bonded and formed alliances with through sparring. When sparring with rival males, sambar lock antlers and push, like other deer, but, uniquely, they also sometimes stand on their hind legs and clash downward into each other {{in a manner similar to}} species of goat-antelope. Females also fight on their hind legs and use their forelegs to hit each other in the head.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{explanation}} {{involves the}} etymology {{of the word}} Nebuta (ねぶた). Aterui (阿弖流為), a general from the Tohoku region, united the Emishi {{people who had been}} chased out of their native territory and defeated Ki no Kosami's army of 50,000 at Kitakami River to advance all the way to Fuji, Shizuoka. This army battled Sakanoue no Tamuramaro's forces for over 12 years, but was ultimately defeated. Aterui was captured and taken to Osaka Prefecture, where he was granted an audience with the ruler before being beheaded. Aterui's severed head was shown off to the public, and his family and followers still remaining in the Tohoku region were forced to dig large holes where they were buried alive. Dirt was thrown over these graves, and those who surrendered to the Japanese forces and became slaves were instructed to <b>stomp</b> over <b>the</b> dirt. This event {{is said to be the}} origin of Nebuta (written [...] "根蓋" [...] in kanji), as Aterui's followers were sent back to their roots or to the world of the dead (...) with the dirt as a covering (...) [...] According to this episode, <b>the</b> dancers <b>stomp</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> while carrying <b>the</b> float of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro on their shoulders.|$|R
50|$|According to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Zarda {{possesses}} superhuman {{strength as}} well as superhuman agility, extremely retarded aging (though in the Exiles series, she states {{that she does not}} age at all), and superhuman durability that falls just short of making her bulletproof. This durability was sufficient enough to take blows from the likes of Redstone, though a shock wave produced by Redstone <b>stomping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> did scramble her insides for a short period and prevented her from standing. Power Princess also proved resilient enough to withstand three of Hyperion's blows that were redirected toward her by Inertia before being rendered unconscious. Zarda is also able to fly, presumably through psionic levitation. In addition to her superhuman abilities, Zarda carries a transparent shield of Utopian design that can block attacks up to tank shells and can be used to redirect energy. In addition, Zarda can throw the shield in a similar manner to Captain America, but given her superior strength, its edges are able to slice through metal.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{calling the}} monster a [...] "bozo", Xykon has implied {{that it is}} powerful. Its power is {{verified}} when it is confronted by Miko Miyazaki. When Miko hits the monster with a full round of attacks, while both Roy and Hinjo were previously severely injured by such attacks, the Monster said the attacks merely tickled. It then challenges her to a game of [...] "Who Can Hit the Lightest", but subsequently loses by knocking Miko and her horse through a wall and several miles further. That the monster actually was trying to hit her lightly is confirmed by its disappointment at having lost. When angered, its shout produces a shockwave powerful enough to blow both Haley and Belkar off their feet, intimidating them into making a trade of stew for the bodies of Roy and O-Chul, rather than taking {{them away from the}} Monster's tea party. Shortly afterward, as Haley and Belkar escape with Roy's corpse and O-Chul, <b>the</b> monster <b>stomps</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at <b>the</b> direction of one of the Demon Cockroaches, which results in a massive, ground-cracking earthquake. Despite the fact that the monster causes the earthquake without any acknowledged effort on its part, it feels tired and hungry after having done so.

5000|$|The Gargantua, nicknamed [...] "Garg", is a {{gigantic}} upright creature that can crush opponents with fire and sheer force. It is mostly blue in color, has a crocodile-like head, a thick back plating which resembles an armadillo, and has one yellow eye that glows red when it perceives a hostile unit. In place of hands, {{it has two}} claw like appendages which can be opened to emit jets of intense heat. These claw weapons are designed to open vertically, not horizontally. Though the flamethrower weapon is short-ranged, it is still effective, known to blow up machinery, as in Half-Life: Uplink. Gargantuas can make loud roars that can damage structures. An example of the loud roars is in Uplink, near the ending sequence before the player gets trapped, the creature's loud roar makes a vent that the player is crawling through collapse. It can also send a shock wave towards its opponents by powerfully <b>stomping</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This shock wave, which appears as a red dot that shoots red sparks behind it, increases in speed as it travels and can traverse vertical structures. The Gargantua moves fast and is very strong: it can smash or toss large obstacles from its path with ease. Gargantuas are very determined pursuers, and wait patiently for their target {{to come out of}} an area they cannot reach for a considerable amount of time before moving on to do something else.|$|R
