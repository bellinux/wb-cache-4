5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Constructor, Sir Edward Reed, was ill so {{the design}} of this ship was {{entrusted}} to his assistant and brother-in-law, Nathaniel Barnaby, himself a future Chief Constructor. For reasons that have not survived, the Admiralty required that Penelope to be a ship of unusually <b>shallow</b> <b>draught,</b> possibly {{in light of the}} operations in the shallow Baltic Sea during the Crimean War of 1854–55.|$|E

5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for whom it provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E
5|$|HMS Penelope was a central-battery ironclad {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the late 1860s and was rated as an {{armoured}} corvette. She was designed for inshore work with a <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> and this severely compromised her performance under sail. Completed in 1868, the ship spent the next year with the Channel Fleet before she {{was assigned to the}} First Reserve Squadron in 1869 and became the coast guard ship for Harwich until 1887. Penelope was mobilised as tensions with Russia rose during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and participated in the Bombardment of Alexandria during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882. The ship became a receiving ship in South Africa in 1888 and then a prison hulk in 1897. She was sold for scrap in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of £196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part of the Particular Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of June–August 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five years service at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South Africa, as a receiving ship the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 for the price of £1,650. The ship was broken up at Genoa, Italy, in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Navigation by {{powered craft}} is {{prohibited}} beyond {{the entrance to}} Llangollen Marina and the final section is used only by the horse drawn trip boats. British Waterways maintains a gravel shoal immediately upstream of the marina entrance past Llangollen Wharf. This maintains a draught which most narrowboats cannot pass, but which is passable by the <b>shallow</b> <b>draughted</b> trip boats.|$|R
50|$|Leighton {{decides to}} cover both {{possibilities}} by detaching one ship {{to patrol the}} French coast. When he learns that Hornblower's Sutherland is best suited for this task, having the <b>shallowest</b> <b>draught,</b> he becomes suspicious that Hornblower is after glory and prize money. Leighton therefore expressly forbids Hornblower from taking any independent action if he sights the French.|$|R
50|$|By the 1840s the West Africa Squadron {{had begun}} {{receiving}} paddle steamers such as , which proved superior {{in many ways}} to the sailing ships they replaced. The steamers were independent {{of the wind and}} their <b>shallow</b> <b>draughts</b> meant they could patrol the shallow shores and rivers. In the middle of the 19th century, there were around 25 vessels and 2,000 personnel with a further 1,000 local sailors involved in the effort.|$|R
25|$|Speed and draught: {{pilots were}} in competition, {{with each other}} and the weather. The speed and {{relatively}} <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> allowed them access throughout a range of tides.|$|E
25|$|The new Shuntiens engines were steam {{turbines}} built by Taikoo Dockyard. She {{was built to}} trade {{along the coast of}} China, where her relatively <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> enabled her to turn in the Hai River at Tianjin and her icebreaker bow equipped her against sea ice in northern waters.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there were}} smaller oared vessels, {{such as the}} navis actuaria, with 30 oars (15 on each bank), a ship {{primarily}} used for transport in coastal and fluvial operations, for which its <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> and flat keel were ideal. In late Antiquity, it was succeeded in this role by the navis lusoria ("playful ship"), which was extensively used for patrols and raids by the legionary flotillas in the Rhine and Danube frontiers.|$|E
50|$|Charles's first {{design of}} note was the Redwing class. The Bembridge sailing club met in October 1896 to agree {{the need for}} a <b>shallow</b> <b>draughted</b> yacht - to allow for the shoal waters of Bembridge Harbour - which could be sailed single-handed, to replace the {{expensive}} half racers. Charles designed the yacht in ten days, and by 1898 the fleet consisted of 16 boats, all built by C&N's yard.|$|R
50|$|Humaytá {{was ordered}} by the Brazilian navy as a deep-diving submarine. Modifications to the {{standard}} Ballila design include {{the placement of the}} diesel and electric motors further forward, the elimination of the bow planes and a different distribution of the ballast tanks throughout the submarine. The submarine was longer at 87 m with a <b>shallower</b> <b>draught,</b> 4 m. The vessel displaced 1,390 tons surfaced and 1,884 tons submerged.|$|R

25|$|Cymric was an iron schooner. She had a <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> of only 10.8 feet, three wooden masts, no poop deck, a flaring bow, a round counter-stern {{and very}} square yards on her fore mast. She {{was built by}} the Thomas yard for their own fleet. Her early days, under Captain Robert Jones, were spent in the South American trade running from Runcorn to Gibraltar {{and on to the}} Rio Grande, docking at the Brazilian port of Porto Alegre. In 1906 she was sold to Captain Richard Hall of Arklow.|$|E
25|$|Cymric was {{witness to}} a sad event that would change the way lighthouses and lightships are {{administered}} in Ireland. At the time, they were directly controlled from the UK by Trinity House, who removed a lightship from the Arklow Bank. On 19 February 1931, the Julia en route from Glasgow to Newhaven, grounded on the Arklow Bank and was wrecked {{with the loss of}} the crew of five, two of whom were from Arklow. Cymric, with her <b>shallow</b> <b>draught,</b> discovered the tragedy two days later. It became a political issue. In 1935, the 'Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order' was made. It is the legislative basis for the Commissioners of Irish Lights.|$|E
25|$|Navigation through Lincoln {{and on to}} Boston was {{hampered}} by the <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> available under the medieval High Bridge, just below Brayford Pool. Sir Joseph Banks, when proposing {{the construction of the}} Horncastle Canal knew that the problem needed addressing, and William Jessop was commissioned to survey the Witham and the Fossdyke in 1791, with particular reference to the junction between the two. He proposed a bypass to the south of the city, using the Sincil Dyke, or excavating the channel beneath the bridge, although he recognized that this solution was not ideal, due to the narrow width of the bridge hole, and the lack of a towing path through it. However, the city was keen to keep trade within its limits, and improvements to High Bridge, which were completed by 1795, were authorised as part of the Horncastle Canal act of 1792.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, the Spanish {{sent the}} two ships with a <b>shallower</b> <b>draught</b> {{to find a}} safe approach through the shallows. The caravels anchored about one league from the shore. Ten large canoes powered by both sails and oars rowed out to meet the Spanish ships. Over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards. The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads, and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day.|$|R
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a <b>shallower</b> <b>draught</b> and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|R
50|$|Aike Beck {{joined the}} River Hull 0.4 mi above its {{junction}} with the Leven Canal. Navigable {{for no more}} than 2 mi from the river, its main function was to carry coal, and it had two canal locks taking craft of 40 feet by 8 feet 10 inches (12 m x 2.7 m). One was an entrance lock where the Beck joined the River Hull, and the other was about halfway along the navigation. Below the middle lock, Aike Beck was enlarged, while above it, the course of the navigation was made much straighter than the original course of the beck. Coal and agricultural fertiliser was transferred from keel boats to the smaller, <b>shallow</b> <b>draughted</b> boats used on the navigation, and hauled by horse or manpower to Lockington wharf.|$|R
25|$|Small two-decked warships, usually classed as fourth rates {{had largely}} {{fallen out of}} favour by {{the second half of}} the eighteenth century, and by the end of the century even the smaller third rates of 64 guns were being phased out. The American War of Independence led to a revival in the concept of the smaller two decked designs, as their <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> but comparably heavy {{armament}} compared to frigates, made them suitable for coastal warfare in the shallow waters of the North American coastline. The Roebuck class was a revival of a 1769 design by Sir Thomas Slade, with nineteen ships ordered to the design during the war, and classed as fifth rates, but not as frigates, as they carried their main armament on two decks, rather than one. Mediator was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Thomas Raymond, of Northam, on 3 December 1779. She was laid down there in July 1780 and was launched on 30 March 1782.|$|E
25|$|SS Keno {{continued}} {{to operate in}} commercial service within the Yukon watershed for almost 30 years. In addition to her work on the Stewart River, her <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> and smaller dimensions meant that she was often pressed into service on the main Whitehorse–Dawson route early in the season, when parts of the river were narrowed by ice. In 1942 the Keno was used to transport US Army men and equipment during construction of the Alaska Highway. She was retired in 1951 after completion, extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway made road transport the cheapest and preferred method for moving goods and people around the territory. The Keno was laid up on the ways at the shipyard in Whitehorse, {{on the banks of}} the Yukon River, where she was joined by many of the surviving sternwheeler fleet a few years later after the BYN Co. ceased paddle steamer operations completely in 1955.|$|E
25|$|On completion, Cerberus was {{registered}} as a merchant vessel for the voyage to Australia. For the journey, {{the sides of}} the hull were built up to the height of the breastwork and {{along the length of the}} ship, to improve seakeeping. She first attempted to sail from Chatham for Melbourne on 29 October 1870, but returned within days because of gale conditions, which made the ship uncontrollable. After returning to British waters, Cerberus was fitted with temporary masts so she could be rigged as a three-masted barque; this was to provide redundancy to the steam engines, and maximise her range before recoaling was required. Cerberus departed for a second time on 7 November, and despite similar conditions, was able to persevere. The ship travelled via the Suez Canal (during which she flew the flag of Victoria instead of the Red Ensign so reduced transit rates for warships could be claimed), with frequent stops to refuel wherever possible because of her ten-day bunker capacity. Her flat bottom and <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> meant that the monitor could roll up to 40° from the centreline in bad weather. Her ship's company nearly mutinied on several occasions.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a <b>shallower</b> <b>draught,</b> a necessity in the shallow waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|R
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of <b>shallow</b> <b>draught</b> so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E
500|$|To {{design and}} build his ship Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading {{shipbuilder}} and naval architect. Archer was well known for a particular hull design that combined seaworthiness with a <b>shallow</b> <b>draught,</b> and had pioneered the design of [...] "double-ended" [...] craft in which the conventional stern {{was replaced by a}} point, increasing manoeuvrability. [...] Nansen records that Archer made [...] "plan after plan of the projected ship; one model after another was prepared and abandoned". Finally, agreement was reached on a design, and on 9 June 1891 the two men signed the contract.|$|E
500|$|The Courageous class {{comprised}} three battlecruisers, {{known as}} [...] "large light cruisers", that were nominally designed to support Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Fisher's Baltic Project, which {{was intended to}} land troops on the German Baltic Coast. The ships of this class were fast but very lightly armoured {{with only a few}} heavy guns. They were given a <b>shallow</b> <b>draught,</b> in part to allow them to operate in the shallow waters of the Baltic but also reflecting experience gained earlier in the war. To maximize their speed, the Courageous class were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers. This made them the fastest capital ships in existence, slightly faster than even the Renown-class ships.|$|E
25|$|The two {{stations}} were remote from Appledore where the crews lived. With {{the development of}} boats that could be more easily sailed (rather than just rowed) a new boat house was built at Badstep in 1889 to replace Northam Burrows. During World War I it became difficult to find the horses and men necessary for launching boats at Braunton Burrows so it too was closed temporarily in 1918 but this became permanent the following year. The first motor lifeboat arrived on station in 1922. In 1938 a , the Violet Armstrong, replaced the earlier, smaller, boat {{and had to be}} kept moored afloat as it did not fit in the boat house. Instead a small boarding boat was kept in it and used to ferry the crew out to the lifeboat. The new lifeboat had a <b>shallower</b> <b>draught</b> than was usual for a Watson Class and also had her stern strengthened, both modifications to help crossing the shallow water {{at the mouth of the}} estuary.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually, {{with only}} one Spanish soldier {{remaining}} unhurt, the captain practically unconscious, and the aggression of the Indians only increasing, they decided then that their only recourse was to form a close phalanx and break out of their encirclement {{in the direction of}} the launches, and to return to board them [...] leaving behind the water jugs [...] and get back to the ships. Fortunately for them, the Indians hadn't concerned themselves to take away the boats or to render them useless, as they might easily have done. When attacking the retreating boats with arrows, stones, and pikes they made a particular effort to interfere with their balance by weight and impact, and ended up dumping some of the Spaniards into the water. The survivors of Hernández's men had to get quickly out to their ships, half swimming and hanging onto the edges of the launches, but in the end they were recovered by the boat with the <b>shallowest</b> <b>draught,</b> and reached safety.|$|R
