5|$|The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> is the 2008 third studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. After independently releasing his 2004 album Ray Ray, Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects {{and developed a}} partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> primarily at his North Hollywood studio with the engineer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the court}} gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, Hamlet looks on glumly. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet {{resolves}} to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To <b>see</b> <b>it</b> after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E

5|$|Candide, the impressionable and incompetent {{student of}} Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and {{eventually}} despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would <b>see</b> <b>it)</b> of his optimism.|$|E

They planned to get married in fancy dress and Speight joked that the wedding might feature monkeys, his favourite animal.|$|E

60|$|On a Sunday {{afternoon}} of late autumn {{they walked down}} to Lake Minniemashie.

5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} weapons nor chemical weapons, {{nor did they}} <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as {{in their interest to}} acquire them. Thus the banning of such weapons was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} {{painted on the}} {{aircraft}} on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th.

5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} {{the ball on}} the left flank, and played a ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal. Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury to be replaced by defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} {{has drawn}} {{a number of}} interpretations. Ludwig Justi sees the old oak {{as a symbol of}} the German people, rooted in the landscape; Jens Christian Jensen <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a link between the past and the present; and Charlotte Margarethe de Prybram-Gladona <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a symbol of loneliness.|$|R

5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will <b>see</b> <b>it</b> conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alien {{opened in}} American theaters on May 25, 1979.

In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.|$|E
