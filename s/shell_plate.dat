50|$|Most land slugs have, {{within the}} mantle, the {{remnants}} or residue of what was, in the evolutionary past, a larger external shell. In most slugs, this remnant {{takes the form}} either of a small internal shell (a thin shelly plate), or a collection of calcareous (chalky) granules. In this species there is an internal shell or <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> which resembles that found in land slugs of the genus Limax. In other words, the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> in this species is oval in shape, solid, and chalky, with a transparent conchiolin (horny) base. The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> is usually somewhat convex above and concave beneath, with a few indistinct concentric lines of growth, and is covered outwardly with a very thin transparent periostracum (a protein layer), and with the nucleus (the oldest growth part) situated near the front. In young Kerry slugs the shell is very thin and convex, abruptly cut off behind, and with an extremely thin layer that projects in front and contains minute granules.|$|E

50|$|The pancake {{tortoise}} has an unusually thin, flat, flexible shell, which {{is up to}} 17.8 cm long. While the shell bones of most other tortoises are solid, the {{pancake tortoise}} has shell bones with many openings, making it lighter and more agile than other tortoises. The carapace (top shell) is brown, frequently with a variable pattern of radiating dark lines on each scute (<b>shell</b> <b>plate),</b> helping to camouflage the tortoise in its natural dry habitat. The plastron (bottom shell) is pale yellow with dark brown seams and light yellow rays, and the head, limbs and tail are yellow-brown. Its bizarre, flattened, pancake-like profile makes this tortoise a sought-after animal in zoological and private collections, leading to its over-exploitation in the wild.|$|E

50|$|Chitons have a shell {{composed}} of eight separate <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> or valves. These plates overlap slightly {{at the front}} and back edges, and yet articulate well with one another. Because of this, the shell provides protection {{at the same time as}} permitting the chiton to flex upward when needed for locomotion over uneven surfaces, and even allows the animal to curl up into a ball when dislodged from rocks. The <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> are encircled by a skirt known as a girdle.|$|R
40|$|By {{evolving}} bilaterally separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> bivalves {{acquired a}} unique body plan {{in which their}} soft tissues are completely protected by hard <b>shell</b> <b>plates.</b> In this unique body plan, mobility between the separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> is provided by novel structures such as a ligament and adductor muscles. As a first step towards understanding how the bivalve body plan was established, we investigated {{the development of the}} separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> and ligament. Over 100 years ago, it was hypothesized that the development of separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> is tightly linked with the unique cell cleavage (division) pattern of bivalves during development, wherein each bilateral daughter cell of the 2 d descendant 2 d 1121 develops into one of the bilateral shell fields. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by tracing the cell lineages of the Japanese purple mussel Septifer virgatus. Although the shell fields were found to be exclusively derived from the bilateral descendant cells of 2 d: 2 d 11211 and 2 d 11212, the descendants of these cells were not restricted to shell fields alone, nor were they confined to the left or right side of the shell field based on their lineage. Our study demonstrated that ligament cells are also derived from 2 d 11211 and 2 d 11212, indicating that the ligament cells emerged as a subpopulation of shell field cells. This also suggests that the establishment of the novel developmental system for the ligament cells was critical for the evolution of the unique body plan of bivalves...|$|R
5000|$|The animals {{looked like}} slugs in chain mail - 1.5 cm to 8 cm long, bilaterally symmetric, {{flattened}} {{from top to}} bottom and unarmored on the bottom. Very near each end there is a <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> with prominent growth lines rather like the growth rings of trees. The rest of the upper surface was covered with about 2,000 sclerites that overlapped each other like tiles and formed three zones with sclerites of different shapes: [...] "palmates", shaped rather like maple leaves, ran along the center of the back between the shell plates; blade-shaped [...] "cultrates" [...] lay {{on either side of the}} palmates and pointing towards the middle of the upper surface; and slim, sickle-shaped [...] "siculates" [...] covered the outer edges. The sclerites bore a wide central cavity, and (at least in some specimens) finer lateral canals. As the animals grew, the shell plates grew by adding material to the outer edges. Individual sclerites stayed the same size; since the cultrate sclerites form a pattern that is constant in all fairly complete specimens, the old ones that were too small may have been shed and replaced by larger ones as the animals grew. The sclerites seem to have grown by basal secretion. There are traces of thin ribs between the sclerites and the skin.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{operculum}} {{is a novel}} {{structure in}} gastropod molluscs. Because the operculum shows notable similarities to the <b>shell</b> <b>plate,</b> we asked whether there were an evolutionary link between these two secretory organs. We found {{that some of the}} genes involved in shell-field development are expressed in the operculum, such as dpp and grainyhead, whereas engrailed and Hox 1 are not. Specific knockdown of dpp by injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulted in malformation of the <b>shell</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> was smaller due to failure of activation of cell proliferation in the shell-field margin. The expressions of grainyhead and chitin synthase 1 in the shell field margin were suppressed by dpp-dsRNA. However, matrix secretion was not completely abolished, and the expressions of ferritin, engrailed or Hox 1 were not affected by dpp-dsRNA, indicating that dpp is partly involved in the developmental pathway for shell matrix secretion. We also present evidence that dpp performs a key role in operculum development. Indeed, dpp-dsRNA impaired matrix secretion in the operculum as well as expression of grainyhead. Based on these observations that dpp is important for development of both the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> and operculum, we conclude that co-option of dpp to the posterior part of the foot contributed to the innovation of the operculum in gastropods...|$|E

5000|$|Short and stubby icebreakers are {{generally}} built using transverse framing {{in which the}} <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> is stiffened with frames placed about 400 to 1000 mm apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships. Near the waterline, the frames running in vertical direction distribute the local ice loads on the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> to longitudinal girders called stringers, which in turn are supported by web frames and bulkheads that carry the global hull loads. While the <b>shell</b> <b>plating,</b> which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight.

40|$|Although {{bivalves}} develop through spiral cleavage patterns, {{similar to}} other lophotrochozoans, the cleavage pattern of D lineage blastomeres is unique, since 2 d shows four rounds of stereotypic unequal cleavage before bilateral cleavage of the largest derivative of 2 d: 2 d 1121. This unique modification of spiral cleavage is directly associated with the characteristic morphology of bivalves, namely, bilaterally separated <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> because the bilateral <b>shell</b> <b>plates</b> {{are thought to be}} derived from the bilateral derivatives of 2 d 1121. In this report, to determine whether the unique cleavage pattern of bivalves is regulated depending on the interaction with other cells or by cell autonomous mechanisms, we performed cell isolation experiments and observed subsequent cleavage patterns of isolated blastomeres. When focusing on the largest derivatives of D blastomeres, 8 % of isolated D blastomeres followed the cleavage pattern of normal development up to bilateral cleavage. Importantly, the remainder of the partial embryos ended cleavage before that stage, and none of the isolated blastomeres showed abnormal cleavage patterns. We also examined the development of isolated blastomeres and found that isolated D blastomeres could develop <b>shell</b> <b>plates,</b> whereas larvae developed from AB blastomeres never had <b>shell</b> <b>plates.</b> Based on these observations, we concluded that D blastomeres control their unique cleavage pattern through intrinsic mechanisms and develop shell glands autonomously without any cell–cell interaction with other lineages...|$|R
