5|$|The miraculous {{story of}} the first known parishioner of the town, Bricstan, is {{documented}} in the Historia Ecclesiastica by the Chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – c.1142). According to the legend, Bricstan was a pious free tenant from the town who had joined the monastery at Ely Cathedral in 1115 to begin training as a monk. However, {{he was accused of}} theft and imprisoned in London. The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of Saint Etheldreda coming towards him, and as if by a miracle, his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer. When he awoke from his dream, he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains. The wife of Henry I, Matilda of Scotland, heard of the miracle, and <b>she</b> <b>assured</b> herself that he was no rogue or thief, issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man.|$|E
5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. <b>She</b> <b>assured</b> Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). <b>She</b> <b>assured</b> him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.

500|$|In 1916, Coolbrith sent {{copies of}} her poetry {{collections}} to her cousin Joseph F.

500|$|On 30 June, the [...] "Immortal Seven" [...] {{secretly}} requested William—then in the Dutch Republic with Mary—to come to England with an army to depose James. William {{had made}} known earlier that a military intervention, {{for which he}} had been assembling forces, would be conditional on such an invitation. At first, William was still reluctant; possibly he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared she would become more powerful than he was. According to Gilbert Burnet, however, Mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, and told him [...] "she would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him King for life". She would, <b>she</b> <b>assured</b> him, always obey her husband as she had promised to do in her marriage vows.|$|E
500|$|This highly nuanced {{and largely}} {{theatrical}} letter was unsigned, {{but she had}} included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems. He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. <b>She</b> <b>assured</b> him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not [...] "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her [...] "not to read them– because he fears they joggle the Mind".|$|E

500|$|Of all of Sherwood's evangelically themed books, The History of the Fairchild Family was {{the most}} popular. When she {{published}} it with John Hatchard of Piccadilly, <b>she</b> <b>assured</b> it and the ten other books she published with him a [...] "social distinction" [...] not attached to her other publications. The Fairchild Family {{tells the story of}} a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also the right earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting are immoral). The overarching narrative of the tale also includes a series of tract-like stories which illustrate these moral lessons. For example, stories of the deaths of two neighborhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to look to the state of their own hearts. The faithful and [...] "true" [...] Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience, suggesting that he was saved; by contrast, the heedless and disobedient Augusta burns up while playing with candles and is presumably damned. Unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes, such as Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Sherwood domesticated her story—actions in the children's day-to-day lives, such as stealing fruit, are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Each chapter also includes prayers and hymns (by Philip Doddridge, Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and Ann and Jane Taylor, among others) that are thematically linked to it.|$|E
2500|$|Although Hitchens {{thought he}} was the only witness called by the Vatican, Aroup Chatterjee (author of Mother Teresa: The Untold Story) was also called to present {{evidence}} opposing Teresa's beatification and canonisation; the Vatican had abolished the traditional [...] "devil's advocate", which served a similar purpose. Hitchens said that [...] "her intention was not to help people", and she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. [...] "It was by talking to her that I discovered, and <b>she</b> <b>assured</b> me, that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty", he said, [...] "She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, 'I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for this reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church.|$|E

The release was sent to several alternative rock radio stations in the Boston area. Hole spokesperson Gayle Fine and Don Law public relations director Pamela Fallon challenged the announcement. Fine did not guarantee that Hole {{would be on the}} tour after March 14, 1999, but <b>she</b> <b>assured</b> ticket holders that the band would perform at the March 13, 1999 concert at The Pond and The Forum. News of Hole's possible departure put the future of the tour into question among industry experts.

2500|$|In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted {{a dinner}} {{to raise money}} for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France.

On gaining admission to the bishop in Mexico City later that day, Juan Diego opened his mantle, the flowers poured to the floor, and the bishop saw they had left on the mantle an imprint of the Virgin's image which he immediately venerated.|$|E

The statement continued, [...] "They could care for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there.
