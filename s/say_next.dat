500|$|Oxenfrees {{gameplay}} {{is built}} around the [...] "walk and talk". Instead of dialogue occurring during cutscenes, speech bubbles appear over Alex's head, allowing the player to choose between two or three options what Alex will <b>say</b> <b>next</b> in the conversation. At the same time, Alex remains free to move around and navigate the game world. Players can select dialogue options {{at any time during}} conversations, choosing to wait for other characters to finish, choosing to interrupt, or remaining silent. Certain dialogue options cause a thought bubble with Alex inside it to appear over characters' heads, suggesting that the player's choice may have had an effect on the characters' relationship.|$|E
2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to <b>say</b> <b>next,</b> so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E

50|$|Putative counterexamples {{to the law}} of {{excluded}} middle include the liar paradox or Quine's Paradox. Certain resolutions of these paradoxes, particularly Graham Priest's dialetheism as formalised in LP, have the law of {{excluded middle}} as a theorem, but resolve out the Liar as both true and false. In this way, the law of excluded middle is true, but because truth itself, and therefore disjunction, is not exclusive, it <b>says</b> <b>next</b> to nothing if one of the disjuncts is paradoxical, or both true and false.|$|R
