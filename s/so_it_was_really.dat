Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> difficult for me to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E

2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E
