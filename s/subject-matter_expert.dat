40|$|E-learning storyboards {{have been}} a useful {{approach}} in distance learning development to support interaction between instructional designers and <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts.</b> Current works show that researchers are focusing on different approaches for use in storyboards, and there is less emphasis {{on the effect of}} design and process difficulties faced by instructional designers and <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts.</b> This study explores problem aspects of the cognitive task and the skills required of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts</b> by applying a cognitive task analysis approach from the expert point of view. The result shows that <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts</b> face difficulties in making decisions on three elements during e-learning course development. The three elements are storyboard templates, prescriptive interactive components, and review process. It is found that the representation skills and decision making of the three elements allows <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts</b> to decide on alternatives of the task process. The result also indicates {{that it is important to}} leverage the design and process skills of <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts</b> as it affects their interaction with instructional designers. Three recommendations are made: training development, prescriptive interactive components development, and interaction design document development. A new framework can be recommended to train <b>subject-matter</b> <b>experts</b> as e-learning storyboard users, and in turn provide for effective interaction between them and instructional designers.
