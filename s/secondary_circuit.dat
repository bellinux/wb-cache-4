25|$|Coupling {{transformers}} {{were difficult}} to adjust, because the three adjustments, the tuning of the primary circuit, the tuning of the <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit,</b> and the coupling of the coils, were all interactive, and changing one affected the others.|$|E
25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the primary circuit by {{powerful}} pumps. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the primary coolant transfers heat in a steam generator to water in a lower pressure <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit,</b> evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam — in most designs 6.2MPa (60atm, 900psia), 275°C (530°F) — {{for use in the}} steam turbine. The cooled primary coolant is then returned to the reactor vessel to be heated again.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit,</b> the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} simple equivalent circuits {{which enables}} calculation of expected values of transverse interference voltages on various <b>secondary</b> <b>circuits</b> at Substations.

25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit.</b> Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 {{a second}} reactor, R2, was bought from the United States under {{bilateral}} safeguards. A third reactor, {{better known as}} Ågesta, {{was designed as a}} dual-use facility to produce electricity and a small amount of plutonium in a crisis. In 1957, FOA suggested using Ågesta to produce a small number of weapons quickly. A fourth power reactor, Marviken, was set to produce larger quantities of nuclear fuel for an arsenal of 100 weapons. In May 1957, the Supreme Commander gave FOA the task of carrying out a new study of the possibilities to produce nuclear weapons focused on the plutonium option. Marviken was located approximately 150km away from Stockholm. Initially it was designed as 100 MW pressurized heavy water reactor that had a <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit,</b> where steam is produced from plain water. In the meantime, parallel to the pressurized reactor, a larger and more complicated design of reactor was under way. The alternative construction included superheating mechanism, internal reshuffling machine, and a complex process of boiling water, which ultimately complicated design and raised serious concerns.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary circuit}} {{refers to the}} incomes and {{products}} generated and distributed from productive activity (reflected by GDP). The <b>secondary</b> <b>circuits</b> refer to trade, transfers and transactions occurring outside that sphere, which can also generate incomes, and these incomes may also involve the realisation of a surplus-value or profit.|$|R
50|$|Planning {{started in}} 1960 and {{construction}} occurred between 1961 and 1965. In March 1965 the reactor was commissioned and initially operated at 6.75 MW, a limitation {{imposed by the}} capacity of the <b>secondary</b> cooling <b>circuit.</b> Output was increased to 20 MW in 1968 after the <b>secondary</b> cooling <b>circuit</b> was upgraded.|$|R
2500|$|To {{produce the}} largest output voltage, {{the primary and}} {{secondary}} tuned circuits are adjusted to resonance with each other. [...] Since the <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit</b> is usually not adjustable, this is generally done by an adjustable tap on [...] the primary coil. [...] If the two coils were separate, the resonant frequencies of the primary and secondary circuits, [...] and , would {{be determined by the}} inductance and capacitance in each circuit ...|$|E
2500|$|Ordinary {{transformers}} {{are designed}} to be [...] "tightly coupled". Due to the iron core and close proximity of the windings, they have a high mutual inductance (M), the coupling coefficient is close to unity 0.95 - 1.0, which means almost all the magnetic field of the primary winding passes through the secondary. The Tesla transformer in contrast is [...] "loosely coupled", the primary winding is larger in diameter and spaced apart from the secondary, so the mutual inductance is lower and the coupling coefficient is only 0.05 to 0.2. This means that only 5% to 20% of the magnetic field of the primary coil passes through the secondary when it is open circuited. The loose coupling slows the exchange of energy between the primary and secondary coils, which allows the oscillating energy to stay in the <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit</b> longer before it returns to the primary and begins dissipating in the spark.|$|E
50|$|Usually, a {{transformer}} is placed {{between the lines}} and consumption. When a high-voltage, low-intensity current in the primary circuit (before the transformer) is converted into a low-voltage, high-intensity current in the <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit</b> (after the transformer), the equivalent resistance of the <b>secondary</b> <b>circuit</b> becomes higher and transmission losses are reduced in proportion.|$|E
50|$|Where M is the mutual inductance of the {{circuits}} and Lp and Ls are the inductances of {{the primary}} and <b>secondary</b> <b>circuits,</b> respectively. If the flux lines {{of the primary}} inductor thread every line of the secondary one, then the coefficient of coupling is 1 and  In practice, however, there is often leakage, so most systems are not perfectly coupled.|$|R
30|$|Under the {{construction}} of smart substation, relay protection technology is undergoing a thorough and extensive reform. The last similar reform was occurred in 1990 when the microcomputer-based protection was developed {{to be the main}} solution.

In this way, he aimed to reveal the [...] "origin of the wealth of nations" [...] given a capitalist mode of production.
