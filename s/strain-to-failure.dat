40|$|Advanced {{structural}} composites such as {{carbon and}} glass fibre-reinforced polymers {{have a limited}} ductility. This is due to intrinsic brittleness of the high performance fibres. The composite ductility can be enhanced by choosing fibers with a higher <b>strain-to-failure,</b> but most known ductile fibres (e. g. some natural and polymer fibres) have a low stiffness. The aim of this work was to investigate a new fibre type for application in composites  annealed stainless steel fibres. The unique property of these fibres is that they combine a high stiffness (± 193 GPa) with a <b>strain-to-failure</b> which can be tailored up to 20 %. The <b>strain-to-failure</b> {{is as high as}} that of a silk fibre and up to 10 times higher than that of a carbon fibre. An extensive experimental program, supported by modelling investigations, was performed to understand the mechanical behaviour of polymer composites made of these fibres. The influence of the matrix ductility, fibre architecture and interphase properties on the damage development and composite properties was investigated. Additionally steel fibre hybrids in combination with carbon fibres, glass fibres or drawn polypropylene tapes were studied. The ductile steel fibres delivered composites with a high stiffness and a high <b>strain-to-failure.</b> The <b>strain-to-failure</b> can be up to 22 %, which is much higher than a typical carbon and glass fibre composite (10 and 5 times, respectively). Steel fibre composites with ductile matrices showed the highest <b>strain-to-failure</b> and a distinctly different failure behaviour, compared to a steel fibre composite with a brittle matrix. In both cases the <b>strain-to-failure</b> could be further improved using a silane treatment which increased the adhesion strength. By replacing low amounts of steel fibres by carbon or glass fibres, the composite strength increased, but with a significantly lower <b>strain-to-failure.</b> However, the sudden failure which is typical for carbon and glass fibre composites, was not present. Adding steel fibres to self-reinforced polypropylene increased its stiffness and, also its specific stiffness despite the high density of steel. In contrast to hybridisation with a brittle fibre, no loss in <b>strain-to-failure</b> in a tensile test was measured. status: publishe...|$|E

Before they can be used intelligently in engineering applications, the capabilities and limitations of these properties must be well understood. This research measured the <b>strain-to-failure</b> of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by elastically straining suspended SWNT ropes using an atomic force microscope in lateral force mode. The ropes experienced multiple scanning cycles at high strains with no plastic deformation. The nanotube ropes were observed to strain as elastic strings, instead of as stiff beams. A maximum strain of 5. 9 +/- 0. 9 % was observed, which led to a lower bound on the yield strength of 45 +/- 7 GPa for single-wall carbon nanotubes.

The degree of alignment and interparticle bond strength was {{not as high as}} that observed for the extruded composite. The sinter-forged composite exhibited higher Youngs modulus and ultimate tensile strength than the extruded material, but lower <b>strain-to-failure.</b> The higher modulus and strength were attributed to the absence of any significant processing-induced particle fracture, while the lower <b>strain-to-failure</b> was caused by poorer matrix interparticle bonding compared to the extruded material.

40|$|Improvement in the <b>strain-to-failure</b> of chemical-vapor-deposition boron fibers {{is shown}} {{possible}} by contracting the tungsten boride core region and its inherent flaws. Results of three methods {{are presented in}} which etching and thermal-processing techniques were employed to achieve core flaw contraction by internal stresses available in the boron sheath. After commercially and treatment-induced surface flaws were removed from 203 -micron (8 -mil) fibers, the core flaw was observed to be essentially {{the only source of}} fiber fracture.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in epoxy resins {{that are to}} be used as a matrix material in fiber-reinforced composites is commonly targeted to be homogeneous and free of agglomerates. In the present paper we report experimental observations, showing that the uniform distribution of CNTs in fiber-reinforced composites is not necessarily a desired feature. The study was performed on a woven glass fiber composite produced using resin transfer moulding. Two different localization states of CNTs were achieved by choosing matrices with different dispersion qualities. For the resin with large agglomerates, CNTs tended to localize in the resin rich zones, while for the resin with smaller agglomerates, CNTs were somewhat homogeneously distributed in a composite. The CNT distribution/localization showed to influence the <b>strain-to-failure</b> of a composite and the density of transverse cracks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that a variety of factors have an {{influence}} on the compres-sion strength of unidirectional organic matrix composites. For example, for failure as a result of microfilament buckling, the strength can be shown [1] to be directly related to both the matrix shear stiffness as well as the fiber volume fraction. Other factors can also {{have a significant effect on}} the compression strength. These include the presence of a fiber/matrix interface [2], the degree of fiber misalignment [3], compression <b>strain-to-failure</b> of the fibers [4], and the nonlinear stiffness of the matrix material [5]. Recent ex-perimental results [2, 6 - 8] have led to the definition of parameters which can be used in performing analyses capable of determining the most significant microstructural and micromechanical aspects of the compression strength of carbon fiber composites. Mathe-matical models which utilize both closed form analytical techmques as well as approx-imate finite element methods have been constructed to assess the effects of interphases, nonlinear matrix stiffness, a distribution of fiber misalignments representative of actual composites, and the compression <b>strain-to-failure</b> of carbon fibers.

The effects of changes to the specimen geometry (i. e., L/D ratio) and the material heat treatment [i. e., annealing versus amorphous (as-received) ], on the peak stress, <b>strain-to-failure,</b> and failure behavior were determined {{with the aid of}} an in situ video obtained by using a high-speed digital camera in conjunction with the split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). Examination of the in situ video recordings and light optical microscopy showed that the failed samples revealed preferential failure initiating at the sample ends due to stress concentration at the sample-insert interface. A new insert design was developed using transient, elastic-plastic finite-element simulations to reduce the effects of these stress concentrations. SHPB testing, combined with in situ video, subsequently revealed that this new experimental configuration promoted failure within the gage length and away from the sample ends in the samples tested.

In fact, monomers derived vegetable oils and plant sources have shown promising results in forming polymers with good properties. The following is a study of two highly viable renewable sources, eugenol and tung oil (TO) to be copolymerized into fully bio-based thermosets. Polymerization of eugenol required initial methacrylate-functionalization through Steglich esterification and the synthesized methacrylated eugenol (ME) was confirmed by 1 H-NMR. Rheological studies showed ideal Newtonian behavior in ME and five other blended ME resins containing 10 - 50 wt% TO. Free-radical copolymerization using 5 mol% of tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (crosslinking catalyst) and curing at elevated temperatures (90 - 160 Â°C) formed a series of soft to rigid highly-crosslinked thermosets.
