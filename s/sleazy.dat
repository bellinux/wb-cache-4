5|$|The {{match between}} Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, <b>Sleazy,</b> and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) {{consisted}} of comedic action {{for much of}} the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and {{played a role in the}} elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns R' Us was eliminated after <b>Sleazy</b> and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on <b>Sleazy</b> and attempted to pin him. Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that <b>Sleazy</b> was on top, however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, <b>Sleazy</b> and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. Dink, Pink, and Wink emerged from under the ring. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.|$|E

Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E

5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of water}} on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, <b>Sleazy</b> and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E

[...] "It was <b>Sleazy's</b> project, then Cosey and <b>Sleazy's,</b> then I came in on it", Carter explained in an interview with The Quietus.

The film starred Frances McDormand, who would go on to feature in many of the Coen brothers' films (and marry Joel). Upon release the film received much praise and won awards for Joel's direction at both the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards.|$|E
