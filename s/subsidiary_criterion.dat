The article starts with an analysis of the situation of the municipality inthe system of federal powers in Brazil, followed by the study of the administrative reform in Brazil andits intent to use the criterion of subsidiarity in the definition of federal powers. However, the conclusionobtained is that this reform proposal was not accepted in Brazil and never should be. In other words,the lack of a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>criterion</b> for the definition of relationships between the municipality and othersFederative levels’ power is a feature that must be preserved in the Brazilian system, differentiating,therefore, of the European system...|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{a recent}} article Gneiting, Balabdaoui and Raftery (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 2007) propose the {{criterion}} of sharpness {{for the evaluation of}} predictive distributions or density forecasts. They motivate their proposal by an example in which standard evaluation procedures based on probability integral transforms cannot distinguish between the ideal forecast and several competing forecasts. In this paper we show that their example has some unrealistic features which make it an insecure foundation for their argument that existing calibration procedures are inadequate in practice. We present an alternative, more realistic example in which relevant statistical methods provide the required discrimination between competing forecasts, and argue that {{there is no need for}} a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>criterion</b> of sharpness...|$|E

40|$|On July 1 2010 {{new rules}} {{regarding}} cross-border group deductions came into force in Sweden. The rules {{are based on}} a series of judgements which were delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union and subsequent rulings deriving from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. The new set of rules is supposed to make the Swedish group consolidation system in line with EU law in the area of cross-border group consolidations. The new rules allow a resident parent to deduct the losses stemming from its non-resident subsidiary but only if the subsidiary has exhausted all the possibilities to take those losses into account in its own state of origin and the losses cannot be utilized in the future by the subsidiary or a third party. Furthermore, the non-resident subsidiary needs to be liquidated for the parent to be able to show that the possibilities have been exhausted. However, before even considering whether the subsidiary has exhausted the losses there is one criterion that need to be fulfilled; the criterion of a wholly owned <b>subsidiary.</b> The <b>criterion</b> of a wholly owned subsidiary requires a resident parent to directly own its non-resident subsidiary without any intermediate companies and that shareholding must correspond to more than 90 percent. It is the requirement of a direct shareholding which post a concern to whether that criterion can be seen as in compliance with the case-law stemming from The Court of Justice of the European Union and the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. After revising and analysing the case-law stemming from the Court of Justice and the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court it is the author’s belief that the criterion of a wholly owned subsidiary, due to the requirement of a direct shareholding, is not in conformity with EU law and cannot be justified by the justification grounds put forward by the Swedish government...|$|R
40|$|Although {{parallel}} and convergent evolution {{are discussed}} extensively in technical articles and textbooks, their meaning can be overlapping, imprecise, and contradictory. The meaning of parallel evolution {{in much of}} the evolutionary literature grapples with two separate hypotheses in relation to phenotype and genotype, but often these two hypotheses have been inferred from only one hypothesis, and a number of <b>subsidiary</b> but problematic <b>criteria,</b> in relation to the phenotype. However, examples of parallel evolution of genetic traits that underpin or are at least associated with convergent phenotypes are now emerging. Four criteria for distinguishing parallelism from convergence are reviewed. All are found to be incompatible with any single proposition of homoplasy. Therefore, all homoplasy is equivalent to a broad view of convergence. Based on this concept, all phenotypic homoplasy can be described as convergence and all genotypic homoplasy as parallelism, which can be viewed as the equivalent concept of convergence for molecular data. Parallel changes of molecular traits {{may or may not be}} associated with convergent phenotypes but if so describe homoplasy at two biological levels-genotype and phenotype. Parallelism is not an alternative to convergence, but rather it entails homoplastic genetics that can be associated with and potentially explain, at the molecular level, how convergent phenotypes evolve...|$|R
