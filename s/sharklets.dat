5|$|A320 Enhanced family (or A320E family) is {{the working}} title {{for a series}} of {{improvements}} to the A320 family. The improvements include engine improvements, aerodynamic refinements– such as adding large curved winglets (<b>Sharklets),</b> weight savings, and a new cabin design.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the <b>sharklets</b> had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
25|$|All Allegiant Airbuses will be repainted in Allegiant's new livery. Old Aircraft will be retired with Allegiant old liveries. All new Airbuses {{will have}} <b>sharklets</b> and painted in Allegaint's new livery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sharklet,</b> {{manufactured}} by <b>Sharklet</b> Technologies, is a plastic sheet product. Its surface is structured to impede bacterial growth. It is marketed {{for use in}} hospitals and other places with a relatively high potential for bacteria to spread and cause infections. Coating surfaces with <b>Sharklet</b> greatly reduces the growth of bacteria, due to the nano-scale texture of the product's surface.|$|R
30|$|The <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern, in a CVC-relevant {{thermoplastic}} polyurethane, {{significantly reduced}} bacterial colonization and relevant platelet interactions after simulated vascular exposure. These {{results suggest that}} the incorporation of the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern on the surface of a CVC may inhibit the initial events that lead to CRBSI and CRT.|$|R

25|$|The wing {{twist and}} belly {{fairings}} are tweaked {{to approach the}} lowest drag elliptical span-wise pressure distribution changed by the larger <b>sharklets,</b> like the flap track fairings shape to lower form drag.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} per seat {{is increased}} by 6% with this option, in total exceeding 20% {{together with the}} new engines and the <b>sharklets.</b> The moved and enlarged exit doors are estimated to add 100kg empty weight.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the new engines, the modernisation programme also included such improvements as: aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets (<b>sharklets),</b> weight savings, a new aircraft cabin with larger hand luggage spaces, and an improved air purification system. Customers will {{have a choice of}} either the CFM International LEAP-1A or the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines.|$|E

30|$|The <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern reduces S. aureus and S. {{epidermidis}} colonization {{after exposure}} to a simulated vascular environment by 70 % or greater (p[*]<[*] 0.05) when compared to smooth unpatterned controls. This micropattern similarly reduces platelet adhesion and fibrin sheath formation by approximately 80 % (p[*]<[*] 0.05). Combined, {{these results suggest that}} the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern implemented onto CVC surfaces will provide clinicians with a non-eluting and non-toxic technology that inhibits the mechanisms that lead to CRBSIs and CRTs.|$|R
25|$|At the Boeing 787 {{launch in}} 2004, Airbus' {{response}} {{was at first}} an improved A330, but after negative feedback from airlines and lessors the A350 XWB became a new design in 2006. After the A320neo launch in December 2010 and its commercial success, Air Asia's boss Tony Fernandes {{said he would like}} Airbus to re-engine the A330. New engines like the GEnx or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 developed for the 787 could offer a 12%-15% fuel burn improvement, and <b>sharklets</b> at least 2%.|$|E
25|$|The larger 112-inch Trent 7000 is 11% more {{efficient}} than the 97-inch previous engine, a 2% loss is due to increased weight and 1% due to additional drag from the larger engine, but the <b>sharklets</b> and aero optimization regains 4% for a 12% fuel advantage per trip. Furthermore, fuel consumption per seat is improved by 2% due to the rearranged cabin (Space-Flex and Smart-Lav) with increased seating, offering a 14% fuel burn reduction per seat for the new −900neo compared to the previous 235-tonne −300 version. The newer 242-tonne −300 is already 2% {{more efficient}}.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Airbus and the Kaskol Group {{created an}} Airbus Engineering centre in Russia, which started with 30 {{engineers}} and since {{has emerged as}} a model of success for Airbus’ globalisation strategy. It was the first engineering facility to open in Europe outside the company’s home countries. Equipped with state-of-the-art communications equipment and linked with Airbus engineering sites in France and Germany, the facility performs extensive work in disciplines such as fuselage structure, stress, system installation and design. In 2011, the centre employs some 200 engineers who have completed over 30 large-scale projects for the A320, the A330/A340 and the A380 programmes. Russian engineers also performed {{more than half of all}} design work on the A330-200F freighter, with its activity related to fuselage structure design, floor grids installation and junctions design. The centre currently is involved in the A320neo <b>Sharklets</b> design development and numerous design works for the A350 XWB programme.|$|E
30|$|The {{surface of}} an {{indwelling}} medical device can be colonized by human pathogens that can form biofilms and cause infections. In most cases, these biofilms {{are resistant to}} antimicrobial therapy and eventually necessitate removal or replacement of the device. An engineered surface microtopography based on the skin of sharks, <b>Sharklet</b> AFTM, has been designed on a poly(dimethyl siloxane) elastomer (PDMSe) to disrupt the formation of bacterial biofilms {{without the use of}} bactericidal agents. The <b>Sharklet</b> AFTM PDMSe was tested against smooth PDMSe for biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus over the course of 21 days. The smooth surface exhibited early-stage biofilm colonies at 7 days and mature biofilms at 14 days, while the topographical surface did not show evidence of early biofilm colonization until day 21. At 14 days, the mean value of percent area coverage of S. aureus on the smooth surface was 54 % compared to 7 % for the <b>Sharklet</b> AFTM surface (p< 0.01). These results suggest that surface modification of indwelling medical devices and exposed sterile surfaces with the <b>Sharklet</b> AFTM engineered topography may be an effective solution in disrupting biofilm formation of S. aureus.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>Sharklet</b> {{equipped}} A320 {{was delivered}} to AirAsia on 21 December 2012, offering a [...] payload increase or [...] longer range at the original payload.|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleAdditionally, platelet adhesion and fibrin sheath formation were reduced by 86 % and 80 % (p < 0. 05), respectively, on the micropattern, when compared to controls. Conclusions: The <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern, in a CVC-relevant thermoplastic polyurethane, significantly reduced bacterial colonization and relevant platelet interactions after simulated vascular exposure. These results suggest that the incorporation of the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern on the surface of a CVC may inhibit the initial events that lead to CRBSI and CRT...|$|R
500|$|On 15 November 2009, Airbus {{announced}} future additions of <b>Sharklets</b> to A320s {{beginning in}} 2012 with Air New Zealand. These Airbus winglets, which are [...] tall and weigh , would reduce fuel burn by 4% and offer increases in payload of , or range by [...] {{at the original}} payload. This corresponds to an annual CO2 reduction of around [...] per aircraft, saving operators US$220,000 per aircraft per year. The <b>Sharklets</b> are to be manufactured and distributed by Korean Air Aerospace Division.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Airbus {{confirmed}} that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with <b>Sharklets,</b> wingtip devices which reduce lift-induced drag and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption. The optional devices, which {{will also be}} available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division, will increase {{the range of the}} aircraft to [...] – an increase of [...] over a standard A318 with 107 seats in a two-class configuration.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Airbus {{announced}} {{a new generation of}} the A320 family, the A320neo (new engine option). [...] The A320neo offers new, more efficient engines, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named <b>Sharklets</b> by Airbus. [...] The aircraft will deliver fuel savings of up to 15%. As of 30 September 2017, a total of 5,202 A320neo family aircraft had been ordered by more than 70 airlines, making it the fastest ever selling commercial aircraft. The first A320neo was delivered to Lufthansa on 20 January 2016 and it entered service on 25 January 2016.|$|E
30|$|The <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern with {{protruding}} features (+ 3 SK 2 × 2) showed {{improved performance}} against platelet adhesion and activation {{when compared to}} the micropattern with recessed features (− 3 SK 2 × 2) (Figures  3, 4). Future work will evaluate feature size and spacing required to achieve optimal boundary layer slip conditions for improved hydrodynamics based on contact line pinning/slipping [63]. It is anticipated that after pattern optimization and manufacturing scale up, a CVC with the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern will demonstrate reduced CRBSI and CRT rates through preclinical and clinical studies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sharklet's</b> {{topography}} creates {{mechanical stress}} on settling bacterium, a {{phenomenon known as}} mechanotransduction. Nanoforce gradients caused by surface variations induces stress gradients within the lateral plane of the surface membrane of a settling microorganism during initial contact. This stress gradient disrupts normal cell functions, forcing the microorganism to provide energy to adjust its contact area on each topographical feature to equalize the stresses. This expenditure of energy is thermodynamically unfavorable to the settler, inducing it {{to search for a}} different surface to attach to. <b>Sharklet</b> is made, however, with the same material as other plastics.|$|R
30|$|Incorporation of nano and micropatterns into CVC {{surfaces}} {{has been}} proposed to reduce CRBSI and CRT rates without antimicrobial or antithrombogenic coatings. Specifically, ordered pillar topographies, with dimensions of 300  nm to 1  μm, {{have been shown to}} reduce platelet adhesion and aggregation [30, 31]. The <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern, either with recessed (− 3 SK 2 × 2) or protruding (+ 3 SK 2 × 2) features on the same size scale (i.e. 2  μm to 16  μm) contains an ordered arrangement of features bio-inspired by the diamond-like structure of shark skin. <b>Sharklet</b> micropatterns have been shown to control the bioadhesion {{of a wide range of}} marine microorganisms, pathogenic bacteria and eukaryotic cells [32 - 37]. The aim of the present study is to expand our understanding of the performance of the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern against common microorganisms that cause CRBSIs after blood protein exposure as well as platelet adhesion and activation that leads to fibrin sheath formation and CRT.|$|R
500|$|On 3 June 2016, Emirates President Tim Clark {{stated that}} talks between Emirates and Airbus on the A380neo have [...] "lapsed". [...] On 12 June 2017, Fabrice Brégier {{confirmed}} that Airbus will not launch an A380neo, stating [...] "...there is no business case to do that, {{this is absolutely}} clear." [...] However, Brégier stated it won't stop Airbus from looking at {{what could be done}} to improve the performance of the aircraft. One such proposal is a [...] wingspan extension to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency by 4%, though further is seen the aircraft with new <b>Sharklets.</b>|$|E
500|$|Simultaneously, Airbus was {{developing}} Airbus A318. In early 1998, Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100-seat aircraft {{based on the}} A320. The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998, after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own, the A318, at that year's Farnborough Airshow. The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus's product range, and was developed coincidentally {{at the same time}} as the largest commercial aircraft in history, the Airbus A380. First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995, it was shorter by [...] ahead of the wing and [...] behind. These cuts reduced passenger capacity from 124 on the A319 to 107 passengers in a two-class layout. Range was , or [...] with upcoming <b>Sharklets.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} ovoviviparous, {{meaning that the}} eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids {{secreted}} by glands in {{the walls of the}} oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. [...] Taking this a step further, [...] sand tiger shark <b>sharklets</b> cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. [...] The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sharklet</b> {{material}} {{was developed by}} Dr. Tony Brennan, material science and engineering professor at University of Florida while trying to improve antifouling technology for ships and submarines at Pearl Harbor.|$|R
50|$|The {{inspiration}} for <b>Sharklet's</b> texture {{was made by}} analyzing the texture of shark skin, which does not attract barnacles or other biofouling, unlike ship hulls and other smooth surfaces. The texture was found to also repel microbial activity.|$|R
30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{that not only}} do fewer platelets adhere to the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern, {{but there is also}} significantly less platelet activation resulting in fibrin sheath formation (Figures  3, 4). Complex fibrin networks are a clinically relevant outcome of platelet adhesion and activation, often leading to CVC occlusion or clots that cause thromboembolisms [14, 22]. These fibrin networks have been shown to facilitate microbial colonization and correlate with CRBSIs that occur in the clinic [20, 22, 24 - 27]. This study shows that the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern can individually reduce bacterial colonization in a simulated vascular environment and reduce fibrin sheath formation that can enhance microbial colonization, thereby functioning through a dual approach to potentially limit infections.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2017, Airbus {{was testing}} {{extended}} <b>sharklets</b> which could offer [...] extra range and reduce fuel burn by 1.4-1.6%.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Airbus {{announced}} {{a new generation of}} the A320 family, the A320neo (new engine option). [...] The similarly lengthened fuselage A321neo variant offers new, more efficient engines, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named <b>Sharklets</b> by Airbus. [...] The aircraft will deliver fuel savings of up to 15%.|$|E
2500|$|At {{launch in}} December 2010, Airbus {{forecast}} a 4,000 aircraft market {{over the following}} 15 years and development costs were predicted to be [...] "slightly more than €1 billion [...] ". The neo list price would be $6 million more than the ceo, including $3.5 million for airframe modifications and around $0.9 million for the <b>sharklets.</b> The A320neo was stated for service entry in spring 2016, the A321neo six months later and the A319neo again six months after.|$|E
30|$|The <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern {{has shown}} promise for {{controlling}} bacterial interaction for several medical device applications (e.g. urinary catheter and endotracheal tubes) [32, 33], but {{has yet to}} be evaluated for effectiveness in a vascular environment and in a TPU material that is predominately used for vascular access devices. This study is {{the first of its kind}} to demonstrate the ability for an ordered micropattern, specifically the <b>Sharklet</b> micropattern, to reduce S. aureus colonization after exposure to whole blood (Table  1). This study also presents the first ordered micropattern embossed in TPU to show performance against several CVC fouling agents, i.e., bacterial colonization, platelet adhesion and fibrin sheath formation (Figures  2, 3, 4 and Table  1).|$|R
2500|$|Airbus {{launched}} the <b>sharklet</b> blended wingtip device during the November 2009 Dubai Airshow. Installation adds [...] but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over [...] Manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division, the [...] tall devices permits an annual carbon dioxide reduction of 700 tonnes per aircraft. The winglets increase efficiency by decreasing lift-induced drag.|$|R
2500|$|Major {{structures}} of the first A330-800 were entering production in October 2017 : high-lift devices are installed on the wing in Bremen, fuselage sections are built in Hamburg, the centre wing-box in Nantes, titanium engine pylons in Toulouse [...] and <b>sharklet</b> wingtips in Korea; final assembly will start {{by the end of}} the year for a first flight in 2018.|$|R
