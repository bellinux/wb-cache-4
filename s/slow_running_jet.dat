50|$|Bernoulli's principle, {{which is}} a {{function}} of the velocity of the fluid, is a dominant effect for large openings and large flow rates, but since fluid flow at small scales and low speeds (low Reynolds number) is dominated by viscosity, Bernoulli's principle is ineffective at idle or <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> and in the very small carburetors of the smallest model engines. Small model engines have flow restrictions ahead of the jets to reduce the pressure enough to suck the fuel into the air flow. Similarly the idle and <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> <b>jets</b> of large carburetors are placed after the throttle valve where the pressure is reduced partly by viscous drag, rather than by Bernoulli's principle. The most common rich mixture device for starting cold engines was the choke, which works on the same principle.|$|R

40|$|Measurement of tendon loading {{patterns}} during gait {{is important}} for understanding the pathogenesis of tendon "overuse" injury. Given that the speed of propagation of ultrasound in tendon {{is proportional to the}} applied load, this study used a noninvasive ultrasonic transmission technique to measure axial ultrasonic velocity in the right Achilles tendon of 27 healthy adults (11 females and 16 males; age, 26 [*]±[*] 9 years; height, 1. 73 [*]±[*] 0. 07 [*]m; weight, 70. 6 [*]±[*] 21. 2 [*]kg), walking at self-selected speed (1. 1 [*]±[*] 0. 1 [*]m/s), and <b>running</b> at fixed <b>slow</b> speed (2 [*]m/s) on a treadmill. Synchronous measures of ankle kinematics, spatiotemporal gait parameters, and vertical ground reaction forces were simultaneously measured. <b>Slow</b> <b>running</b> was associated with significantly higher cadence, shorter step length, but greater range of ankle movement, higher magnitude and rate of vertical ground reaction force, and higher ultrasonic velocity in the tendon than walking (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Ultrasonic velocity in the Achilles tendon was highly reproducible during walking and <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> (mean within-subject coefficient of variation[*]<[*] 2 %). Ultrasonic maxima (P 1, P 2) and minima (M 1, M 2) were significantly higher and occurred earlier in the gait cycle (P 1, M 1, and M 2) during running than walking (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). <b>Slow</b> <b>running</b> was associated with higher and earlier peaks in loading of the Achilles tendon than walking...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the development of}} a macroinvertebrate based multimetric index for two stream types, fast and <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> streams, in the Netherlands within the AQEM project. Existing macroinvertebrate data (949 samples) were collected from these stream types from all over the Netherlands. All sites received a ecological quality (post-) classification ranging from 1 (bad status) to 4 (good status) based on biotic and abiotic variables, using a combination of multivariate analysis and expert-judgement. A number of bioassessment metrics was tested for both stream types (fast and <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> streams) to examine their power to discriminate between streams of different ecological quality within each stream type. A metric was selected for inclusion in the final multimetric index when there was no overlap of the 25 th and 75 th percentile between one (or more) ecological quality class(es). Out of all metrics tested, none could distinguish between all four ecological quality classes without overlap of the 25 th and 75 th percentile between {{one or more of the}} classes. Instead, metrics were selected that could distinguish between one (or more) ecological quality class(es) and all others. Finally, 10 metrics were selected for the assessment of <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> streams and 11 metrics for the assessment of fast running streams. Class boundaries were established, to make the assignment of scores to the individual metrics possible. The class boundaries were set at the 25 th and/or 75 th percentile of the individual metric values. The individual metrics were combined into a multimetric index. Calibration showed that 67 % of the samples from <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> streams and 65 % of the samples from fast running streams were classified in accordance to their post-classification. In total, only 8 % of the samples differed more than one quality class from the post-classification. The multimetric index was validated with data collected in the Netherlands from 82 sites for the purpose of the AQEM project. Validation showed that 54 % of the streams were classified correctly...|$|R

50|$|CENBIO {{laboratory}} tests found that {{as compared to}} diesel, carbon dioxide emissions are 80% lower with ED95, particulate drops by 90%, nitrogen oxide emissions are 62% lower, {{and there are no}} sulphur emissions. During the trial was observed that the first bus began presenting sudden halts of the engine in <b>slow</b> <b>running.</b> The problem manifested more frequently in hot days, when the ambient temperature reached 26 °C or more and on top of long grades. After analyzing carefully the problem in the engine's fuel power line, it was discovered that the bus was developed for the European temperate climate, where average temperatures are lower than in tropical climate. In hotter days, the temperature of the fuel line reached up to 58 °C, a temperature that could increase even more when the engine would be <b>slow</b> <b>running.</b> The excessive heating was causing the vaporization of the fuel in the power line of the engine. The solution found was to deviate the fuel return from the engine straight to the tank, and thus, adaptating the engine to Brazilian climate conditions.|$|R
40|$|Online data-intensive {{services}} parallelize query execution across {{distributed software}} components. Interactive response {{time is a}} priority, so online query executions return answers without waiting for <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> components to finish. However, data from these slow components could lead to better answers. We propose Ubora, an approach to measure the effect of <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> components {{on the quality of}} answers. Ubora randomly samples online queries and executes them twice. The first execution elides data from slow components and provides fast online answers; the second execution waits for all components to complete. Ubora uses memoization to speed up mature executions by replaying network messages exchanged between components. Our systems-level implementation works {{for a wide range of}} platforms, including Hadoop/Yarn, Apache Lucene, the EasyRec Recommendation Engine, and the OpenEphyra question answering system. Ubora computes answer quality much faster than competing approaches that do not use memoization. With Ubora, we show that answer quality can and should be used to guide online admission control. Our adaptive controller processed 37 % more queries than a competing controller guided by the rate of timeouts. Comment: Technical Repor...|$|R
