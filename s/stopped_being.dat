5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Burnham {{branch of the}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, but the tracks continued onto the jetty, where ferry services to South Wales could be boarded. The station opened in 1858 as Burnham, and was renamed Burnham-on-Sea in 1920. It closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951 and <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> used for excursions in 1962. It finally closed to goods traffic in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Most Cannon Street train {{services}} ceased during World War I. Continental boat trains {{were stopped}} on 15 November 1914 and rerouted to Victoria. The station <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> served by through services from Charing Cross on 31 December 1916, and was closed on Sundays. Services were reduced further on 1 May 1918, {{when it was}} closed after 3p.m. on Saturdays and between 11a.m. and 4p.m. Mondays to Fridays. This allowed Cannon Street {{to be used as}} a goods depot for war supplies.|$|E
5|$|A stone pier {{was built}} in 1858 by the Somerset Central Railway. Soon afterwards, in 1860, a steamer service to Wales was inaugurated, {{but it was never}} a {{commercial}} success, and ended in 1888. Burnham-on-Sea railway station was the terminus of the Burnham branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1858, closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951, and <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> used for excursions in 1962. The former Great Western Railway station is now known as Highbridge and Burnham. A second pier, built of concrete between 1911 and 1914, is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain.|$|E

5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|However {{the series}} of power struggles between the lesser nobility (szlachta), the higher nobility (magnates), and elected kings, {{undermined}} citizenship values and gradually eroded the government's authority, ability to function and provide for national defense. The infamous liberum veto procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning {{in the second half}} of the 17th century. After {{the series of}} devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the Chmielnicki Uprising and the Deluge), Poland-Lithuania <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (higher losses than during World War II). Its economy and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on agriculture and serfdom, which, combined with the weakness of the urban burgher class, delayed the industrialization of the country.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an indication of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an indication of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1837 {{hurt the}} Spirit's circulation, but Porter responded by buying out his main competition, the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine {{and moved it}} to New York City. Porter edited the Turf Register until the paper <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> {{published}} in 1844. Porter continued the publication of annual stallion lists and the publication of lists of horses owned by breeders. However, {{the purchase of the}} American Turf Register strained Porter's finances, and he sold the Spirit to another printer, John Richards, who retained Porter as editor. The 1840s were prosperous, but in the 1850s the magazine again encountered difficulties. Around 1855, Porter left Richards' paper, and in 1856, another printer, George Wilkes, began a new sporting newspaper, which he called Porter's Spirit of the Times, and employed Porter as editor.|$|E
5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Historically, equestrians honed {{their skills}} through games and races. Equestrian sports {{provided}} entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship {{that was needed}} in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries {{has resulted in the}} preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> used in combat.|$|E

5|$|The migrations and {{invasions of}} the 4th and 5th centuries {{disrupted}} trade networks around the Mediterranean. African goods <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> imported into Europe, first disappearing {{from the interior}} and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By {{the end of the}} 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 2008 {{the newly}} {{established}} tropical cyclone warning centre in Jakarta, Indonesia named its first system: Durga, before two sets of Indonesian names were established for their area of responsibility ahead of the 2008–09 season. At {{the same time the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology, merged their three lists into one national list of names. The issue of tropical cyclones being renamed when they moved across 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean, was subsequently brought up during October 2008 at the 18th session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee. However, it was decided to postpone the matter until the following committee meeting so that various consultations could take place. During the 2009 Tropical Cyclone RSMCs/TCWCs Technical Coordination Meeting, it was reaffirmed that a tropical cyclone name should be retained throughout a system's lifetime, including when moving from one basin to another, to avoid confusion. As a result, it was proposed at the following year's RA I tropical cyclone committee, that systems <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> renamed when they moved into the South-West Indian Ocean from the Australian region. It was subsequently agreed that during an interim period, cyclones that moved into the basin would have a name attached to their existing name, before it was stopped {{at the start of the}} 2012–13 season. Tropical Cyclone Bruce was subsequently the first tropical cyclone not to be renamed, when it moved into the South-West Indian Ocean during 2013-14. During March 12, 2010, public and private weather services in Southern Brazil, decided to name a tropical storm Anita in order to avoid confusion in future references. A naming list was subsequently set up by the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center with the names Arani, Bapo and Cari subsequently taken from that list during 2011 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have <b>stopped</b> <b>being</b> involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E
