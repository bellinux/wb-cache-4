The objective of this work is to explore some of the cognitive abilities that constitute a common factor for EF in 9 years-old children. The chosen instruments: Batería de Evaluación Neuropsicológica de la Función Ejecutiva en niños (ENFEN) (Battery of Neuropsychological Assessment for Executive Function in Children), along with the Backward Digits Subtestfrom the WISC-III, were administered to 101 children from private schools of Buenos Aires State, Argentina.

40|$|In recent years, many {{different}} <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> have been formulated {{as an alternative}} for the standard likelihood ratio test (LRT) of Structural Equation Models (SEM). These <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> were developed to solve specific {{problems associated with the}} LRT namely, sensitivity to sample size; the problem that no SEM will ever be an exact representation of reality; and the problem of deviation from the assumptions of the standard test. There is, however, oneproblem related to using the LRT that has been largely ignored by the developers of <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> and this is the LRT’s varying sensitivity to the different characteristics of a model and different types of error. Because of this problem, it is impossible to use the LRT to test the fit of models with a fixed critical value. Since most new <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> are functions of the fitting function or the test statistic itself, it was expected that the <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> would have the same sensitivity problems as the LRT statistic. In the present paper, we confirm this by means of a Monte Carlo experiment. We also <b>show</b> that <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> do not provide a simple instrument to test the fit of models.

Hence, for continuing future progress in financial industry’s rapid development, Malaysian government through Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), invites financial institution across the world to establish Takaful and re-takaful operations in Malaysia to conduct foreign currency business. Nowadays, Muslim’s consumers have the option to choose either Takaful or conventional insurance product. In addition, based on the nature of Takaful product descriptions, it has a higher preference since it is Syariah compliant which align with the Islamic regulation. However, the concept of Takaful is still vague to many people even to the Muslim because there is no proper explanation to educate them on lot of hidden advantages of it. Therefore, this study investigates the causal relationship between consumer awareness, perception and religiosity towards Muslim’s consumer preferences on Takaful product. Primary data were collected through series of questions in a questionnaire that were distributed among Muslim’s Takaful customers of selected Takaful agencies.

Validity of the PDI was also examined via its inclusion within a path model of literacy development and exploratory examination of potential cut scores of the estimated PDI score were conducted to maximize classification accuracy between measures. Results indicated that the modified PDI demonstrated good concurrent and predictive validity with the ORF and TOWRE measures. While the originally proposed path model did not demonstrate good fit, alternative models proposed <b>showed</b> improved <b>fit</b> <b>indices.</b> Potential cut scores are identified and the rate of true positives and negatives are reported. Limitations and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the causal {{relationships}} of perceived risk, satisfaction, switching cost and loyalty in outpatient health services. Method: A survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted with 393 hospital outpatients. The analysis of data was done with both SPSS Win 17. 0 for descriptive statistics and AMOS 18. 0 for structural equation model. Results: The causal model yielded Chi-square= 31. 44 (p=<. 001), df= 4, GFI=. 98, AGFI=. 87, CFI=. 97, RMSR=. 04, NFI=. 96, IFI=. 97 and <b>showed</b> relatively good <b>fit</b> <b>indices.</b> Perceived risk had a significant direct effect on customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction, financial switching cost and relational switching cost had significant direct effects on customer loyalty. Perceived risk and customer satisfaction had significant indirect effects on customer loyalty. Conclusion: These results suggest that we should decrease the perceived risk and improve the customer satisfaction and switching cost to retain loyal customers. Further study with both a larger sample from various hospitals and a longitudinal design i...|$|R
40|$|Many {{research}} had <b>shown</b> person <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> might {{be influenced by}} the factor of test length on their detection rates of aberrant responses. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine test length effects on the BW aberrance indices. Three conditions were designed in this study: test length (K, including 25, 50, 100, and 200 items), ability ratio (T/K, defined as the total person score divided by test length K), and error ratio (E/K, defined as the number of errors within ability level divided by test length). Four 100 -person times varying-item data matrices (100 x 25, 100 x 50, 100 x 100, and 100 x 200) were randomly generated and permuted 500 times for each data matrix through 20 repeats. Results showed that after partialling out the factors of E/K and T/K, the effect of test length on the association between the two indices was very slight. In nonlinear regression analyses, E/K and T/K can predict more than 76 and 73 percent of the variances of the B index and that of the W index, respectively, but test length with both very slight contributions on them. Furthermore, a very good model fit generated from SEM analyses also showed the effect of test length on the B and W indices were very tiny. All these pieces of evidence endorsed the B and W indices were robust with test length...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{analysis}} is an exploratory technique for analyzing the interaction in a contingency table. Tables with meaningful {{orders of the}} rows and columns may be analyzed using a model-based correspondence analysis that incorporates order constraints. However, if there exists a permutation of the rows and columns of the contingency table so that the rows are regression dependent on the columns and, vice versa, the columns are regression dependent on the rows, then both implied orders {{are reflected in the}} first dimension of the unconstrained correspondence analysis [Schriever, B. F., 1983. Scaling of order dependent categorical variables with correspondence analysis. International Statistical Review 51, 225 - 238]. Thus, using unconstrained correspondence analysis, we may still find that the data fit an ordinal stochastic model. Fit measures are formulated that may be used to verify whether the re-ordered contingency table is regression dependent in either the rows or columns. Using several data examples, it is <b>shown</b> that the <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> may complement the usual geometric interpretation of the unconstrained correspondence analysis solution in low-dimensional space. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if the model proposed to explain the effect of coping responses in stress that could promote mental health, fit the population of the Iranian university students. This study used path analysis to examine the Goodness-of-fit of the mediating effect of coping responses on stress in promoting mental health among Iranian undergraduate students. Three hundred and twenty-six students took part in the study. A community survey was conducted and the students completed a set of measures that assessed stress level, Coping Responses and Mental Health. Findings from the study <b>show</b> that the <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> for this model are excellent. The RMSEA was 0. 06, and the GFI and AGFI were 0. 92 and 0. 93, respectively. Approach responses (r= [...] 0. 24) and avoidant responses (r= 0. 28) were shown to have direct effect on Mental Health. All paths were significant at p < 0. 05. Correlational results demonstrated that inter- intra personal stress had significant inverse relationship with approach responses and positive relationship with avoidance responses...|$|R
