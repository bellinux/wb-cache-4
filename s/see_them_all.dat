500|$|Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his first win of the season, {{and his second}} Sprint Cup win at Phoenix International Raceway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 75,000 people. [...] "I was feeling the emotions, but to see (the fans) react like that. Then the push truck pushed me around and to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> the way down (the frontstretch) doing that, I was like, ‘I don't know if I've ever experienced something like that.’ And that to me made it all worth it right there to have that feeling," [...] said Gordon of his triumph.|$|E
2500|$|December 2013 – The Mets {{agreed to}} terms with outfielder Curtis Granderson on a {{four-year}} contract worth $60million on December 6, 2013. Granderson played for the Yankees from 2010 to 2013. [...] "A {{lot of the people}} I've met in New York have always said that, 'True New Yorkers are Mets fans,'" [...] said Granderson during a press conference making the deal official. [...] "So I'm excited {{to get a chance to}} <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> out there." [...] Around the same time, the Yankees agreed to sign Carlos Beltrán, who was a Met from 2005 to 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The {{catechism}} {{is one of}} Luther's {{most personal}} works. [...] "Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes," [...] he wrote, [...] "I am quite cool {{and not at all}} eager about it because, roused by a Saturnian hunger, I would rather <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> devoured. For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine, except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism." [...] The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching. It remains in use today, along with Luther's hymns and his translation of the Bible.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} five {{different}} categories of Panjis. No one has <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "I have <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> {{and he is}} the {{greatest}} hurler ever. Ring is a natural. A pocket Hercules, beautifully built with a powerful frame." [...] Pioneering Gaelic games journalist P.D. Mehigan whose recall of games spanned nearly seventy years.|$|R
6000|$|He threw {{a pumpkin}} over the wall, [...] And melons and apples beside, [...] So thick in the air, that to <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> fall, [...] She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried, [...] Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.|$|R
2500|$|Stan was {{introduced}} on-screen on 27 January 2014 when Shirley, Mick and Tina visit {{him at his}} rundown flat needing money to fix the rising damp in their pub, The Queen Victoria. Mick and Tina arrive at his door, but he demands to see Shirley if they want their money. Speaking of Stan's intentions behind giving the money to Shirley, West said, [...] "He’s got the money to spare {{and he wants to}} <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> together in the pub. If he knows where they are, he can use {{it as a way to}} get back into their lives. Also, giving someone money gives you a certain hold over them, which is what Stan wants." [...] Stan appeared again on 20 February 2014, before arriving permanently on 31 March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The actor's son, Miko, was Jackson's {{bodyguard}} {{and assistant}} for several years, {{and was a}} friend of the singer. He stated, [...] "The last time my father left his house to go anywhere, to spend any kind of time... was with Michael Jackson. He loved it... He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service." [...] "Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. For that I will always be indebted to him. Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days, and he was on oxygen much of the time. He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. Dad could name all the trees there, and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> it's such a big place. So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland. They'd just drive around—Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando, with an oxygen tank in a golf cart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Belmonte and Pedrillo come to {{the garden}} with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: [...] "Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke" [...] – [...] "Love, only love, can now direct me"). [...] Pedrillo gets the {{attention}} of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: [...] "In Mohrenland gefangen war" [...] – [...] "In Moorish lands a maiden fair"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle. [...] As the Pasha and his guards come running in, Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: [...] "O, wie will ich triumphieren" [...] – [...] "My triumphant hour's approaching"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish Grandee and Governor of Oran, named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: [...] "Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele.... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben" [...] – [...] "What dreadful fate conspires against us.... Woe, you will die because of me"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> brutally executed (Finale: [...] "Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen" [...] – [...] "Your noble mercy passes measure").|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty scene, ain't it?" [...] said Mr. M'Leod. [...] "My good lady's {{sitting under}} the tree, and that's {{my little girl}} in pink on the far court. But I'll take you to your room, and you can <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'See two waterfalls,' she muttered, 'and {{you have}} <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> There {{are only two}} kinds, one {{a bucket of water}} thrown down from the roof of a house, the other over a staircase. Either the water was a fiction, or you can't get at them for the wet!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Broke me--ruined me clean. Never mind, I've <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> hanged for it; {{that makes}} it easier to bear. There's only one left--the villain that gave the evidence. I'd die happy if I could come across him. There are two things I have to do if I meet him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{show you}} {{hundreds}} of them; {{not exactly a}} thousand, perhaps, but so many that eye cannot <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> nor tongue count them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{the doctor}} said, {{stepping}} into the boat. I shall not give up charge of them until I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> safely in bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose so. I {{vowed to}} myself I would <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> to the devil. But I suppose I shall ask her again, {{in a little}} while.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, angel. Just as you say. We'll go to a church. There are {{millions}} of churches in London. I've <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> over the place." [...] He mused for a moment. [...] "Yes, you're quite right," [...] he said. [...] "A church is the thing. It'll please Webster." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rollo's {{father had}} a great many books of {{pictures}} and engravings of various kinds in his library; and sometimes he used to allow the children to <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> but only a very few at a time. They had not yet <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> He only allowed <b>them</b> to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> {{as fast as they}} had time to examine them thoroughly, and read about them and understand them. But now he said to Rollo, ...|$|R
50|$|Architect Walter Craig (Mervyn Johns) {{has been}} invited by Elliot Foley (Roland Culver) {{to his country}} home in Kent to consult on some renovations. Upon arrival at the cottage, he reveals to Foley and his {{assembled}} guests that despite never having met any of <b>them,</b> he has <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> in a recurring dream.|$|R
60|$|Possibly {{we shall}} <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> there amid the savage {{romance of the}} grim jungle and the great plains where Tarzan of the Apes loves best to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{every one}} of them," [...] I replied carelessly, believing it was {{possible}} to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> and as I spoke Harvey Pearson piped up in his shrill voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good lord! {{it was a}} gallant sight [...] To <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> In a row; [...] With {{every man}} a good broad-sword [...] And eke a good yew bow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There--don't you <b>see</b> <b>'em?</b> Fellers <b>all</b> in black--with bell-toppers-- beavers--chimney-pots on--I don't {{know what}} you call 'em here." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is named}} after the song [...] "All Around the World or the Myth of the Fingerprints" [...] by Paul Simon, {{featured}} on his 1986 album Graceland. The song is concerned with dispelling the [...] "myth" [...] that people are different the world over: [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> and, man, they're all the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said mournfully to the Professor. He {{was looking}} at Mrs. ----, or some one so like her that {{it came to the}} same thing. [...] "Am I {{travelling}} round the world to discover these people?" [...] said he. [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> before. There's Captain Such-an-one and Colonel Such-another and Miss What's-its-name as large as life and twice as pale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one, now {{mother is}} dead. Nothing nearer than aunts and cousins in America. I suppose I shall <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> again one day. But they hardly count over here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, laughing. [...] "Strangers {{come from}} {{hundreds}} of miles to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> the time; but we peasants don't care for them, {{no more than the}} dust of the road." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, boys," [...] says Mr. Spillikins. And a {{few minutes}} later one may <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> hustling up the steps of the Everleigh-Spillikins's mansion, quite eager at the prospect, and all talking together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, I {{would not}} hurt you,--not at this moment. Sometimes I feel that I could tear you limb from limb, so great is my disappointment, so ungovernable my rage! Why,--why should I {{be such a}} victim? Why should life be an utter blank to me, while you have {{everything}} before you? There, you have <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> Which will you have?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, and {{she wore}} a {{beautiful}} gold-colour silk gown, trimmed with black lace, that would have stood alone 'ithout legs inside if required. 'Twas a very winsome sight; {{and her hair was}} brushed splendid. And when the sun shone upon the bright gown and his red coat--my! how handsome they looked. You could <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> the length of the street." ...|$|R
60|$|His spirits rose again. Grant couldn't {{stand out}} when he brought to him a deed of the farm. Surely his debt would be {{canceled}} when he had <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> back in the wide old kitchen. He began to plan and to dream. He went to the windows and {{looked out on the}} yard to see how much it had changed.|$|R
6000|$|... "How cunning they are! I {{wish they}} would let me put them with the kits, and have a nursery full of babies. Wouldn't it be nice to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> grow up?" [...] said Daisy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} of {{importance}} to say to any reporters," [...] he declared, [...] "but I will <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> for two minutes. You can show {{them up in the}} order in which they came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go and butt in, then," [...] Downing suggested. [...] "I love {{breaking}} up these little gatherings. You'll <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> stiffen {{when we come}} near. I hope they haven't got hold of Hastings, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scatter {{right and}} left," [...] he said, [...] "and then move forward. You cannot go wrong." [...] Having <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> at work, he hurried {{away to the}} spot where he had left Osgod sitting. He had before leaving him staunched the flow of blood by winding a bow string round the arm above the wound and then {{twisting}} it tightly.|$|R
6000|$|Having <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> off to Hampstead, he {{gave his}} mother her good-night kiss. He was proud of her, a {{wonderful}} woman, who always put a good face on everything! Even her funny way of always having some new thing or other to do you good--even that {{was all part of}} her wanting {{to make the best of}} things. She never lost her 'form'! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! who?" [...] he said, {{with much}} enjoyment. [...] "I {{tell you it}} did my father’s ’art good to <b>see</b> <b>’em</b> <b>all</b> dressed up like that; and when I thought of its all being owing to you, sit down at home in comfort with a pipe instead of coming {{to thank you for}} it I could not. Not if you was to have paid me I couldn’t." ...|$|R
