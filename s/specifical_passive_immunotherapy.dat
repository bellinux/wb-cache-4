40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that amyloid p peptides (A beta) {{are the key}} mediators of Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic interventions have been directed toward impairing the synthesis or accelerating the clearance of A beta. An equilibrium between blood and brain A beta exists mediated by carriers that transport A beta across the blood-brain barrier. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> {{has been shown to}} be effective in mouse models of AD, where the plasma borne antibody binds plasma A beta causing an efflux of A beta from the brain. As an alternative to <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> we have considered the use of A beta-degrading peptidases to lower plasma A beta levels. Here we compare the ability of three A beta-degrading peptidases to degrade A beta. Biotinylated peptidases were coupled to the surface of biotinylated erythrocytes via streptavidin. These erythrocyte-bound peptidases degrade A beta peptide in plasma. Thus, peptidases bound to or expressed on the surface of erythroid cells represent an alternative to <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|AbstractSARS-CoV causes {{an acute}} {{infection}} making targeted <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> an attractive treatment strategy. We previously generated human mAbs {{specific to the}} S 1 region of SARS-CoV S protein. These mAbs bind epitopes within the receptor binding domain (RBD) or upstream of the RBD. We show that mAbs recognizing epitopes within the RBD inhibit infection by preventing viral attachment to the cellular receptor. One mAb binds upstream of the RBD and prevents viral entry by inhibiting a post-binding event. Evaluation of several mAbs demonstrated varying ability of the mAbs to select escape mutants when used individually. However, a mixture of antibodies could effectively neutralize a range of mutant viruses.

40|$|Treatment {{strategies}} for severe cases of pandemic influenza {{have focused on}} antiviral therapies. In contrast, <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> with convalescent blood products has received limited attention. We consider the hypothesis that a passive-immunotherapy program that collects plasma from {{a small percentage of}} recovered adults can harvest sufficient convalescent plasma to treat a substantial percentage of severe cases during a pandemic. We use a mathematical model to estimate the demand and supply of <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> during an influenza pandemic in Hong Kong. If > 5 % of 20 - to 55 -year-old individuals recovered from symptomatic infection donate their plasma (donor percentage > 5 %), > 67 % of severe cases can be offered convalescent plasma transfusion (treatment coverage > 67 %) in a moderately severe epidemic (R 0 < 1. 4 with 0. 5 % of symptomatic cases becoming severe). A donor percentage of 5 % is comparable to the average blood donation rate of 38. 1 donations per 1, 000 people in developed countries. Increasing the donor percentage above 15 % does not significantly boost the convalescent plasma supply because supply is constrained by plasmapheresis capacity during most stages of the epidemic. The demand–supply balance depends on the natural history and transmission dynamics of the disease via the epidemic growth rate only. Compared to other major cities, Hong Kong has a low plasmapheresis capacity. Therefore, the proposed passive-immunotherapy program is a logistically feasible mitigation option for many developed countries. As such, <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> deserves more consideration by clinical researchers regarding its safety and efficacy as a treatment for severe cases of pandemic influenza...|$|R

40|$|Background: Bacterial infections, {{particularly}} those of the respiratory tract, are a serious cause of mortality worldwide despite vaccinations and optimized treatment strategies. Prior {{to the introduction of}} antibiotics, <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> was widely used to treat a range of bacterial infections. A successful opsonin based treatment, however, requires effective clearance by phagocytic cells. Augmented <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> (API) is a novel treatment strategy that combines pathogen specific immunoglobulin (IVIG) and the immunomodulating peptide P 4 to treat fulminant bacterial infections. Using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models of pneumococcal infection, this thesis aimed to describe host responses to API. Methods: The in vivo recruitment and activation of phagocytes following peptide treatment in the absence of infection was characterised using flow cytometry and electron microscope imaging. These findings were translated to murine infection models by treating pneumococcal septicemia with intravenous peptide administration and pneumococcal pneumonia with intranasal peptide administration. In vitro phagocytosis killing assays were used to determine the ability of P 4 to augment bacterial killing of a range of pneumococcal serotypes and describe the involvement of phagocytic Fcγ receptors. Ex vivo assays of phagocytic function of human neutrophil and alveolar macrophages were used to translate murine and in vitro findings. Results: Peptide administration in the absence and presence of infection led to rapid recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and their activation as demonstrated by increased FcγR expression. Intravenous peptide administration during septicemia led to significantly increased survival rates in models of invasive and acute invasive pneumococcal diseases in young and aged mice of various genetic backgrounds. Intranasal peptide administration during pneumonia prevented the onset of septicemia and subsequent host mortality. Increased survival was associated with reduced bacterial burden in affected tissue. Peptide treatment of neutrophil cell lines, human neutrophils and alveolar macrophages modulates FcγR expression resulting in augmented phagocytic killing of opsonised pneumococci. Conclusion: Augmented <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> is a synergistic treatment that enhances natural host immune responses to infection by opsonizing pathogens and inducing their effective phagocytic clearance...|$|R

In this study, we report on the properties of a novel human IgA 1, constructed using a single-chain variable fragment clone (2 E 9), selected from an Ab phage library. The purified Ab monomer revealed high binding affinities for the mycobacterial α-crystallin Ag and for the human FcαRI (CD 89) IgA receptor. Intranasal inoculations with 2 E 9 IgA 1 and recombinant mouse IFN-γ significantly inhibited pulmonary H 37 Rv infection in mice transgenic for human CD 89 but not in CD 89 -negative littermate controls, suggesting that binding to CD 89 was necessary for the IgA-imparted passive protection. 2 E 9 IgA 1 added to human whole-blood or monocyte cultures inhibited luciferase-tagged H 37 Rv infection although not for all tested blood donors.

Although the efficacy of this anti-anthrax PA mAb has been shown in animal models of inhalational anthrax, its activity in GI infection had not yet been ascertained. We hereby demonstrate that <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> with anti-anthrax PA mAb, administered {{at the same time as}} gastrointestinal exposure to B. anthracis, prevents lethal sepsis in nearly all cases (> 90 %), while a delay of up to forty-eight hours in treatment still greatly reduces mortality following exposure (65 %). Moreover, <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> protects against enteric invasion, associated mucosal injury and subsequent dissemination by gastrointestinal B. anthracis, indicating that it acts to prevent the initial stages of infection. * Expired raxibacumab being cycled off the Strategic National Stockpile; biological activity confirmed by in vitro assay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Despite new {{additions}} to the standard of care therapy for high grade primary malignant brain tumors, the prognosis for patients with this disease is still poor. A small contingent of clinical researchers are focusing their efforts on testing the safety, feasibility and efficacy of experimental active and <b>passive</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> approaches for gliomas and are primarily conducting Phase I and II clinical trials. Few trials have advanced to the Phase III arena. Here we {{provide an overview of}} the cellular therapies and vaccine trials currently open for patient accrual obtained from a search of [URL] The search was refined with terms that would identify the Phase I, II and III immunotherapy trials open for adult glioma patient accrual in the United States. From the list, those that are currently open for patient accrual are discussed in this review. A variety of adoptive immunotherapy trials using ex vivo activated effector cell preparations, cell-based and non-cell-based vaccines, and several combination <b>passive</b> and active <b>immunotherapy</b> approaches are discussed...|$|R
