40|$|Accepted to the Astronomical Journal 2001 -October- 09 The ambient {{interstellar}} {{environment of}} wind- and supernova-driven superbubbles strongly affects their evolution, but its properties are rarely well-determined. We have therefore obtained H I aperture synthesis imaging {{of the environment}} around three similar, optically-selected superbubble nebulae in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The resulting H I maps show that the ambient gas distribution around these superbubbles differ to an extreme: DEM L 25 shows no neutral <b>shell</b> <b>component,</b> but is nestled within an H I hole; DEM L 50 shows a massive neutral <b>shell</b> <b>component,</b> but is otherwise within an H I void; and DEM L 301 shows no correspondence at all between the optical nebula and H I distribution. There is also poor correspondence between the H I and optical kinematics. These results strongly caution against inferring properties of the ambient neutral environment of individual superbubbles without direct observations.

Existing structural models of these viruses propose a helical nucleocapsid under the virion envelope as the unique internal structure. In the present work, we have analyzed the structure of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. The definition of its organization supports a new structural model for coronaviruses, since a spherical, probably icosahedral, internal core has been characterized. Disruption of these cores induces the release of N-protein-containing helical nucleocapsids. Immunogold mapping and protein analysis of purified cores showed that they consist of M and N proteins, M being the main core <b>shell</b> <b>component.</b> This surprising finding, together with the fact that M protein molecules are also located in the virion envelope, indicates that a reconsideration of the assembly and maturation of coronaviruses, as well as a study of potential M-protein subclasses, is needed...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of superrotation {{in the atmosphere}} of planets, with rotation axis perpendicular to the orbital plane is presented. As the atmosphere expands, Hadley cells develop producing a redistribution of mass and angular momentum. A three dimensional thermally driven zonally symmetric spectral model and Laplace transformation simulate the time evolution of a fluid leading from corotation under globally uniform heating to superrotation under globally nonuniform heating. For high viscosities the rigid <b>shell</b> <b>component</b> of atmospheric superrotation can be understood in analogy with a pirouette. During spin up angular momentum is transferred to the planet. For low iscosities, the process is reversed. A tendency toward geostrophy, combined with increase of surface pressure toward the poles (due to meridional mass transport), induces the atmosphere to subrotate temporarily at lower altitudes. Resultant viscous shear near the surface permits angular momentum to flow from the planet into the atmosphere propagating upwards to produce high altitude superrotation rates...|$|E

Unfortunately, ZTA composites are generally difficult to process because of the need to preserve the tetragonal zirconia phase in the final dense ceramic, coincident with the need to fully densify the α-Al 2 O 3 component. We report here that liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis of mixtures of metalloorganic precursors of alumina and zirconia at varying compositional ratios provide access in one step to core–shell nanoparticles, wherein the shell is δ-Al 2 O 3 and the core is a perfect single crystal of tetragonal (t -) zirconia.
