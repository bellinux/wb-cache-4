[...] "There are {{two types}} of <b>swingers,</b> the {{recreational}} <b>swingers</b> and the utopian <b>swingers.</b> The recreational <b>swingers</b> view swinging as a social activity, much like playing tennis or golf, or going out to the movies. Although they may make emotional attachments and friendships through swinging, they might do the same thing golfing but find swinging more pleasurable. Utopian <b>swingers</b> are swinging because they believe that marriage is inherently oppressive due to its dependence on a lack of freedom and the existence of control over one's partner. They do not wish for either their partner or for themselves to experience this type of oppression. Therefore, although they may have made a lifetime commitment to their partner (or they may not have due to their sociopolitical analysis), they want to allow their relationship to be as free as possible. Swinging is one way to make a relationship less restrictive and oppressive." [...] (SelectSwingers.Org)* [...] "It is generally felt that you can divide <b>swingers</b> into two groups. Those who participate for recreational sex only and those who participate for utopian reasons. Recreational <b>swingers</b> see swinging as a social activity, much like bowling and playing tennis and cards. Utopian <b>swingers</b> have a general philosophy of sharing not only sex, but all other aspects of life with their fellow participants." [...] (CloudNine) ...|$|R
