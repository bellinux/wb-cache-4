Within a <b>single</b> <b>element,</b> the number of {{neutrons}} may vary, determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.|$|E
5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a <b>single</b> <b>element</b> of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chemical}} element {{has a unique}} atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a <b>single</b> <b>element.</b> Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we first}} {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} <b>single</b> <b>elements</b> in a module. A systematic study of <b>single</b> <b>elements</b> in the AlgL-module U is initiated, where L is a completely distributive subspace lattice on a Hilbert space H. Furthermore, as an application of <b>single</b> <b>elements,</b> we study module isomorphisms between norm closed AlgN-modules, where N is a nest, and obtain the following result: Suppose that U, V are norm closed AlgN-modules and that Φ: U→Vis a module isomorphism. Then U = V and there exists a non-zero complex number λ such that Φ(T) =λT, ∀T ∈U. 1. Introduction an...|$|R

5|$|Therefore, {{the set of}} all numbers ua + vb is {{equivalent}} to the set of multiples m of g. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (a and b) {{is equivalent}} to the set of multiples of gcd(a, b). The GCD {{is said to be the}} generator of the ideal of a and b. This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a <b>single</b> <b>element)</b> and a principal ideal domain (a domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal).|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a <b>single</b> <b>element</b> is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in ratites, horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a <b>single</b> <b>element.</b> The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic strain energy, which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{behaviour}} of small cylindrical microlenses, arranged in one-dimensional arrays and as <b>single</b> <b>elements.</b> For this purpose, we apply a standard rigorous diffraction theory, commonly used for diffraction gratings. We investigate the coupling effect between the elements. It turns out that <b>single</b> <b>elements</b> behave like periodic elements if the spacing is chosen correctly. Furthermore, we compute the complex transmission function by rigorous diffraction theory and compare them with classical theories (combined ray tracing and the thin-element approach).

Splitting of elementary periodic patterns is repeated until no more <b>single</b> <b>elements</b> in W_T can be used.

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of the theorem changed with the formulation {{of the theory of}} Emil Artin, around 1930.

At the same time, considerations of construction of such an element receded: the theorem becomes an existence theorem.|$|E
