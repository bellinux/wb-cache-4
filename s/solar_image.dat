5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the <b>solar</b> <b>image</b> receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer.

And afterwards by receding farther from the Lens, the Rays which before converged will now cross {{one another in the}} Focus G, and diverge from thence, and thereby make the Colours to appear again, but yet in a contrary order; suppose at [Greek: de], where the red t is now above which before was below, and the violet p is below which before was above.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a new discipline called space weather, which aims at understanding and predicting the impact of solar activity on the terrestrial environment and on technological systems, has led to a growing need for analysing <b>solar</b> <b>images</b> in real time. The rapidly growing volume of <b>solar</b> <b>images,</b> however, makes it increasingly impractical to process them for scientific purposes. This situation has prompted the development of novel processing techniques for doing feature recognition, image tracking, knowledge extraction, etc. Here we focus on two particular concepts and list some of their applications. The first one is Blind Source Separation (BSS), which has a great potential for condensing the information that is contained in multispectral images. The second one is multiscale (multiresolution, or wavelet) analysis, which is particularly well suited for capturing scale-invariant structures in <b>solar</b> <b>images.</b> This article provides a brief overview of existing and potential applications to <b>solar</b> <b>images</b> taken in the ultraviolet.

60|$|So then, if {{we would}} {{diminish}} the Mixture of the Rays, we are to diminish the Diameters of the Circles. Now these would be diminished if the Sun's Diameter to which they answer could be made less than it is, or (which comes to the same Purpose) if without Doors, at a great distance from the Prism towards the Sun, some opake Body were placed, with a round hole {{in the middle of}} it, to intercept all the Sun's Light, excepting so much as coming from the middle of his Body could pass through that Hole to the Prism. For so the Circles AG, BH, and the rest, would not any longer answer to the whole Disque of the Sun, but only to that Part of it which could be seen from the Prism through that Hole, that it is to the apparent Magnitude of that Hole view'd from the Prism. But that these Circles may answer more distinctly to that Hole, a Lens is to be placed by the Prism to cast the Image of the Hole, (that is, every one of the Circles AG, BH, &c.) distinctly upon the Paper at PT, after such a manner, as by a Lens placed at a Window, the Species of Objects abroad are cast distinctly upon a Paper within the Room, and the rectilinear Sides of the oblong <b>Solar</b> <b>Image</b> in the fifth Experiment became distinct without any Penumbra. If this be done, it will not be necessary to place that Hole very far off, no not beyond the Window. And therefore instead of that Hole, I used the Hole in the Window-shut, as follows.|$|E
60|$|Exper. 8. In Summer, {{when the}} Sun's Light uses to be strongest, I placed a Prism at the Hole of the Window-shut, {{as in the}} third Experiment, yet so that its Axis might be {{parallel}} to the Axis of the World, and at the opposite Wall in the Sun's refracted Light, I placed an open Book. Then going six Feet and two Inches from the Book, I placed there the above-mentioned Lens, by which the Light reflected from the Book might be made to converge and meet again at the distance of six Feet and two Inches behind the Lens, and there paint the Species of the Book upon a Sheet of white Paper much after {{the manner of the}} second Experiment. The Book and Lens being made fast, I noted the Place where the Paper was, when the Letters of the Book, illuminated by the fullest red Light of the <b>Solar</b> <b>Image</b> falling upon it, did cast their Species on that Paper most distinctly: And then I stay'd till by the Motion of the Sun, and consequent Motion of his Image on the Book, all the Colours from that red {{to the middle of the}} blue pass'd over those Letters; and when those Letters were illuminated by that blue, I noted again the Place of the Paper when they cast their Species most distinctly upon it: And I found that this last Place of the Paper was nearer to the Lens than its former Place by about two Inches and an half, or two and three quarters. So much sooner therefore did the Light in the violet end of the Image by a greater Refraction converge and meet, than the Light in the red end. But in trying this, the Chamber was as dark as I could make it. For, if these Colours be diluted and weakned by the Mixture of any adventitious Light, the distance between the Places of the Paper will not be so great. This distance in the second Experiment, where the Colours of natural Bodies were made use of, was but an Inch and an half, by reason of the Imperfection of those Colours. Here in the Colours of the Prism, which are manifestly more full, intense, and lively than those of natural Bodies, the distance is two Inches and three quarters. And were the Colours still more full, I question not but that the distance would be considerably greater. For the coloured Light of the Prism, by the interfering of the Circles described in the second Figure of the fifth Experiment, and also by the Light of the very bright Clouds next the Sun's Body intermixing with these Colours, and by the Light scattered by the Inequalities in the Polish of the Prism, was so very much compounded, that the Species which those faint and dark Colours, the indigo and violet, cast upon the Paper were not distinct enough to be well observed.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, I made an Instrument XY {{in fashion}} of a Comb, whose Teeth being in number sixteen, were about an Inch {{and a half}} broad, and the Intervals of the Teeth about two Inches wide. Then by {{interposing}} successively the Teeth of this Instrument near the Lens, I intercepted Part of the Colours by the interposed Tooth, whilst {{the rest of them}} went on through the Interval of the Teeth to the Paper DE, and there painted a round <b>Solar</b> <b>Image.</b> But the Paper I had first placed so, that the Image might appear white as often as the Comb was taken away; and then the Comb being as was said interposed, that Whiteness by reason of the intercepted Part of the Colours at the Lens did always change into the Colour compounded of those Colours which were not intercepted, and that Colour was by the Motion of the Comb perpetually varied so, that in the passing of every Tooth over the Lens all these Colours, red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, did always succeed one another. I caused therefore all the Teeth to pass successively over the Lens, and when the Motion was slow, there appeared a perpetual Succession of the Colours upon the Paper: But if I so much accelerated the Motion, that the Colours by reason of their quick Succession could not be distinguished from one another, the Appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was no red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer, but from a Confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour. Of the Light which now by the Mixture of all the Colours appeared white, there was no Part really white. One Part was red, another yellow, a third green, a fourth blue, a fifth purple, and every Part retains its proper Colour till it strike the Sensorium. If the Impressions follow one another slowly, so that they may be severally perceived, there is made a distinct Sensation of all the Colours one after another in a continual Succession. But if the Impressions follow one another so quickly, that they cannot be severally perceived, there ariseth out of them all one common Sensation, which is neither of this Colour alone nor of that alone, but hath it self indifferently to 'em all, and this is a Sensation of Whiteness. By the Quickness of the Successions, the Impressions of the several Colours are confounded in the Sensorium, and out of that Confusion ariseth a mix'd Sensation. If a burning Coal be nimbly moved round in a Circle with Gyrations continually repeated, the whole Circle will appear like Fire; the reason of which is, that the Sensation of the Coal in the several Places of that Circle remains impress'd on the Sensorium, until the Coal return again to the same Place. And so in a quick Consecution of the Colours the Impression of every Colour remains in the Sensorium, until a Revolution of all the Colours be compleated, and that first Colour return again. The Impressions therefore of all the successive Colours are at once in the Sensorium, and jointly stir up a Sensation of them all; and so it is manifest by this Experiment, that the commix'd Impressions of all the Colours do stir up and beget a Sensation of white, that is, that Whiteness is compounded of all the Colours.|$|E

60|$|In a {{very dark}} Chamber, at a round Hole, about one third Part of an Inch broad, made in the Shut of a Window, I placed a Glass Prism, whereby the Beam of the Sun's Light, which came in at that Hole, might be refracted upwards toward the {{opposite}} Wall of the Chamber, and there form a colour'd Image of the Sun. The Axis of the Prism (that is, the Line passing {{through the middle of}} the Prism from one end of it to the other end parallel {{to the edge of the}} Refracting Angle) was in this and the following Experiments perpendicular to the incident Rays. About this Axis I turned the Prism slowly, and saw the refracted Light on the Wall, or coloured Image of the Sun, first to descend, and then to ascend. Between the Descent and Ascent, when the Image seemed Stationary, I stopp'd the Prism, and fix'd it in that Posture, that it should be moved no more. For in that Posture the Refractions of the Light at the two Sides of the refracting Angle, that is, at the Entrance of the Rays into the Prism, and at their going out of it, were equal to one another.[C] So also in other Experiments, as often as I would have the Refractions on both sides the Prism to be equal to one another, I noted the Place where the Image of the Sun formed by the refracted Light stood still between its two contrary Motions, in the common Period of its Progress and Regress; and when the Image fell upon that Place, I made fast the Prism. And in this Posture, as the most convenient, it is to be understood that all the Prisms are placed in the following Experiments, unless where some other Posture is described. The Prism therefore being placed in this Posture, I let the refracted Light fall perpendicularly upon a Sheet of white Paper at the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and observed the Figure and Dimensions of the <b>Solar</b> <b>Image</b> formed on the Paper by that Light. This Image was Oblong and not Oval, but terminated with two Rectilinear and Parallel Sides, and two Semicircular Ends. On its Sides it was bounded pretty distinctly, but on its Ends very confusedly and indistinctly, the Light there decaying and vanishing by degrees. The Breadth of this Image answered to the Sun's Diameter, and was about two Inches and the eighth Part of an Inch, including the Penumbra. For the Image was eighteen Feet and an half distant from the Prism, and at this distance that Breadth, if diminished by the Diameter of the Hole in the Window-shut, that is by a quarter of an Inch, subtended an Angle at the Prism of about half a Degree, which is the Sun's apparent Diameter. But the Length of the Image was about ten Inches and a quarter, and the Length of the Rectilinear Sides about eight Inches; and the refracting Angle of the Prism, whereby so great a Length was made, was 64 degrees. With a less Angle the Length of the Image was less, the Breadth remaining the same. If the Prism was turned about its Axis that way which made the Rays emerge more obliquely out of the second refracting Surface of the Prism, the Image soon became an Inch or two longer, or more; and if the Prism was turned about the contrary way, so as to make the Rays fall more obliquely on the first refracting Surface, the Image soon became an Inch or two shorter. And therefore in trying this Experiment, I was as curious as I could be in placing the Prism by the above-mention'd Rule exactly in such a Posture, that the Refractions of the Rays at their Emergence out of the Prism might be equal to that at their Incidence on it. This Prism had some Veins running along within the Glass from one end to the other, which scattered some of the Sun's Light irregularly, but had no sensible Effect in increasing the Length of the coloured Spectrum. For I tried the same Experiment with other Prisms with the same Success. And particularly with a Prism which seemed free from such Veins, and whose refracting Angle was 62-1/2 Degrees, I found the Length of the Image 9-3/4 or 10 Inches at the distance of 18-1/2 Feet from the Prism, the Breadth of the Hole in the Window-shut being 1/4 of an Inch, as before. And because it is easy to commit a Mistake in placing the Prism in its due Posture, I repeated the Experiment four or five Times, and always found the Length of the Image that which is set down above. With another Prism of clearer Glass and better Polish, which seemed free from Veins, and whose refracting Angle was 63-1/2 Degrees, the Length of this Image at the same distance of 18-1/2 Feet was also about 10 Inches, or 10-1/8. Beyond these Measures for about a 1/4 or 1/3 of an Inch at either end of the Spectrum the Light of the Clouds seemed to be a little tinged with red and violet, but so very faintly, that I suspected that Tincture might either wholly, or in great Measure arise from some Rays of the Spectrum scattered irregularly by some Inequalities in the Substance and Polish of the Glass, and therefore I did not include it in these Measures. Now the different Magnitude of the hole in the Window-shut, and different thickness of the Prism where the Rays passed through it, and different inclinations of the Prism to the Horizon, made no sensible changes in the length of the Image. Neither did the different matter of the Prisms make any: for in a Vessel made of polished Plates of Glass cemented together in the shape of a Prism and filled with Water, there is the like Success of the Experiment according to the quantity of the Refraction. It is farther to be observed, that the Rays went on in right Lines from the Prism to the Image, and therefore at their very going out of the Prism had all that Inclination to one another from which the length of the Image proceeded, that is, the Inclination of more than two degrees and an half. And yet according to the Laws of Opticks vulgarly received, they could not possibly be so much inclined to one another.[D] For let EG [Fig. 13. (p. 27)] represent the Window-shut, F the hole made therein through which a beam of the Sun's Light was transmitted into the darkened Chamber, and ABC a Triangular Imaginary Plane whereby the Prism is feigned to be cut transversely through the middle of the Light. Or if you please, let ABC represent the Prism it self, looking directly towards the Spectator's Eye with its nearer end: And let XY be the Sun, MN the Paper upon which the <b>Solar</b> <b>Image</b> or Spectrum is cast, and PT the Image it self whose sides towards v and w are Rectilinear and Parallel, and ends towards P and T Semicircular. YKHP and XLJT are two Rays, the first of which comes from the lower part of the Sun to the higher part of the Image, and is refracted in the Prism at K and H, and the latter comes from the higher part of the Sun to the lower part of the Image, and is refracted at L and J. Since the Refractions on both sides the Prism are equal to one another, that is, the Refraction at K equal to the Refraction at J, and the Refraction at L equal to the Refraction at H, so that the Refractions of the incident Rays at K and L taken together, are equal to the Refractions of the emergent Rays at H and J taken together: it follows by adding equal things to equal things, that the Refractions at K and H taken together, are equal to the Refractions at J and L taken together, and therefore the two Rays being equally refracted, have the same Inclination to one another after Refraction which they had before; that is, the Inclination of half a Degree answering to the Sun's Diameter. For so great was the inclination of the Rays to one another before Refraction. So then, the length of the Image PT would by the Rules of Vulgar Opticks subtend an Angle of half a Degree at the Prism, and by Consequence be equal to the breadth vw; and therefore the Image would be round. Thus it would be were the two Rays XLJT and YKHP, and all the rest which form the Image PwTv, alike refrangible. And therefore seeing by Experience it is found that the Image is not round, but about five times longer than broad, the Rays which going to the upper end P of the Image suffer the greatest Refraction, must be more refrangible than those which go to the lower end T, unless the Inequality of Refraction be casual.|$|E

The <b>solar</b> <b>images</b> are constructed after removing the traces of cosmic rays on the raw CCD data files. Thus, while applying the method of removing the cosmic rays traces, we can estimate the cosmic rays flux by {{counting the number of}} traces. The cosmic ray flux in the steady state might be the sum of the solar and galactic cosmic rays. However, the abrupt change in the flux could be assumed to be originated from the Sun. Therefore, we can identify the solar origins of the sudden solar cosmic ray flux changes from the phenomena shown in the processed <b>solar</b> <b>images.</b> The results using the data of SOHO/EIT are presented. The estimated cosmic ray flux in the steady state is the anti-correlated with sunspot numbers, which shows the minima in cosmic ray flux at the solar cycle maxima defined by the sunspot numbers. The profiles of estimated solar cosmic ray associated with ground level enhancements observed by the ground neutron monitor have the significant increase in the cosmic ray flux with good correlation.

5000|$|The {{observatory}} {{has three}} main optical telescopes:Eastern Equatorial {{room is a}} 6 in f/12 Super Planetary Refractor manufactured by Astro-Physics of Machesney Park, Illinois, USA, which uses a G11 Equatorial Mount from Losmandy of Los Angeles, California, USA. The telescope is dedicated to former Observatory Director E. Jay Sarton.Western Equatorial room is a 14 in f/11 C14 Schmidt-Cassegrain Reflector manufactured by Celestron of Torrance, California, USA, which uses a Celestron CGE Computerized German Equatorial Mount. The telescope was donated in 1987 to the Observatory as [...] "A gift from {{the people of the}} Southern Tier". Southern Equatorial room is a 20 in f/8 Ritchey-Chretien Reflector and German Equatorial Mount manufactured by Optical Guidance Systems of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, US. The telescope was donated by the Kopernik Astronomical Society. It {{is one of the largest}} publicly usable telescopes in New York State. The Heliostat is mounted in the main building's physics laboratory/classroom. It is basically two mirrors angled just right to reflect light into an 4 in f/12 refractor telescope that runs about 6 in down through the ceiling and projects the <b>solar</b> <b>image</b> projected as a 7 in diameter white-light image onto the classroom wall. The mirrors track the sun through electric servo motors. The telescope was dedicated in 2104 to Robert A. [...] "Barlow Bob" [...] Godfrey.There are a number of other telescope available for use including four 8 in Orion Newtonians, 1 10 in Meade Newtonian, and 12 4.125 in f/4.2 Astroscan aluminized and overcoated borosilicate glass parabolic primary mirror with a focal length of 17.5 in.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the heliographic coordinates of various solar {{features in the}} <b>solar</b> <b>image</b> one should know the alignment of the image. In practice, there are several methods to mark {{the direction of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>image.</b> A method that automatically nds several types of the alignment marker in the <b>solar</b> <b>image</b> is presented.

40|$|Abstract. The solar {{chromosphere}} {{consists of}} three classes which contribute differently to ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth. We describe a data set of <b>solar</b> <b>images,</b> means of segmenting the images into the constituent classes, and a novel high-level represent ation for compact objects based on a triangulated spatial ‘membership function’. Such representations are fitted in a variable-dimension Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array (MSSTA) has {{obtained}} numerous high-resolution soft X-ray/EUV/FUV <b>solar</b> <b>images</b> with multilayer telescopes; these show dramatic prominences, spicules, and threadlike limb structures. There is excellent correlation between faint Lyman-alpha coronal structures {{seen in the}} digitized MSSTA images and prominences seen in H-alpha images gathered by ground-based observatories. The MSSTA has established the feasibility of an all-reflecting, imaging Ly-alpha coronagraph/polarimeter...|$|R
