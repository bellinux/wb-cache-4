The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis.

Chomsky updated the model as [...] "fear", often as 'the enemy' or an 'evil dictator' such as Colonel Gaddafi, Paul Biya, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>or</b> Slobodan Milosevic.

5000|$|As a manager, Magath quickly gained {{respect and}} became notorious for his hard, {{grinding}} training methods, laying {{heavy emphasis on}} discipline, fitness and conditioning. Players gave him nicknames like [...] "Saddam" [...] (<b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein)</b> <b>or</b> “Quälix”, a rhyming mash of his first name Felix and the German verb “quälen” (to torture). He was once described by former Eintracht Frankfurt player Bachirou Salou as the [...] "last dictator in Europe". After leaving Fulham in September 2014, bizarre stories emerged about how Magath had suggested that Brede Hangeland rub cheese on a thigh injury. Magath stated that Hangeland didn't have a thigh injury but an inflammation of the knee, and that he suggested the additional use of an alternative treatment with a bandage (dressing) consisting of Quark. Fulham player Sascha Riether later explained that the story was greatly exaggerated and that Magath had suggested he use a traditional topfen curd.|$|E
5000|$|The {{repeated}} accusation by Vice President Cheney that Iraq harbored Abdul Rahman Yasin, one of {{the perpetrators}} of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, conflicts with Iraq's 1998 offer to the FBI of extradition for Yasin {{in return for a}} statement clearing Iraq from any role in the attack. Even though the CIA and FBI had already concluded that Iraq played no role in the attack, the Clinton administration refused the offer. Iraq also offered to extradite Yasin in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks. In June 2002, an unnamed US intelligence official told 60 Minutes that Iraq had attached [...] "extreme conditions" [...] to the handing over of Yasin. According to the official, the Iraqis wanted the U.S. to sign a document laying out where Yasin had been since 1993, but that the US did not agree with their version of the facts. In any case, Yasin had cooperated with the FBI and they had released him, although they would later call it a [...] "mistake." [...] The CIA and FBI had nevertheless concluded in 1995 and 1996 that [...] "the Iraqi government was in no way involved in the attack." [...] Counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke called the allegations [...] "absolutely without foundation." [...] The Iraqis made another offer to the Bush Administration in 2003 but this offer was also spurned. al-Qaeda did not have any relationship with <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>or</b> his regime. We had to draw up a plan to enter Iraq through the north that was not under the control of his regime. We would then spread south to the areas of our fraternal Sunni brothers. The fraternal brothers of the Ansar al-Islamexpressed their willingness to offer assistance to help us achieve this goal. Saif al-Adel Former National Security Council counterterrorism directors Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon summarized the problem with the Bush Administration's view {{in the eyes of the}} intelligence community: [...] "The administration pressed its case for war most emphatically by arguing that U.S. national security was imperiled by Saddam's ties to al-Qaeda. The argument had the obvious virtue of playing to the public's desire to see the war on terrorism prosecuted aggressively and conclusively. Yet, scant proof of these links was presented. The record showed a small number of contacts between jihadists and Iraqi officials. This was treated as the tip of an unseen iceberg of cooperation, even though it fell far short of anything that resembled significant cooperation in the eyes of the counterterrorism community—as it always had. No persuasive proof was given of money, weaponry, or training being provided." ...|$|E
40|$|More {{often than}} not when {{conversation}} turns to politics and politicians, discussion focuses on personalities. There is a certain fascination with analyzing political leaders. As a result, biographies on current political figures become best sellers and the triumphs {{as well as the}} tragedies of political leaders become newspaper headlines. A major reason for our curiosity about the personal characteristics of such leaders is the realization that their preferences, the things they believe in and work for, and the ways they go about making decisions can influence our lives. But how can we learn about the personalities and, in particular, the leadership styles of political leaders in more than a cursory fashion? It is hard to conceive of giving people like Tony Blair, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> <b>or</b> Boris Yeltsin a battery of psychological tests or having them submit to a series of clinical interviews. Not only would they not have time for, or tolerate, such procedures, they would be wary that the results, if made public, might prove politically damaging to them. One way of learning more about political leaders that does not require their cooperation is by examining what they say. Only movie stars, hit rock groups, and athletes probably leav...|$|E
