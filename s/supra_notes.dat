40|$|It is now {{accepted}} {{wisdom that}} it was the non-transparent, poorly capitalized and almost wholly unregulated over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives market that lit the fuse that exploded the highly vulnerable worldwide economy in the fall of 2008. [1] Because tens of trillions of dollars of these financial products were pegged to the economic performance of an overheated and highly inflated housing market, the sudden collapse of that market triggered under-capitalized OTC derivative guarantees of the subprime housing market; and the guarantors’ multi-trillion dollar interconnectedness with thousands of other OTC derivatives’ counterparties within that OTC market (through interest rate, currency, foreign exchange, and energy derivatives) required taxpayers to plug the huge capital holes that cascading nonpayment would have caused, thereby leading the world’s economy to crater. [2] As it now stands, the world is still {{in the midst of the}} worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930 ’s. This article explains the history of derivatives products, including the highly charged political events surrounding deregulation of these huge financial markets even in the face of mounting evidence of the danger that those unregulated instruments could cause the U. S. and world financial system. [3] The article then provides an overview of how recent Congressional OTC derivatives financial reform—Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) —will substantially mitigate those risks if properly implemented by federal regulators, while at the same time allowing financial markets to thrive through ensuring capital adequacy, transparency and liquidity. [4] The article ends with a vision for what the financial system would look like if Dodd-Frank is implemented as its drafters intended. [5] [1].

In the pre-dawn hours on Boston’s Hyde Park Avenue, a Honda Civic drifted across the median and slammed into an oncoming car. [1] The drifting driver, a young {{man by the name}} of Patrick Fortuna, died. [2] The four occupants of the other vehicle were rushed to the hospital with serious injuries, a painful litany of bone fractures, cuts and concussions. [3] Police reports indicated that the deceased driver was at fault. [4] Given the roughly thirty-three thousand killed and 2. 3 million injured on U. S. roads each year,[5] this collision—though undoubtedly horrific for those involved—ostensibly did not warrant more than a few sentences in the local police blotter.

40|$|In 1848, New York {{enacted a}} code of civil {{procedure}} that powerfully influenced the common law world. The Field Code, named after one of its drafters, David Dudley Field, systematized New York’s procedural law and combined the previously separate systems of common law and equity. In the following decades, thirty other American states enacted versions of the Code, and English legal reformers studied New York’s experience to inform their efforts at fusion. Although scholars agree on this general outline,[1] they differ regarding what the Code really accomplished. Writing in 1948,[2] Roscoe Pound argued that {{the characteristics of the}} modern Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “could have been attained at least eighty years [earlier] if Field’s Code of Civil Procedure had been developed and applied in its spirit instead of the spirit of maintaining historical continuity. ”[3] Pound particularly praised the “equitable shortcuts” of the Code. [4] [1] See, e. g., Lawrence Friedman, A History of American Law 293 - 97 (3 d. ed., 2005); Robert W. Millar, Civil Procedure of the Trial Court in Historical Perspective 54 - 55 (1952). [2] For the centennial of the Field Code, Professor Alison Reppy organized a conference on the Code at New York Law School. See David Dudley Field: Centenary Essays (Alison Reppy ed., 1949) [hereinafter Centenary Essays]. The presentations typically celebrated more than they clarified, however. The presenters frequently relied on Henry Martyn Field’s biography of his brother, Henry Martyn Field, The Life of David Dudley Field (1898) [hereinafter Life of Field], and they occasionally retain Henry’s extreme rhetoric. For instance, Reppy concluded that Field “believed that with righteousness on his side, he would gather strength as he fought the battle to cut a passage through the labyrinth of judicial myth and precept and ‘cast up a highway that should lead straight to the Temple of Justice. ’” Alison Reppy, The Field Codification Concept, in Centenary Essays, supra, at 52 (quoting Life of Field, supra, at viii).

2500|$|By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit {{extended}} Morse's rationale about {{illegal drugs}} to {{the context of}} student speech that is [...] "construed as a threat of school violence". Boim, 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension {{of a high school}} student for a story labeled as a [...] "dream" [...] in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where [...] " [...] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [...] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment". Id. at 983 (quoting Scott v. Sch. Bd., 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

40|$|The defendant-first {{approach}} advocated in this Article is {{more difficult}} to implement than either the current policy admitting any proffered expert testimony or the exclusionary reform advanced by many commentators. It requires some mechanism for apprising the state when the defense intends to use clinical prediction testimony. When no such intent is registered, it demands that any other clinical testimony, whether offered by the state or the defense, be carefully monitored to insure that the dangerousness issue is not raised; it may require revamping other procedures as well. 2 " But the defendant-first approach also presents the factfinder with the most reliable, most relevant, and least prejudicial information on the dangerousness issue: hard actuarial data and proof of prior bad acts. At the same time, it does not foreclose the defense from presenting clinically obtained and combined information on the dangerousness issue. Moreover, since the defense may frequently elect not to use clinical prediction testimony, it should force the state to generate alternative sources of information on dangerousness;in particular, it should improve the art of prediction by providing an incentive to develop hard actuarial data. Finally, the defendant-first approach conforms more closely than either wholesale admission or exclusion with due process notions of fairness and fifth amendment selfincrimination jurisprudence. Most significantly, the aforementioned need to have the defense's expert testify first so as to permit the judge to gauge the appropriate scope of the prosecution's rebuttal may necessitate changes in typical practice.

40|$|The {{momentum}} behind {{development of}} global online fast track low value high volume dispute resolution (hereafter ODR) continues to accelerate. Consumer and business {{groups around the}} world are promoting fair, proportionate, effective, online, fast track redress for low value high volume cross border e-commerce disputes. As a result, there will continue to be increasing demand for a variety of effective ODR systems design and procedural rules. Best practices developed by entities like eBay and lessons learned from the work of UNCITRAL Working Group III can be helpful in developing framework models for fast track low value high volume e-commerce ODR systems. E-commerce ODR systems like eBay’s provide a marketplace for e-commerce as well as an electronic system for fast track resolution of disputes which arise on their e-commerce marketplace. Ordinary ODR systems do not provide an e-commerce marketplace but only provide for resolution of disputes. Accordingly, best practices developed by eBay’s e-commerce ODR system discussed in this article are generally applicable and needed by e-commerce ODR systems, but generally inapplicable and not needed by ordinary ODR systems. This article addresses development by eBay of its highly successful fast track low value high volume e-commerce ODR system by application of the following four best practices: (i) Low Value Parameters: Adoption of a generally applicable de facto low value workable monetary “standard” (for example, the Purchase Price “Money Back Guarantee” discussed infra) rather than a “numeric” (i. e. $ 15, 000) monetary description for disputes which are eligible for resolution on the providers’ platforms facilitates global development of fast track low value high volume ODR systems. A $ 15, 000, $ 10, 000 or $ 5, 000 monetary ceiling for low value disputes might constitute low value in a developed economy. It will not in an underdeveloped economy. Hence the need for a low value workable monetary “standard” rather than an unworkable “numeric” monetary description. As indicated, the eBay Purchase Price “Money Back Guarantee” cap on the amount of a permissible claim provides a workable standard in developed and underdeveloped economies. (ii) Limitation of Types of Claims: Leaving resolution of disputes involving high value and complicated legal issues to other forums, eBay’s fast track ODR eligibility requirements also limit the complexity and scope of permissible claims (i. e. claims eligible for resolution on its platform) by giving buyers a “Money Back Guarantee,” which, as <b>noted</b> <b>supra,</b> caps the amount a buyer may claim to recovery of purchase price paid, and also limits the types of claims to “Items not received” or “Items not as described. ” These limitations on the amount and types of claims permitted facilitate fast track and fair resolution of disputes and enables eBay to handle 60, 000, 000 e-commerce disputes annually averaging $ 70 -$ 100 in value. (iii) Buyers’ On-Demand Access to Automated Trustmark Evaluation/Feedback Information Needed to Identify Reliable Sellers: Vital to facilitating e-commerce between buyers and sellers, often {{in different parts of the}} world and speaking different languages, is developing trust between buyers and sellers to give them the confidence they need to enter into electronic transactions. eBay’s solution to developing this trust between buyers and sellers is the Automated Trustmark Evaluation/Feedback System. This system enables buyers involved in electronically purchasing low value high-volume items to quickly identify on demand a reliable seller without doing extensive research. Buyers seeking to make purchases using the eBay platform are able to assess the reliability of sellers with whom they anticipate doing business based on ratings and feedback derived from performance data supplied electronically by previous buyers after each transaction they completed on the eBay platform. (iv) Private Enforcement After discussing (i) Low Value Parameters, (ii) Limitation of Types of Claims, and (iii) Buyers’ On Demand Access to Automated Trustmark Evaluation/Feedback Information Needed to Identify Reliable Sellers, we address (iv) Private Enforcement measures available to enforce settled claims and rulings of neutrals to successfully implement fast track low value high volume e-commerce systems...|$|R
