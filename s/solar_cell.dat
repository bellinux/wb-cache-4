5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell {{recognized the importance of}} this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.|$|E
50|$|Excitonic <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> generates {{free charge}} by bound and {{intermediate}} exciton states unlike inorganic and crystalline <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> The {{efficiency of the}} excitonic <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and inorganic <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> (with less exciton-binding energy). cannot go beyond 31% as explained by Shockley and Queisser.|$|R
50|$|Polymer <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> {{have yet}} to commercially compete with silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and other {{thin-film}} cells. The present efficiency of polymer <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> lies near 10%, well below silicon <b>cells.</b> Polymer <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> also suffer from environmental degradation, lacking effective protective coatings.|$|R
5000|$|This {{approach}} {{should only}} be used for comparing <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> with comparable layout. For instance, a comparison between primarily quadratical <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> like typical crystalline silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and narrow but long <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> like typical thin film <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> can lead to wrong assumptions caused by {{the different kinds of}} current paths and therefore the influence of, for instance, a distributed series resistance contribution to rS. [...] Macro-architecture of the <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> could result in different surface areas being placed in any fixed volume - particularly for thin film <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and flexible <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> which may allow for highly convoluted folded structures. If volume is the binding constraint, then efficiency density based on surface area may be of less relevance.|$|R
5|$|Tellurium {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E

25|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is any {{device that}} {{directly}} converts the energy in light into electrical energy {{through the process}} of photovoltaics. Although French physicist Antoine-César Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect much earlier in 1839, the first <b>solar</b> <b>cell,</b> according to Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> was invented by another American named Russell Ohl. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through their improvement of the silicone <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> in 1954, which by placing them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.|$|E

25|$|The most {{efficient}} type of <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> {{to date is}} a multi-junction concentrator <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> with an efficiency of 46.0% produced by Fraunhofer ISE in December 2014. The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by Sharp Corporation at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009, and Boeing Spectrolab (40.7% also using a triple-layer design). The US company SunPower produces cells that have an efficiency of 21.5%, well above the market average of 12–18%.|$|E

30|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>cells</b> are {{devices to}} convert {{sunlight}} to electricity by photovoltaic effects. Multiple generations of <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been developed}} since the 1940 s. <b>Solar</b> <b>cells</b> made from crystalline silicon and GaAs show outstanding performances but are limited by {{the high cost of}} material and fabrication. Thin film <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> made from CdTe and CIGS are promising but still suffer from cost issues. Other interesting systems include dye-sensitized and organic <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> which benefit from their lower fabrication cost and larger flexibility.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> {{the material}} that holds the photovoltaic material generally costs more than the material itself. With inkjet printing {{it is possible to}} print <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> on paper. This will allow <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> to be much cheaper and be placed almost anywhere. Paper thin <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> or eventually direct 3D printing will allow to create <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> on blinds, in windows, in curtains, and almost anywhere in the home. This is very promising and could be the future of solar power.|$|R
50|$|Relative to {{the best}} of polymer-fullerene {{heterojunction}} <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> that have PCEs of about 10%, polychiral nanotube and fullerene <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are still a far ways off. Nevertheless, these findings push the achievable limits of CNT technology in <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> The ability for polychiral nanotubes to absorb in the NIR regime is a technology that can be utilized to improve the efficiencies of future of multi-junction tandem <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> along with increasing the lifetime and durability of future noncrystalline <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|CdTe {{is used to}} make {{thin film}} solar cells, {{accounting}} for about 8% of all solar cells installed in 2011. They are among the lowest-cost types of <b>solar</b> <b>cell,</b> although a comparison of total installed cost depends on installation size and many other factors, and has changed rapidly from year to year. The CdTe <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> market is dominated by First Solar. In 2011, around 2 GWp of CdTe solar cells were produced; For more details and discussion see cadmium telluride photovoltaics.|$|E
25|$|Air mass affects output. In space, {{where there}} is no atmosphere, the {{spectrum}} of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, air filters the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from Air Mass 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.|$|E
