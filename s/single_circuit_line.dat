Power purchase agreements, grid connection guidelines were also developed {{with the development of}} the industry. Limitations on the grid connection capability were also laid down. Two of the main limitations are as follows; a) Maximum capacity of generation that can be connected to a Grid Substation with 2 * 31. 5 MVA transformers is limited to 25 MW. b) Maximum capacity of total generators that may be connected to the system be limited to the lower of either, 6 % of the peak power demand or 15 % of the Off Peak power demand. It is stated that these limitations are to be revised with time to be in line with the latest system parameters and configurations. Since no study has yet been made to review these, an attempt is made to review the above limitations. This study is mainly forcussed on the first limitation. On analyzing the grid substation capacity limitation, it is noted that a detail study of the pattern of generation and the details of the individual feeder loads need to be made. Since there is a minimum (guaranteed load) at each GSS, this load can be considered in arriving at the maximum amount of DGs that can be connected at each GSS. Accordingly it is noted that the maximum capacity of DGs that can be connected at Balangoda and Ratnapura grid substations with (n- 1) reliability criteria amount to 40 and 38 MVA respectively. These values are calculated with load values at each of the grid substations relating to year 2010. As the demand for electricity has been increasing at around 9 % annually in Sabaragamuwa province these values will also subject to revision annually. It is noted that transmission system is having its limitations mainly on the Lynx <b>single</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>line</b> from Polpitiya to Seethawaka.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} the performance of the controller developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) for Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) using Real Time Digital Simula-tor (RTDS). The TCSC controller was developed for the Kanpur-Ballabhgarh 400 kV <b>single</b> <b>circuit</b> ac transmission <b>line</b> located in North India. It is designed to perform im-portant functions like impedance control, current control in the line and damping of power swing oscillation caused by system disturbances. It also reduces the stress on Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV) during faults and protects the capacitor against overvoltage and the Thyristor Con-trolled Reactor (TCR) against over current. The control system block diagram scheme has been arrived at after rigorous digital simulation studies in MATLAB. The de-veloped scheme is implemented in the control panel using high-speed processor based hardware. TCSC controller was interfaced to RTDS and studies were performed in stages. Initially, a simplified circuit consisting of Kanpur-Ballabhgarh line with both ends represented by Thevenin equivalent source and impedance was considered. The transient response of the controller was studied for step changes in TCSC impedance and line current. In the sec-ond phase of the studies, the northern region power system was represented and various contingencies were simulated. The performance of the controller in damping the power swing oscillation in the Kanpur-Ballabhgarh line was demonstrated. Some of the important results of RTDS studies have been compared with the MATLAB digital simulation results. Both the results were in close concurrence...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{possible}} to load the transmission lines very close to their thermal limits by allowing the conductors to carry usual ac along with dc super imposed on it. The added dc power flow does not cause any transient instability. This project gives the feasibility of converting a double <b>circuit</b> ac <b>line</b> into composite ac–dc power transmission line to get the advantages of parallel ac–dc transmission to improve stability and damping out oscillations. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out for the coordinated control as well as independent control of ac and dc power transmissions. No alterations of conductors, insulator strings, and towers of the original line are needed. The present situation demands the review of traditional power transmission theory and practice, on the basis of new concepts that allow full utilization of existing transmission facilities without decreasing system availability and security. To achieve this is by simultaneous ac–dc power transmission in which the conductors are allowed to carry superimposed dc current along with ac current. Ac and dc power flow independently, and the added dc power flow does not cause any transient instability. Simultaneous ac–dc power transmission was first proposed through a <b>single</b> <b>circuit</b> ac transmission <b>line.</b> In these proposals Mono-polar dc transmission with ground as return path was used. There were certain limitations due to use of ground as return path. Moreover, the instantaneous value of each conductor voltage with respect to ground becomes higher by the amount of the dc voltage, and more discs are to be added in each insulator string to withstand this increased voltage. In this paper, the feasibility study of conversion of a double <b>circuit</b> ac <b>line</b> to composite ac–dc line without altering the original line conductors, tower structures, and insulator strings has been presented. In this scheme, the dc power flow is point-to point bipolar transmission system. The novelty of our proposed scheme is that the power transfer enhancement is achieved without any alteration in the existing EHV ac line. The main object is to gain the advantage of parallel ac–dc transmission and to load the line close to its thermal limi...|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{involvement}} of larger number of conductors, the possibility of occurrence of faults in six phase transmission line is more as compared to three phase line. The total number of shunt faults that can occur in six phase system is 120, {{which is much more}} as compared to 22 in three phase double circuit and 11 in three phase <b>single</b> <b>circuit</b> transmission <b>lines</b> (Bhatt et al. 1977; Nanda et al. 1981; Venkata et al. 1982 a, b). The greater number of possible faults in six phase transmission line, demands the use of a relatively more complex, reliable and fast protection scheme. In this regard, limited protection techniques have been reported for protection of six phase lines in literature (Rebbapragada et al. 1992; Apostolov and George 1992; Apostolov and Raffensperger 1996; Oppel et al. 1998; Oppel and Krizauskas 1999; Redfern 1997; Hajjar and Mansour 2006; Hajjar and Mansour M 2007; Coury et al. 2002). Rebbapragada et al. reviewed the applicability of the commercially available digital protection scheme for the protection of six phase line in (Rebbapragada et al. 1992). Apostolov et al. analyzed the implementation of microprocessor based relays with programmable logic (designed for conventional three-phase systems) {{for the protection of the}} six phase test line in (Apostolov and George 1992; Apostolov and Raffensperger 1996). These techniques use voltage and current signals at both ends and thus require a complicated communication channel, which affects the reliability and cost of the protection schemes. A step distance scheme utilizing three phase relays as backup protection has been described in (Oppel et al. 1998). However, the scheme was able to detect only 83  % of the simulated faults cases. Also, for fault cases involving adjacent phases with fault impedance 20  Ω or greater, it’s response was not proper. The performance of a protection scheme developed for six phase test line has been analyzed in (Oppel and Krizauskas 1999). A non unit distance protection scheme for various fault conditions has been addressed by Redfern (1997). A microprocessor and wavelet based relaying approach for detection and classification of shunt faults have been reported in (Hajjar and Mansour 2006). A technique based on wavelet transform has been reported for estimation of fault location in (Hajjar and Mansour 2007).|$|R
