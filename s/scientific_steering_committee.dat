40|$|Executive summary Probabilistic {{methods can}} be used to {{estimate}} the frequency and magnitude of impacts in risk assessment, and to take account of variability and uncertainty. The EU <b>Scientific</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>Committee’s</b> Working Group on the Harmonisation of Risk Assessment has recommended that these methods should be considered for adoption in the general area of human and environmental health. The EUPRA workshop considered the potential of probabilistic methods for assessment of ecological risks of plant protection products, under European Directive 91 / 414 /EEC. The workshop reviewed {{the state of the art}} and included 52 presentations by researchers, end-users and other stakeholders. Summaries of the presentations are included in this report. The participants examined the potential advantages and disadvantages of using probabilistic methods and concluded that they would be a useful addition to the tools for risk assessment, provided they were implemented appropriately to minimise potential disadvantages. The workshop developed detailed recommendations for research and other actions to implement probabilistic methods. These recommendations include development of essentia...|$|R

Accordingly, a series of modifications {{have been made to}} the planned analyses. These updates will ensure that the data from the CANVAS Program will maximize advances in scientific knowledge and patient care. The specification of the analysis strategy prior to knowledge of the trial results, their design by the independent <b>scientific</b> trial <b>Steering</b> <b>Committee,</b> the detailed a priori definition of the analysis plans, and the external review provided by the US Food and Drug Administration all provide maximally efficient and robust utilization of the data.

We believe that the response to this question may be summarized in one word: REALIZATION. The best definition for success is realization. The huge motivation in each one of us made the difference.

The Eighth Annual Research Conference on Population, Reproductive Health and Economic Development will take place from January 22 – 25 in Nairobi, Kenya. Selected papers will advance knowledge and/or methodology, addressing the themes relevant to the PopPov inquiry into how population dynamics and reproductive health affect economic development (see references below). Conference Themes The conference <b>scientific</b> program <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> invites paper submissions that address important issues at the intersection of population, reproductive health and economic prosperity.

40|$|International audienceThe bibliometric study {{presented}} in this communication {{was carried out in}} 2006 for an Advisory Scientific Committee organized by the 3 universities of Aix-Marseilles. This Scientific Committee was made up of scientists coming from other areas of France, from countries of Europe or other parts of the world. To help the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee,</b> the <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> considered that it was necessary to propose a bibliometric study of the three universities' scientific activities. The bibliometric study was not intended to be an instrument for helping in the research assessment of the Aix Marseilles universities, but rather an instrument for helping in the strategic analysis of the three universities' scientific policy. Thus, the methodology employed for this bibliometric study was strongly inspired by strategic analysis methods carried out in companies. The collected data from the WoS were compiled in “scoreboards” showing the evolution of the production of the 13 scientific areas compared in each scientific field for the 6 periods of 4 years. To make the use of such scoreboards easier, relative indicators were computed and translated into graphs in order to offer a global view of the evolution of the Aix-Marseilles area positioning in the chosen scientific fields in relation to the activities of the 12 other scientific areas...|$|R
