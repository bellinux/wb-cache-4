40|$|The {{accuracy}} of early cost estimates {{is critical to}} the success of construction projects. The <b>selected</b> <b>tender</b> price (clients' building cost) is usually seen in previous research as a holistic dependent variable when examining early stage estimates. Unlike other components of construction cost, the amount of contingencies is decided by clients/consultants with consideration of early project information. Cost drivers of contingencies estimates are associated with uncertainty and complexity, and include project size, schedule, ground condition, construction site access, market condition and so on. A path analysis of 133 UK school building contracts was conducted to identify impacts of nine major cost drivers on the determination of contingencies by different clients/cost estimators. This research finds that gross floor area (GFA), schedule and requirement of air conditioning have statistically significant impacts on the contingency determination. The mediating role of schedule between gross floor area and contingencies (GFA→Schedule→Contingencies) was confirmed with the Soble test. The total effects of the three variables on contingencies estimates were obtained with the consideration of this indirect effect. The squared multiple correlation (SMC) of contingencies (= 0. 624) indicates the identified three variables can explain 62. 4...|$|E
40|$|Theme 1 Fjord {{crossings}} by ferries {{are vital}} in the Norwegian trunk road system. The ferries are operated by ferry companies, each ferry company being a monopolist on {{a bundle of}} crossings. The government regulates prices and service frequencies and awards subsidies to the companies {{in order to make}} the ferry services economically viable. Tendering has been suggested as a means to induce cost efficiency and thus reduce costly subsidies. In order to gain experience with tendering on this area, this regime has recently been introduced on a few selected crossings. We argue that this small-scale experiment may not reveal the cost savings that may be obtained by a large-scale experiment. This is due to a ratchet effect: The incumbent ferry companies may not have the incentives to submit low tenders as by doing so, the ferry companies reveals that there is much to gain for the government by carrying through a large-scale tender competition in the future. Such a large-scale tender competition may be harmful to the companies as compared to status quo. Realising this, each company may be reluctant to submit low tenders in the competition for the <b>selected</b> <b>tender</b> crossings. Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies.

Ker gre za porabo javnih sredstev, mora biti celoten postopek pravno urejen. Namen diplomskega dela je na splošno predstaviti področje javnega naročanja v Republiki Sloveniji ter na drugi strani bolj podrobno predstaviti javno naročanje na področju občin. Cilj dela je ugotoviti, ali med naročniki (občinami) in izbranimi ponudniki v postopkih javnega naročanja obstaja teritorialna povezava. Teritorialno povezavo opredeljujem kot povezavo med naročnikom in izbranim ponudnikom, ki ima svoj sedež na območju naročnika (občine). Na podlagi pridobljenih rezultatov ugotavljam, da v analiziranih primerih ni prisotne teritorialne povezave med naročniki in izbranimi ponudniki v tem smislu, da bi se v postopkih oddaje javnih naročil preferiralo domače ponudnike. Izkazalo se je ravno obratno, večina izbranih ponudnikov se je namreč nahajala izven območja občine, ki je v postopku nastopala kot naročnik. Te ugotovitve pa, glede na omejitve raziskave, v kateri se je analiziralo javna naročila le štirih občin, ne moremo posplošiti na vse občine v Republiki Sloveniji. Public {{procurement}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which the}} public sector purchases goods, services and construction performance {{from the private sector}} by means of public resources. As the public funds are used, the complete procedure has to be governed by law. The aim of my thesis is to present the area of public procurement in the Republic of Slovenia in general on one hand and to present public procurement in the area of municipalities in more detail on the other hand. The objective of my thesis is to find out whether there is a territorial connection in the proceedings of public procurement between the clients (municipalities) and the <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer.</b> Territorial connection is defined as a connection between a client and a <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer</b> who has its headquarters {{in the area of the}} client (municipality). Based on the extracted results, I establish that there is no territorial connection present between the clients and the <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer</b> in the analysed examples in the sense that in the award of public contract procedure domestic tenderers are not favoured. In fact, the opposite has proven to be the case as the majority of the selected tenderers are located outside the area of the municipality which performed as the client. These findings, however, cannot be generalized to all municipalities in the Republic of Slovenia due to the limitations of the research study where only public procurements of four municipalities were analysed...|$|R

5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy <b>selected</b> <b>tenders</b> from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to be {{completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|R

Strategic alliances in building construction may be a useful evaluation criterion in assisting public sector construction managers evaluate and <b>select</b> <b>tenders</b> and encourage more co-operative relationships amongst construction project team members. This paper reviews competitiveness of the Australian building construction industry {{in the context of}} the theory of {{strategic alliance}}s between contracting firms and subcontractors; and explores whether implementing strategic alliances provides contracting firms any competitive advantage over competitors. A theoretical concept of strategic alliances is proposed and appropriate indicators of competitive advantage are developed. An analysis framework comprising six attributes of strategic alliances—trust, commitment, interdependence, co-operation, communication and joint problem solving is described. These attributes were used to collect data from 59 building construction firms in South-East Queensland to assess their respective levels of strategic alliance. The formation of strategic alliance relationships between contracting firms and subcontractors is proposed as a component of the tender evaluation process for public works sector...|$|R

5000|$|Eriksson and Westerberg also {{reported}} that traditional procurement focused on competition is suitable for simple and standardised projects with low uncertainty. However, most projects are not like that. There is a trend towards increased complexity, uncertainty, and time pressure in projects, which has rendered traditional procurement procedures obsolete. Chen and Manley emphasized that projects focused on collaborative schemes, {{in which it is}} expected that relationships between project participants will be encouraged, can potentially maximize project outcomes. Cooperative procurement procedures entail among other things, joint specification, <b>selected</b> <b>tendering,</b> soft parameters in bid evaluation, joint subcontractor selection, incentive-based payment, collaborative tools, and contractor self-control. Collaborative approaches to project delivery are believed to be especially appropriate for projects of high complexity and uncertainty. Cardenas, Voordijk, and Dewulf have recently shown that some elements of the collaborative approach to procurement and delivery are beneficial in complex projects. The data on which this finding is originated consist of records on 58 European infrastructure projects. The records were obtained from a review of the pre- and post-contract transactions and were complemented with personalized semi-structured interviews held with the management of the projects.

40|$|The Division Zuid-Holland of the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management {{has used}} a new {{procedure}} for contracting the widening of the A 4 motorway near Leiden. The new procedure paid {{special attention to}} road safety {{in the framework of}} functional contracting. Tenderers could receive an imaginary discount on the tendered price if they were awarded a high rating for incorporating road safety measures into their design proposals. In this way a tender could be more attractive than those paying less attention to road safety. The discount being imaginary, the <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer</b> would be contracted for the sum quoted originally, implying that the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management is dedicating the discounted amount to implementing specific road safety features in the design and construct process. The Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management, Division Zuid-Holland asked SWOV to assess: - whether this approach can be used to stimulate market parties to suggest road safety measures; - whether the chosen valuation method is sufficiently robust; and - whether the chosen method can be refined. Because this new procedure may be an instrument for ensuring quality in design, SWOV answered these questions in the framework of the present research project Quality assurance. SWOV concludes that the introduction of road safety as a condition for allocation is an important way to force market parties {{to pay more attention to}} road safety in drawing up design and construct tenders. The method for determining the so-called tender requirement – a document containing the functional requirements and the contract definitions on the basis of which market parties can draw up their tenders – can be further refined, as can the method to assess the safety effects of the road design in the tenders. General directions for the safety of the road design and road safety audits are important tools in this. The general assessment framework can be derived from the guidelines 'Overview Effects of Infrastructure' (OEI) ...|$|R

In this way the individual who is <b>selecting</b> the <b>tender</b> will be quite confident that the tender is feasible. Bids are not only chosen on cost alone. Sometimes contractors submit lower tenders to win the contract and win the work.
