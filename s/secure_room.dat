25|$|Perry {{remained}} {{outside the}} <b>secure</b> <b>room</b> lying in wait, knife in hand, {{for a visit}} from the pirates who were trying to locate the missing crew members in order to gain control of the ship and presumably sail it to Somalia. Perry tackled the ringleader of the pirates and took him prisoner after a cat-and-mouse chase in a darkened engine room. Pirate ringleader Abduwali Muse cut his hand trying to keep Perry's knife away from his neck. The pirate was then tied up and his wounds were treated by Second Mate Ken Quinn.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{successful}} Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, progress inland was slow. To facilitate the Allied build-up in France and to <b>secure</b> <b>room</b> for further expansion, the deep water port of Cherbourg {{on the western}} flank of the American sector and the historic town of Caen in the British and Canadian sector to the east, were early objectives. The original plan for the Normandy campaign envisioned strong offensive efforts in both sectors, in which the Second Army (Lieutenant-General Sir Miles Dempsey) would secure Caen and the area south {{of it and the}} First US Army (Lieutenant General Omar Bradley) [...] would [...] "wheel round" [...] to the Loire.|$|E

500|$|At Blamey's Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (Adv LHQ) in St Lucia, Queensland, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Major General Frank Berryman, {{headed the}} {{planning}} process. A {{model of the}} Lae-Salamaua area was constructed in a <b>secure</b> <b>room</b> at St Lucia, the windows were boarded up and two guards were posted on the door round the clock. On 16 May, Blamey held a conference with Berryman and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, the commander of I Corps, around the model at which {{the details of the}} operation were discussed. Blamey's operational concept was for a double envelopment of Lae, using [...] "two of the finest divisions on the Allied side". Major General George Wootten's 9th Division would land east of Lae in a shore-to-shore operation and advance on Lae. Meanwhile, Major General George Alan Vasey's 7th Division, in a reprise of the Battle of Buna–Gona in 1942, would advance on Lae from the west by an overland route. Its primary role was to prevent reinforcement of the Japanese garrison at Lae by establishing itself in a blocking position across the Markham Valley. Its secondary task was to assist the 9th Division in the capture of Lae. The plan was generally known as Operation POSTERN, although this was actually the GHQ code name for Lae itself.|$|E

[...] Changes to {{policies have been}} introduced in the California (U.S.) legislature that identify schools as key institution of support for adolescent mothers.

5000|$|There are two categories; each must be {{addressed}} differently.

50|$|Many {{building}} codes require {{the presence of}} speakers in a <b>secure</b> <b>room</b> for emergency announcements.

It is essentially an audio diode; sound only goes one way.|$|E
