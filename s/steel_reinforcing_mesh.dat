30|$|Taken together, {{the tests}} {{described}} in this report highlight {{a number of important}} construction details and potential construction errors which may appear inconsequential to a building contractor, but which may have a profound impact on the structural fire response and integrity of a building during fire. Examples of this include integrity of fire stopping during large deformations, lapping of <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh,</b> anchorage of <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> over shear studs on protected perimeter beams, use of deformed versus smooth bars for reinforcement (potentially leading to strain localization and tensile failure of deformed steel bars during fire), proper anchorage and grouting of hollowcore slabs, use of specific types of bolted steel connections to promote connection ductility and rotational capacity during fire, quality, uniformity, and robustness of structural fire protection materials (either passive or intumescent), and so on. Serious unknowns continue to surround many, if not all, of these issues, and {{there is a need for}} testing to support the development of best practice guidance which can be used to provide quality assurance programs on construction sites of so-called ‘fire engineered’ buildings.|$|E
30|$|The main {{conclusions}} {{from this study}} demonstrated that using cellular secondary beams to support a composite slab does not jeopardise the tensile membrane action that develops in such a slab in a fire situation. Maximum <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> temperatures in the slab were less than 375 °C, suggesting less than 5 % strength loss. As an aside, {{it is noteworthy that}} despite using various tools (e.g. the Ozone program (Cadorin et al. 2001) and the predicted parametric fire curve specified in BS EN 1991 - 1 - 2 (CEN 2002)) to predict anticipated compartment temperatures, the actual fire was more severe than predicted.|$|E

40|$|Use of macro plastic fibres to {{reinforce}} concrete has attracted widespread attention from both scientists and construction industry {{due to the}} multiple sustainability benefits they offer, compared to steel fibres and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh.</b> This paper critically reviews {{the current state of}} knowledge and technology of using macro plastic fibres {{to reinforce}} concrete. Detailed review on the various preparation techniques and the resulting properties of macro plastic fibres are presented and the effects of macro plastic fibres on the fresh and hardened concrete properties are discussed in this paper. The effect of macro plastic fibres on workability, plastic shrinkage, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, post-crack performance and dry shrinkage is discussed in this paper.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} impact of four alternatives for reinforcing 100 m² of concrete footpath (Functional Unit, FU) by using cradle to gate life cycle assessment (LCA), based on the Australian context. Specifically, the four options considered are a) producing <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> (SRM), b) producing virgin polypropylene (PP) fibre, c) recycling industrial PP waste and d) recycling domestic PP waste. The FU yields 364 kg of SRM (in a) and 40 kg of PP fibres (in b, c and d), necessary to achieve the same degree of reinforcing in concrete. All the activities required to produce these materials are considered in the study, namely manufacturing and transportation, and also recycling and reprocessing in the case of industrial and domestic recycled PP waste fibres. These processes are individually analysed and quantified in terms of material consumption, water use, and emissions into the environment. This allows for the impacts from producing recycled fibres to be compared with those from producing virgin PP fibre and SRM, which are traditionally used. The LCA results show that industrial recycled PP fibre offers important environmental benefits over virgin PP fibre. Specifically, the industrial recycled PP fibrecan save 50 % of CO₂ equivalent, 65 % of PO₄ equivalent, 29 % of water and 78 % of oil equivalent, compared to the virgin PP fibre. When compared to the SRM, the industrial recycled PP fibre can save 93 % of CO₂ equivalent, 97 % of PO₄ equivalent, 99 % of water and 91 % of oil equivalent. The domestic recycled PP fibre also generates reduced environmental impacts compared to virgin PP fibre, except for higher consumption of water associated with the washing processes...|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the beams {{incorporating}} reinforced mortar forms had almost the same stiffness as the control beam upto its cracking load after which they were much stiffer than the control beam.

40|$|Steel mesh {{is used as}} {{a passive}} skin {{confinement}} medium to supplement the active support provided by rock bolts for roof and rib control in underground coal mines. Thin spray-on liners (TSL) are believed to have the potential {{to take the place of}} steel mesh as the skin confinement medium in underground mines. To confirm this belief, large scale laboratory experiments were conducted to compare the behaviour of welded steel mesh and a TSL, when used in conjunction with rock bolts, in reinforcing strata with weak bedding planes and strata prone to guttering, two common rock conditions which exist in coal mines. It was found that while the peak load taken by the simulated rock mass with weak bedding planes acting as the control sample (no skin confinement) was 2494 kN, the corresponding value of the sample with 5 mm thick TSL reinforcement reached 2856 kN. The peak load of the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforced</b> sample was only 2321 kN, but this was attributed to the fact that one of the rock bolts broke during the test. The TSL reinforced sample had a similar post-yield behaviour as the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforced</b> one. The results of the large scale guttering test indicated that a TSL is better than steel mesh in restricting rock movement and thus inhibiting the formation of gutters in the roof. 2014...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presented}} a durability experimental study for thin basalt fiber <b>reinforced</b> polymer (BFRP) <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforced</b> cementitious plates under indoor and marine environment. The marine environment was simulated by wetting/drying cycles (wetting in salt water and drying in hot air). After 12 months of exposure, {{the effects of}} the chloride on the tensile and bending behaviors of the thin plate were investigated. In addition to the penetration of salt water, the chloride in the thin plate could be also from the sea sand since it is a component of the plate. Experimental results showed that the effect of the indoor exposure on the tensile capacity of the plate is not pronounced, while the marine exposure reduced the tensile capacity significantly. The bending capacity of the thin plates was remarkably reduced by both indoor and marine environmental exposure, in which the effect of the marine environment is more severe. The tensile capacity of the meshes extracted from the thin plates was tested, as well as the meshes immersed in salt solution for 30, 60, and 90 days. The test results confirmed that the chloride is the reason of the BFRP mesh deterioration. Moreover, as a comparison, the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforced</b> thin plate was also tested and it has a similar durability performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of axial compression tests on concrete block wallettes coated with cement mortar overlays. Different types of mortars and combinations with steel welded meshes and fibers were tested. The experimental results were discussed based on different theoretical approaches: analytical and Finite Element Method models. The main conclusions are: a) the application of mortar overlays increases the wall strength, but not in a uniform manner; b) the strengthening efficiency of wallettes loaded in axial compression is not proportional to the overlay mortar strength because it can be affected by the failure mechanisms of the wall; c) <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforced</b> overlays in combination with high strength mortar show better efficiency, because the steel mesh mitigates the damage effects in the block wall and in the overlays themselves; d) simplified theoretical methods of analysis as described in this paper can give satisfactory predictions of masonry wall behavior up to a certain level...|$|R

In contrast to other similar studies, the simulation model included both a numerical human body phantom and its environment—room walls, floor and ceiling. As an example, radio signal attenuation between two different configurations of transceivers with dipole antennas placed in a direct vicinity of a human body (on-body scenario) is analyzed by computer simulations for several types of reflecting environments. In the analyzed case the propagation environments comprised a human body and office room walls.
