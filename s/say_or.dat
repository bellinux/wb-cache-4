5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk {{is known as the}} simple random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, <b>say,</b> , <b>or</b> decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could <b>say</b> <b>or</b> have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union {{regarded}} chess as {{a symbol}} of Communist superiority, and hence the Soviet chess world was extremely politicized. As Botvinnik was the first world-class player produced by the Soviet Union, everything he said or did (or did not <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do) had political repercussions, and there were rumors that Soviet opponents were given hints that they should not beat him.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006, the Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) {{was able}} to extend the {{surveillance}} for another three years. Despite the doctrinal changes and banning of Vajrayana texts, the PSIA advocates increased surveillance; it periodically expresses concerns that the Vajrayana texts remain in use and that danger remains while Asahara remains leader. Aleph leaders carefully insert passages rejecting the Vajrayana texts into almost everything they <b>say</b> <b>or</b> write, including karaoke songs, to publicly distance Aleph from Vajrayana.|$|E
25|$|The Holocaust {{has been}} {{explained}} away officially as merely {{the relocation of}} the Jewish population into areas of Eastern Europe where communications and transport networks are still very poor. Despite this, many Germans suspect the government has eliminated the Jews, but generally don't care or are too afraid of the Nazi authorities to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do anything with this knowledge. Some surviving Jews escaped to Soviet territory, where they have provided testimony of the extermination efforts - while Nazi authorities decry this as Bolshevik propaganda, the outside world {{is aware of the}} Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral so as not to further damage relations, and refers only to vague 'human rights violations' he wishes to investigate while visiting Berlin.|$|E

25|$|In the background, Britain {{remained}} {{committed to}} implementing self-government for Ireland {{in accordance with}} the (temporarily suspended) Home Rule Act 1914. The British Cabinet drew up a committee to deal with this, the Long Committee. This largely followed Unionist MP recommendations, since Dáil MPs boycotting Westminster had no <b>say</b> <b>or</b> input. These deliberations resulted in a new Fourth Home Rule Act (known as the Government of Ireland Act 1920) being enacted primarily in the interest of Ulster Unionists. The Act granted (separate) Home Rule to two new institutions, the northeastern-most six counties of Ulster and the remaining twenty-six counties, both territories within the United Kingdom, which partitioned Ireland accordingly into two semi-autonomous regions: Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, co-ordinated by a Council of Ireland. Upon Royal Assent, the Parliament of Northern Ireland came into being in 1921. The institutions of Southern Ireland, however, were boycotted by nationalists and so never became functional.|$|E

500|$|Filipino values are, for {{the most}} part, {{centered}} around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily {{by the desire to}} be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of [...] "Hiya", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and [...] "Amor propio" [...] or 'self-esteem'. Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.|$|E

In one instance, Diane von Fürstenberg workers were reportedly angered that Port [...] "doesn't really work" [...] and was [...] "hardly ever in the office", elaborating that series producers would inhibit normal work operations by not allowing employees to move items in their offices. Freddie Fackelmayer, Port's former love interest, commented that the network [...] "never asked the cast to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do anything", though the editing that followed portrayed him as a [...] "womanizing jerk".|$|E

He tries to ignore character tropes {{in an attempt to}} write [...] "honestly". Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself [...] "What is this scene really about?

500|$|When writing [...] "I Want to Tell You", Harrison drew {{inspiration}} from his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The lyrics address what he later termed [...] "the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or <b>say</b> <b>or</b> transmit". In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties of achieving meaningful communication. The recording {{marked the first time}} that McCartney played his bass guitar part after the band had completed the rhythm track for a song, a technique that became common on the Beatles' subsequent recordings.|$|E

His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him.

500|$|In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison {{says that}} [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "the avalanche of thoughts {{that are so}} hard to write down or <b>say</b> <b>or</b> transmit". Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc cite the song, along with [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You", as an early example of the Beatles abandoning [...] "coy" [...] statements in their lyrics and instead [...] "adopt an urgent tone, intent on channeling some essential knowledge, the psychological and/or philosophical epiphanies of LSD experience" [...] to their listeners. Writing in The Beatles Anthology, Harrison likened the outlook inspired by his taking the drug to that of [...] "an astronaut on the moon, or in his spaceship, {{looking back at the}} Earth.

BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar alleged that the Congress State government deliberately delayed taking any action when the attacks on North Indians began in Mumbai. He said that he suspected Congress had a strategy to divide Maharashtrian and non-Maharashtrian votes, by creating a feeling of insecurity among non-Maharashtrians {{in the hope that}} they would vote for the Congress. He blamed the party for trying to divert people's attention from more critical problems that Maharashtra faces, such as the agrarian crisis and load shedding.

500|$|After the {{coaching}} situation had been settled, Gillis next {{turned his attention}} back to trading Luongo. The Canucks were hoping to make a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do."

500|$|Before {{the success}} of [...] "Day 'n' Nite", the rapper had {{said that he would}} never try to mix {{politics}} or jocular things in with his lyrical content. After realizing the power of his voice he then decided to make important and unique songs, focusing on the message, rather than just creating inane music. He said his mode of operation at that time [...] "was just, 'Hey, I'm making these cool sounding songs and I have little messages in them'", but still had himself in it. Although Cudi had a message in every track, he chose to avoid using dense lyrics, explaining {{that he did not want}} to write material that he would not actually <b>say</b> <b>or</b> use in real life, adding that being true to yourself entirely was meaningful to him. [...] "I don't speak like a fucking nerdy guy; I speak like a regular dude", he remarked.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's acting style {{consisted}} of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: [...] "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to <b>say</b> <b>or</b> do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters." [...] Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among [...] "the greatest actors" [...] because {{of his ability to}} deliver great performances [...] "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply [...] "playing himself".|$|E
