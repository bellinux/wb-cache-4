The findings are illustrated with parameters estimated from simultaneous entry USFS timber auctions where our estimates predict that the sequential mechanism would increase revenue and efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} transmission side bidding for availing power transmission services through a market mechanism. The transmission side bidding, in essence, refers to the direct market participation of transmission line owners for selling their line capacities with appropriate price offers. The transmission <b>offers</b> <b>are</b> <b>submitted</b> to the centralized auction conducted by the independent system operator for carrying out dispatch scheduling or for the issuance of transmission rights. Those are jointly cleared along with other bids and offers, and bid-consistent prices are established by means of marginal pricing. The uncertainty that gets involved in revenues or payments of market players because of the conventional transmission pricing is, therefore, eliminated. By recognizing the criticality of power flow interactions between different transmission lines, the auction participation of transmission line owners is suitably regulated. The issuance of financial transmission rights (FTRs) is supplemented by assigning counterflow flowgate rights to the transmission line owners so as to ensure revenue adequate FTR settlement. Detailed case studies are performed to verify {{the utility of the}} proposed transmission pricing methodology...|$|R

One of the offers, which involved a consortium of three investors, was determined by BCE's directors to be {{in the best interests of}} BCE and BCE’s shareholders. This was to be implemented by a plan of arrangement under s. 192 of the Canada Business Corporations Act, which was approved by 97.93% of BCE’s shareholders, but was opposed by a group of financial and other institutions that held debentures issued by Bell Canada. These debentureholders sought relief under the oppression remedy under s. 241 of the CBCA. [...] They also alleged that the arrangement was not “fair and reasonable” and opposed s. 192 approval by the court. Their main complaint was that, upon the completion of the arrangement, the short‑term trading value of the debentures would decline by an average of 20 percent and could lose investment grade status.|$|R

30|$|In July 2009, George Smitherman, the Energy Minister of Ontario, {{said that}} the {{government}} wanted to negotiate with Ottawa to reduce the bidding price. Smitherman declared that AECL’s bid was “billions” above what Ontario had anticipated. Ontario Power Generation (OPG) had estimated {{the cost of the}} installation of the two ACRs at $ 3, 000 per kilowatt, compared to $ 10, 800, the price offered by AECL. One of the major reasons for the offer being this high is that the design of the ACR is not yet complete, but Ontario is disinclined to pay for the cost of the research and development (R&D) process. On the other hand, before the <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> <b>submitted</b> by AECL, the Harper government had told the company that its bidding price must cover all the costs of R&D, and that AECL should not count on future sales to put off the cost overruns. In the case in which the Federal Government decides to keep AECL as a federal Crown corporation and not sell it, the government needs to ensure that the Ontario nuclear project is commercialized in an attempt to preserve AECL’s value and to avoid federal taxpayers subsidizing Ontario ratepayers (McCarthy and Howlett, 2009).|$|R
