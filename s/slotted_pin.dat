Short pin-fin arrays are used to enhance the heat transfer in cooling channels of gas turbine airfoils, combustor liners, electronic chips, bearing housings etc. Numerous experimental and numerical past studies ascertain the optimal spacing and length to height ratios within arrays of round short pin-fins for optimal heat transfer. However, the heat transfer enhancement in pin-finned channels is achieved {{at the expense of}} a significant pressure drop across the channel. Augmentation of pin-fins to improve the flow and heat transfer characteristics through the channel, may however lead to further improvements. This paper presents measured pressure drop characteristics in a channel with a staggered array of round short pin-fins where each pin has two through slots. The two slots located at the two ends of each pin have an identical slot-depth to pin-diameter ratio and slot-width to pin-diameter ratio which is 0. 48. The slots are oriented parallel to the mean flow direction in the pin-fin array. The pin-height to diameter ratio used is 1. 28 and pitch to diameter ratio in both streamwise and pitchwise direction of the pin-fin array is 2. The array consists of 13 staggered rows of pin-fins. Pressure drop in the channel is also measured with conventional solid round pin-fins. The same array spacing, pin-diameter and pin-height was used as with the slotted pin-fin array for comparison. The Reynolds number based on the mass averaged velocity and pin hydraulic diameter ranges between 3, 300 and 32, 800 covering different cooling applications. The objectives of the measurements are to investigate the effect of the pin-slots on the pressure drop over the array of pin-fins and recirculation region downstream of the <b>slotted</b> <b>pin</b> in the channel. The recirculation regions are responsible for low heat transfer coefficients on the end wall in the immediate vicinity downstream of the pin-fins. In general, the normalized pressure drop over the slotted pin-fin array decreases as Reynolds number decreases. The pressure drop over the slotted pin-fin array was also lower than the predicted pressure drop over an array of solid pin fins without slots. The normalized pressure distribution around the <b>slotted</b> <b>pin</b> circumference at mid-height shows a stagnation region over the frontal section of the <b>slotted</b> <b>pin.</b> The normalized pressure distribution changes little between 90 ° and 180 ° over the Reynolds number range that was used; this indicates a region of local flow separation. A short pin-fin array with slotted pins as described in this paper reduces the pressure drop over an array when compared to an unslotted array with the same geometrical arrangement. Slotting of pin fins may enhance the performance of an array of short pin-fins by reducing the pressure drop across the array. cf 201...|$|E

The “on” and “off” states of the PIN diodes in the DMS unit provide the phase shifts by changing the current paths.

Different configurations of slot embedded resonant patch elements have been proposed and multiple PIN diodes have been used in ON and OFF states to obtain frequency switching at different points. The design has been demonstrated to be operating in X-band frequency range where frequency tunability from 9. 63 GHz to 8. 10 GHz has been demonstrated using combination of rectangular <b>slots</b> and <b>PIN</b> diodes. Moreover the design provides 2 n different states of diode switching (n is number of diodes) which can be used to obtain different resonant frequencies of planar reflectors.

50|$|As {{long as the}} hot-swap {{connector}} {{is sufficiently}} rigid, {{one of the four}} corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row connector arrangement this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is fully seated. This diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that fully seated detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the <b>slot.</b> The remaining <b>pins</b> are used for all the other data signals.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous alternate motion, wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, parallel input and output shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two star wheels properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for star wheels, <b>pins</b> and <b>slots</b> handle the acceleration and deceleration phases, while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of <b>pins</b> and <b>slots</b> is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a <b>slot,</b> a <b>pin</b> from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. By annihilating the arrest phases typical of star wheels, the proposed system eliminates the discontinuities in the acceleration diagram. The paper develops a complete parametrical analysis of the device, underlining the effect of the constraints on the shape of the motion laws with particular emphasis on the acceleration and deceleration phases. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. With respect to an analogous mechanism realizing the same laws of motion, e. g., cams, this device is very compact and economical, also presenting parallel input and output shafts, and significantly reduces sliding and wea...|$|R

The pole housing 16 contains a telescopically arranged and arcuately shaped primary pole member (22) and extension pole member (23) which are guided by roller assemblies (30, 35). The extension pole member (23) is slidable and extendable relative to the primary pole member (22). For actuation, a spring actuated system includes a spring (52) in the pole housing. A locking member (90) engages both pole members (22, 23) through notch portions (85, 86) in the pole members. The locking member selectively releases the extension pole member (23) and the primary pole member (22). An internal one-way clutch or anti-return mechanism prevents retraction of the extension pole member from an extended position. Shock absorbers (54) (150, 152) are for absoring {{the energy of the}} springs. A manual backup deployment system is provided which includes a canted ring (104) biased by a spring member (108).
