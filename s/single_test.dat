5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a <b>single</b> <b>test</b> bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E

40|$|Three {{procedures}} (radioimmunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, and enzyme immunoassay) for {{the determination}} of gentamicin and tobramycin levels were compared. These systems were evaluated {{on the basis of}} accuracy, reproducibility, specificity, and cost. All three systems showed a high degree of accuracy and precision. The fluorescence immunoassay gave significantly lower values for gentamicin and tobramycin at levels below 5 microgram/ml. Of the three systems, the radioimmunoassay was the least expensive, provided that a minimum of 10 analyses were performed daily; <b>single</b> <b>tests</b> required more technical time and were more costly. Costs of <b>single</b> <b>tests</b> by fluorescence immunoassay and enzyme immunoassay systems were similar. The enzyme immunoassay system performed equally well for both gentamicin and tobramycin in giving rapid and accurate results...|$|R

As a result, he considered moving to South Australia, where a grocery magnate offered him employment and financial incentives. However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him with a job in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a <b>single</b> <b>Test</b> match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him {{less than a week}} before his scheduled departure.|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh had {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with International cricket since becoming the tenth Test team in November 2000. Before their 2003 tour of Australian, Bangladesh had only one Test draw, which came against lowly ranked Zimbabwe, and not a <b>single</b> <b>test</b> win. Their One Day International (ODI) form had also been poor since their historic victory over Pakistan in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The victory subsequently paved the way for their admission to Test cricket. In Bangladesh's last series before Australia, they were defeated by an innings in both matches by South Africa. Australia, however, had a 31 away Test victorystarting in Aprilagainst the West Indies, and a 43 ODI victory over the same opposition. Earlier in the year, they remained unbeaten (10 matches) in winning the 2003 ODI Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Led by Ricky Ponting, Australia defeated India in the final, despite losing leg-spiner Shane Warne. Prior to the start of the World Cup, Warne—Australia's highest Test wicket-taker—was sent home from South Africa after a drug test during the recent one-day series in Australia returned a positive result for a banned diuretic. He was consequently banned from International and first-class cricket for a year.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no <b>single</b> <b>test</b> or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E

30|$|Neuropsychological testing, in its {{clinical}} {{or research}} application, may {{be composed of}} <b>single</b> <b>tests</b> that assess certain aspects of cognitive functions or of sets of tests, known as batteries. Some test batteries are designed to investigate several facets of a single cognitive function (e.g. types of memory), while others are dedicated to a broader and deeper investigation of cognitive abilities. Between the specificity of <b>single</b> <b>tests</b> {{and the depth of}} batteries, one may find a third class of psychometric instruments, composed of instruments designed to combine relatively quick application time and cover many cognitive functions: the screening tests. To accomplish such a task, screening tests usually refrain from making a complete performance profile of the functions they assess and focus on detecting signs of deficits (Ustárroz, 2007).|$|R

No effect of the anisotropy of the sheets on the behaviour in the <b>single</b> connector <b>tests</b> was found. Axial crushing tests of aluminium single-hat sections joined with flow-drill screws were also performed. Two connection failure modes not observed during the <b>single</b> connector <b>test</b> were found in these tests.

40|$|The <b>single</b> cell <b>test</b> system {{development}} for the SRNL sulfur dioxide-depolarized electrolyzer has been completed. Operating experience and improved operating procedures were developed during test operations in FY 06 and {{the first quarter of}} FY 07. Eight different cell configurations, using various MEA designs, have been <b>tested.</b> The <b>single</b> cell <b>test</b> electrolyzer has been modified to overcome difficulties experienced during testing, including modifications to the inlet connection to eliminate minute acid leaks that caused short circuits. The test facility was modified by adding a water bath for cell heating, thus permitting operation over a wider range of flowrates and cell temperatures. Modifications were also identified to permit continuous water flushing of the cathode to remove sulfur, thus extending operating time between required shutdowns. This is also expected to permit a means of independently measuring the rate of sulfur formation, and the corresponding SO{sub 2 } flux through the membrane. This report contains a discussion of the design issues being addressed by the <b>single</b> cell <b>test</b> program, a test matrix being conducted to address these issues, and a summary of the performance objectives for the <b>single</b> cell <b>test</b> system. The current primary objective of <b>single</b> cell <b>test</b> system is to characterize and qualify electrolyzer configurations for the following 100 -hour longevity <b>tests.</b> Although the <b>single</b> cell <b>test</b> {{system development}} is considered complete, SRNL will continue to utilize the test facility and the single cell electrolyzer to measure the operability and performance of various cell design configurations, including new MEA's produced by the component development tasks...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a new portable head-mounted perimeter, "imo", which performs visual field (VF) testing under flexible conditions without a dark room. Besides the monocular eye test, imo can present a test target randomly to either eye without occlusion (a binocular random <b>single</b> eye <b>test).</b> The performance of imo was evaluated. Using full HD transmissive LCD and high intensity LED backlights, imo can display a test target under the same test conditions as the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA). The monocular and binocular random <b>single</b> eye <b>tests</b> by imo and the HFA test were performed on 40 eyes of 20 subjects with glaucoma. VF sensitivity results by the monocular and binocular random <b>single</b> eye <b>tests</b> were compared, and these test results were further compared to those by the HFA. The subjects were asked whether they noticed which eye was being tested during the test. The mean sensitivity (MS) obtained with the HFA highly correlated with the MS by the imo monocular test (R: r = 0. 96, L: r = 0. 94, P < 0. 001) and the binocular random <b>single</b> eye <b>test</b> (R: r = 0. 97, L: r = 0. 98, P < 0. 001). The MS values by the monocular and binocular random <b>single</b> eye <b>tests</b> also highly correlated (R: r = 0. 96, L: r = 0. 95, P < 0. 001). No subject could detect which eye was being tested during the examination. The perimeter imo can obtain VF sensitivity highly compatible to that by the standard automated perimeter.
