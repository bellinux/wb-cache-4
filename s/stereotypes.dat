40|$|Much {{research}} has examined how <b>stereotype</b> threat {{leads to the}} underperformance of <b>stereotyped</b> targets. The underlying cause for this effect, however, remains unclear. Some,researchers argue that <b>stereotype</b> threat can be explained from a behavioral-priming perspective, while others claim that it necessarily involves concerns about confirming a negative self-relevant <b>stereotype.</b> The current experiment highlights the critical role of self-relevance in distinguishing between <b>stereotype</b> priming and <b>stereotype</b> threat. Results showed that when participants wrote about a <b>stereotyped</b> target from a first-person perspective, both targets and non-targets performed poorly under <b>stereotype</b> threat conditions, because writing from a first-person perspective made the <b>stereotype</b> self-relevant for non-targets. But when participants wrote about a <b>stereotyped</b> target from a third-person perspective, only targets underperformed since the <b>stereotype</b> was already self-relevant. Moreover, when the <b>stereotype</b> was made self-relevant non-targets experienced the same threat-based concerns that targets experience under <b>stereotype</b> threat conditions.

In a study including 240 six-year-old children, this paradox was addressed by testing whether automatic associations trigger <b>stereotype</b> threat in young girls. Whereas no indicators were found that children endorsed the math–gender <b>stereotype,</b> girls, but not boys, showed automatic associations consistent with the <b>stereotype.</b> Moreover, results showed that girls' automatic associations varied as a function of a manipulation regarding the <b>stereotype</b> content. Importantly, girls' math performance decreased in a stereotype-consistent, relative to a stereotype-inconsistent, condition and automatic associations mediated the relation between <b>stereotype</b> threat and performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stereotype</b> threat (fear of {{confirming}} {{a negative}} group <b>stereotype</b> {{that in turn}} can inhibit academic performance) has been implicated in the gender gap observed {{in the field of}} mathematics.

The current study investigated <b>stereotype</b> threat specifically in statistics [...] an unexplored area in the research literature [...] and the alleviating effects of self-affirmation. Participants in three conditions (control, <b>stereotype</b> threat, <b>stereotype</b> threat + affirmation) completed a statistics test.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} investigated if {{beneficiaries of}} affirmative action experience <b>stereotype</b> threat and its negative consequences. Study one consisted of an experiment in which we simulated affirmative native action procedures. We found that affirmative action programs which do not ensure beneficiaries of their equality of merit and ability, can induce <b>stereotype</b> threat and its negative consequences. However we recognised that the previous affirmative action manipulations may not match the forms of Affirmative action utilized in Northern Ireland. Therefore study two used a more applicable "weak" preferential selection manipulation. We found that this found {{of affirmative action}} did not induce <b>stereotype</b> threat nor its negative consequences as these participants knew the <b>stereotype</b> of affirmative action was not true of themselves. However the <b>stereotype</b> threat hypothesis postulates that <b>stereotype</b> endorsement {{is not necessary to}} induce <b>stereotype</b> threat. Study three empirically tested this assumption. We manipulated both the presentation of a <b>stereotype,</b> and participants' personal endorsement of that <b>stereotype.</b> We found that the inducement of <b>stereotype</b> threat does not in fact require <b>stereotype</b> endorsement. This finding leads us to ask why affirmative action in study two did not induce <b>stereotype</b> threat. We hypothesised that these participants simply were not aware {{they were part of a}} <b>stereotyped</b> group. Therefore in study four we presented beneficiaries of weak preferential selection manipulations with the widespread <b>stereotype</b> surrounding affirmative action. We found that when beneficiaries of weak affirmative action procedures encounter the negative <b>stereotype</b> associated with affirmative action, <b>stereotype</b> threat is induced. The present research contributes to the previous literature by moving the argument on from the forms of affirmative action used, to how public discourses and presentations of affirmative action may be the true cause for concern. Moreover this thesis also contributes to the <b>stereotype</b> threat literature by empirically that <b>stereotype</b> threat does not depend on <b>stereotype</b> endorsement.

50|$|<b>Stereotype</b> {{threat is}} a {{potential}} contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender gaps in academic performance. It may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative <b>stereotype</b> because <b>stereotype</b> threat is thought to arise from a particular situation, rather than from an individual's personality traits or characteristics. Since most people {{have at least one}} social identity which is negatively <b>stereotyped,</b> most people are vulnerable to <b>stereotype</b> threat if they encounter {{a situation in which the}} <b>stereotype</b> is relevant. Situational factors that increase <b>stereotype</b> threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the <b>stereotype</b> to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of <b>stereotype</b> threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the <b>stereotyped</b> group. These effects are also increased when they expect discrimination due to their identification with a negatively <b>stereotyped</b> group. Repeated experiences of <b>stereotype</b> threat can lead to a vicious circle of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.|$|R
40|$|According to <b>stereotype</b> threat theory (Steele, 1997), <b>stereotyped</b> targets under-perform on {{challenging}} tests, in {{part because}} they are worried about being viewed in terms of the negative <b>stereotype</b> that they are intellectually inferior. How then are the negative effects of <b>stereotype</b> threat reduced for <b>stereotyped</b> targets? To examine this issue, a study was conducted to investigate whether <b>stereotype</b> threat's adverse effects are reduced when a Black experimenter administers a verbal test to Black participants. We further examined the question of whether Black participants have a subjective awareness of <b>stereotype</b> threat. Results showed that when a Black experimenter gave a verbal test to Black participants, they did not suffer the typical performance decrements associated with <b>stereotype</b> threat. Additionally, results supported the hypothesis that Black participants have conscious access to the experience of <b>stereotype</b> threat and that this effect is partially mediated by their endorsement of the <b>stereotype...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a theoretical framework}} for understanding when people interacting {{with a member of}} a <b>stereotyped</b> group activate that group’s <b>stereotype</b> and apply it to that person. It is proposed that both <b>stereotype</b> activation and <b>stereotype</b> application during interaction depend on the strength of compre-hension and self-enhancement goals that can be satisfied by <b>stereotyping</b> one’s interaction partner and on the strength of one’s motivation to avoid prejudice. The authors explain how these goals can promote and inhibit <b>stereotype</b> activation and application, and describe diverse chronic and situational factors that can influence the intensity of these goals during interaction and, thereby, influence <b>stereotype</b> activation and application. This approach permits integration of a broad range of findings on <b>stereotype</b> activation and application. As one interacts with a member of a <b>stereotyped</b> group—for example, an African American, a woman, a doctor—the <b>stereotype</b> of that group may or may not come to mind.

There was no main effect for character gender, however, nor was there an interaction effect between <b>stereotype</b> activation and character gender.

40|$|<b>Stereotype</b> threat {{refers to}} the {{negative}} impact a <b>stereotype</b> about one’s group can have on one’s performance in domains relevant to the <b>stereotype.</b> In the current paper, we explore whether the negative <b>stereotype</b> of provisional license drivers (PLDs) might produce <b>stereotype</b> threat in a driving-related hazard perception task. We manipulate threat by asking participants to self-identify as PLDs in a categorization condition, or by reminding PLD participants explicitly of the <b>stereotype</b> of PLDs in an explicit <b>stereotype</b> condition. Results reveal increments in hazard perception in the categorization condition, and decrements in hazard perception in the explicit <b>stereotype</b> condition. Mediation analysis reveals that hazard perception performance is fully mediated by increased effort in the categorization condition and by decreased effort in the explicit <b>stereotype</b> condition. We discuss these findings {{in terms of their}} implications for <b>stereotype</b> threat and its mediators, and for public policy that explicitly discriminates between PLDs and other driver groups...|$|R

40|$|A known {{consequence}} of <b>stereotype</b> suppression is post-suppressional rebound (PSR), an ironic {{activation of the}} suppressed <b>stereotype.</b> This is typically explained as an unintended by-product from a dual-process model of mental control.
