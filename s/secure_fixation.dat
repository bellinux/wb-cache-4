30|$|Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation {{is recommended for}} femoral unicondylar fractures to reduce the possibility of posttraumatic arthritis, joint contracture, and knee instability. This is achieved with standard surgical techniques such as screw fixation or plate/screw fixation [2, 3, 4, 5].

We retrospectively reviewed all 102 prospectively followed patients (106 implants) with this implant to document the longer-term implant survivorship, clinical function, fixation quality, and periprosthetic bone preservation. Ninety-seven patients with 101 implants had current followup or were followed to patient death (range, 1 – 14  years; average, 10  years). Eighty-six living patients were followed for an average implant survivorship of 10  years. There were no known femoral implant removals. The average Harris hip score at 10 -year followup was 98.

30|$|Femoral {{shortening}} is {{a proven}} method of addressing leg length discrepancy after growth has ceased. The discrepancy should be clinically significant {{to justify the}} procedure and should preferably be confined to the femur.

Options for fixation include internal fixation using plates, intramedullary nailing and external fixation. It is important to maintain femoral alignment and rotation in the shortening.|$|E
30|$|Bone {{transport}} can be {{internal or}} external; in the former, the transport segment is pulled by a construct that {{is inside the}} limb exiting distally, whereas during the latter, the bone segment {{is attached to a}} transport ring, with the construct moving through the soft tissues. The main advantage of the internal technique is that it eliminates the risk of transection of important structures, such as nerves.

30|$|Bioabsorbable {{implants}} {{are commonly}} used for orthopaedic intra-articular procedures.

The RIGIDFIX anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) cross pin (Mitek, Westwood, MA, USA) utilises polylactic (PLA) pins to give the advantage of 360 ° bone-to-graft contact at the graft tunnel, with clinically acceptable pull-out strength and proven patient outcomes [2, 3]. This fixation method does, however, have the disadvantages of local tissue response, such as inflammation and swelling [4, 5]. We report the case of implant migration and the loose body presenting as a subcutaneous collection.|$|R
30|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{may be seen}} in the arthrogrypotic child. This {{will improve}} following hip reduction, and migration of hips is infrequently seen because of the associated hip stiffness.

Staheli has advocated a shelf procedure to augment acetabular cover. Both hips, if needed, can be operated on at the same time, and postoperative immobilisation is limited to 6  weeks in a cast.

Although <b>secure</b> <b>fixation</b> of the catheter can be achieved with sutures, {{to reduce the risk}} of damage to the catheter, alternative methods, such as surgical tapes or skin glue should be considered. After removal of a catheter, its tip should be checked to ensure that the entire catheter has been completely removed.

40|$|As yet {{the only}} thing we can do in the {{treatment}} of slipped epiphysis of the femoral head is to try to detect the condition as early as possible and prevent further slipping. If slipping is advanced, attempts must be made to improve the position of the epiphysis. If slipping is slight to moderate, the epiphysis may be fixed without preliminary correction of its position since such a degree of slip-ping does not seriously impair function and any secondary arthritic changes are usually slight. Howorth, in 1941 and 1949, reviewed a large series of patients with slipped upper femoral epiphyses treated by the method he had been using since 1930. He <b>secures</b> <b>fixation</b> by inserting bone pegs through drill holes across the epiphyseal plate. (A similar method has since been described by Heyman and Herndon.) In Howorth’s method the results he achieved must be regarded as very good; there was no aseptic necrosis nor did any serious complication occur in the 200 hips operated on. The only disadvantage of his method is the relatively long interval before weight-bearing is allowed. This period varies with the age of the child and the state of the epiphyseal plate. Howorth permitted weight-bearing about ten weeks postoperatively. It was mainly because of the length of this period that Waldenstr#{ 246 }m, in Sweden, recommended nailing according to the method described by Wilson in 1938; fixation of the epiphysis with a three-flanged nail, a method which has since been widely used in our country and with which this paper is concerned.

30|$|The {{importance}} of <b>secure</b> graft <b>fixation</b> has dramatically increased as current rehabilitation protocols emphasise early weight bearing after ACL reconstruction {{and as the}} fixation site {{is known to be}} the weakest link during the early postoperative period [26]. Graft fixation to bone should furthermore consider that the bone mineral density and the angle of force application significantly differ between the femoral and the tibial bone. In accordance with the surgical procedure of drilling the femoral tunnel with the knee flexed between 90 ° and 120 °, studies on the line of force transmission have shown that the femoral graft fixation strength increases as the angle between the axis of the bone tunnel and the axis of the ligament increases during extension of the knee [100, 101, 102, 103].|$|R
50|$|The fuel {{injector}} valves {{are of a}} solenoid type with needle and seat. They are opened by a current flowing through the injector's coil and are closed by a strong spring when the current is switched off. To ensure as optimal combustion as possible and with that lower exhaust emission the injectors are equipped with four holes, which gives a good distribution of the fuel. The squirts of fuel are very exact positioned (two jets on the backside on each inlet valve). This put very high demands on the fixation of the injectors. To <b>secure</b> this <b>fixation</b> the injectors are fixed in pairs by a special retainer between cylinders 1 - 2 and 3 - 4. The injectors are electrically supplied from the main relay, while the ECU grounds the injectors.|$|R

Mennen’s paper describes a novel method of fixing metacarpal fractures and rightly comments on the shortcomings of existing techniques of internal fixation. Kirschner wires, though relatively atraumatic, have a tendency to impinge on muscle and tendon and may not provide sufficient stability to allow immediate motion. Unless expertly inserted, tendon adhesions and loss of movement at the M. P. joint can result. The A.

30|$|Spinal {{instrumentation}} surgeries are popular, and {{an increasing}} number of surgeries is being performed annually [1, 2]. Implant stability is important in spinal instrumentation surgeries, as it ensures <b>secure</b> <b>fixation</b> of the implant to the bone and prevents implant fixation failure [3, 4]. In particular, in the field of spinal surgery, the rate of postoperative pedicle screw loosening has been reported to be up to 12 % [5, 6]. Galbusera et al. [7] reported a screw loosening incidence of up to 60 % among patients with osteoporosis. Pedicle screw loosening {{is one of the major}} indications for revision after spinal surgery [8]. An appropriate initial test force is important to achieve good surgical results and prevent screw loosening. To overcome these issues, both the prediction of test force using preoperative images and establishment of an intraoperative test force evaluation system are required.|$|E
