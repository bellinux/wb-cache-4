5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their <b>separation</b> <b>distance</b> and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it.

5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original <b>separation</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Austrian Odour Dispersion Model (AODM) is a Gaussian model {{which was}} adapted for the {{prediction}} of odour sensation. It consists of three modules to estimate the daily and seasonal variation of the odour emission, the average odour concentration and the momentary (peak) concentration for the time interval of a single human breath (approx. 5 seconds). Peak concentrations further downwind are modified by use of an exponential attenuation function for which {{the proportion of the}} standard deviations of the wind components to the average wind speed have either to be taken from the literature or to be calculated e. g. from ultrasonic anemometer data. AODM calculates direction-dependent <b>separation</b> <b>distances</b> for a combination of odour threshold and exceedence probability which are a function of the prevailing wind velocity and atmospheric stability conditions.

40|$|The Austrian odour {{dispersion}} model (AODM) is a Gaussian model {{suitable for the}} prediction of ambient odour concentrations.

40|$|To {{determine}} <b>separation</b> <b>distances</b> between odour {{sources and}} residential areas to avoid odour nuisance and complaints by the residents, odour impact criteria OIC {{have to be}} adopted by the responsible authorities. There is {{a wide variety of}} OIC used for this purpose, which differ by the odour concentration threshold (between 0. 12 ouE m- 3 and 10 ouE m- 3), the averaging period (hourly or instantaneous) and by the tolerated exceedance probability of the adopted threshold (between 0. 1 % and about 35 % of the time). There are two groups of OIC used in various jurisdictions: the first one with a low odour concentration threshold and a high tolerated exceedance probability (e. g. Germany); and the second group with a high odour concentration threshold and a low tolerated exceedance probability (e. g. Ireland). The modelled direction-dependent <b>separation</b> <b>distances</b> (using OIC which are supposed to offer the same protection level) can vary significantly.

25|$|The last {{problem to}} be solved was how to {{separate}} the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed {{to solve the problem}} within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough <b>separation</b> <b>distance</b> of the LM.

40|$|The Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS), {{currently}} deployed {{at major}} airports around the U. S., monitors aircrafts movement and predicts possible incursion. The incursion prediction involves linear prediction of <b>separation</b> <b>distances</b> between {{a pair of}} aircrafts. A careful safety algorithm uses this prediction, airport configuration, and other environment factors, to determine if incursion is likely and to warn air traffic controllers to perform corrective measures. However, the linear prediction is inaccurate, and thus the safety algorithm generates too many false alarms. We investigate the uses of neural network as an estimation tool {{in place of the}} linear prediction. Previous work has shown that estimation of <b>separation</b> <b>distances</b> at ten seconds in the future by a neural network is more accurate than the existing linear prediction. This paper investigate the possibility of using neural networks to shorten the lead time, the time since the system gives alarming message until the time incursion occurs. A new neural network is optimized to estimate <b>separation</b> <b>distances</b> at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 seconds in the future. The results show that, although the neural network significantly reduces the number of false alarms, it does not alarm in real alarm situation.
