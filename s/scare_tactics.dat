The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using <b>scare</b> <b>tactics</b> in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing <b>scare</b> <b>tactics</b> to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention is to go to Barcelona).|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Cunningham was {{challenged}} in his re-election campaign by Scott Ott, a Republican political newcomer {{associated with the}} conservative Tea Party movement. Ott accused Cunningham of avoiding a county tax increase only by depleting a tax relief fund established during Jane Ervin's administration, leaving the county {{in a position where}} future tax hikes would be necessary. For his part, Cunningham accused Ott of using <b>scare</b> <b>tactics</b> in his campaign and said he lacked the experience to lead the county. He also argued Republican county commissioners had actually increased spending. Cunningham defeated Ott in the general election by a voter count of 21,063 to 20,201, capturing 51 percent of the vote to Ott's 49 percent. In 2010, a 16.1 percent tax increase was proposed as part of the county budget, with Cunningham said was necessary due to difficult financial times, but would avoid the need to sell assets, deplete savings, impose massive layoffs, or reduce government services {{to the point that the}} problem would grow worse in subsequent years. It was the first county tax increase since 2003. The budget was ultimately passed. In 2011, Ott was elected to the county's board of commissioners in 2011, along with a slate of fellow conservatives who ran together on a ticket of reform, which heavily criticized the 16 percent county tax increase during their campaigns.|$|E

[...] John Kindley, {{one of the lawyers}} representing Kjolsrud stated: [...] "I think most citizens, whether they are pro-choice or anti-abortion, believe in an individual's right to self-determination. They believe people shouldn't be misled and should be told about [...] risks, even if there is controversy over those risks."

25|$|The {{process that}} leads to the {{formation}} of a bait ball typically starts when predators locate a fish school deep below the surface. The predators make rushes and use various <b>scare</b> <b>tactics</b> to force the fish school to the surface, herding {{it at the same time}} into a compact volume. The alarmed fish, trapped against the surface above and surrounded all about, abandon their coordinated schooling movements and become chaotic. Their graceful and disciplined schooling strategies of uniform spacing and polarity degrade into frenetic attempts by each fish to save itself. In this way, a dense bait ball forms as each fish scrambles to get away from the surface of the ball and hide in the interior. The symmetry of this centripetal action forms a sphere, the shape with the minimum surface area for a given volume, thereby exposing the fewest number of fish on the surface to the predators. The movement, sound and smell can attract more predators, including different predator species, until there is a carousel of them, each species using its own characteristic predatory strategies. Fish that break loose are singled out and eaten. A frenzy can develop as predators compete, the water reddening with blood as shredded flesh and scales drift to the depths. As the bait ball reduces in size and number, it becomes progressively easier for the predators to target the survivors.|$|E

500|$|The set design, too, {{has been}} praised for being [...] "suitably claustrophobic." [...] Robson's {{direction}} has earned kudos for heightening the suspense by leaving certain actions and motives vague. In {{the scene in}} which Seaman Parker (Lawrence Tierney) dies, crushed by the anchor chain, Robson left it unclear whether Captain Stone committed murder by trapping Parker in the anchor chain locker or whether he merely shut the door. The vagueness leaves the audience unsure whether to believe Merriam's accusations against the Captain, and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which {{is critical to the}} picture's success. Contemporary critic Gary Giddins has pointed out that the film incorporates classic Lewton <b>scare</b> <b>tactics</b> but in new ways. [...] "His trademark scare tactic, a high point in practically all of his films, is a long, dark, nightmarish walk, where every sound is magnified and every object threatening. In The Ghost Ship, that [...] "walk" [...] is transferred to the cabin of the victimized third officer..." [...] Others have pointed out another Lewton device, the gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer, as another deft touch in the film.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted <b>Scare</b> <b>Tactics</b> and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just you and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
500|$|On {{the story}} side, McMillen {{explained}} that the religious tone is based on his own experiences with his family, split between Catholics and born-again Christians. McMillen noted that while both sides born out faith from the same Bible, their attitudes were different; he found some of the Catholic rituals his family performed inspiring, while other beliefs they had were condemning of several pastimes McMillen had participated in like Dungeons & Dragons. He took inspiration from that duality to create Isaacs narrative, showing how religion can both instill harmful feelings while also bringing about dark creativity. McMillen also considered the <b>scare</b> <b>tactics</b> used by the Christian right to condemn popular media of the 1980s, such as heavy metal and video games. McMillen noted {{how many of the}} propaganda films from this period features satanic cults that would sacrifice children, and he noted how many Biblical stories mirrored these concepts, subsequently building the story around that. He also stated that he also tended to like [...] "really weird stuff" [...] relating to toilet humor and similar types of off-color humor that did not sit well with his family and which he had explored in previous games before Super Meat Boy. While Super Meat Boy helped to make his reputation (including being one of the featured developers in [...] ), he felt it was a [...] "safe" [...] game considering his preferred type of humor, and used Isaac to return to this form, considering that the game could easily be [...] "career suicide" [...] but would make a statement about what he really wanted to do.|$|E

2500|$|An {{emphasis}} on educating women about lifestyle changes {{that may have}} a small impact on preventing breast cancer often makes women feel guilty if they do develop breast cancer.

Adopting such a belief may increase their sense of being {{in control of their}} fate. Increased awareness inadvertently increases victim blaming. [...] Women who resist screening mammography or breast self-exams are subjected to social pressure, <b>scare</b> <b>tactics,</b> guilt, and threats from some physicians to terminate the relationship with the patient.
