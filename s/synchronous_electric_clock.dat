5000|$|Around {{the same}} time that the local rail lines were in decline, the {{inventor}} Henry E. Warren developed the Warren Synchronizing Timer in 1916, which made <b>synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> possible by keeping alternating current flowing from power plants at a consistent sixty cycles per second. Warren founded Telechron, which, in partnership with General <b>Electric,</b> manufactured <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> in Ashland until 1979. A Warren Synchronizing Timer is on display at the Smithsonian's Museum of American History in Washington D.C., and the Ashland High School sports teams are coined [...] "The Clockers." ...|$|R
5000|$|Henry Warren {{established}} {{the company in}} 1912 in Ashland, Massachusetts. Initially, it was called [...] "The Warren Clock Company," [...] producing battery-powered clocks. These proved unreliable, however, since batteries weakened quickly, which resulted in inaccurate time-keeping. Warren saw electric motors as {{the solution to this}} problem. In 1915, he invented a self-starting synchronous motor consisting of a rotor and a coil, which was patented in 1918. A synchronous motor spins {{at the same rate as}} the cycle of the alternating current driving it. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> had been available previously, but had to be started manually. In later years, Telechron would advertise its clocks as [...] "bringing true time," [...] because power plants kept the frequency of the alternating current perfectly constant at 60 Hz.|$|R
50|$|<b>Synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> do {{not have}} an {{internal}} oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 Hz oscillation of the AC power line, which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a synchronous motor which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train. Although changes in the grid line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds {{during the course of a}} day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} clock is a clock that {{is powered by}} electricity, {{as opposed to a}} mechanical clock which is powered by a hanging weight or a mainspring. The term is often applied to the electrically powered mechanical clocks that were used before quartz clocks were introduced in the 1980s. The first experimental {{electric clock}}s were constructed around 1840, but they were not widely manufactured until mains electric power became available in the 1890s. In the 1930s the <b>synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> replaced mechanical clocks as the most widely used type of clock.|$|E
5000|$|Telechron is {{the name}} of a U.S. company that {{manufactured}} electric clocks between 1912 and 1992. [...] "Telechron" [...] is derived from the Greek words tele, meaning [...] "far off," [...] and chronos, [...] "time," [...] thus referring to the transmission of time over long distances. Founded by Henry Ellis Warren, Telechron introduced the <b>synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> which keeps time by the oscillations of the alternating current electricity that powers it from the electric power grid. Telechron had its heyday between 1925 and 1955, when it sold millions of electric clocks to American consumers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pendulum}} {{clock is}} a clock {{that uses a}} pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element. The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping {{is that it is}} a harmonic oscillator; it swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates. From its invention in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use. [...] Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation, and their greater accuracy allowed the faster pace of life which was necessary for the Industrial Revolution. The home pendulum clock was replaced by cheaper <b>synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> in the 1930s and '40s, and they are now kept mostly for their decorative and antique value.|$|R

5000|$|Pendulum clocks {{remained}} the world standard for accurate timekeeping for 270 years, until {{the invention of}} the quartz clock in 1927, and were used as time standards through World War 2. The French Time Service used pendulum clocks as part of their ensemble of standard clocks until 1954. [...] The home pendulum clock began to be replaced as domestic timekeeper during the 1930s and 1940s by the <b>synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> which kept more accurate time because it was synchronized to the oscillation of the electric power grid. The most accurate experimental pendulum clock ever made may be the Littlemore Clock built by Edward T. Hall in the 1990s(donated in 2003 to the National Watch and Clock Museum, Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>synchronous</b> <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> {{does not}} contain a {{timekeeping}} oscillator such as a pendulum or balance wheel, but instead counts the oscillations of the AC utility current from its wall plug to keep time. It consists of a small AC synchronous motor, which turns the clock's hands through a reduction gear train. [...] The motor contains electromagnets which create a rotating magnetic field which turns an iron rotor. The rotation rate of the motor shaft is synchronized to the utility frequency; 60 cycles per second (Hz) in North and South America, 50 cycles per second in most other countries. The gear train scales this rotation so the minute hand rotates once per hour. Thus the synchronous clock {{can be regarded as}} not so much a timekeeper as a mechanical counter, whose hands display a running count of the number of cycles of alternating current.|$|E
