5000|$|In {{contract}} law, a <b>simple</b> <b>contract</b> is {{a contract}} made orally or in writing, {{rather than a}} contract made under seal. Simple contracts require consideration to be valid, but simple contracts may be implied from the conduct of parties bound by the contract. William Blackstone observed in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that in the seventeenth century, debtors used simple contracts as one of three accepted forms of unsecured debt instruments. In 1828, the Parliament of the United Kingdom amended the statute of frauds so that oral acknowledgments or promises {{could not be used}} as evidence to prove the existence of a <b>simple</b> <b>contract.</b> Today, some American jurisdictions have established that a security interest is perfected [...] "when a creditor on a <b>simple</b> <b>contract</b> cannot acquire a judicial lien that is superior to the interest" [...] of the secured party.|$|E

40|$|Supply {{reliability}} {{may suffer}} due to {{events such as}} labor strikes that disrupt capacity (random capacity) or manufacturing defects that result in yield losses (random yield). Suppliers can enhance reliability by process improvement and overproduction, but these mitigating actions are often not contractible. Moreover, the investment in mitigation depends critically {{on the design of}} the procurement process: whether the buyer determines the production quantity (control) or the supplier does (delegation). Complex contracts, typically with a penalty clause, can be used to coordinate the supply chain. However, evidence suggests that <b>simple</b> wholesale price <b>contracts</b> are widely used. Our main finding is that such <b>simple</b> <b>contracts</b> can perform well (in terms of supply-chain profits) {{depending on the type of}} supply risk and the procurement process design. We find that for random capacity, irrespective of the process design, contract performance is monotonically increasing in the supplier’s bargaining power, suggesting that <b>simple</b> <b>contracts</b> perform well when the supplier is powerful. However, this monotonicity trend is reversed for random yield with control: in that case, <b>simple</b> <b>contracts</b> perform well when the buyer is powerful. For random yield with delegation, <b>simple</b> <b>contracts</b> perform well when either party is powerful. Our findings provide insight and guidance regarding when <b>simple</b> <b>contracts</b> suffice, and when more complex coordinating contracts are warranted...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} of incomplete contracts is actually more about <b>simple</b> <b>contracts</b> than about incomplete contracts: “foundations ” of incomplete contracts are theories of why <b>contracts</b> are optimally <b>simple,</b> and “applications ” of incomplete contract theory are studies {{of what happens}} if agents can use only <b>simple</b> <b>contracts.</b> Or is it?

A gap in a law/contract can cease to look like a gap to the judge when other parts of the same law/contract become more complicated.

40|$|In {{most of the}} {{contract}} theory literature, contracting costs are assumed either to be high enough to preclude certain forms of contracting or low enough to permit any contract to be written. Similarly researchers usually treat renegotiation as either costless or prohibitively costly. This article addresses the middle ground between these extremes, in which the costs of contracting and renegotiation can take intermediate values and {{the contract}}ing parties can themselves influence these costs. The context for our analysis is the canonical problem of inducing efficient relation-specific investment and efficient ex post trade. Among our principle results are: (i) The efficiency {{and complexity of the}} initial contract are decreasing in the cost to create a contract. Hence the best mechanism design contracts can be too costly to write. (ii) When parties use the <b>simpler</b> <b>contract</b> forms, they require renegotiation to capture ex post surplus and to create efficient investment incentives. In some cases, parties want low renegotiation costs. Most interesting is that, in other cases, parties have a strict preference for moderate renegotiation costs. (iii) The effect of contract law on contract form is significant but has been overlooked. In particular, the law 2 ̆ 7 s interpretive rules raise the cost of enforcing complex contracts, and thus induce parties to use <b>simple</b> <b>contracts.</b> Worse, the law also lowers renegotiation costs, which further undermines complex contracts and is also inappropriate for some of the <b>simpler</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R

50|$|There are {{numerous}} situations where a claim is extinguished by operation of law. If two persons are jointly but not severally liable for a <b>simple</b> <b>contract</b> debt, a judgment at common law obtained against {{only one of}} the debtors works as an extinguishment of the claim on the other debtor as a matter of law. A conveyance of mortgaged land by the mortgagor to the mortgagee extinguishes the mortgage.

50|$|The {{reason that}} both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading {{scholars}} {{to be the}} result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of assumpsit, which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a <b>simple</b> <b>contract</b> in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his Traite des Obligations, much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially John Stuart Mill's influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.|$|E

By various statutes, the first dating from the reign of Henry VIII of England (in 1541), the crown has {{priority}} for its debts before all other creditors.

40|$|Estimates of {{the cost}} of {{disinflation}} made before the recent reduction in the inflation rate varied widely. Estimates were made in terms of the sacrifice ratio [...] the percentage points of GNP at an annual rate lost per percentage point reduction in the inflation rate. At one extreme it was argued thata resolute and credible monetary policy could reduce inflation virtually costlessly. At the other extreme were estimates that the sacrifice ratio exceeded 10. Costless immediate disinflation is not possible in an economy with long-term labor contracts. This paper sets out a <b>simple</b> <b>contracting</b> model of wage and output determination and uses it to calculate sacrifice ratios for a disinflation program, under the assumption that announced policy changes are immediately believed. Under this assumption disinflation with a structure of labor contracts like those of the United States would be less costly than typically estimated. The model is then modified to allow for the slow adjustment of expectations of policy to actual policy; sacrifice ratios then approach the ranges typically estimated. The sacrifice ratio for the current disinflation is calculated in the last section: the current disinflation was somewhat more rapid and less costly than previous estimates suggested. The calculated sacrifice ratio is consistent with the predictions of the <b>simple</b> <b>contracting</b> model. ...|$|R
