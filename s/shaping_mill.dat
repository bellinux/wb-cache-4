40|$|Abstract. From the {{definition}} of logarithmic spiral and its particular characteristics, logarithmic spiral is discussed and adopted as the tooth back curve of the relieving <b>shaped</b> <b>milling</b> cutter under the new manufacturing conditions. Thus, the relief angle of each point {{on the cutting edge}} keeps instant after regrinding the cutter and thereby makes for preserving the machinability stability. Besides, cutter structure parameters determine coefficient values in the equation of logarithmic spiral tooth back curve. Based on the objected-oriented thought, a CAD system for the relieving <b>shaped</b> <b>milling</b> cutter with logarithmic spiral tooth back is developed in virtue of the language of VBA embedded in AutoCAD, which achieves the automatic generation of logarithmic spiral, realizes the cutter parametric design, shortens the whole cycle and improves the design quality...|$|R

40|$|The rotors {{of three}} screw pumps are {{commonly}} machined using <b>shaped</b> <b>milling</b> cutters. The {{determination of the}} exact shape of the cutter is very important, since a high precision in the machining is required to obtain a high volumetric efficiency of the pump. This paper describes a method to determine the theoretical shape of the cutter, starting from the characteristic parameters of the pump. The rotors are modeled in space by helicoids. Then, the contact line between the tool and the workpiece is determined and this allows us to define the exact cutter profile, with a suitable reference system transformation...|$|R

50|$|Construction of the towermill of Gronsveld {{was started}} in 1618 by order of Joest Maximilian van Bronckhorst, count of Gronsfelt and was {{finished}} in 1623. The cylindrical <b>shaped</b> <b>mill</b> was raised in 1766 with a tapering part which has given it its distinctive shape. The mound around the mill was raised at the same time. The windmill remained property of the Van Bronckhorst family and later, by marriage, the Törring family until it was confiscated {{by the government in}} the French-Batavian period and publicly sold in 1805. The buyer was Van Gulpen who sold the mill on to miller Jacobus Jacobs who expanded the milling business with a farm. After his death Catharina Jacobs became the owner.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014, an {{estimated}} 80% of all gearing produced worldwide {{is produced by}} net shape molding.Molded gearing is usually either powder metallurgy or plastic. Many gears are done when they leave the mold (including injection molded plastic and die cast metal gears), but powdered metal gears require sintering and sand castings or investment castings require gear cutting or other machining to finish them. The {{most common form of}} gear cutting is hobbing, but gear <b>shaping,</b> <b>milling,</b> and broaching also exist. 3D printing as a production method is expanding rapidly. For metal gears in the transmissions of cars and trucks, the teeth are heat treated to make them hard and more wear resistant while leaving the core soft and tough. For large gears that are prone to warp, a quench press is used.|$|R

Paragon Mill and New Old Mill were built in the Edwardian Baroque style by H. S. Porter using Accrington brick and terracotta. They had cast iron columns supporting transverse steel beams and reinforced concrete floors. Initially they were built with five-storeys and nine bays but a sixth storey was added later. The machinery was electrically driven and a new electricity substation was built in 1915. At the same time, Sedgewick New Mill and Long Mill were virtually rebuilt to take heavier equipment (usually this meant ring spinning frames).|$|R

40|$|Three {{screw pumps}} {{represent}} an important family of positive displacement rotary pumps. They are quite easy to construct, {{even if the}} use of a <b>shaped</b> <b>milling</b> cutter for the rotor machining can cause some problems when the tool is not new. In fact the sharpening of the tool modifies the total geometry of the milling cutter by reducing its diameter. The shape of the single cutter does not change, but the cutter radial position is shifted towards the tool center. This causes deviations in the profile cut and the screws consequently need a long breaking in. In this paper the problem is analyzed from a quantitative point of view, using a method that allows us to determine the machining error {{as a function of the}} tool geometry variation. Moreover some alternative solutions to this problem are suggested...|$|R

The telescope cabin must be cooled prior to aircraft takeoff to ensure the telescope matches the external temperature to prevent thermally induced shape changes. Prior to landing the compartment is flooded with nitrogen gas to prevent condensation of moisture on the chilled optics and instruments.|$|R

40|$|William T. Thornton's {{contribution}} to developments in {{late nineteenth century}} political economy is generally associated with his criticism of John Stuart Mill's 'supply and demand' theory of value and his attack on Henry Fawcett's version of the wage fund doctrine. In a Fortnightly Review article (published in May and June 1869) on Thornton's book, On Labour, Mill publicly deferred to Thornton's criticism of the wage fund doctrine but did not accept his criticism {{of the theory of}} value. There is another aspect of Mill's review article, however, which historians of economic thought seem to have overlooked: his enthusiastic discussion of Thornton's treatment of trade union efficacy and industrial co-partnership. The question explored in this paper is whether Thornton's work on labour relations, trade union efficacy and cooperativism helped <b>shape</b> <b>Mill's</b> own thinking on these subjects during the 1860 s. We begin by documenting Thornton's views on trade unionism and then examine Mill's evolving sympathy toward trade unions-an important feature of his social reform program. It is sometimes claimed that nineteenth century economists tended to ignore the role played by trade unions in industrial society. This paper points out that Mill and Thornton, two leading economists {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century, did not oppose trade unions and were favourably impressed with the advantages for society of labour combinations. Nonetheless, they looked forward to the gradual supplanting of the system of collective bargaining by 'higher' cooperation. ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of splines, {{internal}} and external. External splines may be broached, shaped (for example on a gear <b>shaping</b> machine), <b>milled,</b> hobbed, rolled, ground or extruded. There are fewer methods available for manufacturing internal splines due to accessibility restrictions. Methods include those listed above with the exception of hobbing (no access). Often, with internal splines, the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole, which precludes use of a pull / push broach or extrusion-type method. Also, if the part is small {{it may be difficult to}} fit a milling or grinding tool into the area where the splines are machined.|$|R
