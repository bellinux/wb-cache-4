5|$|Golondrina {{points are}} {{widespread}} {{across much of}} central, southern, and western Texas, with distribution extending northward along the Balcones Escarpment. They are particularly prevalent across the <b>South</b> <b>Texas</b> Plains, so much {{so as to be}} said to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the <b>South</b> <b>Texas</b> Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several sites have also been found in Arkansas {{as well as in the}} Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.|$|E

5|$|Erika {{produced}} light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83inches (97mm) in Sabinal, {{though most}} locations reported {{less than two}} inches (50mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6inches (100 to 150mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika in <b>south</b> <b>Texas</b> peaked at 39mph (62km/h) in Brownsville, where a gust of 47mph (75km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60mph (95km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage in <b>south</b> <b>Texas,</b> including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged {{the roof of a}} business. The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|While {{the storm}} was located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 15, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning from Brownsville to Baffin Bay, Texas.

Late that same day, when strengthening was underway, a Hurricane Warning was either issued or recommended from La Pesca, Mexico to Baffin Bay, Texas, though the warnings for <b>south</b> <b>Texas</b> were dropped when a more southward motion occurred. Just one month after Hurricane Claudette caused millions in damage in <b>south</b> <b>Texas,</b> the fast movement of Erika caught citizens by surprise as it was forecast to make landfall near Brownsville.
