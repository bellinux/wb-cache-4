5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community</b> {{close enough to the}} rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line with the principles of the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community</b> of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{sometimes}} utopian {{concept of}} the new town, aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was {{an important part of}} Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century. In addition to the new towns of Edinburgh and Glasgow, these included the complete rebuilding of Inverary for John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll by John Adam and Robert Mylne, between 1772 and 1800. Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a gridiron plan. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community,</b> combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.|$|E
50|$|Like asylums for {{the mentally}} ill, the state-run schools for {{children}} and adults with cognitive disabilities found across the United States from the 1850s until the 1990s were usually <b>self-contained</b> <b>communities</b> as isolated from society's mainstream as prisons are today.|$|R

5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, <b>self-contained</b> <b>community,</b> it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community,</b> containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three o’clock in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E

500|$|Troy Middleton was {{the fifth}} of nine {{children}} and grew {{up at the end}} of the 19th century on a 400-acre plantation in southeastern Copiah County. [...] The plantation was virtually a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community,</b> and he had a variety of chores to do depending on the season, with sausage-stuffing being one of his favorites. The local Lick Creek and Strong River had plentiful fish that he would catch, and he loved to hunt, particularly with his 12-gauge shotgun. [...] While his family was Episcopal by heritage, they worshiped at the Bethel Baptist Church, a few miles west of Georgetown, the only church reachable on a Sunday morning. [...] His education was conducted at the small Bethel schoolhouse, near the Bethel Church, but in the summertime he was tutored by his oldest sister Emily, who came home from Blue Mountain College to share her knowledge of different subjects with her family. [...] Having exhausted all the educational opportunities available at home, Middleton's father asked him if he was interested in a college education. Finding this an attractive proposition, in the summer of 1904, at the age of fourteen, Middleton made the 172-mile train trip to Starkville, where he would begin his studies at Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mississippi A), later to become Mississippi State University.|$|E

In addition to the New Town of Edinburgh these included the complete rebuilding of Inverary for John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll by John Adam (1721–92) and Robert Mylne (1733–1811), between 1772 and 1800. Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a grid-iron plan. Small new towns on a gridiron plan in the period 1770–1830 included Cuminestown, New Pitsligo, Tomintoul and Aberchirder. At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community,</b> combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning. Housing was combined with generous communal and living spaces, a children's school and community education centre. It also introduced a village store that supplied good at lower prices and became the model for the co-operative movement. Scotland also produced one of the major figures in urban planning in sociologist Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), who developed the concept of conurbation, and discarded the idea of [...] "sweeping clearances" [...] to remove existing housing and the imposition of the gridiron plan, in favour of [...] "conservative surgery": retaining the best buildings in an area and removing the worst.

2500|$|Onslow Village Ltd {{acquired}} [...] or {{just over}} a square mile of land from Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow in 1920 for approximately one quarter of its market value at the time. The aim {{was to create a}} [...] "Garden City" [...] to be modelled on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard's Garden City Movement. It was their intention to build a <b>self-contained</b> <b>community</b> with smallholdings, public buildings, open spaces, recreation grounds, woodland and a railway station, as well as developing sites for churches, hotels and factories. On Saturday 1 May 1920, ten weeks after the formation of the Society, the foundations of the first two houses were laid and by March 1922 ninety-one houses had been built. Unfortunately {{due to a lack of}} funding the scheme never reached full completion, with about 600 houses actually being built. Original drawings however showed that there were further plans to develop the farmland at Manor Farm, north of the A3. By the mid-1970s, one third of the properties were still owned by Onslow Village Ltd. Then, in 1984, the company was wound up and many shareholders and tenants had the chance to buy their homes at extremely affordable prices.|$|E
