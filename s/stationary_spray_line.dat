40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some of {{the most}} important problems in modelling metal spray deposition processes: a spatial mass flux distribution within the spraying cone produced by the source, and a spraying efficiency in depositing material onto the substrate. The model is based on a continuous approach of the liquid metal spraying. The mass flux distribution function is derived from experimental observations and the mass preservation constraint. It depends on the source spray parameters and modelling functions. Upon impinging the substrate, liquid metal droplets disintegrate in a complex way. A fraction of the total mass arrived at remains in the point of impact, while the rest is splashed and re-deposited elsewhere. The ratio of the mass retained over the total mass arrived at is called the sticking efficiency. This parameter is found to be the solution of an inverse problem. The non-linear inverse problem is transformed into a boundary value problem, which is solved using methods for a curvilinear grid generation.

We explored the use of cold aerosol foggers and misting machines for area-wide applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (VectoBac WDG) as a larvicide targeting Aedes albopictus. During 2010 â 2013 we performed initially open field trials and then 19 operational area-wide applications in urban and suburban residential areas in northeastern USA to test three truck-mounted sprayers at two application rates. Area-wide applications of WDG in open field conditions at 400 and 800 g/ha killed on average 87 % of tested larvae.

40|$|In Fluid CokingTM or Fluid Catalytic Cracking liquid {{feedstocks}} are {{injected into}} {{a bed of}} fluidized particles. Uniform distribution of liquid feed on fluidized particles increases the yield of valuable products and improves operability in these processes. Contact between the injected liquid and the bed particles can be greatly affected by the liquid properties and local bed hydrodynamics. The impact of parameters such as liquid properties, fluidization velocity, nozzle atomization gas flowrate, nozzle location and inclination were investigated {{on the distribution of}} liquid sprayed into a fluidized bed with a reliable and fast response capacitance meter. This method was also extended to monitor the agglomerate breakup kinetics. The research showed that a liquid whose viscosity and contact angle on the surface of solid particles are similar to the liquid used in the high temperature commercial reactors provides a good simulation of liquid distribution into a fluidized bed with room temperature experiments. VarsolTM was selected for a cold simulation of Fluid Cokers. The research also presents an innovative design of a cold model fluidized bed to investigate the impact of the velocity of particles, relative to the spray nozzle, on solid-liquid contact since it varies greatly with location in actual Fluid Cokers. This design provided an inexpensive and accessible means to study the effect of the relative velocity between the spray jet and particles independently of other bed hydrodynamic characteristics. The investigation found that distribution of the injected liquid in the bed can be improved by either increasing the atomization gas flowrate or, preferably, the fluidization velocity. Study of nozzles at different locations and inclinations identified the dominant effects of bed hydrodynamics at the nozzle and jet tips on the distribution of liquid on solid particles.

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from chamber kilns with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 Â°C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate chamber kilns with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot kiln. The conditioning chamber opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough.

The article analyzes the methods of trenchless renovation for applying protective coatings: routing in the old pipeline of new pipes made of polymeric materials or polymeric sleeves, centrifugal spraying on the inner surface of pipelinesâ inorganic and organic protective coatings. Special attention was paid to bag technology, providing the required strength properties at specific values of the modulus of elasticity and a number of external factors such as the depth of the existing pipe, the existence and magnitude of the horizon groundwater over it. Also attention is paid to the application technology of tape coatings ribbed profile on the inner surface of pipelines. This technology has a unique feature, which is the ability of recoverable pipeline functioning during its renovation by winding an endless belt and the formation of a new pipe. The tape coating winding is carried out by different types of spiral winding machines. The thickness of the protective coating layer forming the tube remains minimal. Inorganic cement-sand and organic coatings were considered as alternative options for repair of pipelines, which allow to localize the defects {{in the form of a}} fistula, minor cracks and other damages. However it is noted that a cement-sandy covering is inferior to organic, because it does not provide the strength characteristics of the pipeline system. The main advantage of the organic coating is mudding fistula of a large diameter, making a high wear-resisting pipe, ensuring a smooth surface. Then the protective coating almost merges with the old pipeline.

The water remains <b>stationary,</b> {{excepting}} the <b>spray</b> and foam on the surface, and is only possessed of a rising and sinking motion. This undulatory motion, or impulse, is transmitted from each particle of water to its neighbouring particle, until it reaches the last drop of water on the shore. But when a wave reaches shallow water it has no longer room to sink to its proper depth; hence the water composing it acquires actual motion, and rushes to the land with more or less of the tremendous violence that has been already described.|$|R
