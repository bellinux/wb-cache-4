Bona's {{sway over}} {{the king and}} the magnates, her efforts to {{strengthen}} the monarch's political position, financial situation, and especially the measures <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> advance her personal and dynastic interests, including the forced royal election of the minor Sigismund Augustus in 1529 and his premature coronation in 1530, increased the discontent among szlachta activists.|$|E

In June 2015, she condemned the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China, and urged her fans to sign an online petition aimed at stopping it. In October 2015, she launched 'Pawsitivity', a campaign aimed at sensitising people about the adverse effects of noise, air, water and soil pollution on animals.|$|E

5|$|Hill was a gymnast {{early in}} life, nearly broke {{a world record}} lifting weights, and ran competitively. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> {{climbing}} at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and {{became a part of}} the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.|$|E
25|$|On losing this job, {{she took}} up with ex-soldier Thomas Conway in Birmingham; she moved to London with him {{and they had a}} {{daughter}} and two sons. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> drinking and left her family in 1880; the following year she was living with new partner John Kelly at Cooney's common lodging-house at 55 Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, at the centre of London's most notorious criminal rookery. Here <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> casual prostitution to pay the rent. To avoid contact with his former partner, Conway drew his army pension under the assumed name of Quinn, and kept their sons' addresses secret from her.|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of recent articles, Robin Jeshion has {{developed}} a theory of singular thought which she calls ‘cognitivism’. According to Jeshion, cognitivism offers a middle path between acquaintance theories—which <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> impose too strong a requirement on singular thought, and semantic instrumentalism—which <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> impose too weak a requirement. In this article, I raise {{a series of}} concerns about Jeshion's theory, and suggest that the relevant data can be accommodated by a version of acquaintance theory that distinguishes unsuccessful thoughts of singular form from successful singular thoughts, and in addition allows for ‘trace-based’ acquaintance...|$|R

The group practiced playing the drums for five months with a trainer for the single.

She also appeared in England in tours of two Ivor Novello musicals, Glamorous Night and The Dancing Years, the latter playing a season at the Saville Theatre in London. She also appeared as the Mother Abbess in the 1981 London revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music at the Apollo Victoria Theatre.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Courtneidge devoted {{much time}} to {{entertaining}} the armed forces. In 1941, she presented a nightly three-hour show, raising funds, and then formed a small company which <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> Gibraltar, Malta, north Africa, and Italy, performing for the services and hospitals. She also toured in Hulbert Follies (1941), and Full Swing (1942), which she and Hulbert then brought to the Palace Theatre. Together with other prominent performers including Robert Donat and Florence Desmond, Courtneidge led professional opposition to a wartime proposal to allow theatres to open on Sundays. Instead, they proposed that only charity shows for the troops should be permitted on a Sunday. The Hulberts appeared together in another musical, Something in the Air in 1943. The show received only moderate praise, although the performances of the two stars received good notices.|$|E
25|$|A fifth {{consecutive}} French {{cross country}} title came in 1989 {{and at the}} 1989 IAAF World Cross Country Championships {{she returned to the}} top of the podium, taking the gold medal and taking France to the team runner-up spot close behind the Soviet team. She suffered an injury, missing the rest of the season, and returned to action at the 1990 IAAF World Cross Country Championships held in Aix-les-Bains. She was not at full strength, however, and finished in 17th place overall. She competed over 10,000m at the 1990 European Athletics Championships in Split and came away with the bronze medal (her first on the track) and a new French record mark of 31:51.68 minutes.

25|$|When Blixen was {{diagnosed}} with syphilis, she was treated with mercury tablets. Some reports indicate that she took approximately 1 gram of mercury per day for almost a year, while others show she did so {{for only a few}} months. She then spent time in Denmark for treatment and was given arsenic, which she continued to take in drop form as a treatment for the syphilis that she thought was the cause of her continued pain. Blixen had reported severe bouts of abdominal pain as early as 1921, while she was still in Kenya. Several well-known physicians and specialists of both internal medicine and neurology diagnosed her with third-stage chronic syphilis. Mogens Fog, who was Blixen's neurologist, thought that her gastric problems were attributable to syphilis, {{in spite of the fact}} that blood and spinal fluid tests were negative. By the time she left Africa, Blixen was suffering from anemia, had jaundice and had overused arsenic. As clumps of her hair had begun to fall out, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> wearing hats and turbans.|$|E
25|$|Solace {{was next}} ordered to Espiritu Santo and arrived there on 20 March. During {{the next nine}} weeks, she {{shuttled}} between New Guinea, the Admiralty Islands, and Australia. She was back at Roi on 6 June and departed there nine days later for the Marianas. The hospital ship anchored in Charan-Kanoa Anchorage, Saipan, on 18 June. While the shores and hills were still under bombardment, she began taking on battle casualties, many directly from the front lines. When she sailed for Guadalcanal on the 20th, all of her hospital beds were filled, and there were patients in the crew's quarters. Altogether, the ship was caring for 584 men. Solace returned to Saipan from 2–5 July and embarked another load of wounded whom <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> the Solomons. From there, she was routed to the Marshalls arriving at Eniwetok on the 19th. Two days later, she sailed for Guam. Between 24 and 26 July, she took on board wounded from various ships and the beachhead for evacuation to Kwajalein. Solace was back at Guam from 5–15 August where she picked up 502 casualties for evacuation to Pearl Harbor.|$|E

500|$|The Chief Justice also {{suggested}} that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to find the defendant liable for defamation but {{reducing the amount of}} damages payable depending on how much care he or <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> ensure the accuracy of the information published. He noted: [...] "There is no reason why a defendant who has published a defamatory statement should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff's reputation simply because he has satisfied the 'responsible journalism' test." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexandra {{retained}} a youthful appearance into her senior years, {{but during the}} war her age caught up with her. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossips as having her face [...] "enamelled". She made no more trips abroad, and suffered increasing ill health. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her with temporary partial blindness.

Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a [...] "priggish schoolgirl" [...] was an extremely rare criticism. In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales. In public, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd.|$|E
