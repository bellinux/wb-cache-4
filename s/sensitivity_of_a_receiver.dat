The main function of such a filter in a transmitter is to limit the bandwidth of the output signal to the band allocated for the transmission.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a heterodyne experiment {{which uses a}} 380 - 520 GHz planar circuit balanced Nb-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -Nb superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) quasiparticle mixer with 4 - 8 GHz instantaneous intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth to quantitatively determine local oscillator (LO) noise. A balanced mixer is a unique tool to separate noise at the mixer's LO port from other noise sources. This is not possible in single-ended mixers. The antisymmetric IV characteristic of a SIS mixer further helps to simplify the measurements. The double-sideband receiver sensitivity of the balanced mixer is 2 - 4 times the quantum noise limit hν/k_B over the measured frequencies with a maximum LO noise rejection of 15 dB. This work presents independent measurements with three different LO sources that produce the reference frequency but also an amount of near-carrier noise power which is quantified in the experiment {{as a function of}} the LO and IF frequency in terms of an equivalent noise temperature T_LO. In a second experiment we use only one of two SIS mixers of the balanced mixer chip, in order to verify the influence of near-carrier LO noise power on a single-ended heterodyne mixer measurement. We find an IF frequency dependence of near-carrier LO noise power. The frequency-resolved IF noise temperature slope is flat or slightly negative for the single-ended mixer. This is in contrast to the IF slope of the balanced mixer itself which is positive due to the expected IF roll-off of the mixer. This indicates a higher noise level closer to the LO's carrier frequency. Our findings imply that near-carrier LO noise has the largest impact on the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>receiver</b> system which uses mixers with a low IF band, for example superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers.

In this dissertation, new methods of detecting these faint and random microwave signals are discovered. <b>A</b> Dicke type <b>receiver</b> has been designed and constructed in the effort to detect 22 GHz spontaneous emission from water vapor. The receiver compares the brightness temperatures of two waveguides, one containing gaseous H 2 O at low pressure as the source channel, the other is evacuated as the reference. Each waveguide is terminated with a polished brass plate, which provides a low background brightness temperature, at one end and is connected to the input of the receiver at the other end. The system is capable <b>of</b> detecting <b>a</b> brightness temperature difference as small as 0. 2 ∘K.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optical <b>receiver,</b> the gain and the {{collection}} area of the photo-detectors within the receiver should be increased. Detectors with internal gain such as avalanche photodiodes (APD) are usually used to increase the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the receiver. One problem with APDs is the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> their gain to their bias voltage, which makes them challenging to be fabricated in a standard CMOS process due to variations in their gain. However, when an APD is biased over its breakdown voltage, it is sensitive to a single photon, hence, {{referred to as a}} single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD). The SPADs are photon-counting detectors, which are less sensitive to their bias voltage, and can be integrated with rest of the electronic circuitry that form <b>an</b> optical <b>receiver.</b> An avalanche diode requires dedicated circuits to be operated in the SPAD mode. These circuits make the diode insensitive to an incident photon for a duration that is known as deadtime. Unfortunately, The collection area of the PD, APD, and SPADs are limited to their capacitance. Hence, a large photo-detector leads to a larger capacitance, which reduces the bandwidth of the receiver. In this thesis, a photon counting optical <b>receiver</b> based on <b>an</b> array <b>of</b> SPADs is proposed which increases the collection area with a low output capacitance. The avalanche diode and peripheral circuits which operate and readout-out the SPAD array are fabricated in the commercially available UMC 0. 18 μm CMOS process. Initially, the avalanche diode is tested and characterised. A high performance circuit is then designed and tested which is able to achieve short deadtimes up to 4 ns. Once the photon counting operation of the SPAD is verified, a numerical model is developed to investigate the influence of several factors, including the deadtime, on the performance of the photon-counting detector in a communication link. Based on the simulation results, which show the advantages <b>of</b> <b>an</b> array over a single detector, a prototype detector array of 64 asynchronous SPADs is designed and tested. This array uses a high-speed readout mechanism which is inspired by the current steering digital-to-analogue converters.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityDesigned {{within the}} {{framework}} of communication theory and utilizing psychological methods, <b>a</b> study <b>of</b> the Protestant parish ministry has been made yielding basic vocational information, and permitting the formulation of five major problems confronting the ministry and the Church today. Vital information about each communication which took place on one weekday and one Sunday in the life of each minister was systematically collected by a self-recording technique. All topics of conversation were gathered for content analysis. The methodology of this study differs from others made in this field in deriving primary data of communication from records made close to the moment of action, employing extensive followup interviews, and representing a virtually complete sample of the professional Protestant ministry in a greater urban area of 150, 000 people. Primary data were transferred to IBM punch cards and processed electronically; statistical results are presented in thirty-two tables and illustrations. Analysis is made of the contents, means, motives, and personal network of communication, providing answers to the questions: What does the minister talk about? By what means does he communicate with others? To whom does he communicate, and why? On the basis of primary and interview data five crucial problems of communication are formulated: (1) the problem of specialization, arising from the desire for vocational fulfilment, but largely frustrated by an overwhelming need for non-professional services; (2) the problem of supply and demand, which calls attention to the Church's failure to provide facilities and manpower to meet rising demands, and the inadequacy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> communication network corresponding roughly to a single wheel with all lines converging at the center, the minister; (3) the problem of selectivity or bias, indicating {{the degree to which the}} minister's conscious and unconscious preferences interfere with the establishment of truly cosmopolitan and inclusive Christian communities; (4) the problem of superficiality, indicated by the heavy predominance of incidental contents, brief contacts, and impersonal means of communication; and (5) the problem <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>of</b> remaining <b>a</b> sensitive <b>receiver</b> <b>of</b> communication in spite of the serious barriers created by status, schedule, and preoccupation with parish detail. Judging from his communications, the major role of the minister today is that of pastor, with the role <b>of</b> administrator <b>a</b> close competitor. In actual conversation as well as by stated preference, ministers move away from administrative functions toward pastoral, while parishioners and others call upon them more often for administrative than for pastoral services. Heavy involvement in committees and groups, averaging one fourth of all working time, gives new prominence to the organizational role, a role in which the minister is not well adjusted, and lacks strategy. The more professional ministry involving direct attention to religion in either pastoral, priestly, preaching, or teaching situations is mainly a Sunday phenomenon, all of these put together accounting for only 11 % <b>of</b> weekday conversation. <b>A</b> large proportion <b>of</b> ministers in this study are dissatisfied with their present vocational roles. Yet, they seem unable to cut out spheres of major activity and competence for themselves, and to interpret this specialization to their congregations. In outlining <b>a</b> strategy <b>of</b> communication to meet the situation, the author begins with <b>a</b> consideration <b>of</b> the pastor's own motives and vocational goals, laying particular stress upon the hazards of the Messiah complex. In asserting the need for multiple foci of communication, he analyzes the effects of staff on the actual communications of the pastor, and critically evaluates the staff-solution to the minister's dilemma.

These nodes must consume extremely low power and must communicate with their neighbours at bit-rates in the order of hundreds of kilobits per second and potentially need to operate at high volumetric densities. Since the power constraint is the most challenging requirement, the radio transceiver must consume ultra-low power in order to prolong the limited battery capacity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> node. The radio transceiver must also be compact, less than 5 × 5 mm 2, to achieve a target size for sensor node and operate over <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> at least one metre to allow communication between widely deployed nodes. Different transceiver topologies are discussed to choose the radio transceiver architecture with specifications that are required in this project. The conventional heterodyne and homodyne topologies are discussed to be unsuitable methods to achieve low power transceiver due to power hungry circuits and their high complexity. The super-regenerative transceiver is also discussed to be unsuitable method because it has <b>a</b> drawback <b>of</b> inherent frequency instability and its characteristics strongly depend on the performance of the super-regenerative oscillator. Instead, a more efficient method of modulation and demodulation such as on-off keying (OOK) is presented. Furthermore, design considerations are shown which can be used to achieve relatively large output voltages for small input powers using an OOK modulation system. This is important because transceiver does not require the use of additional circuits to increase gain or sensitivity and consequently it achieves lower power consumption in a sensor node. This thesis details the circuit design with both a commercial and in-house device technology with ultra-low dc power consumption while retaining adequate RF performance. It details the design of radio building blocks including amplifiers, oscillators, switches and detectors. Furthermore, the circuit integration is presented to achieve a compact transceiver and different circuit topologies to minimize dc power consumption are described. To achieve the <b>sensitivity</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>receiver,</b> <b>a</b> detector design method with large output voltage is presented. The receiver is measured to have output voltages of 1 mVp-p for input powers of - 60 dBm over a 1 metre operating range while consuming as much as 420 μW. The first prototype combines all required blocks using an in-house GaAs MMIC process with commercial pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (PHEMT). The OOK radio transceiver successfully operates at the centre frequency of 10 GHz for compact antenna and with ultra-low power consumption and shows <b>an</b> output power <b>of</b> - 10. 4 dBm for the transmitter, <b>an</b> output voltage <b>of</b> 1 mVp-p at <b>an</b> operating range <b>of</b> 1 metre for the <b>receiver</b> and <b>a</b> total power consumption of 840 μW. Based on this prototype, an MMIC radio transceiver at the 24 GHz band is also designed to further improve the performance and reduce the physical size with an advanced 50 nm gate-length GaAs metamorphic high electron mobility transistor (MHEMT) device technology.
