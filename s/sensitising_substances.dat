The link between these risk factors and the development of pain is still not understood, but stimulation of chemo-sensitive receptors in the muscle probably plays an important role. It has been suggested that <b>sensitising</b> <b>substances</b> may accumulate in the muscle during LLRW, especially when combined with mental load. The overall purpose of this thesis was to try to shed some light on the effects of LLRW on the concentration of <b>sensitising</b> <b>substances</b> (glutamate, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), norepinephrine (NE)) and on metabolism (lactate, pyruvate and oxygenation) in the trapezius muscle of healthy controls (CON) and subjects with trapezius myalgia (TM). A first step was to investigate whether females with TM exhibit higher absolute concentrations of glutamate and PGE 2 in the affected muscle during rest. Using Microdialysis (MD) females with TM and asymptomatic controls were studied during four hours of rest. [Glutamate] and [PGE 2] during rest did not differ between groups. A second step was to investigate, in a simulated occupational setting, the effects of LLRW on the concentration of <b>sensitising</b> <b>substances</b> and metabolism in the trapezius muscle of TM and CON, and whether increased work duration resulted in a progressive effect. Asymptomatic females were studied during baseline rest, 30 versus 60 min work and recovery, using MD and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Subjects with TM were studied during baseline rest, 30 min work and recovery. [Glutamate] and [lactate] increased in response to work, but not progressively with increased work duration. [Glutamate] was at all time points significantly lower in TM. [PGE 2]and oxygenation remained unchanged during work for CON, while for TM oxygenation decreased significantly during work. In TM [pyruvate] increased during both work and recovery, and a significant interaction between groups was found for [pyruvate] during recovery; while moderately increased in CON it increased progressively in TM. The effects of LLRW with and without superimposed mental load on intramuscular [NE], muscle activity and oxygen saturation in the trapezius were also investigated and compared. Using MD, electromyography and NIRS, healthy females were studied on two occasions; during 30 min LLRW and during 30 min LLRW with superimposed mental load. During work [NE], and muscle activity, were increased, while oxygenation decreased, but no differences between occasions. However, recovery of [NE] to baseline was slower after LLRW with superimposed mental load. The findings of the present thesis suggest: (i) no inflammation, or increased interstitial [glutamate] in TM; (ii) LLRW causes an increased anaerobic metabolism in both TM and CON; (iii) no effect of work duration was found; (iv) {{a significant difference in the}} effects of LLRW on the interstitial milieu of the trapezius muscle in TM as compared to CON; (v) LLRW causes a significant increase in [NE], but superimposed mental load does not cause a further increase; (vi) LLRW with a superimposed mental load may result in a slower recovery to baseline [NE] as compared with LLRW alone...|$|E

The aims were to further elucidate if an accumulation of <b>sensitising</b> <b>substances</b> or impaired oxygenation is evident in painful muscles during RW. Females with TM (n = 14) were studied during rest, 30 minutes RW and 60 minutes recovery. Microdialysate samples were obtained to determine changes in intramuscular microdialysate (IMMD) [glutamate], [PGE 2], [lactate], and [pyruvate] (i. e., [concentration]) relative to work. Muscle oxygenation (%StO 2) was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. During work, all investigated substances, except PGE 2, increased significantly: [glutamate] (54 %, P <. 0001), [lactate] (26 %, P <. 005), [pyruvate] (19 %, P <. 0001), while the %StO 2 decreased (P <. 05). During recovery [PGE 2] decreased (P <. 005), [lactate] remained increased (P <. 001), [pyruvate] increased progressively (P <. 0001), and %StO 2 had returned to baseline. Changes in substance concentrations and oxygenation in response to work indicate normal increase in metabolism but no ongoing inflammation in subjects with TM...|$|E

30|$|Disinfectants are {{chemicals}} that {{are able to}} reduce the amount of germs on objects to be disinfected. They are regulated mainly in the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 528 / 2012 [1]. They are used in several sectors by professional and non-professional users. The BPR separates disinfectants in five product types (Annex V): human hygiene, disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals, veterinary hygiene, food and feed area and drinking water [1]. In the professional sector, the use of disinfectants is very important to avoid infections, e.g. in hospitals or the food industry. The use of disinfectants in private homes by non-professional users however is intensely debated amongst scientists: In Germany, it is widely accepted that disinfectants should only be used by private persons if there are medical indications [2]. These might be infectious diseases of family members or if people in need of care are living in the household. The limitation of uses is due to the fact that disinfectants do not only inherit benefits but also might pose risks to humans and the environment [2]. Studies show that the use of disinfectants is only significantly reducing bacterial contamination in households if users follow a strict cleaning protocol [3, 4]. In a setting where households were not informed how to use a disinfectant, the prevalence of bacterial contamination was not reduced [3]. A study on the effects of antibacterial products on infectious disease symptoms showed that using antibacterial products did not result in a reduction of the primarily viral infectious disease symptoms [5]. Reports of resistances are often accompanied by reports of wrong uses or insufficient cleaning [6]. This may also cause cross-resistances to antibiotics [7]. For example, it is under discussion whether a resistance to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant, might lead to a resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [8]. For many disinfecting substances, data on possible cross-resistances is not available; and for this reason, it is unclear which active substances pose the highest risks of these cross-resistances [7]. However, quaternary ammonium compounds, biguanides (i.e. surface active agents) and phenolics are considered as high-risk biocides concerning resistance problems [7]. For several substances (isothiazolones, anilides, diamidines, inorganic acids and their esters, alcohols), little information is available on resistance or tolerance [7]. Due to ‘the nature of their interaction with the bacterial cell and their antimicrobial efficacy’ [7], the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) considers them as medium-risk biocides. Several disinfectants have irritating or sensitising properties. A study showed that concentrations of the <b>sensitising</b> <b>substances</b> CMI/MI, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide in disinfectants are in the same order of magnitude that leads to sensitising effects in laboratory tests [9]. Risks for the human health were especially high for spray applications or the use of concentrates for the cleaning of surfaces [9]. Some disinfectants or their metabolites can reach the environment. For example, the metabolite of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, was detected in surface waters [10] and biota [11]. Triclosan is also used in cosmetic products and in these cases does not fall under the BPR. Especially disinfection-by-products (DBP) which result from the reaction of halogenated oxidising substances with organic matter might pose risks that we are not aware of at the moment [12].|$|E
