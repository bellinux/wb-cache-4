5|$|The van Berkel Pavilion was {{composed}} of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving <b>scoops,</b> all built on a steel frame covered with glossy white plywood. It was situated on a raised platform, which was sliced by a ramp entrance, making it ADA accessible. The Hadid Pavilion was a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework made of more than 7,000pieces. A centennial-themed video presentation was projected on its interior fabric walls after dark.|$|E
5|$|Water brakes {{were first}} {{introduced}} on SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes {{can only be}} used when a splashdown element, in which {{a body of water}} surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When <b>scoops</b> on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several feet into the air behind it.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear <b>scoops</b> and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.|$|E

40|$|Advanced <b>SCOOP</b> 1 aspects play an {{important}} role in <b>SCOOP</b> projects. To support a full fledged <b>SCOOP</b> implementation we have to make sure that advanced <b>SCOOP</b> aspects are processed and translated correctly. The translation is done from <b>SCOOP</b> code which is processed and transformed into Eiffel code by running it through the <b>SCOOP</b> compiler. In order for <b>SCOOP</b> to be able and understand those advanced aspects we have to enrich the <b>SCOOP</b> compiler to know how to deal with those aspects while processing the <b>SCOOP</b> code. Modern <b>SCOOP</b> projects can include feature redeclaration involving separate and non-separate types. Cases of feature redeclaration including separate and non-separate types which are allowed under the <b>SCOOP</b> conformance rules fail being processed by the current <b>SCOOP</b> implementation 2. The solution is to simulate that no redeclaration was done on the feature signature while adapting the internal use of the changed type in the Eiffel code which was processed and translated from the <b>SCOOP</b> code. As well as feature redeclaration, casting is {{an important}} advanced aspec...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} consumer {{acceptance of a}} recycled paper <b>scoop</b> versus the existing polystyrene (PS) <b>scoop</b> as a dosing device for synthetic powder laundry detergents. Specifically: (1) Were the consumers aware of and {{in agreement with the}} environmental benefits of a recycled paper <b>scoop</b> versus the current plastic <b>scoop?</b> (2) Did consumers consider a recycled paper <b>scoop</b> as an acceptable replacement for the current plastic measuring <b>scoop?</b> The implementation of a recycled paper <b>scoop</b> would reduce packaging waste by approximately 20 % by weight and a significant source reduction through decreased consumption of raw materials. Additionally, it would provide a substantial cost savings of approximately $ 30 M USD annually. The recycled paper <b>scoop</b> consisted of 50 % of post industrial (external) recycled fibres, 40 % of post consumer recycled fibres and 10 % of virgin fibres and internal waste sources. The 10 % virgin fibres and internal sources was used to help increase the board strength and improve printability. The TAPPI (1989) test methods were used in the selection of the paperboard grades in meeting the performance requirements of the paper <b>scoop</b> application. The results of the home performance test indicated that a recycled paper measuring <b>scoop</b> was not an acceptable replacement for the plastic measuring <b>scoop.</b> Although there were positive ratings on the recycled paper <b>scoop,</b> they related to generalities and environmental preference. The recycled paper measuring <b>scoop</b> cannot substitute several aspects of the plastic <b>scoop,</b> specifically, the technical functionality, durability, rigidity and utility...|$|R
5|$|The character's {{death was}} and {{continues}} to be ranked in public polls of various opinions. It was voted Best Drama Moment on the BBC's annual TV Moments broadcast in 2004. The same year, a poll conducted for National Pub Week ranked the scene where a barman <b>scoops</b> some of Rachel's ashes into a bucket the fifth best of various pub-related television scenes. In 2008, the death was ranked at number three in Sky One's 50 Greatest TV Endings programme. In a 2010 public poll to promote Freeview HD, Rachel's death was ranked as the seventh most emotional TV moment. In 2011, Rachel's wedding to Adam was placed at number nine in Channel 5's Greatest TV Weddings programme. Colin McAllister opined that every woman's heart broke when they married.|$|E
5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet <b>scoops</b> have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime running lights.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable <b>scoops</b> in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>Scoop</b> {{released}} in 1983, Another <b>Scoop</b> features {{a multitude of}} demos, outtakes and unreleased material, {{many of which are}} songs by The Who.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as <b>scoops</b> for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E
5|$|When Leslie leaves Ron {{with his}} {{favorite}} movies for his surprise birthday party, {{one of them}} is The Bridge on the River Kwai, a 1958 film about British World War II prisoners forced to build a bridge in Thailand. The scene Ron watches on television is an actual scene from that film. The other film Leslie gives Ron is The Dirty Dozen, a 1967 war film about a team of convicted murderers being trained for mission to assassinate German officers, also during World War II. Leslie only finds out Ron's birthday, which was a closely guarded secret, by bribing an employee from Baskin-Robbins, an ice cream parlor chain that gives free <b>scoops</b> of ice cream to customers on their birthdays. Eagleton is such a rich town that, after their town meeting, they distribute gift bags that include an iPod Touch, a portable music player by Apple, Inc. Lindsay Carlisle Shay also drives a Cadillac Escalade, an expensive luxury sport utility vehicle brand by Cadillac. During another scene, Ron declares that birthdays were made up by Hallmark, a greeting cards company, to sell more cards.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and <b>scoops</b> up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
40|$|<b>SCOOP</b> is {{a minimal}} {{extension}} to the sequential object-oriented programming model for concurrency. The extension consists of one keyword (separate) that avoids explicit thread declarations, synchronized blocks, explicit waits, and eliminates data races and atomicity violations by construction, through {{a set of}} compiler rules. <b>SCOOP</b> was originally described for the Eiffel programming language. This paper makes two contributions. Firstly, it presents a design pattern for <b>SCOOP,</b> which makes it feasible to transfer <b>SCOOP’s</b> concepts to different object-oriented programming lan-guages. Secondly, it demonstrates the generality of the <b>SCOOP</b> model by presenting an implementation of the <b>SCOOP</b> design pattern for Java. Additionally, we describe tools that support the <b>SCOOP</b> design pattern, and give a concrete example of its use in Java...|$|R
