40|$|Bridge {{expansion}} joints, if {{not properly}} designed, constructed, and maintained, {{often lead to}} the deterioration of critical substructure elements. <b>Strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints consisting of a steel extrusion and neoprene gland are one type of expansion joint and are commonly used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). <b>Strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints are susceptible to tears and pull outs that allow water, chlorides, and debris to infiltrate the joint, and subsequently the bearings below. One area of the <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> that is particularly problematic is where it terminates at the interface between the deck and the barrier rail. The Iowa DOT has noted that the initial construction quality of the current <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> termination detail is not satisfactory, nor ideal, and a need exists for re-evaluation and possibly re-design of this detail. Desirable qualities of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> termination detail provide a seal that is simple and fast to construct, facilitate quick gland removal and installation, and provide a reliable, durable barrier to prevent chloride-contaminated water from reaching the substructure. To meet the objectives of this research project, several <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> termination details were evaluated in the laboratory. Alternate termination details may not only function better than the current Iowa DOT standard, but are also less complicated to construct, facilitating better quality control. However, uncertainties still exist regarding {{the long-term effects of}} using straight-through details, with or without the dogleg, that could not be answered in the laboratory in the short time frame of the research project...|$|E
40|$|Sealing of {{components}} {{where there is}} no relative motion between the elements concerned remains a significant challenge in many gas turbine engine applications. Loss of sealing and cooling air from the internal air system through seals impacts on specific fuel consumption and can lead to undesirable flow interactions with resultant cost implications. For gas turbines, various <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> types have been developed for use between Nozzle Guide Vanes in order to limit the flow of gas between the main stream annulus and the internal air system. Many different types of design have been proposed for overcoming <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> problems such as misalignment of the grooves due to manufacturing and assembly constraints. In this paper various methods, with a particular focus on patents, for minimising the amount of leakage caused by such problems for strip seals between nozzle guide vanes are reviewed. By considering {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technique it is concluded that although apparently new <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> designs for NGVs have improved performance, none of them can be considered to be ideal. This paper reviews the techniques and makes recommendations for future designs...|$|E

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} on the premature failures of neoprene strip seals in expansion joints in Iowa bridges. In a relatively large number of bridges, strip seals have pulled out of the steel extrusions or otherwise failed well before the expected life span of the seal. The most serious consequence of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> failure is damage to the bridge substructure due to salt, water, and debris interacting with the substructure. A literature review was performed. Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 specifications and recommendations, practices in the states bordering Iowa, and Iowa DOT design and installation guidelines were reviewed. Iowa DOT bridge databases were analyzed. A national survey {{was conducted on the}} use and performance of strip seals. With guidance from the Iowa DOT, twelve in-service bridges with <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints were selected for detailed investigation. Effective bridge temperatures and corresponding expansion joint openings were measured, DOT inspection reports were reviewed, and likely cause(s) of premature failures of strip seals were proposed. Experimental results show that for a majority of these serious failures (all in concrete girder bridges), the joint opening at 0 °F predicted by the Iowa DOT design equations, the joint opening at 0 °F extrapolated from the experimental data, or both, are larger than the movement rating of the <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> specified on the bridge plans. Other likely causes of premature failures of seals in the twelve bridges include debris and ice in the seal cavity, skew of bridge deck, improper installation, and improper setting of the initial gap...|$|E
40|$|Strip seals {{are used}} in gas turbine engines between two static {{elements}} or between components which do not move relative to each other, such as Nozzle Guide Vanes (NGVs). The key role of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> between NGV segments is sealing between the flow through the main stream annulus and the internal air system and to limit inter-segmental movements. In general {{the shape of the}} <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> is a rectangular strip that fits into two slots in adjacent components. The minimum clearance required for static strip seals must be found by accounting for thermal expansion, misalignment, and application, to allow correct fitment of the strip seals. Any increase in leakage raises the cost due to an increase in the cooling air use, which is linked to specific fuel consumption, and it can also alter gas flow paths and performance. The narrow path within the seal assembly, especially the height has the most significant affect on leakage. The height range of the narrow path studied in this paper is 0. 01 0. 06 mm. The behaviour of the flow passing through the narrow path has been studied using CFD modelling and measurements in a bespoke rig. The CFD and experimental results show that normalized leakage flow increases with pressure ratio before reaching a maximum. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} provide new experimental data to verify the CFD modelling for static strip seals. The typical flow characteristics validated by CFD modelling and experiments can be used to predict the flow behaviour for future static <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> designs...|$|E

40|$|The Nairn Avenue Overpass is a 213 m long, 11 -span, 4 -lane + {{sidewalk}} precast {{prestressed concrete}} I-girder {{bridge over the}} CP Keewatin Subdivision line in Winnipeg, MB. The superstructure consists of three continuous segments with deck joints at piers # 3 and # 8. The structure was built in 1967, and underwent major strengthening and rehabilitation of the deck, girders, and bearings in 1985. Piers consist of a cast-in-place pier cap approximately 18 m long supported on two cast-in-place columns approximately 7 to 8 m tall supported on concrete pile caps over timber raft-pile foundations. Leaking omega-style <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> deck joints at Pier # 3 and Pier # 8 have exposed the piers and girder ends to chloride contaminated run-off from the deck.

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{overview}} of the research that was performed for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) concerning the performance of bridge deck expansion joints. The purpose of the research is to evaluate several types of joints currently in use and also provides the evaluation criteria for rating the joint condition. The types of joints investigated are Compression Seal (B. S.) joint, <b>Strip</b> <b>Seal</b> (S. S.) joint, Integral Abutment Jointless (I. A.) joint, Poured Silicone (XJS) joint, and Polymer Modified Asphalt (LDI and PaveTech) joint. The research was performed by questionnaire surveys, Roadway Management data analysis, expert interviews, and site assessment. The problems and their causes, the merits, the potential improvements, and the estimated lives of these types of joints were identified from the questionnaire surveys. The results showed that the S. S., B. S., and I. A. joints are rated as the top three for their longer estimated lives as well as other attributes The results of the factor and logistic regression analyses of the INDOT Roadway Management data indicate that the performances of the S. S., B. S., and I. A. joint are rated first, second, and third respectively, based on deterioration rates under identical conditions of traffic loading, settlement, and age. Other types of joints could not be analyzed due to insufficient data. The investigation of the practices of surrounding states revealed that each state has its own experiences in using and maintaining the joints. There are no uniform drawings, specifications, and maintenance strategies among the investigated states. The investigation also showed that the Integral Abutment Expansion joint (I. A.) is commonly being used in the surrounding states. Finally the research provides pilot evaluation schemes for inspecting joints. Based on the findings of this research, an implementation policy has been designed to ensure the longer service life of expansion joints...|$|E
40|$|Clarke-Sather, AbigailSchumacher, Thomas;Many bridges in {{this country}} have reached their {{intended}} service-life, and are deemed in need of maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement services. A life cycle inventory collects relevant information about sustainability impacts {{that can be used to}} assess the effect of decisions on the economy, environment and society. Sustainability is important because it considers impacts that are externalized from traditional costing systems; so the impacts result in costs but bridge owners do not measure or pay those costs directly. Bridge management sustainability assessment can be thought of as impacting owners, road users, and the environment. As funding for bridge maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement services dwindle there are greater incentives for sustainable decision making. The development of inventories that assist practitioners in exercising sustainable bridge management techniques are increasingly becoming relevant in bridge management systems (BMS). The bidding process for bridge repair projects illustrates how including sustainable assessment into decision-making can improve upon BMS. Typically, A+B bidding considers both owner costs per item (A) and the costs incurred to the road users as a result of the time to complete the project (B); monetary values are assigned to the time necessary to complete the project and the bidder with the lowest total costs (A+B) is rewarded. The manner at which time is costed is dependent on the agency and can consider road user and vehicle operating costs. However, during traditions construction operations. the costs incurred to society, specifically road users, through travel delays and increased vehicle operation costs are being disregarded. In addition, the environmental costs to human health from pollutant emissions are ignored. These impacts can be greater from specific maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement service operations and differ from normal traffic patterns. By incorporating the costs incurred to users and the environment, both efficient and sustainable practices can be incentivized, therefore catalyzing contractors to further develop detailed and sustainable plans when bidding for and carrying out a project. For this study, we investigated various maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement actions that are pivotal to the structural health of a bridge. As a case study, the impacts of different deck expansion joint rehabilitation/replacement options measured sustainability impacts in the units of dollars. Thus, costs are associated with impacts incurred by the owner, user, and environment and are summed to provide a total cost to score the overall efficiency and sustainability of each option. Employing the A+B+C costing method, the options with the lowest cost prove to be the most efficient and sustainable. A full-depth replacement of an abutment expansion joint, on a particular bridge, was the primary focus of the case-study conducted. The joint's headers were fully removed as were the armoring and in-place sealant. Using the A+B+C costing method, the most sustainable joint maintenance program, for the particular abutment expansion joint, was determined for the bridge's remaining service life. It was found that the most cost effective joint maintenance program includes a full depth removal of the headers in 2015, and a partial depth replacement of the headers with Class A concrete in 2027. From these findings, the best option is an open compression seal implemented after the full depth replacement in 2015, and replacing the open compression seal with a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> in 2030. The lowest cost to the owner, users, and the environment for joint maintenance and replacement for the remaining life of the bridge is approximately $ 188, 000. 00. The most expensive joint maintenance program includes a full depth removal of the headers in 2015, and 7 partial depth replacement of the headers with elastomeric concrete; the headers replacement schedule would be supplemented with a new <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> implemented in 2015 and open compressions seals implemented in 2030 and 2036. The most expensive option would cost approximately $ 285, 000. 00, approximately 52 % more expensive than the optimized program. Within each program considered the owner costs ranged between 10 - 15 % of the total costs, the societal costs ranged between 80 - 90 % of the total costs while the environmental costs ranged between 2. 6 and 2. 7 % of the total costs.

40|$|Bridge deck {{expansion}} joints play {{an important}} role in the functioning of bridge structures. They provide room for bridge decks to expand and provide seals to prevent water and debris from penetrating the bridge substructure. When they fail to function properly, the performance of bridges can be seriously affected. In the past two decades a great deal of research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of different types of joints. Some of these prior research projects were based on field evaluation, while others utilized in-house laboratory tests. However, a systematic approach is lacking to explore the relationship between the joint condition and the factors that could affect the joint performance. ^ The condition rating of bridge joints is discrete and ordinal and has three levels, i. e., good, fair, and poor, and this research presents a methodology that uses the ordered regression model to predict the joint condition. The joint types investigated in the research are: compression seal (B. S.), <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> (S. S.), and integral abutment (I. A.). The source data is from the 1998 bridge inspection records provided by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). The estimation result confirmed the findings of the previous field studies as to different parameters 2 ̆ 7 influence on the joint condition. The research also showed how joint deterioration curves can be developed and used to compare the performance of different types of joints. ^ The dynamic programming approach was then used to provide a rehabilitation decision support system for determining the best time to repair and replace a joint within the life cycle of a bridge deck. With the objective of minimizing the total cost, this approach suggests the best rehabilitation policy of the joint for each possible length of the service life of the bridge deck. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the influence of the interest rate and the related cost values on the rehabilitation policy. ^ This research focused specifically on three types of expansion joints, but the methodologies can be applied to other infrastructure systems as well. The models presented in this research are expected to provide an easy and effective way to evaluate their performance. ...|$|E

40|$|In this project, Stora Enso’s newly {{developed}} building {{system has been}} further developed to allow building to the Swedish passive house standard for the Swedish climate. The building system {{is based on a}} building framework of CLT (Cross laminated timber) boards. The concept has been tested on a small test building. The experience gained from this test building has also been used for planning a larger building (two storeys with the option of a third storey) with passive house standard with this building system. The main conclusions from the project are:  It is possible to build airtight buildings with this technique without using traditional vapour barriers. Initial measurements show that this can be done without reaching critical humidity levels in the walls and roof, at least where wood fibre insulation is used, as this has a greater capacity for storing and evening out the moisture than mineral wool. However, the test building has so far not been exposed to internal generation of moisture (added moisture from showers, food preparation etc.). This needs to be investigated and this will be done during the winter 2013 - 14.  A new fixing method for doors and windows has been tested without traditional fibre filling between them and the CLT panel. The door or window is pressed directly on to the CLT panel instead, with an expandable <b>sealing</b> <b>strip</b> between them. This has been proved to be successful.  The air tightness between the CLT panels is achieved with expandable <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> between the panels. The position of the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> is important, both for the air tightness itself and to allow rational assembly.  Recurrent air tightness measurements show that the air tightness decreased somewhat during the first six months, but not {{to such an extent that}} the passive house criteria were not fulfilled. The reason for the decreased air tightness is not clear, but can be due to small movements in the CLT construction and also to the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> being affected by changing outdoor temperatures.  Long term measurements (at least two years) have to be carried out before more reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the long term effect of the construction on air tightness and humidity in the walls.  An economic analysis comparing using a concrete frame or the studied CLT frame for a three storey building shows that it is probably more expensive to build with CLT. For buildings higher than three floors, the CLT frame has economic advantages, mainly because of the shorter building time compared to using concrete for the frame. In this analysis, no considerations have been taken to differences in the influence on the environment or the global climate between the two construction methods...|$|R
