40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} interplay between {{economic}} performance and policies in OECD countries. Macroeconomic theory focuses on <b>supply</b> <b>policies</b> as a key determinant of country?s economic performance. Aggregate demand {{can play a role}} only in the short-run. This view rests {{on the assumption that the}} economy is always in equilibrium. However, market distortions may impede the adjustment of the economy to equilibrium and leave room for demand also in the long run. Our analysis reveals the presence of marked cross-country differences in economic performance, according to country size and EMU membership. Furthermore, we show that differences in performance are related to diverging dynamics in domestic vs. external demand components, and to different fiscal, openness and structural policies. Finally, we discuss how these results contribute to revise the standard view about <b>supply</b> and demand <b>policies</b> in the determination of economic performance.

The Plans of Hydraulic Works of 1902 and 1933, financed for the most part by the state, are an example of this type of policy.

50|$|The {{development}} of a national water <b>supply</b> <b>policy</b> occurred in parallel with these developments.

It had also recognised that the supply of water to non-domestic consumers was part of an integrated policy, and had introduced the concept of abstraction licensing. In many areas, pollution of rivers by sewage was a serious problem, resulting from rapid expansion of population, and little incentive to invest in sewage treatment works. The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act 1951 introduced discharge licensing, and with extra powers from a similar Act of 1961, tried to encourage local authorities to invest more in such works, but the Working Party on Sewage Disposal, which reported in 1970, concluded that there were over 3000 sewage treatment works which were performing inadequately.|$|E

Methods: Questionnaire were distributed to 200 ambulatory patients attending the A&E department on 4 April 2000, asking for their opinions on the reasonable duration of medication supply and its possible impact on emergency department misuse. The questionnaires were collected and the data analysed. Results: A total of 78 questionnaires (39 %) were returned. Forty-nine respondents (62. 8 %) accepted that dispensing two days of medications from emergency departments reasonable. Ten out of the 27 patients who disagreed on two-day supply (37. 0 %) considered that a three-day supply would be optimal. More {{than half of the}} respondents (52. 6 %) agreed with the hypothesis that a two-day <b>supply</b> <b>policy</b> would discourage misuse of emergency department service.
