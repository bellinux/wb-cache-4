5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics.

However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{the first}} partial edition, {{prepared}} by Marguerite E. Wilbur, {{was published in}} 1941 as A Pioneer at Sutter’s Fort, 1846–1850: The Adventures of Heinrich Lienhard. Wilbur translated the sections relating to Lienhard’s stay in California, excluding his trip to Switzerland in 1849. On the whole <b>she</b> <b>follows</b> the original, yet often omits episodes that, according to her judgment, “proved to be of slight historic value.” This severely weakens, partially falsifies the text and also seriously damages its authenticity.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the stage {{production}} is that the audience is watching genderqueer rockstar Hedwig Robinson's musical act as <b>she</b> <b>follows</b> rockstar Tommy Gnosis's (much more successful) tour around the country. Occasionally Hedwig opens a door onstage to listen to Gnosis's concert, which is playing in an adjoining venue.

Capitalizing on her notoriety from the incident, Hedwig determines to tell the audience her story ("Tear Me Down").|$|E
25|$|In an {{extraordinary}} act of identification, poet and essayist Rooney improvises on Kees’ most haunting poems, a quartet featuring an alter ego named Robinson. Her loosely biographical, knowledgeably imaginative, and gorgeously atmospheric story in verse portrays Robinson as a dapper, talented, and bedeviled man who conceals his sorrows behind insouciance. Rooney weaves lines from Kees’ writings into her bluesy, funny, and scorching lyrics as <b>she</b> <b>follows</b> Robinson from elation to desolation {{as his wife}} succumbs to alcoholism and his dreams fade. Rooney’s syncopated wordplay, supple musicality, and cinematic descriptions subtly embody Kees’ artistic pursuits as well as Robinson’s sardonic grace under pressure. An intricate, psychologically luminous homage, tale of American loneliness, and enthralling testament to poetry’s resonance.|$|E
