500|$|In early March 2002, a {{music video}} was {{released}} for [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] {{and the song}} was distributed to radio stations. Tell All Your Friends was released on March 25. It sold 2,000 copies its first week, charting at number 183 on the Billboard 200 chart. That summer, Taking Back Sunday toured with Brand New and Rufio. In December, a Fight Club-inspired music video was released for [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)". The group spent {{the early part of}} 2003 touring with The Used and The Blood Brothers before headlining their own tour. After the tour, Nolan and Cooper left the band and were replaced by Fred Mascherino and Matt Rubano. In September, [...] "You're <b>So</b> <b>Last</b> Summer" [...] was distributed to radio stations and the band began co-headlining a tour with Saves the Day which lasted until November.

500|$|From June to August 2003, {{the group}} {{was part of the}} Warped Tour. Reyes {{contacted}} his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's place; on August 5, it was announced that Mascherino {{was a member of the}} band. Bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with O'Connell, then joined the group. Rubano was asked to audition by O'Connell but was initially hesitant, since he was not a fan of emo music or aware of the band; however, he bought the album and learned Cooper's parts. On September 16, [...] "You're <b>So</b> <b>Last</b> Summer" [...] was released as a radio single. From September to November Taking Back Sunday co-headlined a tour with Saves the Day, supported by Moneen. In November, a music video for [...] "You're <b>So</b> <b>Last</b> Summer" [...] was filmed at Fulton State Park in New York. The video, directed by Winters, debuted on MTV on November 24. In the video, the band plays while Public Enemy vocalist Flavor Flav (in full regalia) jumps. According to Lazzara, {{the group was}} making fun of itself: [...] "We had two guys leave our band and there were two main singers, so we were trying to think of a way to bring the new band members into the video, but not have Fred singing the old guy’s part. And the funniest way to do that was to use Flavor Flav." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saves the Day toured with Green Day, Blink-182 and Weezer, {{playing in}} large arenas such as Madison Square Garden. By {{the end of}} the year they had {{performed}} on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, appeared on the cover of Alternative Press and had music videos for [...] "At Your Funeral" [...] and [...] "Freakish" [...] in rotation on MTV2. Taking Back Sunday released their debut album, Tell All Your Friends, on Victory Records in 2002. The album gave the band a taste of success in the emo scene with singles such as [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] and [...] "You're <b>So</b> <b>Last</b> Summer". Initially charting at number 183 on the Billboard 200, Tell All Your Friends was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and is considered one of emo's most-influential albums. Articles on Vagrant Records appeared in Time and Newsweek, and the word [...] "emo" [...] became a catchall term for non-mainstream pop music. Andy Greenwald attributes emo's explosion into the mainstream to a media search for the [...] "next big thing" [...] in the wake of the September 11 attacks: ...|$|E
