Data from the elevated location, together with visual observations, suggests that at night the smoke over the city is usually confined to a layer several hundred feet deep. A simple model is developed to consider the modification of stable air as it moves across a city acting as a heat and smoke source. An adiabatic mixing layer of increasing depth builds up due to the accumulation of heat. Applying this model indicates that half of the smoke in mid-winter is due to heating of buildings...|$|E

The aims of {{this study}} were (a) to examine the profile of {{hospital}} admissions for selected respiratory illnesses for two major hospitals in Cape Town, and (b) to analyse the association of such admissions with air pollution indicators and meteorological variables. The first part of the study investigated the admission patterns of coloured and African children under twelve years of age who were diagnosed as suffering from asthma or acute respiratory infections at two major teaching hospitals in Cape Town. Computerized hospital admission records covering the years 1988 - 1990 from the overnight holding wards of the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital and Tygerberg Hospital were used to determine patterns with respect to diagnosis, gender, race, age and date of admission. During the three year study period, respiratory admissions at both hospitals accounted for 15 078 (47. 3 %) {{out of a total of}} 31 887 admissions. Acute respiratory infections accounted for 63. 6 % and asthma 37. 4 % of these respiratory admissions. Two factors of interest were noted: (1) Considerably more males than females were admitted with both asthma and acute respiratory infections. (2) Asthma admissions to Red Cross Hospital among African children were proportionally much less than those of coloured children when compared to the proportions of admissions for acute respiratory infections. After removal of the seasonal effect, a multiple linear regression model was fitted to the data to determine the individual associations between admissions and ambient environmental variables. Significant associations were found between: (1) acute respiratory infections and oxides of nitrogen, <b>soiling</b> <b>index,</b> and temperature; (2) asthma and oxides of nitrogen (3) total admissions and <b>soiling</b> <b>index,</b> average temperature and minimum temperature (negative). The study concluded that despite generally low levels of air pollution in Cape Town, childhood respiratory admissions to Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital and Tygerberg Hospital were statistically significantly associated with some ambient air pollutants as well as temperature. However, given the nature of both the exposure and admissions databases, these results should be treated with caution. More representative site selections for air pollution monitors, as well as searching and controlling for possible confounding factors (i. e. indoor air pollution, parental smoking, overcrowding), would allow a better understanding of the current air pollution problem and the possible effects on the respiratory health of children in metropolitan Cape Town...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an empirical review of research concerning {{the impact of}} dust accumulation {{on the performance of}} photovoltaic (PV) panels. After examining the articles published in international scientific journals, many differences between the studies were found {{within the context of the}} PV technologies used, the contribution to this type of study from different countries, and the variety in the representation of the results where each study has its unique parameters, testing equipment, and relevant standards. Due to those variations and differences, it has been found that it is very difficult and impractical to compare between results of the corresponding studies. Hence, in addition to the valuable reviews found in literature, this article demonstrates another new perspective that highlights the gaps in the studies related to the impact of dust accumulation on PV panels. The conclusions of this study are considered to be the seed for establishing a new initiative—The Photovoltaic <b>Soiling</b> <b>Index</b> (PVSI) —which would be an indicator for the performance of PV panels under exposure to dust at the Standard Test Conditions (STC), as well as at other operating conditions in different locations around the globe...|$|E

This {{can be used as}} a mean of designing the road pavement required for a particular strength of sub-grade by comparing the strength of different sub-grade materials. However; civil engineers always encounter difficulties in obtaining representative CBR value for design of pavement. Over the years, many correlations had been proposed by various researchers in which the <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties were used to develop these correlations. A study was carried out to find correlations between CBR value with <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties those best suit the type of soils in Sri Lanka. Analyses were carried out based on the published correlations and soil data obtained from several Sri Lankan project sites. Based on the results, it is observed that the current published correlations are not in good agreement with Sri Lanka soils. In addition, no typical range could be found based on the <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties. Mechanical Strength of soil depends not only on the soil type but also on the observable physical characteristics which significantly influence on a soil’s behavior. Therefore, a method is proposed for correlating soaked CBR value and compaction parameters with such index properties, for Sri Lankan soils. This research covers the entire soil types according to Unified Soil Classification System which are generally used as sub-grades and base-courses. Among the several <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties, Atterberg Limits and grain size distribution data are used in this regard as these tests are much more economical and rapid than Compaction and CBR tests. The correlations are established in the form of an equation as a function of different soil properties by the method of regression analysis.

Soil {{compaction}} mainly {{occurs in}} occasions related with agricultural traffic, when {{the soil is}} subjected to various applied loads by different types of agricultural implements. Soil surface compaction and deep soil compaction occurs because of soil-tyre interaction process that will modify the initial stress state. This will alter the initial soil physical properties, so {{it is possible to}} evaluate the soil compaction by measuring their variation. This paper presents a tool and a method for experimental determination, in laboratory conditions, of <b>soil</b> cone <b>index</b> at soil-tyre interface layer and on soil profile, being focused only on data related with <b>soil</b> cone <b>index</b> influenced by wheel load and number of passes.

40|$|This master thesis {{addresses}} {{challenges of}} the determination of agricultural land use, based on the land production potential indicated by the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index,</b> which is recorded in the land cadastre. In the theoretical part, legislation of protection of agricultural land, spatial planning and land cadastre in Slovenia are presented. They are crucial for understanding the implementation {{and use of the}} land productivity index for the determination of agricultural land use. The focus is on current “Agricultural Land Act”, which was introduced in 1996, with amendments, in particular the amendment from 2011, which has brought a new categorization of agricultural land with two categories: prime agricultural land conservation areas (TVKZ) and other agricultural areas (OKZ). The thesis presents analytical studies of the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> in thirteen municipalities in Pomurje region in order to determine whether the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> of agricultural land is a suitable criterion for determining the areas of TVKZ and OKZ. For each municipality the average value of <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> and distribution of agricultural land considering <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> classes was determined. Furthermore, the analysis of the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> of agricultural land in drainage areas and in areas of permanent crops (plantations) was conducted, and the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> was analyzed considering the slope of the terrain. The thesis provides results of three versions of TVKZ and OKZ areas for all thirteen municipalities, which are than compared with the areas of the old agricultural land classification, i. e. with the best agricultural land (K 1) and other agricultural land (K 2). The results of our research confirmed the suitability of the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> for determining the areas of TVKZ and OKZ. However, {{it has been shown that}} the same limit value of the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> is not suitable to determine the areas of TVKZ in all municipalities that were included into our research. Thus, two new criteria were defined for determining areas of TKVZ: areas with irrigation systems and intensive orchard plantations. The thesis concludes that the determined areas of TVKZ and OKZ are geographically much more dispersed than the areas of K 1 and K 2. To ensure the homogeneity of the TVKZ and OKZ areas it is necessary to consider additional criteria: vineyard areas, drainage areas, land consolidation areas and the slope of the terrain...|$|R

Stabilized and unstabilized specimens were prepared using Iowa State University 2 in. by 2 in. compaction apparatus. Specimens were prepared, cured, and tested for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) with and without vacuum saturation. Percent fines content (F 200), AASHTO group index (GI), and Atterberg limits were tested before and after stabilization. The results were analyzed using multi-variate statistical analysis to assess influence of the various <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties on post-stabilization material properties. Results indicated that F 200, liquid limit, plasticity index, and GI of the materials generally decreased with increasing cement content.

We found significant differences in the <b>soil</b> productivity <b>indexes</b> among <b>soil</b> types; the <b>indexes</b> ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 85 and averaged 0. 47. Higher productivity soils generally occurred in forest areas within the west and northwest sub-regions of Yunnan, while lower productivity soils tend to be located at low or extremely high elevations. The <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> was lowest for barren land, followed by dry farmland, grassland, paddy fields, horticultural land, and forest lands. We found the productivity index to increase significantly as latitude increased and to vary with altitude at lower elevations. The <b>soil</b> productivity <b>index</b> ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 61 generally from the southeast sub-region to the northwest sub-region.

40|$|The {{research}} shows {{the application of}} <b>Soil</b> Stability <b>Index</b> Mapping (SINMAP) to predict the potential of landslide hazard. The study was conducted at Rawatamtu sub-Watershed, located at Jember Regency. Input {{data for this study}} are: (1) digital elevation model (DEM), (2) physical preperties of soil, (3) rainfall data, and (4) other GIS layers collected from the study area. The DEM was obtained from ASTER GDEM 2. SINMAP calculate the <b>soil</b> stability <b>index</b> based on combination effect of: slope stability, soil properties, land use and rainfall intensity. Then, interaction of those four factors are integrated on SINMAP and are classified as <b>soil</b> stability <b>index.</b> About 50 locations were surveyed by GPS and optical camera to interpret the map qualitatively. Result show the stable zone (index value > 1. 5) occupied about 64. 7 % of the watershed area. Area that classified in the upper and bottom limit of landslide (i. e. potentially subject to landslide hazard) are located at both mountain areas (Mount Argopuro and Raung) of the sub-watershed...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} {{procedure of}} sandy <b>soil’s</b> compression <b>index</b> is proposed in this paper. At first, {{a series of}} box shear test datum are obtained under constant perpendicular stress condition. Secondly, this method is carried out by fitting some equations to sandy soil’s shearing behaviors (i. e., dilatancy behaviors). Finally, sandy <b>soil’s</b> compression <b>index</b> is obtained by relationship between maximum compressive displacements and initial specific volumes. The validity of this method is confirmed by applying to local soil Shirasu. And the relation between Shirasu’s compression index and degree of saturation is made clear for the first time.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{policies}} of the European Union the purposes of soil quality descriptions can be on the one hand represented by the performed functions of the soil, which correspond to the land use goals. With the consideration of soil dynamics through responses to human or natural impacts on the other hand, a complex approach is achieved that gives a solid ground to evaluate and relate the quality of soil according to the requirements of sustainability. Therefore functions and responses are considered in our soil quality perception with special regards to major degradation threats, which are in the focus of the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection in the European Union. Concept and definitions in the soil quality domain (soil quality, <b>soil</b> threath <b>index,</b> <b>soil</b> sustainability <b>index</b> etc.) are given in the report. The report provides a framework for soil quality and sustainability evaluation, that can be applied in variouse planning and decision making procedures. JRC.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop {{empirical}} relationship between CBR values and <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties of cohesive soils as road subgrade. However; it is always difficult for highway engineers to obtain representative CBR values for design of pavement. Over the years, many correlations had been proposed by various researchers in which the <b>soil</b> <b>index</b> properties were used to develop these correlations. The CBR value is affected by the initial state parameters of soil as described by the water content and dry density and the testing conditions. Silty clay soil samples were compacted at different water contents and dry densities to measure the strength by CBR tests in soaking and unsoaking conditions. The results show that the CBR values of these soils are greatly influenced by the water content and dry density (i. e. the initial state parameters) of the soil as well as the testing conditions. Analysis of the experimental data indicated that it is possible to combine these initial state parameters in a way reflecting the influence of each of them on the CBR. Therefore a new concept has been developed; this is called the initial state factor. This factor is also developed for the soaking or saturated condition and is called the soaking state factor. On basis of this concept, a reliable strong correlation has been established between CBR values and soil state factors and plasticity index. Comparison between the measured soaked or unsoaked CBR values and the calculated results using the developed equations clearly indicates the reliability of these equations...|$|R
