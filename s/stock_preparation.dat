30|$|Human liver {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma cells (Hep G 2) {{were from the}} American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). These {{cells were cultured in}} EMEM medium supplemented with 10 % FBS, 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, 1 % ultraglutamine and 1 % NEAA. They were incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidified incubator. For AuNP exposure, cells were plated at densities of 7.5 × 104 cells per millilitre in 96 -well tissue culture microtiter plates (Greiner-Bio one, CellStar, Madrid, Spain) and subsequently incubated for 24 h. After this period, cells were exposed to a series of concentrations of the five AuNP preparations for either 2 or 24 h for ROS production studies or for 24 or 48 h for the cytotoxicity studies. AuNP suspensions were prepared in high-grade Milli-Q water to achieve a stock concentration of 1, 000 μg/ml. All <b>stock</b> <b>preparations</b> were stored at 4 °C. AuNP working concentrations were prepared from the 1, 000 μg/ml <b>stock</b> <b>preparations</b> in EMEM/S + or EMEM/S-. Given the different size and stability profiles found for the AuNPs when suspended in these two types of medium, as shown by UV–vis, DLS and TEM analysis, we performed exposures in medium with and without serum. Working concentrations ranged from 0.781 to 100 μg/ml and were prepared using serial half dilutions. The final concentration of water in EMEM medium did not cause any osmotic imbalance. For each assay, three independent experiments were performed, with exposures carried out in triplicate for each concentration. Untreated cells in culture medium were used as negative controls in all experiments, while a serial half dilution of chloramine-T was used to produce a concentration range between 0.325 and 10 mmol/l, which was used as a positive control.|$|R

5000|$|According to Hervé:In {{the second}} century BC, the {{anonymous}} author of a papyrus kept in London used a balance to determine whether fermented meat was lighter than fresh meat. Since then, many scientists {{have been interested in}} food and cooking. In particular, the preparation of meat stock—the aqueous solution obtained by thermal processing of animal tissues in water—has been of great interest. It was first mentioned in the fourth century BC by Roman Apicius (André (ed), 1987), and recipes for <b>stock</b> <b>preparation</b> appear in classic texts (La Varenne, 1651; Menon, 1756; Carême & Plumerey, 1981) and most French culinary books. Chemists have been interested in meat <b>stock</b> <b>preparation</b> and, more generally, food preparation since the eighteenth century (Lémery, 1705; Geoffrey le Cadet, 1733; Cadet de Vaux, 1818; Darcet, 1830). Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier is perhaps the most famous among them—in 1783, he studied the processes of <b>stock</b> <b>preparation</b> by measuring density to evaluate quality (Lavoisier, 1783). In reporting the results of his experiments, Lavoisier wrote, [...] "Whenever one considers the most familiar objects, the simplest things, it's impossible not to be surprised to see how our ideas are vague and uncertain, and how, as a consequence, it is important to fix them by experiments and facts" [...] (author's translation). Of course, Justus von Liebig should not be forgotten in the history of culinary science (von Liebig, 1852) and stock was not his only concern. Another important figure was Benjamin Thompson, later knighted Count Rumford, who studied culinary transformations and made many proposals and inventions to improve them, for example by inventing a special coffee pot for better brewing. There are too many scientists who have contributed to the science of food preparation to list here. — Hervé This, 2006 ...|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} provirus copy number per cell (VCN/cell) {{is a fundamental}} issue in transgenesis {{as well as in}} gene therapy studies based on stably integrated vectors. To this end, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a powerful method but it is sensible to differences in quality or concentration of the two-plasmid preparations used for the construction of the standard curves. In order to minimize technical errors we included genome specific sequences (mouse or human) and vector specific sequences in the same plasmid. We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of these bivalent plasmids by qPCR analysis on mouse and human genomic DNA containing a known number of a reporter lentiviral vector and we found that the system is reliable to measure up to 0. 1 VCN/cell. Here we have applied this assay to measure vector titer of virus <b>stock</b> <b>preparations</b> and to determine the optimal cell passages at which viral titration effectively reflects the number of integrated vectors...|$|R

Pretreatment of HEK cells with a medium containing 5 -fluorouracil desoxyriboside (FUDR) did not affect induction of either adenovirus or SV 40 neoantigen or development of cytopathic effects after infection with E 46 +, but did prevent formation of Ad. 7 viral antigen...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>preparation</b> {{systems for}} {{recycled}} papers {{need to be}} designed to produce a high quality, uniform product from a source that has significantly varying properties. Process models are {{a useful tool for}} analyzing and optimizing <b>stock</b> <b>preparation</b> systems. However, many models only account for the bulk flows of the components {{in the form of the}} fraction of fibers, contaminants, and ash. This report extends some of these modelling ideas to include component distributions. For example, the fiber fraction can be treated as a distribution based on fiber length and possibly fiber coarseness and composition. The contaminant concentration is expressed as a function of both particle size and density of the contaminant. Finally, the separation efficiency of the processing steps also becomes a function of fiber and contaminant distributions. Ultimately, these models are used to determine the efficiency of various <b>stock</b> <b>preparation</b> systems with differing configurations of the cleaners, screens, washing, and other operations. Such models allow the performance of existing and new systems to be compared and optimized, especially in the light of the changing composition of the feedstock...|$|E

Results obtained with this technique were reproducible and compared favorably with a conventional cell-free infection inhibition assay. The transfection-neutralization assay obviates the need for virus <b>stock</b> <b>preparation</b> and, therefore, is particularly suitable for the evaluation of HIV- 1 clones with slow replication kinetics and of recombinant chimeric HIV- 1 clones inclined to undergo additional mutations during <b>stock</b> <b>preparation.</b> The potential value of this assay for the analysis of the specificity of neutralizing sera and MAbs was demonstrated in experiments with V 3 chimeric molecular clone...|$|E

40|$|Development and {{evaluation}} of medical countermeasures for diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics requires production of standardized, reproducible, and well characterized virus preparations. For filoviruses this includes plaque assay for quantitation of infectious virus, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for morphology and quantitation of virus particles, and real-time reverse transcription PCR for quantitation of viral RNA (qRT-PCR). The ViroCyt® Virus Counter (VC) 2100 (ViroCyt, Boulder, CO, USA) is a flow-based instrument capable of quantifying virus particles in solution. Using a proprietary combination of fluorescent dyes that stain both nucleic acid and protein in a single 30 min step, rapid, reproducible, and cost-effective quantification of filovirus particles was demonstrated. Using a seed stock of Ebola virus variant Kikwit, the linear range of the instrument {{was determined to be}} 2. 8 E+ 06 to 1. 0 E+ 09 virus particles per mL with coefficient of variation ranging from 9. 4 % to 31. 5 % for samples tested in triplicate. VC particle counts for various filovirus stocks were within one log of TEM particle counts. A linear relationship was established between the plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and the VC.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} the {{accurate}} diagnosis of influenza based on {{culture of the}} virus or PCR are highly sensitive and specific but require specialised laboratory facilities and highly trained personnel and, {{in the case of}} viral culture, can take up to 14 days to obtain a definitive result. In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor (QCM) has been developed and its potential evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of both influenza A and B viruses in laboratory-cultured preparations and clinical samples. The effective limit for detection by QCM for <b>stock</b> <b>preparations</b> of both A/PR/ 8 / 34 and B/Lee/ 40 viruses was 1 × 104 pfu/mL, associated with observed frequency shifts of 30 (± 5) and 37 (± 6. 5) Hz, respectively. Conjugation of 13 nm gold nanoparticles to the detecting antibody improved the mass sensitivity of the immunosensor, resulting in a 10 -fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit of 1 × 103 pfu/mL for both preparations, with resulting frequency shifts of 102 (± 11) and 115 (± 5) Hz, respectively. Detection of virus in nasal washes with this technique was achieved by overnight passage in MDCK cultures prior to analysis.
