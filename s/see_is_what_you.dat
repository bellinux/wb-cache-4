25|$|The kind of markup used by {{traditional}} word-processing systems: binary codes embedded within document text that produce the WYSIWYG ("what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get") effect. Such markup is usually hidden from human users, even authors or editors.|$|E
25|$|Some early {{examples}} of computer markup languages available outside {{the publishing industry}} {{can be found in}} typesetting tools on Unix systems such as troff and nroff. In these systems, formatting commands were inserted into the document text so that typesetting software could format the text according to the editor's specifications. It was a trial and error iterative process to get a document printed correctly. Availability of WYSIWYG ("what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get") publishing software supplanted much use of these languages among casual users, though serious publishing work still uses markup to specify the non-visual structure of texts, and WYSIWYG editors now usually save documents in a markup-language-based format.|$|E
25|$|Simonyi {{remained}} at Microsoft during its rapid {{rise in the}} software industry, becoming one of its highest-ranking developers. He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a What You <b>See</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Get (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E

500|$|The first {{operating}} system publicly {{released by the}} company was a variant of Unix announced on August 25, 1980. Acquired from AT through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it Xenix, and hired Santa Cruz Operation in order to port/adapt the {{operating system}} to several platforms. This Unix variant would become home to {{the first version of}} Microsoft's word processor, Microsoft Word. Originally titled [...] "Multi-Tool Word", Microsoft Word became notable for its use of [...] "What You <b>See</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Get", or WYSIWYG pioneered by the Xerox Alto and the Bravo text editor in the 1970s.|$|E

The encyclopedia is recommended for further reading by David Southwell and Sean Twist in their book Unsolved Political Mysteries. Writing for The Star, James Mitchell observed, [...] "There's a huge amount packed in here, simply presented."

500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 24, 2014, until October 8, 2014. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Glen Winter, and Arrows by Jesse Warn. The fight scene between the Flash and Arrow in The Flash episode was shot over three nights. Because {{this was the first}} time Stephen Amell's character fought someone with superpowers, he had to change the way he performed stunts to accommodate the special effects. Comparing the filming of both series, Grant Gustin described The Flash shooting as [...] "really tedious," [...] working with [...] "a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we are going to be in" [...] and later added in post-production, as opposed to Arrow where [...] "they shoot it from the perfect angles and what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get". Gustin also recalled at times it got confusing on set because they were shooting both episodes at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Perry Como {{made the}} move to {{television}} when NBC initially televised the Chesterfield Supper Club radio program on December 24, 1948. A very special guest on that first television show was Como's eight-year-old son, Ronnie, {{as part of a}} boys' choir singing [...] "Silent Night" [...] with his father. The show was the usual Friday night Chesterfield Supper Club with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television. The experimental simulcast was to continue for three Friday [...] "Supper Club" [...] shows, but had gone so well, NBC decided to extend the televised version through August 1949. Years later, Como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially, but somehow managed to just be himself. Said Como, [...] "You can't act on TV. With me, what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get." [...] While still in its experimental phase, Como and the television show survived an on location broadcast in Durham, North Carolina, on April 15, 1949.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here {{is a guy who}} is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began to see him as more transparent—what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÓBriain gained their subjects' trust, [...] "dissolving any self-consciousness {{as a result of their}} cameras".|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't {{have much in common}} with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

This album also featured Johnnie Johnson, {{as well as}} guest appearances by organist Reese Wynans (of Double Trouble), saxophone player Jim Horn, and a local musician named Robbie Bartlett, who sang guest vocals on [...] "Everyday People." [...] It included the non-charting single [...] "Lonely Nights" [...] and a tribute song to Carl Perkins entitled [...] "Last Night I Met Carl Perkins", {{as well as two}} covers: [...] "I Still Wanna Be Your Man," [...] originally recorded by Eddie Hinton, and [...] "Have You Ever Loved a Woman?," [...] a blues standard made famous by Eric Clapton. This album received generally favorable reviews. Mark Deming gave a three-star rating for Allmusic, saying that the album's more rhythm and blues and soul-influenced sound worked well due to the blues influences present in Southern rock, although he added that the album retained the [...] "big guitar bombast" [...] of the band's previous works. Matt Bjorke of About.com considered its sound a departure from the earlier albums, but added [...] "it's not hard to see that the band fully enjoys what they are doing" [...] and highlighted the presence of a horn section and Hammond B-3 organ on some tracks. Ray Waddell of Billboard magazine considered Wynans' and Johnson's contributions [...] "perfect fits", and noted that the album was [...] "laid back" [...] until the second half.
