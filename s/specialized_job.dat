25|$|Workers obtain {{information}} about colony needs from the environment, and must respond {{to changes in}} colony structure. Activity in the colony seems to be decentralized, {{with the majority of}} interactions initiated by workers, not the queen. Workers that are more dominant tend to pressure subordinates to forage by dominance interactions, and thus subordinates do the majority of foraging. Those who are foragers must respond to intrinsic and extrinsic changes in colony need in order to maintain levels of food, water and building materials. The job of collecting water seems to belong to a small number of fixated foragers. When water foragers are removed from the nest, the remaining individuals will increase their search rate rather than recruit other workers to become water foragers. This indicates that foraging for water is a <b>specialized</b> <b>job.</b> Nectar collection, however, depends on a larger number of workers. When nectar foragers are removed from the nest, new individuals are recruited to replace them. This may be because the location of nectar is not always known, and nectar foragers are not able to increase their search rate {{to make up for lost}} workers.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{entry-level}} computer engineering jobs require {{at least a}} bachelor's degree in computer engineering.

5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more <b>specialized</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{economic}} migration {{on a large}} scale, we often see {{that the majority of}} migrants are working age people. This places a strain on the country that the migrants leave; as working age people exit the country, the elderly population remains - thus straining the economy. However, the advantage to this country could be a release of pressure on the current job market and resources. Looking at the nation that the migrants enter, the inflow of migrants is a source of cheap labour. In some cases, the immigrants in the country are skilled and looking for <b>specialized</b> <b>jobs.</b> The inflow of migrants could also bring about cultural diversity.|$|R

5000|$|Jack E. Boucher (September 4, 1931 - September 2, 2012) was an American {{photographer}} for the National Park Service {{for more than}} 40 years beginning in 1958.

In 1966 he left the Park Service for two years to supervise New Jersey's State Historic Preservation program, including the State's roadside marker program, 18 historic museum houses, several lighthouses, and two historic villages. Offered his old job back by the Park Service/HABS in 1970, he left New Jersey to return to NPS/HABS and the highly <b>specialized</b> <b>job</b> of large format photographic architectural documentation.

30|$|In {{terms of}} social {{clothing}} norms, immigrants tended to avoid potential conflicts by conforming to social rules and obeying it. This {{is not based on}} personal characteristic, but it is more helpful to survive in the new society’s politic and economic environment (Padilla and Perez 2003). Weinstock (1963) observed that Hungarian immigrants who have more <b>specialized</b> <b>jobs</b> receive higher pressure to wear clothes and to pronounce words in ‘American style.’ Inglessis (2008) found that Hispanic females in America stated that they learn American clothing norms in church, school, or in office and when they encounter a problem regarding clothing cultural difference, they follow how their mothers behave at the same point. Those cases show that immigrants experience inner or outer conflicts on constructing their appearance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{division}} of labor in lumber camps led to several specialized jobs on logging crews, such as whistle punk, chaser, and high climber. [...] The whistle punk's job was to sound a whistle (usually at the Steam donkey) as {{a signal to the}} yarder operator controlling the movement of logs. He also had to act as a safety lookout. A good whistle punk had to be alert and think fast as the safety of the others depended on him. The high climber (also known as a tree topper) used iron climbing hooks and rope to ascend a tall tree in the landing area of the logging site, where he would chop off limbs as he climbed, chop {{off the top of the}} tree, and finally attach pulleys and rigging to the tree so it could be used as a spar so logs could be skidded into the landing. High climbers and whistle punks were both phased out in the 1960s to early 1970's when portable steel towers replaced spar trees and radio equipment replaced steam whistles for communication. The choker setters attached steel cables (or chokers) to downed logs so they could be dragged into the landing by the yarder. The chasers removed the chokers once the logs were at the landing. Choker setters and chasers were often entry-level positions on logging crews, with more experienced loggers seeking to move up to more skill-intensive positions such as yarder operator and high climber, or supervisory positions such as hook tender. Despite the common perception that all loggers cut trees, the actual felling and bucking of trees were also <b>specialized</b> <b>job</b> positions done by fallers and buckers. Faller and bucker were once two separate job titles but are now combined.|$|E

50|$|Almost all {{high-performance}} {{cutting tools}} use indexable inserts. There {{are several reasons}} for this. First of all, at the very high cutting speeds and feeds supported by these materials, the cutting tip can reach temperatures high enough to melt the brazing material holding it to the shank. Economics are also important; inserts are made symmetrically {{so that when the}} first cutting edge is dull they can be rotated, presenting a fresh cutting edge. Some inserts are even made {{so that they can be}} flipped over, giving as many as 16 cutting edges per insert. There are many types of inserts: some for roughing, some for finishing. Others are made for <b>specialized</b> <b>jobs</b> like cutting threads or grooves. The industry employs standardized nomenclature to describe inserts by shape, material, coating material, and size.|$|R
40|$|Wage {{levels and}} {{turnover}} rates are negatively correlated across types of employment, and {{this fact is}} often interpreted as evidence that high-wage jobs are rationed. A simple training model illustrates, however, that this correlation may arise because able workers {{have an incentive to}} choose highly <b>specialized</b> <b>jobs.</b> In any job, the most able workers possess the most valuable stocks of specific skills and therefore face the highest mobility costs. Thus, able workers may have a comparative advantage in specialized employments. Data from the national Longitudinal Survey of Youth provide an opportunity to evaluate the merits of the training model developed here. Data on worker training and mobility provide support for several implications of the model. The model also provides new ways to interpret existing results in the literature on interindustry wage differentials. ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{much of it}} {{is based}} on the {{original}} Tropico, the gameplay is very different. The player runs a pirate island and, as the Pirate King, must keep the pirates happy while stealing as much booty as possible. Workers, called captives, are taken on raids, from shipwrecks off the player's island, or from nations with which an alliance has been established. The captives are responsible for production and construction on the island. They can take on most of the jobs available, including farmer, lumberjack, and blacksmith, and can even be promoted to a pirate. Skilled captives may perform more <b>specialized</b> <b>jobs</b> which unskilled captives cannot. Still, the main goal of the game, other than the objectives stated in a scenario, is to stay in power, much like the original Tropico.|$|R
