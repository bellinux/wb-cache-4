25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was {{a throwback to the}} late 1950s Ivy League style. This revival came to be definitively summarized in an enormously popular paperback released in 1980: The Official Preppy Handbook. Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, suspenders, <b>seersucker</b> or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|WR {{recruits}} {{were promised}} uniforms upon reaching boot camp, {{but that was}} not always the case. In fact, during the summer of 1943, some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until uniforms were available. When the new uniforms arrived, {{they turned out to be}} winter uniforms. The <b>seersucker</b> summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying affect upon delivery. In time, these issues were resolved, and most WR members felt their uniforms were much better looking than those of the other women's military organizations.|$|E
25|$|The summer service uniform was a two-piece {{green and}} white outfit made of {{washable}} <b>seersucker</b> material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeved jacket with a V-neck. The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons were green, and emblems were bronze. The shoes were brown, the gloves were white, and the handbags were light green. The summer dress uniform was made of white twill. It had short sleeves and a V-neck, worn with gilt buttons on the jacket and cap, with dress emblems and white pumps. The officers could choose between three summer dress uniforms. The first was the white one worn by enlisted women, but with added green shoulder straps. The other two were made of white twill or palm-beach material. One was a short-sleeved blouse, {{and the other was}} long sleeved and collarless.|$|E
500|$|The noted New York fashion {{house of}} Mainbocher {{designed}} the uniforms. Their design services were secured, without cost, {{through the efforts}} of Mrs. James V. Forrestal, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The winter uniform was made from navy blue wool, worn with a white shirt and dark blue tie. [...] The jacket was single breasted and unbelted, with a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. The summer uniform was much the same as the winter uniform, however, it was lighter in weight, made of white material and worn with white shoes. [...] Later, a gray and white striped, <b>seersucker</b> work uniform for summer was added, along with the wearing of slacks and dungarees when appropriate.|$|E
500|$|The uniforms {{worn by the}} SPARS {{were the}} same design and style as those worn by the WAVES, except for the service insignias; created for them by the New York fashion house of Mainbocher. The {{decision}} made regarding the type and style of the uniforms was largely that of the U.S. Navy Uniform Board. The standard uniform was a navy blue suit, consisting of a jacket and a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. [...] The summer uniform was of the same design as the standard uniform, worn in white Palm Beach cloth, tropical worsted, or other light fabrics. Shoes were oxfords or pumps of white leather. The summer work wear was a grey and white striped <b>seersucker</b> dress with jacket.|$|E
2500|$|The Elric {{character}} is parodied in the Cerebus the Aardvark graphic novels by Dave Sim, as Elrod of Melvinbone, the Albino, with his sword <b>Seersucker,</b> and the speech-patterns of Foghorn Leghorn. Sim's drawing of Elrod follows Smith's drawing of Elric in Conan the Barbarian, {{which in turn}} {{was based on the}} US Lancer paperback covers by Jack Gaughan, complete with [...] "tall pointy hat".|$|E
2500|$|Slacks of covert {{material}} {{were worn}} for certain duties, although {{the most common}} work uniform was the olive-drab, cotton utility outfit, worn with high topped shoes. The trousers had a bib-front and crossed straps, and were worn over a short sleeve, matching shirt, and topped by a long-sleeve jacket. For recreation, field nights, and physical conditioning, women Marines wore the peanut suit, so called because of its colored appearance. [...] It was a tan, <b>seersucker,</b> one-piece bloomer outfit, with ties {{at the bottom of}} the shorts. In keeping with the propriety of the times, the women covered their legs with a front-buttoned A-lined skirt when not actively engaged in sports, exercises, or work details.|$|E
2500|$|George Edmondson (a.k.a. [...] "Mr. Two Bits"), {{wearing his}} {{trademark}} yellow oxford shirt, blue <b>seersucker</b> trousers, orange-and-blue tie, and black-and-white saddle shoes, {{traveled around the}} stands for almost 60 years leading fans in the old [...] "Two Bits" [...] cheer ("Two bits! [...] Four bits! [...] Six bits! [...] A dollar! [...] All for the Gators, stand up and holler!"). Edmondson began the tradition in 1949 and [...] "retired" [...] to become a regular fan after his fiftieth season in 1998. [...] However, he couldn't stay {{in his seat and}} continued to lead the cheer during pre-game festivities and (occasionally) in the stands during games. On November 22, 2008, at the last home game of the season, Mr. Two Bits was again honored with a retirement ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, <b>seersucker,</b> and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, [...] breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.|$|E
2500|$|The Foxfield Races are {{a set of}} steeplechase races that {{originated}} in 1978 and are held twice annually in Albemarle County, Virginia, approximately eight miles northwest of downtown Charlottesville. [...] It is a popular tradition {{for much of the}} community as well as students of the University of Virginia and other universities on the East Coast. [...] Foxfield holds two races each year, one in the fall and another in the spring. The fall race has a more family-friendly atmosphere, while the spring race tends to attract a larger proportion of local college students. Each race generally benefits a local organization or charity; previous groups include Service Dogs of Virginia, the Ronald McDonald House, and Kids Pan Alley. There are many different color passes that can be purchased allowing access to certain areas in and around the track itself. Tickets can be purchased from the official website or from numerous outlets around the Charlottesville area, as well as surrounding areas. [...] Traditionally, students and other attendees dress in a Southern, aristocratic style often seen at other steeplechase and horse racing events across the South. [...] <b>Seersucker,</b> bowties, and pastel colors predominate the atmosphere, particularly at the spring race.|$|E
2500|$|Suits {{are made}} {{in a variety of}} fabrics, but most {{commonly}} from wool. The two main yarns produce worsteds (where the fibres are combed before spinning to produce a smooth, hard wearing cloth) and woollens (where they are not, thus remaining comparatively fluffy in texture). These can be woven {{in a number of ways}} producing flannel, tweed, gabardine, and fresco among others. These fabrics all have different weights and feel, and some fabrics have an S (or Super S) number describing the fineness of the fibres measured by average fibre diameter, e.g., Super 120; however, the finer the fabric, the more delicate and thus less likely to be long-wearing it will be. Although wool has traditionally been associated with warm, bulky clothing meant for warding off cold weather, advances in making finer and finer fibre have made wool suits acceptable for warmer weather, as fabrics have accordingly become lighter and more supple. Wool fabric is denominated by the weight of a one-square yard piece; thus, the heavier wools, suitable for winter only, are 12-14 oz.; the medium, [...] "three season" [...] (i.e., excluding summer) are 10-11 oz.; and summer wools are 7-8 oz. [...] (In the days before central heating, heavier wools such as 16 oz. were used in suits; now they are used mainly in overcoats and topcoats.) Other materials are used sometimes, either alone or blended with wool, such as cashmere. [...] Silk alone or blended with wool is sometimes used. Synthetic materials, while cheaper, e.g., polyester, are very rarely recommended by experts. At most, a blend of predominantly wool may be acceptable to obtain the main benefit of synthetics, namely resistance to wrinkling, particularly in garments used for travel; however, any synthetic, blended or otherwise, will always be warmer and clammier than wool alone. [...] For hot weather, linen is also used, and in (Southern) North America cotton <b>seersucker</b> is worn.|$|E
60|$|He woke deathly sick at first, {{and found}} himself lying in bed, {{one of the two}} rows in a long room, where there were some quiet women in neat caps and <b>seersucker</b> dresses going about, with bowls of food and bottles of medicine.|$|E
60|$|On the {{particular}} hot morning in question, {{as he stood}} in his <b>seersucker</b> coat reading the unquestionably pompous letter of Mr. Allison announcing that his niece was on the high seas, he returned the greetings of his friends with his usual kindness and cheer. In an adjoining compartment a long-legged boy of fourteen was busily stamping letters.|$|E
6000|$|He went on, {{and told}} the story in unsparing detail, while his chance for the boat passed unheeded, and the clerks in the outer office hung up their linen office coats and put on their <b>seersucker</b> or flannel street coats. The young lady went too, and nobody was left but the porter, who made {{from time to time}} a noisy {{demonstration}} of fastening a distant blind, or putting something in place. At last the Colonel roused himself from the autobiographical delight of the history of his paint. [...] "Well, sir, that's the story." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} nearly seven o'clock that the train arrived which brought home my Cousin Robert. He was a big man; his {{features}} and even his ample moustache gave a disconcerting impression of rugged integrity, and I remember him chiefly in an alpaca or <b>seersucker</b> coat. Though much less formal, more democratic--in a word--than my father, I stood in awe of him for a different reason, and this I know now was because he possessed the penetration to discern the flaws in my youthful character,--flaws that persisted in manhood. None so quick as Cousin Robert to detect deceptions which were hidden from my mother.|$|E
60|$|On the portico of {{the hotel}} they found half a score of gentlemen smoking, and {{creating}} together that collective silence which passes for sociality on our continent. Some carriages stood before the door, and within, {{around the base of}} a pillar, sat a circle of idle call-boys. There were a few trunks heaped together in one place, with a porter standing guard over them; a solitary guest was buying a cigar at the newspaper stand in one corner; another friendless creature was writing a letter in the reading-room; the clerk, in a <b>seersucker</b> coat and a lavish shirt-bosom, tried to give the whole an effect of watering-place gayety and bustle, as he provided a newly arrived guest with a room.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Tom {{was indeed}} an early riser. As Honora dressed (Catherine {{assisting}} as at a ceremony), {{she could see}} him, in his <b>seersucker</b> coat, bending tenderly over his beds; he lived enveloped in a peace which has since struck wonder to Honora's soul. She lingered in her dressing, even in those days, falling into reveries from which Catherine gently and deferentially aroused her; and Uncle Tom would be carving the beefsteak and Aunt Mary pouring the coffee when she finally arrived {{in the dining room}} to nibble at one of Bridget's unforgettable rolls or hot biscuits. Uncle Tom had his joke, and at quarter-past eight precisely he would kiss Aunt Mary and walk to the corner to wait for the ambling horse-car that was {{to take him to the}} bank. Sometimes Honora went to the corner with him, and he waved her good-by from the platform as he felt in his pocket for the nickel that was to pay his fare.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of such {{imposing}} company the little dwelling which became the home of our heroine sat well back in a plot that might almost be called a garden. In summer its white wooden front was nearly hidden by the quivering leaves of two tall pear trees. On {{the other side of}} the brick walk, and near the iron fence, was an elm and a flower bed that was Uncle Tom's pride and the admiration of the neighbourhood. Honora has but to shut her eyes to see it aflame with tulips at Eastertide. The eastern wall of the house was a mass of Virginia creeper, and beneath that another flower bed, and still another in the back-yard behind the lattice fence covered with cucumber vine. There were, besides, two maples and two apricot trees, relics of the farm, and of blessed memory. Such apricots! Visions of hot summer evenings come back, with Uncle Tom, in his <b>seersucker</b> coat, with his green watering-pot, bending over the beds, and Aunt Mary seated upright in her chair, looking up from her knitting with a loving eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{see exactly}} what you are driving at," [...] said William. [...] "I don't wear an alpaca coat with blue {{trousers}} and a <b>seersucker</b> vest on dress occasions, like I used to do at home. You talk about being cut to a pattern--well, ain't the pattern all right? When you're in Rome you've got to do as the Dagoes do. This town {{seems to me to}} have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations. According to the railroad schedule I've got in mind, Chicago and Saint Jo and Paris, France, are asterisk stops--which means you wave a red flag and get on every other Tuesday. I like this little suburb of Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. There's something or somebody doing all the time. I'm clearing $8,000 a year selling automatic pumps, and I'm living like kings-up. Why, yesterday, I was introduced to John W. Gates. I took an auto ride with a wine agent's sister. I saw two men run over by a street car, and I seen Edna May play in the evening. Talk about the West, why, the other night I woke everybody up in the hotel hollering. I dreamed I was walking on a board sidewalk in Oshkosh. What have you got against this town, Jack? There's only one thing in it that I don't care for, and that's a ferryboat." ...|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1996, the US Senate held a <b>Seersucker</b> Thursday in June, {{where the}} {{participants}} dress in traditionally Southern clothing, but the tradition was discontinued in June 2012. As of June 2014, {{it has been}} revived {{by members of the}} US Senate. At the same time, however, some senators such as Ryan McKenna of Missouri have spoken against the wearing of <b>seersucker</b> due to its traditional use by small children. The Republican Party has advised students at its Comms college not to wear <b>seersucker</b> when appearing before the cameras because of its old fashioned connotations, plus the disruptive effect of the stripes.|$|E

At the same time, <b>seersucker</b> formal wear continued to be worn by many professional adults in the Southern and Southwestern US. College professors were known to favor full suits with red bowties, although 1950s Ivy League and 21st century preppy students usually restricted themselves to a single <b>seersucker</b> garment, such as a blazer paired with khaki chino trousers.
