5000|$|Railfreight grey {{with yellow}} cabs, black cab window {{surrounds}} and red <b>solebars.</b> Nineteen locomotives repainted in 1985-87 received this livery (26001-8/10/25/6/31/2/4/5/7/8/40/1); ...|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} the CBH class are liveried in a CBH Group {{two-tone}} mid blue / light blue design. Numbering is in mid blue, striping and lettering is in white, and the <b>solebars</b> and handrails are picked out in white. Underframes are painted black, with black and white safety stripes on the headstocks and access steps picked out in yellow.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{production}} of hauled Mark 1 stock came a series of eight experimental carriages known as the XP64 set. Three Corridor Firsts, two Corridor Seconds, and three Tourist Second Opens were built by Derby Carriage Works in 1964. Externally they resembled Mark 1 stock {{with the addition of a}} cosmetic cover over the <b>solebars</b> of the standard Mark 1 underframes, but inside they included many new features, including pressure ventilation, new seating designs and wider bi-fold doors. Many of these features were later incorporated in the Mark 2 stock produced from 1964.|$|E
50|$|The new livery {{was further}} distinguished, in {{locomotive}} classes {{such as the}} Class 58 and Class 20 where the bodywork was mounted on a <b>solebar,</b> by painting the <b>solebar</b> red to give a distinctive red stripe running {{the length of the}} lower bodyside, a livery known as 'Railfreight Red Stripe'. Other classes of locomotives with an integrated monocoque construction and so no <b>solebar,</b> such as the Class 26, Class 37, Class 47 and Class 56, also had red stripes applied to the lower body side.|$|R
5000|$|BR Class 20 No. 20087 (D8087), BR Blue/Red <b>Solebar,</b> Saltley L.I.P/'Hercules'. Built in 1961. (Stopped due to {{electrical}} fault, {{owned by}} the Harry Needle Railroad Company, currently for sale) ...|$|R
50|$|Class 20 {{locomotives}} {{operated by}} the Harry Needle Railroad Company (HNRC) are painted into house colours of orange and black, with yellow nose ends (20121, 20166, 20311 and 20314). Some other locomotives owned by HNRC, of subclasses 20/0 and 20/9, have been painted in a variation of two-tone Railfreight grey livery. These have dark grey roof, mid-grey upper body and light grey lower body, black underframe and buffer beam. The nose ends are painted yellow, with {{the lower part of}} the cab end in yellow and the upper part black, this continuing around the cab sides but with the light grey instead of yellow. Others are in BR Blue or Railfreight Red-stripe livery. HNRC Class 20s on long-term hire to Corus were painted in Corus livery; previously silver but currently a bright yellow with red <b>solebar</b> (No.81 - 20056). Since the Corus business was bought by the Indian Tata Steel group, some of these locomotives have been repainted into Tata Blue livery (No.82 - 20066). Two HNRC Class 20s have been painted into GBRf Europortes blue and gold livery (20901 and 20905), while two other HNRC Class 20s have been painted in the White livery of Hope Construction Materials, with a purple <b>solebar</b> (No.2 - 20168) and a black <b>solebar</b> (No.3 - 20906).|$|R
50|$|From new, all locos were outshopped in Railfreight grey, {{with yellow}} ends and red <b>solebars.</b> The {{introduction}} of Railfreight sector liveries from October 1987 saw 58050 outshopped by Stratford {{in the new}} triple grey scheme, complete with the Railfreight coal sub-sector logo. Eventually {{the majority of the}} fleet were repainted in triple grey livery. Upon shadow privatisation of the UK freight business, Mainline Freight became the owners of the 50 strong fleet, which saw a small number re-painted into the operator's aircraft blue and silver livery, while others had Mainline Freight branding applied to the triple grey bodywork. With full privatisation and the takeover of the freight operations by EWS, maroon and gold became the standard livery for repainted examples from mid-1997 and beyond.|$|E
5000|$|The underframes {{consisted}} of a heavy assembly of steel sections, with angle used to form bracing trusses. These were placed close to the centre line of the vehicle rather than beneath the <b>solebars,</b> as was characteristic of previous vehicles. The original bogies were a double bolster type, which like the carriages mounted upon them, were designated [...] "BR Mark 1" [...] (BR1 for short). These proved unsatisfactory and a new cast-steel design was introduced from 1958 (often {{referred to as the}} Commonwealth type). This gave a superb ride with minimal tyre wear, but was heavy. The final batches of locomotive hauled Mk1s, and many Mk1 EMU vehicles, were built with the Swindon-designed B4 bogie. Later on, many BR1 bogied vehicles were retrofitted with the B4 bogie, and a comfortable ride could then be relied on, as was evident in the later EMU vehicles.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new eddy-current flaw detector that operates with a pocket PC (PPC), the flaw detector meeting all present-day requirements set for means of NDT, particularly documentation of inspection results. The VD- 12 NFP eddy-current flaw detector {{is intended to}} reveal defects with the depth from 0. 5 mm on complex geometry surfaces and high roughness surfaces, up to Rz 320. Such surfaces are met with disks of railway wheels, coupler carriers, <b>solebars,</b> bolsters, labyrinth rings, sheaves, etc. The distinguishing feature of the device is the elimination of lift-off interference, up to 3 mm. The device is certified and widely used at locomotive facilities and carriage repair workshops of Ministry of Railways and other industries as well. Small dimensions, low weight and battery power supply allow the use of it in field conditions. The employment of a PPC broadens {{the application of the}} device, viz an operator gets the widest possibilities to store the results, their processing and information representation, including setting of the inspection parameters on the PPC display, marks on the signal graph and direct printing of reports from PPC. The use of a radio channel to transfer data lets us get rid of cables, provide high mobility of the complex and easily integrate the device into an automated inspection workbench. We have managed to substitutes the PPC display for the device display that also extends the possibilities of inspection and makes it easier for operators. When fastened to a wrist, the PPC does not restrict movements and allows inspection in hard-to-reach places due to its low weight and ergonomic casing...|$|E
25|$|The refresh {{took place}} at Railcare Wolverton works and also {{featured}} both a mechanical overhaul (under the <b>solebar)</b> and a full exterior relivery, again in vinyl. Some Class 319/4 units have had their Stone Faiveley AMBR air and spring pantograph replaced by the more modern Brecknell Willis High Speed air-only pantograph design.|$|R
2500|$|From new the D600s wore {{standard}} BR {{green with}} a [...] light grey horizontal band between the cabs {{a few inches}} above the <b>solebar.</b> By the time of withdrawal D600 was in all-over rail blue with full yellow ends, D602 was blue with small yellow warning panels on each nose and D601/3/4 were still green, albeit with yellow warning panels.|$|R
50|$|Unit 5606-6606, {{which had}} been used for various {{equipment}} trials, was scrapped in December 1994. Cars 6505 and 6713 were damaged in the 7 July 2005 London bombings and were scrapped above the <b>solebar.</b> The remains {{were used in the}} building of new cars 6606 (the second car with this number) and 6734 as C08 stock. They were paired with 5505 and 5713, renumbered 5606 and 5734 to match their partners. 5548+6548 were rebuilt in part following the bombings.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{acoustic}} emission sensor modeling by means of FEM system COSMOS/M. The following types of acoustic waves in the acoustic emission sensors are investigated: the longitudinal wave and transversal wave. As a material is used piezoelectric ceramics. The computed displacements are compared with physical model under consideration. The results of numerical and physical simulations of the processes of acoustic wave propagation in <b>solebar</b> of the freight-car truck are presented. The fields of dynamic displacements and stresses were calculated for improvement of acoustic emission testing method...|$|R
5000|$|Rolling {{stock of}} all ages and types was painted in Network SouthEast's livery, made up of {{horizontal}} stripes of its house colours of red, white, blue and grey. From the <b>solebar</b> upwards, the stripes were grey, white, red, white, blue (the thickest stripe, around the windows and doors), white and red. Much brighter shades of red and blue, and paler grey paint, were used from late 1987. [...] "Bright", [...] "brash" [...] and [...] "garish" [...] in contrast to British Rail's sober dark blues and greys, it was nicknamed the [...] "toothpaste" [...] livery.|$|R
25|$|The {{pilot scheme}} {{locomotives}} were delivered in overall green livery with a grey roof and black below the body. D5000 was delivered {{with a narrow}} light grey stripe at waist level while the remainder had a broad light grey stripe at <b>solebar</b> level. This light grey stripe may have appeared bluish and {{has been described as}} pale blue or eggshell, but in most illustrations it appears to be off-white. At first green liveried locos had plain green ends, but this was changed from 1962 to small yellow warning panels, and then from 1967 to full yellow ends, some locos receiving these while still in green livery. At least five locos were repainted in two-tone green livery (applied along with the small yellow warning panel) in a similar manner to Class 47s and some Class 25s.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} paper, the authors present an {{analysis}} of the structural characteristics of an intermediate rail vehicle and their effects on crash performance of the vehicle. Theirs is a simulation based analysis involving four stages. First, the crashworthiness of the vehicle is assessed by simulating an impact of the vehicle with a rigid wall. Second, the structural characteristics of the vehicle are analysed based on the structural behaviour during this impact and then the structure is modified. Third, the modified vehicle is tested again in the same impact scenario with a rigid wall. Finally, the modified vehicle is subjected to a modelled head-on impact which mirrors the real-life impact interface between two intermediate vehicles in a train impact. The emphasis of the current study is on the structural characteristics of the intermediate vehicle and the differences compared to an impact of a leading vehicle. The study shows that, similar to a leading vehicle, bending, or jackknifing is a main form of failure in this conventionally designed intermediate vehicle. It has also been found that the location of the door openings creates a major difference in the behaviour of an intermediate vehicle. It causes instability of the vehicle in the door area and leads to high stresses at the joint of the end beam with the <b>solebar</b> and shear stresses at the joint of the inner pillar with the cantrail. Apart from this, the shapes of the vehicle ends and impact interfaces are also different and {{have an effect on the}} crash performance of the vehicles. The simulation results allow the identification of the structural characteristics and show the effectiveness of relevant modifications. The conclusions have general relevance for the crashworthiness of rail vehicle desig...|$|R
50|$|Equipment carried {{aboard the}} brake van, {{which had to}} be checked by the guard before the train's departure, {{consisted}} of a shunting pole (a wooden pole about 6 feet long with a twisted hook on the end which was used to couple and uncouple 3-link and instanter couplings without the guard having to position himself dangerously in between the vehicles), a brake stick (imagine a square ended baseball bat; it was used to lever down the handbrakes of wagons by placing it under the <b>solebar</b> and applying downward pressure), paraffin for the lamps, usually in an old milk bottle, and two pairs of track circuit clips (these are clips that fit over the rail and are connected by a length of wire more than 4 feet 8 and a half inches long; they are clipped over both rails of a track-circuited line so as to short circuit the track and indicate to the signalman that a train is occupying that section; they would be used {{in the event of an}} accident in which other running lines were fouled and trains on them had to be stopped as a matter of great urgency). He would also check that the tail and side lamps were carried, filled, trimmed, and lit at night, during fog or falling snow, or if the train is to run through any tunnel in which lamps are required. These checks were part of the guard's train preparation duties, and his responsibility. The guard would, also at this time, ensure that the van carried coal and kindling to light the stove fire, even in summer if the train was to be relieved by another crew who might have to work into the cool of evening or night. It was common for guards to carry old newspapers with which to stop up any draughts that made their presence felt at speed; partly fitted freight trains might run up to 60 mph.|$|R
