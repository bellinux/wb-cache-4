40|$|Abstract—Simple point {{detection}} is {{an important}} task for several problems in discrete geometry, such as topology preserving thinning in image processing to compute discrete skeletons. In this paper, the approach to <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> detection is based on techniques from cubical homology, a framework ideally suited for problems in image processing. A (-dimensional) unitary cube (for a-dimensional digital image) is associated with every discrete picture element, instead of a point in (the-dimensional Euclidean space) as has been done previously. A <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> in this setting then refers to the removal of a unitary cube without changing the topology of the cubical complex induced by the digital image. The main result is a characterization of a <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> (i. e., <b>simple</b> unitary cube) {{in terms of the}} homology groups of the @Q IA neighborhood of for arbitrary, finite dimensions Index Terms—Cubical homology, digital geometry, <b>simple</b> <b>point,</b> skeleton...|$|R

40|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> of {{an object}} is a point whose removal {{does not change the}} topology. However, the {{simultaneous}} deletion of <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> may change the topology. Through the notion of P-simple point, we give examples of algorithms, described by a two-steps procedure, which removes <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> in parallel and which are automatically ensured to preserve the topology. More particularly, a new symmetrical thinning algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, through the notion of P^x-simple point, we give a methodology which permits to produce an algorithm A' (described by a one-step procedure) from an existent one A, which is "faster" than A, {{in the sense that it}} usually 'deletes more points than A''...|$|R
5000|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, a geometrically regular ring is a Noetherian ring over a {{field that}} remains a regular ring after any finite extension of the base field. Geometrically regular schemes are defined in a similar way. In older terminology, points with regular local rings were called <b>simple</b> <b>points,</b> and points with geometrically regular local rings were called absolutely <b>simple</b> <b>points.</b> Over fields that are of characteristic 0, or algebraically closed, or more generally perfect, geometrically regular rings {{are the same as}} regular rings. Geometric regularity originated when Chevalley and Weil pointed out to [...] that, over non-perfect fields, the Jacobian criterion for a <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> of an algebraic variety is not equivalent to the condition that the local ring is regular.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePreserving topological {{properties}} of objects during thinning procedures {{is an important}} issue in the field of image analysis. In the case of 2 -D digital images (i. e. images defined on Z 2) such procedures are usually based on the notion of <b>simple</b> <b>point.</b> In contrast to the situation in Zn, n>= 3, it was proved in the 80 s that the exclusive use of <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> in Z 2 was indeed sufficient to develop thinning procedures providing an output that is minimal with respect to the topological characteristics of the object.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} purely {{discrete}} deformable partition model for segmenting 3 D images. Its main ability {{is to maintain}} the topology of the partition during the minimization process. To do so, our main contribution is a new definition of multi-label <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> (ML <b>simple</b> <b>point)</b> that is easily computable. An ML <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> can be relabeled without modifying the overall topology of the partition. The definition is based on intervoxel properties, and uses the notion of collapse on cubical complexes. This work {{is an extension of}} a former restricted definition [DupasAl 09] that prohibits the move of intersections of boundary surfaces. A deformation process is carried out with a greedy energy minimization algorithm. A discrete area estimator is used to approach at best standard regularizers classically used in continuous energy minimizing methods.

40|$|<b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> were {{proposed}} as a lightweight alternative to standard Function Points. The {{idea at the}} base of the definition of <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> is that it is possible to get equally effective size measures even without considering fine-grained details of functional specifications. Skipping the analysis and measurement of such details should allow for saving time and effort when measuring the functional size of software. In a previous study, the <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Point</b> method was employed to size software applications included in the ISBSG repository, thus employing data from different companies. In this paper, we aim at getting further evidence of the qualities of <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> via the empirical study of 25 Web applications developed by a single software company. The study highlights the correlation between <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> and standard Function Points measures and the existence of a significant model that guarantees the convertibility between <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> and standard Function Points. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the two measures provide predictions of the effort to develop Web applications that are equally accurate. Thus, our results confirm the empirical evidence provided by the original investigation, highlighting that <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> appear essentially equivalent to Function Points, except that they require a much simpler measurement process...|$|R
