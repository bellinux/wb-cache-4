5|$|The {{walls were}} largely {{maintained}} intact {{during most of}} the Ottoman period, until sections began to be dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries. Despite the subsequent lack of maintenance, many parts of the walls survived and are <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> today. A large-scale restoration program has been under way since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{fewer than}} a dozen mills are <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> the {{majority}} of which are used for light engineering or as distribution centres. Despite an economic depression brought about by the demise of cotton spinning, Royton's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts.|$|E

5|$|Two {{pre-existing}} settlements {{were included}} in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new Methodist {{church was}} built in the {{community}} in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden trestle part of the railroad bridge across the Willamette caught fire and burned. Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what was then the Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historical}} sources, Augvald and his cow {{were taken from}} the battlefield and buried at Avaldsnes. In his Saga of Olav Tryggvason, Oddr Snorrason writes that Tryggvason excavated two mounds on Karmøy, revealing the bones of a man in one and those of a cow in the other. Local legends contradict Augvald's burial at Avaldsnes, stating instead that he was buried in Ferkingstad, {{on the south side of}} the 12th-century churchyard. A large memorial stone, <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald.|$|E
50|$|This {{historic}} building was consumed by a fire on July 3, 2003, although the walls <b>still</b> remain <b>standing.</b>|$|R

5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|Bridges over {{waterways}} {{had been}} known in China since the ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large trestle bridges were constructed, such as that built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158. There were also large bridges made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> today. Bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of Xia Gui (1195–1224). Long, covered corridor bridges, like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s {{and again}} after his {{participation}} in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. He oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds surveyed and mapped the islands and shorelines on the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the {{airfield}} was designated as Stützpunkt 134 Paderborn, housing defence units {{as part of}} the Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications. The units were equipped with 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzers. During the winter of 1943–44, 10.5 cm leFH 324(f) howitzers replaced the leFH 18s. A number of concrete bunkers were constructed to house the guns, which were <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> around {{the airfield}} in October 2007. Following Operation Overlord {{at the start of the}} Allied invasion of western Europe, the Germans committed various acts of sabotage on departure from Saint-Inglevert.|$|E
5|$|Some closed station {{buildings}} are <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> converted {{for other uses}} or abandoned, while others have been demolished and their sites redeveloped. A number of stations, while still open, have closed platforms or sections, such as the Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross. The interiors and platforms of a few closed stations are among parts of the London Underground available for filming purposes, such as those at Aldwych.|$|E

5|$|Syrian {{government}} forces supported by Russian airstrikes recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters. According to initial reports, {{the damage to}} the archaeological site was less extensive than anticipated, with numerous structures <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> Following the recapture of the city, Russian de-mining teams began clearing mines planted by ISIL prior to their retreat. Following heavy fighting, ISIL reportedly reoccupied the city on 11 December 2016, prompting an offensive by the Syrian Army which retook the city on 2 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers won 60 {{games in}} the 1972–73 NBA season, and took another Pacific Division title. Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again {{led the league in}} {{rebounding}} and set the <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7%. The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven {{games in the}} conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis is {{the largest}} {{architectural}} complex at Quiriguá, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned. The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes. The acropolis complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of corbel arches, but none are <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas, enormous stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the {{architecture of}} the period.|$|E
5|$|The first statehouse, {{located in}} Corydon, Indiana, is <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> and is {{maintained}} {{as a state}} historic site. The second building was the old Marion County courthouse which was demolished and replaced in the early 20th century. The third building was a structure modeled on the Parthenon, but was condemned in 1877 because of structural defects and razed so the current statehouse could be built on its location.|$|E
5|$|The main turbine and boiler {{building}} {{is now a}} locally listed building, standing today as {{a monument to the}} important role that Tyne and Wear played in the development of electrical supply. The building had been considered for the more protected Listed Building status, but the decision was taken in May 2004 not to promote it. Other early power stations in the area (such as those at Dunston and Wallsend) have all been entirely demolished. The Lemington station is partly <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> due to riverside sites becoming less important to industrial development, leading to the site never being redeveloped.|$|E
