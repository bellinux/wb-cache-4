5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> remaining unchanged.|$|E

5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|The metric system, {{that is the}} <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> {{based on}} the metre, was officially adopted in France on 10December 1799 (19frimaire AnVIII) and became the sole legal system of weights and {{measures}} there from 1801.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational metric systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} the International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (SI).|$|E
5|$|In 1861 a {{committee}} of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and James Prescott Joule introduced {{the concept of a}} coherent <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> based on the metre, gram and second, which, in 1873, was extended to include electrical units.|$|E

5|$|The English-speaking {{countries}} {{also used}} a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of fluid measure, or in modern terminology volume units, {{based on the}} apothecaries' system. A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an apothecaries' ounce of water was called a fluid ounce, and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples. The analogue of the grain was called a minim.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (Système {{international}} d'unités or SI) is {{the current}} international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world. It {{is an extension of}} Giorgi's MKSA system—its base units are the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela and mole.|$|E
5|$|The metre-tonne-second <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (MTS) {{was based}} on the metre, tonne and second – the unit of force was the sthène and the unit of {{pressure}} was the pièze. It was invented in France for industrial use and from 1933 to 1955 was used both in France and in the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Historical {{metrology}} is {{the science}} that {{is dealing with}} the fundamental <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measurement, <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> formerly in use in various countries, and the development <b>of</b> monetary <b>units</b> throughout their history.|$|R
500|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century three {{different}} <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure existed for electrical measurements: a CGS-based system for electrostatic units, also known as the Gaussian or ESU system, a CGS-based system for electromechanical units (EMU) and an MKS-based system ("international system") for electrical distribution systems.|$|R
5000|$|... the <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> {{weights and}} {{measures}} used in the Kingdom of Wessex during the Anglo-Saxon period, later adopted as the national standards of England, {{as well as the}} physical standards (prototypes) associated with these <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units.</b> However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} use of metric units was legalised for trade in the UK in 1864, the UK had signed the Metre Convention in 1884 and the UK Parliament had defined the yard and the pound {{in terms of the}} metre and the {{kilogram}} in 1897, the UK continued to use the imperial system of measure and to export the imperial <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> to the Empire. In 1932, the system of Imperial Preference was set up at the Ottawa Conference. Although Ireland left the Commonwealth in 1948 and South Africa in 1961, both continued their close economic ties with the Commonwealth.|$|E
50|$|The SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> {{luminous}} {{energy is}} the lumen second, which is unofficially {{known as the}} talbot in honor of William Henry Fox Talbot. In other <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> luminous energy may be expressed in basic <b>units</b> <b>of</b> energy.|$|R

40|$|For a {{harmonic}} oscillator with time-dependent (positive) {{mass and}} frequency, an unitary operator {{is shown to}} transform the quantum states <b>of</b> the <b>system</b> to those <b>of</b> a harmonic oscillator <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> mass and time-dependent frequency, as well as operators. For a driven harmonic oscillator, an unitary transformation which relates the driven system and the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> same mass and frequency without driving force is given, as a generalization of previous results, {{in terms of the}} solution of classical equation of motion <b>of</b> the driven <b>system.</b> These transformations, thus, give a simple way of finding exact wave functions of a driven harmonic oscillator system, provided the quantum states <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> mass are given...|$|R
5|$|The uncoordinated use of {{the metric}} system by {{different}} scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in different choices of base units even though all {{were based on the}} same definitions of the units of the metre and the kilogram. During the 20th century, efforts were made to rationalise these units, and in 1960, the CGPM published the International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units,</b> which has since then been the internationally recognised standard metric system.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with other}} <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> the base <b>units</b> <b>of</b> a set <b>of</b> natural <b>units</b> will include {{definitions}} and values for length, mass, time, temperature, and electric charge (in lieu of electric current). It {{is possible to}} disregard temperature as a fundamental physical quantity, since it states the energy per degree of freedom of a particle, which can be {{expressed in terms of}} energy (or mass, length, and time). Virtually every <b>system</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>units</b> normalizes Boltzmann's constant [...] to 1, which {{can be thought of as}} simply a way <b>of</b> defining the <b>unit</b> temperature.|$|R
