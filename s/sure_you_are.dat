500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. About.com writer Bill Lamb rated [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] {{three and a}} half stars out of five; he praised its pop sound and Hudgens' [...] "engaging personality", but criticized it for having a manufactured sound from the [...] "Disney pop factory". Moreover, Lamb wrote: [...] "'Come Back to Me' is unlikely to linger too long in your memory, but it also fails to generate any annoying after taste. Program it into your listening when you need a contemporary, breezy, light pop confection... <b>Sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> being manipulated by the corporate music establishment, but the song is fun." [...] He also noted that the [...] "Baby Come Back" [...] sample was possibly added to [...] "trigger pleasant deja vu in parents listening along with their kids". In an editorial review for Rhapsody, Nick Cavalieri named the song one of the best tracks on V.|$|E
500|$|Rangel rose {{rapidly in}} the House, due to his {{political}} skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. [...] In 1974, {{he became the first}} black ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means, a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee), and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health. [...] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. [...] By 1979, Rangel {{was a member of the}} influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. [...] Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. [...] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. [...] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. [...] Rangel said of himself, [...] "I guess I'm practical, but you have to live with yourself and make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself." ...|$|E

[...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned".
