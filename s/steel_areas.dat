40|$|Chloride-induced {{reinforcement}} corrosion {{in concrete}} is characterised by {{the action of}} so-called macrocells. The associated localised form of corrosion results from the strong electrochemical interaction between the relatively small pitting sites acting as anodes and the large passive <b>steel</b> <b>areas</b> acting as cathodes. The existence of macrocell corrosion poses severe problems in the interpretation of results obtained from corrosion experiments, especially regarding corrosion potential and galvanic current. To elucidate the mechanism of macroceU corrosion experimental investigations were conducted on reinforcement steel embedded in chloride-contaminated concrete. The macrocells were provoked by shortcircuiting actively corroding mild steel bars to passivated stainless steel, thereby intensifying the corrosion process. The experiments included measurement of corrosion potential, ionic concrete resistance, potential difference, corrosion rate and galvanic current. The magnitude of the galvanic current is significantly influenced by the resistance of passive steel to polarisation, and to a much lesser degree by the ionic concrete resistance. Results from potential mapping demonstrated that due to macrocell action the rest potential of the passive steel was shifted towards very negative values that, according to many codes of practice, would suggest active corrosion to take place.

The first is the growth of traffic live load over time. The second is the resistance deterioration of steel reinforcing bars due to corrosion. The third is the deterioration due to aging of CFRP. The reliability analysis is performed implementing five flexural failure modes. A Monte-Carlo simulation is used to develop time-dependent statistical models for <b>steel</b> <b>areas</b> and daily live load extreme effects. The reliability of a RC bridge CFRP-strengthened interior beam, designed in accordance to AASHTO-LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design) specifications, is evaluated under various traffic volumes, different corrosion environments and strengthening configurations.

Visible and near‐infrared (NIR) spectra and {{samples for}} {{laboratory}} microbial analysis were acquired of fecal contaminants, ingesta contaminants, and bare processing equipment surfaces (rubber and stainless steel) {{in a commercial}} poultry processing plant. Spectra were analyzed in the visible region of 450 to 748 nm and the NIR region of 920 to 1680 nm and microbial sampling for Enterobacteriaceae counts (EBC) was conducted for 82 fecal contaminant samples, 59 ingesta contaminant samples, 40 bare rubber belt areas, and 40 bare stainless <b>steel</b> <b>areas.</b> Two‐wavelength band ratios in the visible and NIR regions were selected for separating contaminants from equipment areas. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to analyze the spectral data set and 2 ‐class soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models were developed for comparison with band ratio classification. Fecal and ingesta contaminants were difficult to separate from each other but both were easily differentiated from the equipment areas. The visible ratio using 518 and 576 nm correctly classified 100 % of contaminant samples and 92. 5 % of equipment area samples. The NIR ratio using 1565 and 1645 nm correctly classified 100 % of the contaminant samples and 95 % of the equipment area samples. Microbiological analysis found the highest EBC levels for fecal contaminants; mean EBC for ingesta contaminants was significantly lower than that for fecal contaminants. The high EBC levels for fecal contaminants indicate that these contaminants should be targeted for spectral‐based detection methods for sanitation monitoring and verification purposes; although their EBC levels are significantly lower, ingesta contaminants should also be included due to difficulty of separation from fecal contaminants...|$|E
40|$|Behaviour {{under fire}} {{circumstances}} {{is becoming more}} and more crucial for designing a concrete structureand authorities require more often a fire-resistance time. In fact, engineers need a powerful, user-friendly,accurate and non time-consuming method that can be used to design reinforced concrete structures. Inthis study, the author has developed a method to design any fire-exposed reinforced concrete crosssections under flexure that takes into account second order effect. The first part focuses on the thermal analysis of the reinforced concrete cross section. Fourier'sequation is solved using finite differences method and the development tool of Excel: Virtual BasicAdvanced macro. Thus, it could easily be used on every personal computer (reasonably powerful) andneeds no extra investment. The accuracy of this thermal analysis is checked by comparison with resultsfrom commercial softwares (FAGUS edited by Cubus and SAFIR developed by the university of Liege). The second part deals with the mechanical analysis. Indeed, the concrete compressive strengthtogether with the yield strength of the steel reinforcement bars will decrease when the temperature willraise inside the concrete cross section. This loss of characteristic will be regarded as a loss of area andnew dimensions are set up. Finally a classic analysis (as it can be done at ambient temperature) isperformed. The mechanical analysis which takes into account second order effect is based on the Eulerbuckling load.

40|$|Since FRP {{bars are}} not {{susceptible}} to corrosion, they {{have emerged as}} a replacement to steel reinforcement in concrete, with the potential of reducing lifetime costs in applications where corrosion of steel bars causes costly maintenance. However, there may be differences {{in the behavior of}} reinforced concrete members reinforced with these materials as compared to steel. The shear design of reinforced concrete members has been based on empirical methods developed from experiments. Considering experimental evidence from steel reinforced concrete shear tests, the use of low longitudinal reinforcement ratios can cause a reduction in shear strength. The use of FRP bars as flexural reinforcement, which produces unusually low longitudinal reinforcement ratios when converted to equivalent <b>steel</b> <b>areas,</b> may yield a similar effect. The investigations conducted here consisted of two phases: an experimental and an analytical. The experimental phase investigated the effect of using FRP bars as longitudinal reinforcement on the shear strength and behavior of rectangular concrete beams without transverse reinforcement. It was determined that when equal areas of tensile reinforcement are provided, FRP bar reinforced concrete beams fail at a lower shear strength than steel reinforced ones. However, when the bending stiffness after flexural cracking was kept constant (concrete strength and ρeff constant), the shear strength was approximately the same regardless of the reinforcement type used. The analytical phase concentrated on the relationship between the neutral axis depth at cracking and the shear strength of the member. Considering this relationship, a simple analysis method based on mechanics to calculate the concrete contribution to shear strength of rectangular reinforced concrete beams regardless of the longitudinal reinforcement type was developed. The proposed design method was shown to be valid by testing it on a 339 -specimen database of rectangular reinforced concrete specimens regardless of the type of flexural reinforcement. Finally, the applicability of the proposed design method in calculating the concrete contribution to the shear strength of members with other cross sectional shapes such as flanged and circular sections was discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of {{reinforcement}} detailing on the behaviour of a reinforced concrete structure. Using a retaining wall as a case-study, the performance of two commonly used alternative reinforcement layouts (of which one is wrong) are studied and compared. Reinforcement Layout 1 had the main reinforcement (from the wall) bent towards the heel in the base slab. For Reinforcement Layout 2, the reinforcement was bent towards the toe. This study focused on the reinforcement details used in the D-region, and on how it impacts the capacity, joint efficiency and failure mode of the structure. First, a literature review is carried out which focused on the behaviour of corner joints from experimental works available in literature. Next, a strut and tie model of the D-region is made. From the strut and tie model, the opening moments acting on the structure subjects the re-entrant corner region to a concentration of tensile stresses, while a compressive stress field acts concurrently with transverse tension within {{the core of the}} joint. The internal forces within the D-region are evaluated, and the required <b>steel</b> <b>areas</b> computed. Afterwards, ATENA FEM software is used to model the structure, and to study {{the impact of}} the alternative reinforcement layouts on the capacity and behavior of the structure. Some aspects of the structural behavior studied include the stress and strain distribution in the concrete, crack width, crack pattern, steel stress and strain distribution etc. The results obtained from the FEM analysis was sensitive to bond model defined in the material model. When perfect-bond was assumed in the FEM analysis, Reinforcement Layout 1 attained a joint efficiency of 72. 4 %, while Reinforcement Layout 2 achieved 88 % joint efficiency. In his experimental works on similar details, Nilsson (1973) had obtained a joint efficiency of 60 % for Reinforcement Layout 1, a range between 82 % to 102 % for Reinforcement Layout 2. The disparity between FEM result and experimental result for Reinforcement Layout 1 occurred because perfect-bond was assumed in the FEM model. With cracking playing prominent role in this structure, perfect bond assumption is not valid, and some slip is inevitable. To verify, a bond-slip relation is used to model the structure, resulting in 62 % joint efficiency for Reinforcement Layout 1, and 82 % joint efficiency for Reinforcement Layout 2. These values obtained with bond-slip model are much closer to experimental values than those obtained with perfect bond. The reinforcement layout used also had significant impact on the joint behavior. In Reinforcement Layout 1, the reinforcement (tie) from the wall was not properly anchored in the nodal region in the slab. The compressive stress field (i. e. inclined strut) was observed to flow past the bent part of the reinforcement without much interaction. The force transfer between the inclined strut and the tie was not effective. Also, wide cracks occurred along the inclined strut from the action of transverse tension (caused by the opening moment). These cracks which further weakened the strut. This detail had a diagonal tension cracking failure mode. For Reinforcement Layout 2, a clearly defined nodal region exists. A CTT node formed allowed for effective force transfer (at the node) between the concrete and steel. Furthermore, the bent part of the reinforcement crossed the path of the inclined strut, and helped to control crack width. The reinforcement also provided confinement to the inclined strut which further increased its strength. This detail prevented diagonal tension cracking failure, hence the higher capacity it achieved. Failure was by crushing of concrete along the joint – slab interface, after formation of a wide vertical crack extending from the re-entrant corner downwards into the slab. Adding a diagonal bar, placed 45 ° around the re-entrant corner, helped to control this re-entrant corner crack, thus ensuring that over 100 % joint efficiency is achieved. In conclusion, Reinforcement Layout 1 is a poor detail. Though common in practice, a node is not properly formed in this detail, thus force transfer capacity between concrete and steel is not effective.

40|$|Many {{concrete}} structures {{over the}} world have deteriorated through the corrosion of steel reinforcement. In concrete columns, corrosion often occurs preferentially {{on one side of}} the member, leading to unsymmetrical loss of <b>steel</b> <b>area.</b> For slabs, corrosion of bottom steel also results in reduction in steel reinforcement ratio. The objective of this research is to study the effectiveness of repairing deteriorated concrete columns and slabs with fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite sheets. Using steel reinforcements with reduced cross sections, concrete columns and slabs are cast to represent members with corroded steel bars. This research focuses on the repair of columns (circular and rectangular) and slabs (one way and two way) with different FRP configurations. Circular and rectangular columns are retrofitted with horizontal and vertical FRP’s to study the strengthening effect. The columns are tested under uniaxial compression load. The failure mechanisms are reported. A simple analytical model to compute the failure load is also proposed. For circular columns, horizontal wrapping is found to be the most effective approach. For rectangular columns, one can either employ horizontal FRP alone or vertical FRP confined by external horizontal FRP. Slabs with reduced <b>steel</b> <b>area</b> are tested in both one way and two way bending. Various repair configurations are studied, and the cracking and failure mechanisms are reported. For one-way slab, the H-type configuration, with two FRP strips bonded on the two sides of the region with reduced <b>steel</b> <b>area,</b> is found to be the most effective. To predict the failure load of the strengthened member, a simple analytical approach based on existing debonding models has been developed. Predictions are found to be in good agreement with test results.
