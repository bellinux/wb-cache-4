Shultz (Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State from 1982 to 1989), who was a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Shultz included Rice in a [...] "luncheon club" [...] of intellectuals who met every few weeks to discuss foreign affairs. In 1992, Shultz, who was a board member of Chevron Corporation, recommended Rice for a spot on the Chevron board. Chevron was pursuing a $10 billion development project in Kazakhstan and, as a Soviet <b>specialist,</b> <b>Rice</b> knew the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. She traveled to Kazakhstan on Chevron's behalf and, in honor of her work, in 1993, Chevron named a 129,000-ton supertanker SS Condoleezza Rice. During this period, Rice was also appointed to the boards of Transamerica Corporation (1991) and Hewlett-Packard (1992).|$|E
40|$|A palaeotropical {{family of}} lianas, shrubs and herbs, {{with a single}} genus, Nepenthes. There are 83 species {{of the family in}} the Malesian area, {{including}} three nothospecies and one little known species. Most of the species are cultivated and traded across the world as ornamental plants with curiosity value. Locally in Malesia, some species are used for cooking <b>specialist</b> <b>rice</b> dishes, for medicinal uses or for making rope. The introductory part consists of chapters on distribution, fossils, habitat and ecology, reproductive biology, morphology and anatomy, pitcher function, cytotaxonomy, conservation, taxonomy, uses, collecting notes, and spot characters. Regional keys to the species are given. These are based largely on vegetative characters. For each species full references, synonymy, descriptions, ecology, distribution, notes on diagnostic characters and relationships with other species are presented. Species are arranged alphabetically. This treatment is illustrated with 19 full-page line drawings...|$|E
30|$|Third, current {{concepts}} of “culture” and “language” also slight how rice growing is an “activity complex.” As a task-centered body of practice, an activity follows its own inner logic and develops its own customs {{quite apart from}} what culture or language decrees. Of course this separateness—what we might call the relative autonomy of a key activity—doesn’t apply just to rice. Take our symposium. Did it matter that we gathered in Ithaca and emphasized English? A bit perhaps but not a lot. We understood each other—once as scholars (sharing scholarship as a practice), again as <b>specialists</b> (sharing <b>rice</b> as a subject), and perhaps yet again as interlocutors of rice (joined in how the plant answers our probes). And while our mutual understanding unites us across cultural and linguistic divides, it divides us from others who share our culture and language but not our rice-given understandings. Are rice growers {{all that different from}} rice scholars? Imagine a chain of marriages between wet rice villages: a Malay marries into a Tai village, Tai into Mon, Mon into Burmese—crossing four language families. Yes, the newcomers would learn new words but how new would growing rice be? Don’t misunderstand—I’m not a rabid reductionist. Just the contrary: I’m saying a practice (growing rice in this instance) has an integrity that can never be reduced to how a specific culture (Tai for example) defines it.|$|R
40|$|Plants evolved {{effective}} defense strategies against herbivores {{that depend}} on rapid and reliable recognition of herbivore attack and subsequent induction of tailored plant defenses. Two defense strategies are generally used by plants (including rice) that involve direct and indirect defense mechanisms. Since 2011, we use rice crop to understand its innate defense mechanisms against naturally occurring herbivores in Japan. So far, we show that herbivore feeding elicits proteinase inhibitors, phenolamide accumulation and momilactones as part of direct defense responses; however, many more metabolites against insects in rice can be predicted from our non-targeted metabolomics analyses. In indirect defense, herbivory elicited emissions of several volatile organic compounds, dominated by monoterpene linalool, following insect species-dependent patterns [...] a generalist herbivore tended to provoke stronger responses in rice compared to its specialized insect pest. We hypothesize that such differential response primarily relates to differential composition of oral secretions (and elicitor content) as well as typical feeding behavior of generalist and <b>specialist</b> insects on <b>rice</b> plants. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|In {{the same}} figure, {{students}} of CNAHS preferred the PTC {{as the source}} of information on CC, probably owing to the access to information the PTC facilitates. In the information and communications technology for development literature, among the reasons why people invest in mobile phones are speed of transaction and the significant reduction in costs associated with accessing information. This result is encouraging as far as information provision and access are concerned. In a country with a 103 cellular mobile telephone service density per 100 population in 2013 (PSA 2015), it pays to realize that this technology is being employed productively for development efforts. Additionally, this will afford the students higher quality information in terms of technical content, as the PTC has <b>rice</b> <b>specialist</b> agents who answer questions received by the facility. Interactions with the PTC agents can enhance learning. A minor criticism of the PTC is that it entails cost, but Manalo (2011) noted that young people’s spending for mobile phone prepaid credits in the Philippines was almost equal to their food expenditure. Given the unlimited texting offers in the Philippines, which makes mobile phone usage cheaper, young people will likely optimize this platform if they find it useful.|$|R
40|$|The {{brown planthopper}} (Nilaparvata lugens Stål; BPH) is a <b>specialist</b> {{herbivore}} on <b>rice</b> (Oryza sativa) that ingests phloem sap {{from the plant}} through its stylet mouthparts. Electronic penetration graphs revealed that BPH insects spent more time wandering over plants carrying the resistance genes Bph 14 and Bph 15, but less time ingesting phloem than they did on susceptible plants. They also showed that their feeding was frequently interrupted. Tests with [14 C]sucrose showed that insects ingested much less phloem sap from the resistant than the susceptible plants. BPH feeding up-regulated callose synthase genes and induced callose deposition in the sieve tubes {{at the point where}} the stylet was inserted. The compact callose remained intact in the resistant plants, but genes encoding β- 1, 3 -glucanases were activated, causing unplugging of the sieve tube occlusions in susceptible plants. Continuing ingestion led to a remarkable reduction in the susceptible plants' sucrose content and activation of the RAmy 3 D gene, leading to starch hydrolysis and ultimately carbohydrate deprivation in the plants. Our results demonstrate that BPH feeding induces the deposition of callose on sieve plates in rice and that this is an important defense mechanism that prevents insects from ingesting phloem sap. In response, however, the BPH can unplug sieve tube occlusions by activating β- 1, 3 -glucanase genes in rice plants...|$|R
40|$|Background: Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes control crucial traits for the {{metabolism}} {{of various}} toxins encountered by insects in host {{plants and the}} wider environment, including insecticides. The planthoppers Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera are serious <b>specialist</b> pests of <b>rice</b> throughout eastern Asia. Their capacity to rapidly adapt to resistant rice varieties and to develop resistance to various insecticides has led to severe outbreaks over the last decade. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the genome sequence of N. lugens, we identified {{for the first time}} the complete GST gene family of a delphacid insect whilst nine GST gene orthologs were identified from the closely related species S. furcifera. Nilaparvata lugens has 11 GST genes belonging to six cytosolic subclasses and a microsomal class, many fewer than seen in other insects with known genomes. Sigma is the largest GST subclass, and the intron–exon pattern deviates significantly from that of other species. Higher GST gene expression in the N. lugens adult migratory form reflects the higher risk of this life stage in encountering the toxins of non-host plants. After exposure to a sub-lethal dose of four insecticides, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, buprofezin or beta-cypermethrin, more GST genes were upregulated in S. furcifera than in N. lugens. RNA interference targeting two N. lugens GST genes, NlGSTe 1 and NlGSTm 2, significantly increased the sensitivity of fourth instar nymphs to chlorpyrifos but not to beta-cypermethrin. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides the first elucidation of the nature of the GST gene family in a delphaci...|$|R
40|$|World rice {{consumption}} increases {{every year}} due to world population growth. This challenges rice producing countries to improve productivity. Moreover, {{high quality of}} rice with high nutrients and safety for farmers and consumers are considered in market trend. While recently, various factors more influence the volume of rice production such as climate change, diseases, insects, pollution in soil and water. This includes the increasing of inputs price, rice price volatility, {{the stability of the}} government and the lack of farming labours. Although, Thailand as a leader of rice exporter country, farmers are also facing difficulties of such factors. Therefore, the concept of sustainability is taken into consideration to improve rice supply chain, particularly rice production to help Thai farmers have ability to deal with any situations. The study aims to recommend sustainability of rice supply chain model and rice production practices in Thailand by information of other leaders of producing countries has been conducted and analysed. It includes opinions and recommendations from farmers’ leaders and <b>rice</b> <b>specialists</b> which they are useful to adapt the rice supply chain and rice production being practical. The new rice supply chain has no middleman between farmers and rice processors to decrease logistics cost and increase purchasing price for farmers more or less. Furthermore, farmers are highly recommended to join in either cooperatives group to have more power or contract farming to assure income. At the same time, farmers implement sustainable farming practices by government and relevant firms contribute with all their ability. Moreover, sustainability of rice supply chain will not achieve if there is no collaboration and information sharing...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of omics methods provided enormous possibilities but also challenges in every field of biology. In chemical ecology, integration of transcriptomics data and metabolomics provided especially useful tools for finding of causative metabolites in plant defense against various herbivores. Starting {{with a single}} gene and its profound regulation upon methyl jasmonate treatment in tobacco cells, the role of phenolamides in plant response to herbivores has been uncovered in our work over the last decade. The MYB 8 transcription factor is a master regulator of phenolamide biosynthesis that in tobacco and rice strongly accumulate after wounding and herbivore attack. Our previous transcriptomic and co-expression analyses revealed several new genes involved in PA biosynthesis [1, 2, 3], as well as another branch of MYB 8 function in wound-induced lignification process [4]. More recently, PAs, their function, and biosynthetic genes have been revealed in rice [5, 6], demonstrating a wide radiation of PAs and their biosynthetic pathways in plant evolution. Using similar approaches, our work is now focusing on rice and sorghum to seek their full spectrum of metabolic defences as new resources for these monocot crop models with highly contrasting growth and environmental requirements. Similar to direct defense metabolites, current technologies also allowed studying profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at unbiased level. Interestingly, generalist and <b>specialist</b> herbivores in <b>rice</b> induced different amplitudes of VOCs {{that seemed to be}} highly correlated with the composition of the oral secretions of these insects, supporting the specialist/generalist paradigm. In conclusion, while new technologies proved to be very useful in our work, this presentation eventually demonstrates that even more questions remain unanswered. It is the real challenge in this work to select proper targets and directions, out of the vast amount of data provided by omics, promoting their efficient use in every biological field. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Plants evolved {{effective}} defense strategies against herbivores {{that depend}} on rapid and reliable recognition of herbivore attack, and subsequent induction of appropriate plant defenses. Two major defense strategies in plants involve direct and indirect defense mechanisms. Our group is using two crops, rice and sorghum, to understand their innate defense mechanisms against naturally occurring insect herbivores. For example, we could already show that herbivore feeding in rice elicits proteinase inhibitors, phenolamide (PA) accumulation and momilactones {{as part of its}} direct defense; however, many more metabolites against insects in rice can be predicted from our results of non-targeted metabolomics analyses. So far, we studied in detail and report here the role of two major rice PA conjugates, p-coumaroylputrescine (CoP) and feruloylputrescine (FP). 	Both compounds are strongly induced by chewing and sucking herbivore feeding. In bioassays with synthetic CoP and FP, mortality of rice sucking pest, brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), was enhanced by addition of CoP or FP to artificial diet at 100 µg/ml concentrations. However, chewing herbivore survival was not affected, leaving the importance of these compounds against chewing herbivores in question. Next, we identified genetic basis for phenolamide accumulation in rice by cloning the key biosynthetic genes. We show that phenolamides and their genes are expressed in tissue specific, as well as inducible manner in rice. While main constitutive gene expression and metabolite accumulation occurred in field-grown roots and panicles of rice, herbivores and mechanical wounding induced additional expression and accumulation of CoP and FP in the treated leaves. The accumulation patterns and wide distribution of phenolamides in plant kingdom suggested rapid evolution as well as multiple functions of these metabolites, especially during plant interactions with other organisms. 	In indirect defense, we report that herbivory elicits emissions of several volatile organic compounds in rice, dominated by monoterpene linalool, in insect species-dependent patterns. A generalist herbivore tended to provoke stronger responses in rice compared to its specialized insect pest. We hypothesize that such differential response lays in differential composition of oral secretions (and elicitor contents) as well as typical feeding behavior of generalist and <b>specialist</b> insects on <b>rice</b> plants. We also show that volatiles are emitted in diurnally specific patterns, suggesting differential way of communication between plants and insects during light and dark periods. We speculate that this might be an adaptation of plants to herbivore lifestyles, which are either nocturnal or active during the daylight, allowing plants to boost or relax their defense systems during diurnal cycle. status: publishe...|$|R
