40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present an {{architecture}} {{based on a}} Java (J 2 SE, J 2 EE, J 2 ME and Java Card) platform supporting a secure channel from a Mobile Operator to the SIM card. This channel offers the possibility of end to end <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> of large data files to a GSM SIM card. Such a secure channel {{could be used for}} delivery of high value content that requires a high bandwidth channel – perhaps either rendered for user infotainment, or processed in the client Mobile Station (device and SIM card) for remote device management. Our methodology overcomes the bandwidth constraints of the SIM Toolkit Security scheme described in GSM standard 03. 48. To validate our proposal we have developed code to create DRM and Web Service test scenarios utilising readily available J 2 ME, Java Card, J 2 SE and J 2 EE platforms, Web Services tools from Apache, the KToolBar emulator from Sun, and a Gemplus Java Card...|$|E

40|$|We analyse the {{opinions}} of shippers, logistic service providers (LSPs) and carriers related to regulations and issues faced by these companies regarding freight distribution in megacities, and the logistical performance measures likely affected by those regulations and issues. We present {{a review of the}} freight distribution literature focusing on a large number of freight distribution aspects, such as regulatory, collaborative, environmental, logistical and risk. We also investigate some logistical performance indicators adopted by the companies. Subsequently, we conduct a survey with 147 companies working in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR). We use multivariate analysis of variance to assess the logistical performance indicators and non-linear canonical correlation analysis to identify the most relevant freight distribution attributes. The results that the majority of carriers are located inside the SPMR and efficiently handle these issues better than others actors. The lack of collaboration, cargo theft, traffic congestion and some regulations affect the LSP’s logistical performance. Moreover, the actors perceive regulatory aspects, mainly traffic congestion, and a lack of <b>security</b> <b>for</b> <b>deliveries</b> in unsafe areas as the significant issues <b>for</b> <b>deliveries</b> in megacities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of B 2 C E-Commerce {{has led to}} automation in most steps of the purchasing process, from procurement to payment. With the proliferation of digital products {{it is now possible}} to consider a fully digital and automatic environment, with immediate delivery of the products to the customer, immediately after payment has been cleared. In this scenario, the control of digital rights and the usage of tight <b>security</b> mechanisms <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> are crucial. This paper discusses Digital Rights Management techniques and proposes two secure approaches <b>for</b> Digital Product <b>Delivery</b> of purchased electronic goods to the end user...|$|R

Parties that may submit the questionnaire include one of the following: Lead Manager/Underwriter, Issuer’s financial advisor or the DTC Participant clearing the transaction for its correspondent. The Lead Manager/ Underwriter must ensure that DTC’s Underwriting Department receives the issue’s offering document (e.g., prospectus, offering memorandum, official statement) and the CUSIP numbers assigned to the issue within the time frames outlined in DTC’s Operational Arrangements.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{security}} concerns and inability of American aid workers to deliver the aid to certain regions in Pakistan, Pakistani institutions are responsible {{for a majority of}} the aid delivery to regions including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The areas needing the aid have residents that have anti-American sentiment and hence the delivery of any aid containing the American Flag or label has led to several extremist attacks and reactions (Epstein and Kronstadt 2013, 39). In 2012, aid organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross were forced to shut down operations in FATA regions of Pakistan after finding a British national employee had been beheaded as {{a result of}} negative perception to aid (Epstein and Kronstadt 2013, 39). The idea that the residents in these areas “don’t like America anymore” (Epstein and Kronstadt 2013, 39), pose great <b>security</b> risks <b>for</b> aid <b>delivery</b> <b>for</b> the United States and form a roadblock to the effective implementation of the aid in Pakistan. The need to outsource delivery to Pakistan leads to a lack of control and difficulty in monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the aid and has been a leading cause of the ineffective implementation of U.S. aid.|$|R
40|$|Currently we see {{tremendous}} {{expansion in}} the area of network deployment. As companies realized the cost benefits and productivity gains created by network technology, they began to add networks and expand existing networks almost as rapidly as new network technologies and products are being introduced. The problems associated with network expansion affect both day-to-day network operation management and strategic network growth planning. Each new network technology requires its own set of experts. An urgent need has arisen for automated network management (including what is typically called network capacity planning) integrated across diverse environments.
