25|$|The spider, after {{spinning}} its web, then waits on or {{near the}} web for a prey animal to become trapped. The spider senses the impact and struggle of a prey animal by vibrations transmitted through the web. A spider positioned {{in the middle of the}} web makes for a highly visible prey for birds and other predators, even without web decorations; many day-hunting orb-web spinners reduce this risk by hiding at the edge of the web with one foot on a <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> from the hub or by appearing to be inedible or unappetizing.|$|E
25|$|Spiders do {{not usually}} adhere {{to their own}} webs, because {{they are able to}} spin both sticky and non-sticky types of silk, and are careful to travel across only non-sticky {{portions}} of the web. However, they are not immune to their own glue. Some of the strands of the web are sticky, and others are not. For example, if a spider has chosen to wait along the outer edges of its web, it may spin a non-sticky prey or <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> to the web hub to monitor web movement. However, in the course of spinning sticky strands, spiders have to touch these sticky strands. They do this without sticking by using careful movements, dense hairs and nonstick coatings on their feet to prevent adhesion.|$|E

[...] Examples include pen-down interrupts from touchscreen sensors, thermal limit alerts from temperature sensors, alarms issued by real time clock chips, SDIO, and headset jack insertions from the sound codec in a cell phone.

50|$|Addressable Fire Alarm Control Panel employ {{one or more}} <b>Signaling</b> <b>Line</b> Circuits - usually {{referred}} to as loops or SLC loops - ranging between one and thirty. Depending on the protocol used, a <b>Signaling</b> <b>Line</b> Circuit can monitor and control several hundred devices. Some protocols permit any mix of detectors and input/output modules, while other protocols have 50% of channel capacity restricted to detectors/sensors and 50% restricted to input/output modules. Each SLC polls the devices connected, which can number from a few devices to several hundred, depending on the manufacturer. Large systems may have multiple <b>Signaling</b> <b>Line</b> Circuits.|$|R
60|$|When {{the copper}} helmet sank {{below the surface}} and a train of bubbles rushed up, Jimmy felt his heart beat and his hand grow damp with perspiration. He held the <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> and knew the code, {{as well as the}} number of strokes to the minute that should give air enough; but he had not much {{confidence}} in the pumps. Though he had had to pay a heavy deposit on them, and their hire was costly, they were far from new. The bubbles moved, however, drawing nearer the weed-crusted wood.|$|E
60|$|It proved {{difficult}} work. A vigorous movement upset his unstable equilibrium, and {{he wondered}} whether the weight he carried and the pressure applied were adapted to the depth. This could be ascertained only by experiment; and Jimmy feared to make it. Gripping himself, however, he removed a few shovelfuls of sand; and then {{the pain in his}} head got worse, and, driving in the shovel deeper than before, he fell forward with the effort. Instead of coming to the ground, he made some ridiculous gyrations before he recovered his footing; and then the <b>signal</b> <b>line,</b> which he felt at to reassure himself, seemed tauter than it should be.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had been}} down for some time, Jimmy, turning the pump in {{obedience}} to the plucking of the <b>signal</b> <b>line,</b> began to wonder when he would come up. Bethune seemed particular about his air supply, and Jimmy surmised that he found it needful to move the case along the bottom to get a clear lead for the lifting line because the Cetacea had altered her position. Moran {{put his hand on}} the crank when required, but at other times he stood motionless, watching the ice with an imperturbable brown face. Indeed, Jimmy, as a relief from the tension, began to speculate about his comrade and wonder what he thought. Though they had toiled hard and faced many perils together with mutual respect and confidence, he felt that he knew very little about the man. Moran’s reserve and stolid serenity were baffling. When strenuous action was required he could be relied upon, but even then he was seldom hurried, and his movements somehow suggested that his splendid frame was endowed with unreasoning, automatic powers. For all that, Jimmy knew that such a conception of his friend was wrong. He had seen the cool judgment and indomitable courage that controlled the man’s strength in time of heavy stress.|$|E

50|$|Araneus mitificus builds orb webs {{that are}} {{characteristically}} missing a section. The spider does not {{rest on the}} center of the web, but instead builds a silk-lined sanctuary in a leaf at the margins. The leaf is bent at the edges and roofed with a mesh of silk. If a prey animal becomes entangled in the web, the vibrations from its struggle travel {{to the center of the}} web, then along a single long strand of silk (the <b>signal</b> <b>line)</b> positioned in the empty section.

50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is a {{class of}} {{telecommunications}} <b>signaling</b> protocols. <b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register <b>signaling</b> occurs, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R

50|$|Termination can be passive or active. Passive {{termination}} {{means that}} each <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> is terminated by two resistors, 220 Ω to TERMPOWER and 330 Ω to ground. Active termination {{means that there}} is a small voltage regulator which provides a +2.85 V supply. Each <b>signal</b> <b>line</b> is then terminated by a 110 Ω resistor to the +2.85 V supply. Active termination provides a better impedance match than passive termination because most flat ribbon cables have a characteristic impedance of approximately 110 Ω. Forced perfect termination (FPT) is similar to active termination, but with added diode clamp circuits which absorb any residual voltage overshoot or undershoot. There is a special case in SCSI systems that have mixed 8-bit and 16-bit devices where high-byte termination may be required.|$|E
