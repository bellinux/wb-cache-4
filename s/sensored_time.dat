40|$|Abstract—Tools of sensor-data-driven anomaly {{detection}} facil-itate condition monitoring of dynamical systems {{especially if the}} physics-based models are either inadequate or unavailable. Along this line, symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) {{has been reported in}} lit-erature as a real-time data-driven tool of feature extraction for pat-tern identification from <b>sensor</b> <b>time</b> series. However, an inherent difficulty for a data-driven tool is that the quality of detection may drastically suffer in the event of sensor degradation. This paper proposes an {{anomaly detection}} algorithm for condition monitoring of nuclear power plants, where symbolic feature extraction and the associated pattern classification are optimized by appropriate par-titioning of (possibly noise-contaminated) <b>sensor</b> <b>time</b> series. In this process, the system anomaly signatures are identified by masking the sensor degradation signatures. The proposed anomaly detec-tion methodology is validated on the International Reactor Innova-tive & Secure (IRIS) simulator of nuclear power plants, and its per-formance is evaluated by comparison with that of principal com-ponent analysis (PCA).

40|$|Abstract- Due to the {{collaborative}} nature of <b>sensor</b> nodes, <b>time</b> synchronization {{is critical for}} many sensor network operations. For sensor networks deployed in hostile environments, security {{is critical to the}} success of time synchronization. In the past few years, a number of secure time synchronization schemes have been proposed for sensor networks. However, these schemes are designed for homogeneous sensor networks and may incur large communication/computation overhead or cause accumulated synchronization errors (due to multi-hop relays of time reference messages). Several literatures have shown that better performance and security can be achieved in heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN). In this paper, we present a secure and efficient time synchronization scheme for HSN by utilizing powerful high-end sensors. We implement the time synchronization scheme in real sensor nodes and the experiments show that our scheme achieves higher synchronization accuracy than a popular <b>sensor</b> <b>time</b> synchronization scheme. The analyses demonstrate that our scheme is resilient to various attacks and significantly reduces communication overhead.

30|$|The <b>sensor</b> {{exposure}} <b>time</b> {{and applied}} gain {{can also be}} used for video-level control. The control associated with these parameters is stable and fast (change is effective next video frame already) and offers good linearity and known response. In addition, any possible motion blur reduces only with the shorter exposure time and not with closing of the lens. (Motion is even more critical for rolling-shutter CMOS sensors, which introduce geometrical distortions. In these cases, <b>sensor</b> exposure <b>time</b> must be kept low, and lens control should be used to achieve a desired average video level.) Therefore, when observing motion scenes like traffic or sport events, the <b>sensor</b> integration <b>time</b> is set deliberately low (depending on the speed of objects in the scene) to prevent the motion blur. For traffic scenes, integration time can be as low as 1 [*]millisecond for license-plate recognition applications.|$|R
40|$|Many {{practical}} applications of {{wireless sensor networks}} require sensor nodes to report approximations of their readings at regular time intervals. Time series pre-diction techniques {{have been shown to}} effectively reduce the communication effort for such applications, while guaranteeing user-specified accuracy requirements on collected data. The achievable communication savings offered by time series pre-diction, however, strongly depend on the type of signal sensed, and an inadequate a-priori choice of a prediction model can in practice lead to poor prediction per-formance. This paper describes our adaptive model selection (AMS) algorithm, a lightweight online algorithm that allows sensor nodes to autonomously select the statistically most suitable model among a set of candidate models. Experimental results obtained on the basis of 14 real-world <b>sensor</b> <b>time</b> series demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the proposed framework in improving communication savings.
