50|$|Speed flow {{diagrams}} {{are used to}} determine the speed at which the optimum flow occurs. There are currently two shapes of the speed-flow curve. The speed-flow curve also consists of two branches, the freeflow and congested branches. The diagram is not a function, allowing the flow variable to exist at two different speeds. The flow variable existing at two different speeds occurs when the speed is higher and the density is lower or when the speed is lower and the density is higher, which allows for the same flow rate. In the first <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagram,</b> the freeflow branch is a horizontal line, which shows that the roadway is at freeflow speed until the optimum flow is reached. Once the optimum flow is reached, the diagram switches to the congested branch, which is a parabolic shape. The second speed flow diagram is a parabola. The parabola suggests that the only time there is freeflow speed is when the density approaches zero; it also suggests that as the flow increases the speed decreases. This parabolic graph also contains an optimum flow. The optimum flow also divides the freeflow and congested branches on the parabolic graph.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{environmental}} impacts {{are becoming more}} and more important in urban network traffic management. However, traditional urban traffic management approaches are predominantly geared towards satisfying the traffic demand, and do not consider the environmental effects in the design phase. Calculation of the generated emissions is usually foreseen after the calculation of traffic volume data via traffic assignment models. This paper describes a new methodology which uses the environmental constraints as key input for defining network wide traffic management strategies. Both flow and {{environmental impacts}} are calculated simultaneously instead of evaluating the environmental impacts for a given specific flow pattern. The methodology that allows integrating the traffic and emission models, including the inversion process of utilizing environmental constraints as input for the network traffic management, will be elaborated. On the link level this means that the suggested methodology will adjust the (flow) capacity of a link according to the various environmental constraints that apply. The subsequent flow pattern represents the basis for the design of an environment-friendly traffic network. The key element in the process is the development of a <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagram</b> on each link based on the relevant environmental constraints. Combining the speed-flow diagrams related to the environmental constraints and the fundamental <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagram</b> a new (integrated) speed flow diagram will be obtained, addressing all constraints simultaneously. Therefore, the maximum flow which is assigned to a link applying the new <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagram</b> will satisfy both traffic capacity and environmental constraints. Applying this methodology to a network, the assignment results represent the capacities that meet the environmental constraints (the environmental capacities); this result can thus be obtained in one step avoiding a long iterative procedure of trial and error, involving the adjustment of the link capacities. A wide range of possible traffic management and capacity management measures that can be applied to accommodate differences between flow capacity and environmental capacity will be indentified in the last part of the paper. Further details, including the proposed traffic models, emission models and traffic variables, are discussed in the paper. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe new HCM 2010 proposes {{in chapter}} 11 {{two-stage}} curves {{to represent the}} <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagram</b> for non-congested flow on freeways where constant speeds are postulated over a rather wide range of volumes. This division of the traffic flow in two parts plus the congested conditions is a rather pragmatic approach. Further the three steps pretend three separate traffic flow regimes, which donâ€™t exist. A continuous function, like it {{is used in the}} other guidelines, would replicate the traffic conditions comprehensibly and realistically. Therefore, a model based on simple queueing theory analogy is presented to represent the noncongested part of traffic flow. Moreover several models which represent each state of traffic flow by one function are discussed. These different approaches are compared to real world data from the US and Germany. Based on this analysis a new single-stage model for the approximation of fundamental diagrams for freeways is recommended. The model can also be modified in order to represent the capacity drop effect...|$|E
40|$|Free {{flow speed}} {{is used as}} a {{parameter}} in transportation planning and capacity analysis models, as well as <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Many of these models suggest estimating free flow speed according to measurements from similar highways, which is not a practical method for use in B&H. This paper first discusses problems with using these methodologies in conditions prevailing in B&H and then presents a free flow speed evaluation model developed from a comprehensive field survey conducted on nine homogeneous sections of state and regional roads...|$|R
40|$|An {{enormous}} amount of publications deals with smoothing {{in the sense of}} nonparametric regression. However, nearly all of the literature treats the case where predictors and response are related {{in the form of a}} function y = m(x) + noise. In many situations this simple functional model does not capture adequately the essential relation between predictor and response. We show by means of <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagrams,</b> that a more general setting may be required, allowing for multifunctions instead of only functions. It turns out that in this case the conditional modes are more appropriate for the estimation of the underlying relation than the commonly used mean or the median. Estimation is achieved using a conditional mean-shift procedure, which is adapted to the present situation...|$|R
40|$|Scatterplots {{of traffic}} speed versus flow have caught {{considerable}} attention {{over the last}} decades due to their characteristic half-moon like shape. Modelling data of this type is difficult as both variables are actually not a function {{of each other in}} the sense of causality, but are rather jointly generated by a third latent variable, which is a monotone function of the traffic density. We propose local principal curves as a tool to describe and model speed-flow data, which takes this viewpoint into account. We introduce the concept of calibration curves to determine the relationship between the latent variable (represented by the parametrization of the principal curve) and the traffic density. We apply local principal curves to a variety of <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> from Californian freeways, including some so far unreported pattern...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{second edition}} of the German Highway Capacity Manual HBS was {{published}} in 2015. The paper presents the HBS procedure {{for the assessment of}} basic freeway segments and discusses challenges for the future development of the methodology. As in the former {{edition of the}} HBS, the volume-to-capacity ratio is used as measure of effectiveness for basic freeway segments. The design capacities and <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> for basic freeway segments were completely revised and supplemented by new design values for segments with four-lane carriageways and segments with hard shoulder running. Besides the provision of specific design capacities, the reduced capacity variance on segments with variable speed limits, which was ascertained in recent investigations, is considered by adjusting the lower threshold value of LOS E. The new edition of the HBS also provides a framework for the use of specific parameters and the application of alternative methods for the assessment of traffic flow quality. Overall, the revised procedure for the analysis of basic freeway segments includes major enhancements and covers a larger number of segment types, but the main concept still follows the tradition of using deterministic capacities and providing rather simple analytical procedures to assess the traffic flow in one specific peak hour. For the future development of the HBS, the application of computer-based simulation models as well as the use of stochastic traffic flow parameters that better represent traffic reliability will increasingly emerge...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{is to determine the}} effect of Transverse Rumble Strips (TRS) on the traffic flow fundamental diagram. To achieve this goal, firstly segment KM 14. 3 - 14. 6, Northbound PLUS Expressway E 2, which connect Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur had been chosen as a study area, because in this place TRS was deployed on pavement. To find traffic flow fundamental diagrams before and at TRS required data which were traffic volume, speed and density had been collected before TRS with SSD distance to avoid from the effect of TRS on traffic flow characteristics and at TRS. Required data before TRS were collected by ATC method (pneumatic tubes) and data on TRS had been collected by video camera. After installing ATC, data collected for two weeks and peak period was determined. Heaviest traffic was on Friday and Saturday during 2 : 00 pm to 5 : 00 pm for this reason at Friday 31 August 2012 and Saturday 1 September 2012 during 3 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 pm required data had been collected by a video camera on TRS. In the last step fundamental diagram for both cases before and at TRS were founded and compared with each other. This study shows that TRS in speed-density and <b>speed-flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> reduces free flow speed between 4 to 5 km/hr which is significant. But about jam density and maximum flow there was not any accurate result achieved in flow-dansity and other diagrams...|$|R
