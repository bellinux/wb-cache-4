The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the response of <b>sole</b> and <b>relay</b> intercropping cotton and wheat to the effect of sowing dates and ridge width on cotton yields in Abo Hussein Village, Abo Kebeer district, Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The experiment was carried out in a strip plot design with four replications. The vertical plots were occupied with three sowing dates. The horizontal plots were assigned to three ridge width. Sowing on 15 th March significantly affected (p< 0. 05) number of days to first flower opening and plant height of <b>sole</b> and <b>relay</b> intercropping cotton and number of fruiting branches/plant, number of opened bolls/plant, boll weight, seed cotton yield per plant and feddan and lint cotton yield/fed of sole cotton and resulted in the highest values in both seasons. Sowing relay intercropping cotton on 1 st April significantly affected (p< 0. 05) number of fruiting branches/plant, number of opened bolls/plant, boll weight, seed cotton yield per plant and feddan and lint cotton yield/fed and produced the highest values in both seasons. Sowing <b>sole</b> or <b>relay</b> intercropping cotton on wide ridges significantly affected all studied traits and produced the highest values in both seasons. It can be concluded that, in order to maximize seeds and lint cotton yields/fed of sole cotton, it must be sown in 15 th March on ridges with width of 100 cm. However, for maximization of seeds and lint cotton yields/fed of relay intercropping cotton, it must be sown in 1 st April on ridges with width of 100 cm...|$|R

40|$|What is a Deaf interpreter? Liz Scott-Gibson {{wrote about}} Sign {{language}} interpreting: An emerging profession, in 1991. The {{process through which}} {{the help of the}} missioners and welfare work became formalised into social work with Deaf people and sign language interpreting, is being paralleled this time amongst Deaf people themselves. There is a new emerging profession Deaf people working as interpreters (or, as they are commonly called, <b>relay</b> <b>interpreters).</b> Interest in this role is widespread and much discussed. But there is confusion, and with confusion comes risk. 1. How did Deaf interpreting start? What exactly is the definition of a Deaf interpreter? What is their role? In what type of settings do they work? Are they professionals? Do they follow interpreter professional ethics? 2. What skills and abilities do Deaf interpreters need? 3. What training and qualifications does/should a Deaf interpreter have? What needs to be added or changed to current standard interpreting courses to incorporate Deaf interpreters effectively? Do they have access to post qualification professional development and mentoring? 4. What do hearing interpreters need to learn in order to work with Deaf interpreters? These are some of the questions that we will respond to in our paper, concluding with the proposition that the progress made by the profession of interpreting, as a whole should not be brushed aside when it comes to Deaf interpreters we can learn from their experiences. We do not want to reinvent the wheel! A profession made up of untrained, unqualified, and unregulated people, even though they may have many relevant skills and experiences, is not desirable or safe for the Deaf community. We will offer suggestions on how this can be turned around...|$|R

40|$|The relay of pain fibers {{from the}} spinal and {{medullary}} dorsal horn in the thalamus {{has become a}} controversial issue. This study analyzed the relationship of fibers arising in lamina I to nuclei {{in and around the}} caudal pole of the ventral posterior nuclear complex and especially to a zone of calbindin-dense immunoreactivity (VMpo) identified by some authors as the <b>sole</b> thalamic <b>relay</b> for these fibers. We show that the densest zone of calbindin immunoreactivity is part of a more extensive, calbindin-immunoreactive region that lies well within the medial tip of the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), as delineated by other staining methods, and prove that the use of different anti-calbindin antibodies cannot account for differences in interpretations of the organization of the posterior thalamic region. By combining immunocytochemical staining with anterograde tracing from injections involving lamina I, we demonstrate widespread fiber terminations that are not restricted to the calbindin-rich medial tip of VPM and show that the lamina I arising fibers are not themselves calbindin immunoreactive. This study disproves the existence of VMpo as an independent thalamic pain nucleus or as a specific relay in the ascending pain system.

This study shows that VRS interpreters experience {{high levels of}} stress that can lead to job burnout and high turnover in the VRS industry. This article begins by discussing the VRS industry and the topic of burnout in the workforce. Survey results from individuals within the VRS industry (n = 424) illuminate interpreters’ experiences with stress and burnout in VRS interpreting and provide ideas about solutions for this problem. Lastly, there is a discussion of the implications of burnout as well as suggestions for the four primary players in VRS interpreting work: the VRS interpreters, call center managers, VRS providers as a whole, and the Federal Communications Commission. The goal {{of this study is to}} provide evidence regarding the existence of stress and burnout in VRS interpreting in hopes that this information can be used to improve this subset of interpreting work...|$|R
40|$|The Hog 1 mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) plays {{a central role}} in stress {{responses}} in the human pathogen Candida albicans. Here, we have investigated the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) -dependent regulation of the pathway. In contrast to the Hog 1 pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is regulated by three MAPKKKs (Ssk 2, Ssk 22, and Ste 11), our results demonstrate that Hog 1 in C. albicans is regulated by a single MAPKKK Ssk 2. Deletion of SSK 2 results in comparable stress and morphological phenotypes exhibited by hog 1 Δ cells, and Ssk 2 is required for the stress-induced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Hog 1, and for Hog 1 -dependent gene expression. Furthermore, phenotypes associated with deletion of SSK 2 can be circumvented by expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of the MAPKK Pbs 2, indicating that Ssk 2 regulates Hog 1 via activation of Pbs 2. In S. cerevisiae, the Hog 1 pathway is also regulated by the MAPKKK Ste 11. However, we can find no connection between Ste 11 and the regulation of Hog 1 in C. albicans. Furthermore, expression of a chimeric Pbs 2 protein containing the Ste 11 -dependent regulatory region of S. cerevisiae Pbs 2, fails to stimulate Ste 11 -dependent stress signaling in C. albicans. Collectively, our data show that Ssk 2 is the <b>sole</b> MAPKKK to <b>relay</b> stress signals to Hog 1 in C. albicans and that the MAPK signaling network in C. albicans has diverged significantly from the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{decisions}} in crop production is the choice of row distance and plant density. The choice of these planting pattern parameters is especially challenging in heterogeneous systems, such as systems containing alternating strips. Here we use functional-structural plant modelling {{to address the problem}} of identifying optimal row distances and plant density in a heterogeneous crop system. We compare radiation capture in <b>sole</b> cotton and <b>relay</b> strip cotton, remaining after harvest of wheat from a wheat-cotton relay strip intercrop. We compare light interception in the two systems under different scenarios of row distance and plant density. Light interception calculations with the functional-structural plant model were evaluated using field observations. Light interception by cotton was mainly determined by row distances and to a lesser extent by plant density. Light interception was reduced by the gaps between the strips in strip cotton. Plant density (per unit area of the whole system) providing maximum light interception was lower in relay strip cotton than in normal cotton. Plastic responses of cotton to canopy heterogeneity, accounted for in the model, did not result in full radiation capture in strip cotton. The gaps between the rows in strip cotton allowed light penetration to deeper canopy layers relevant for the reduction of fruit abortion rate. We conclude that relay strip cotton cannot attain the same light interception as sole cotton, due to the gaps between the strips. Increasing plant density was insufficient to bridge the gap. Thus, the maximum light interception in strip cotton is lower than in sole cotton, and is achieved at a lower overall plant density. FSP modelling provided a suitable tool to identify row distance and plant densities providing high light interception in a heterogeneous canopy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mixed {{cropping}} of groundnuts and maize in East Java was {{studied by}} means of a survey of farming practice and by field experiments. The influence of different sowing times and plant density of maize on the development and yield of groundnuts and maize were the main topics in this thesis. Plant arrangement, light use efficiency, and economic aspects were also investigated. The normal farming practice in East Java for mixed cropping of groundnuts and maize was to sow the crops simultaneously {{at the end of the}} rainy season. The average plant densities used were: 190, 000 plants per hectare (167, 000 - 214, 000) for groundnuts (95 % of the plant density of the sole crop) and 40, 000 plants per hectare (31, 000 - 50, 000) for maize (53 % of the sole crop density). Average yields were 1140 kg/ha of groundnuts (80 % of the sole crop yield) and 900 kg/ha of maize (43 % of the sole maize yield). The average LER of the mixed crops was 1. 23, which means a 23 % higher productivity than the sole crops of groundnuts and maize. In the field experiments, the density of groundnuts was 160, 000 plants per hectare, and the density of sole maize was 125, 000 plants per hectare (80 x 20 cm, 2 plants per hill). In each of the experiments 3 to 7, the plant density of maize in the mixed crops was varied. in experiments 1 and 2, however, the maize density was 83, 000 plants per hectare (80 x 30 cm, 2 plants per hill), both in sole and mixed crops. In experiments 1 and 2, the sowing date of maize (sown at 100 % density) in the mixed crop was varied. Later sown maize plants were less developed and gave lower yields than simultaneouslysown maize. Groundnuts in the mixed crops showed a better development and yield when maize was sown later, but not as good as sole groundnuts. In experiment 2, the sole crop yields were much higher, and the response to a delay in sowing time of the maize was much stronger than in experiment 1. The higher yield was due to better nutrient availability and freedom from water stress in the beginning of the growing period. The most equal yield distribution between groundnuts and maize in mixed crops was reached when maize was sown about 10 days later than groundnuts. In experiments 3 to 5 the plant density of maize in the mixed crop was varied, with maize sown 10 days later than the groundnuts. At higher plant densities, the development and yield of the groundnut crop and of the individual maize plants was less than at lower maize densities. When maize was sown 10 days later than the groundnuts (100 % density), maximum maize yields in mixed crops were obtained at maize densities between 80 % and 150 % of the sole crop density, but the highest LER values for the mixed crop were reached with slightly lower maize densities between 70 % and 100 %. This was higher than the usual maize density in farmers' fields of about 50 % in mixed crops with simultaneously- sown groundnuts and maize. The effect of the arrangement of maize plants in mixed crops was small compared with the effect of plant density. only at extremely high maize densities, plant arrangement had a substantial effect (experiment 5). The interaction of sowing time effect and plant density effect, studied in experiments 6 and 7, showed that the longer the delay in sowing time of the maize, the higher the plant density of maize had to be, to reach maximum LER values for the mixed crop. The higher productivity of the mixed crops compared to sole maize can be explained by the higher percentage of intercepted light (67 % against 43 %), and compared to sole groundnuts by the better utilization of the intercepted light (1. 0 % against 0. 6 %). The revenues from the mixed crops were much higher than from sole maize and only slightly lower than from sole groundnuts. Delaying the sowing of maize in the mixed crop resulted in higher revenues. A change in the price ratio between groundnuts and maize from 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 would result in higher revenues for the mixed crop than for each of the sole crops (chapter g). In mixed crops, a higher share of the work was done by women (57 %) than in sole groundnuts (53 %) and sole maize (27 %). A 10 -day delay in the sowing time of maize resulted in a better spreading of the labour demand over the growing period. Sowing maize 10 days later than groundnuts at a density of 75 % of the normal sole crop density can be an improvement of the normal farming practice to sow maize at 50 % density simultaneously with the groundnuts. In mixed crops with 10 days delay in sowing time of maize and 70 % to 100 % maize density, the marketable yield was 1070 kg/ha of groundnuts and 1840 kg/ha of maize, averaged over the 7 field experiments. The groundnut yield in the experiments was similar to that in the farmers' practice with simultaneous sowing and 50 % maize density, and the maize yield was twice as high. In experiment 2, with its high fertility level and its adequate water supply, the LAI of sole maize was higher than 4, and sole maize yield was over 4 tons per hectare. In mixed crops with LAI values of maize higher than 4, the shading of the groundnut crop is too heavy, and no yield advantage can be expected from the mixed crop compared to the <b>sole</b> maize crop. <b>Relay</b> cropping can be a proper practice of intensive crop production when high yield levels are obtained with sole crops. Mixed crops are more secure than sole crops in situations of marginal farming, low soil fertility, unreliable water supply and low input level. Improvements in mixed cropping techniques are a cheap way to increase the food production in East Java...|$|R
