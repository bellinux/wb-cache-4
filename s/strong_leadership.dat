5|$|Carleton {{addressed}} the weak {{points of the}} town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along {{the walls and the}} inner defenses; and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under <b>strong</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked <b>strong</b> <b>leadership,</b> and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{had been}} {{governed by a}} three-man National Commission, {{consisting}} of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann left office {{at the request of}} other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, preferred a single commissioner to rule over the game, but were willing to see the National Commission continue if Herrmann was replaced by someone who would provide <b>strong</b> <b>leadership.</b> Landis's name was mentioned in the press for this role, and the influential baseball newspaper The Sporting News sought his appointment.|$|E

5|$|On the {{battlefield}} the Jägers provided <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> that made disciplined {{action by the}} common White soldiers possible. The White troopers {{were similar to those}} of the Red Guards with brief and inadequate training. At the beginning of the war, the leadership of the White Guards had little authority over volunteer White Guard platoons and companies, which obeyed only their dominant, local leaders. In the end of February, the Jägers started rapid training of six regiments with conscripts.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{his fifth}} {{season with the}} Predators, Weber {{continued}} his stellar record. At the February Olympic break, Weber accumulated 35 points in 59 games for the Predators. He also established a <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> role and willingness to defend his teammates, highlighted by three consecutive games in March 2010 in which he fought opposing players. Weber's offensive production slowed after the Olympic break and he finished the season with 43 points in 78 games played. Despite a decrease in offence from the previous season, Weber was a Norris Trophy candidate {{for the third consecutive}} year, receiving a single first place vote and 96 voting points to finish as the sixth runner-up behind winner Duncan Keith (1,096 points). Weber also received a single fifth-place vote, tying for 23rd with six other players in Hart Memorial Trophy voting, and was the seventh-ranked defenceman in NHL All-Star Team voting with 83 voting points.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's vice {{presidency}} is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because {{of their personal}} dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition {{to prevent him from}} assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent. Without <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> in the executive branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office.|$|E

50|$|In May 2012, {{researchers}} from the Humanitarian Policy Group at the Overseas Development Institute highlighted that the situation in South Kordofan was approaching crisis levels and called for <b>stronger</b> <b>leadership</b> and engagement from humanitarian actors, {{as well as a}} redoubling of diplomatic efforts to restart political dialogue in the hope of securing a lasting and peaceful resolution.|$|R
5|$|That night, {{many of the}} revolutionaries {{attended}} a theatre production {{on the theme of}} tyranny, called Rome Saved. The lead actor was Morante, playing Cicero. The police chief requested Morante to feign illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with Misanthropy and Repentance by the German novelist and playwright August von Kotzebue. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic speech, about the Gaul threat to Rome (the Gauls are ancestors of the French people) and the need for <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up and cried out for the freedom of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.|$|E
5|$|The first {{refugees}} resettled {{under the}} programme were housed in Sheffield, {{which was the}} first city to join the scheme and which had branded itself the UK's first 'City of Sanctuary'. Others have been housed in cities and towns including Bradford, Brighton and Hove, Bromley, Colchester, Hull, Middlesbrough, Motherwell, Norwich, and the Manchester area including Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport and Tameside. Sheffield, Bolton and Hull have received the largest numbers, accounting for just under half of all refugees resettled under the programme between 2004 and 2012. The large proportion of refugees who have been resettled in North West England has been attributed partly to <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> on migration issues in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February, the French cruiser Montcalm, {{followed}} by the Russian auxiliary cruiser Orel and Japanese warships Otowa and Tsushima arrived. Seventy-five Japanese sailors, twenty-two Russians and 190 French marines were landed to round up mutineers who had taken refuge in the jungle {{to the north of}} Singapore. They were joined in this operation by sixty soldiers of the 36th Sikhs who were passing through Singapore, plus Singaporean police, British sailors and Malay States Volunteer Rifles. Lacking <b>strong</b> <b>leadership,</b> the mutiny had started to lose direction – a large number of the mutineers surrendered immediately, and the rest scattered in small groups into the jungles. Many tried to cross the Strait of Johore, but were quickly rounded up by the Sultan of Johore's army. While local media spoke of serious battles there were in fact only minor skirmishes between the allied landing parties and the now demoralized mutineers. By the evening of the 17th 432 mutineers had been captured.|$|E
50|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1994, the Explorers Program has maintained a 90% retention rate.

40|$|The Second Annual Indigenous Higher Education Conference (IHEAC) held in 2006 {{led to the}} {{development}} of a broad set of recommendations for possible policy directions and research issues.

5|$|In Higueras, Cerezeda became ill, and {{lacked the}} ability to provide <b>strong</b> <b>leadership.</b> He was unable to expand the conquered area, and the Spanish treated the {{indigenous}} population with customary harshness, resulting in population decline as the natives either succumbed to their ruthless treatment, or fled into the hills. The natives that remained were increasingly hostile, and refuse to work for their encomendero overlords. This resistance crystallised around Sicumba; ever more indigenous warriors rallied to his cause, and areas that had been superficially conquered rose up in arms against the Spanish. Areas that had previously fallen to the Spanish were lost, and they were encircled in a small region centred on Buena Esperanza. The colonists were demoralised, fearing a massive Indian attack at any moment, and were desperately short of provisions since the encomienda towns refused to supply them. The colonists openly questioned Cerezeda's leadership, and new factions formed, with treasurer Diego García de Solís leading the opposition. Rumours of the riches of Peru lured Spaniards away from the faltering colony in Honduras-Higueras, and forty or fifty men deserted in search of better fortune elsewhere. Although precious metals had been discovered close to Buena Esperanza, {{it was impossible to}} mine them due to the hostility of the Indians. In spite of Cerezeda's opposition, García de Solís appealed directly to the governor of Guatemala, Pedro de Alvarado, who had recently returned from Ecuador. Such was the desperate situation that García de Solís travelled personally to Guatemala with ten soldiers, leaving Buena Esperanza in October 1535, and arriving in Santiago de Guatemala in late November.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Jennings' super PAC, Kentuckians for <b>Strong</b> <b>Leadership,</b> {{took on a}} new mission—helping Republicans {{gain control}} of the Kentucky state House of Representatives. KSL spent $2 million on 19 {{legislative}} races as the GOP went from a 53-47 minority to a 64-36 super majority. Republicans had not controlled the Kentucky house in nearly 100 years.|$|E
25|$|Alluding to {{past and}} recent {{proposals}} of cease-fire negotiations, Ridgway also advised that future governmental decisions might compel the Eighth Army {{to adopt a}} static defense. Because of its inherent rigidity, such a stance would require <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> and imaginative tactical thinking, he warned, to stand off a numerically stronger enemy {{that might not be}} similarly inhibited in the choice of tactics.|$|E

25|$|De Lerma's role as royal {{favourite}} {{at court}} was {{further complicated by}} the rise of various 'proconsuls' under Philip III's reign – significant Spanish representatives overseas, who came to exercise independent judgement and even independent policies in the absence of <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> from the centre. The challenges to government communication during the period encouraged aspects of this, but the phenomenon was much more marked under Philip III than under either the reign of his father or son.|$|E
25|$|According to a Gallup Poll taken February 911 2007, {{responders}} {{who supported}} Giuliani were {{asked why they}} supported him.

Another poll taken by Marist showed that 42% of Giuliani supporters believed that leadership {{is the most important}} quality for a candidate, compared to 34% of McCain supporters who believed the same.|$|E
25|$|With {{hundreds}} of thousands dead, and many localized examples of excellent combat performance, important segments of South Vietnamese society put up a strong fight against Northern hegemony. During the 1972 Easter Offensive for example, such resistance highlighted credible performances, not only by elite units like Rangers, Marines or Paratroops, but among elements of regular divisions as well. <b>Strong</b> <b>leadership</b> {{in the form of}} commanders like Maj. General Ngo Quang Truong also galvanized and inspired the ARVN effort at places like Hue and An Loc.|$|E

40|$|Despite initial {{fears of}} Euroscepticism on the {{continent}} after the election, the coalition government’s relationship with Europe has on the whole, been productive. Paul Adamson argues that while the government’s more recent policy of relatively pragmatic disengagement initially signaled {{an end to the}} ‘European honeymoon’, the fiscal crisis and events in Libya may yet see a <b>stronger</b> <b>leadership</b> role for the UK in Europe...|$|R

25|$|An outspoken man who {{had several}} brushes with the game's officials, Hookes retired {{at the end of}} the 1991–92 season and pursued his media career. He moved to Melbourne in 1995 and {{broadcast}} on Radio 3AW. His popularity among players and his reputation for <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> led to his appointment as coach of the Victorian team in 2002.

25|$|Olsen {{played a}} wide variety of positions, {{including}} right winger, central midfielder, and libero. In his youth, Olsen's strengths were his acceleration, agility, and play intelligence and he played as a winger. In his first senior years, Olsen played all positions except goalkeeper, maturing him into a versatile team-player. He eventually found his place as a central midfielder. Though initially filling the role of playmaker rather than a ball-winning tackler, Olsen eventually excelled as a defensive midfielder possessing great determination, dedicated professionalism, and organisational skills. He gradually took on a <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> role, a trait he worked hard to develop.|$|E
25|$|The team {{suffered}} the blow {{of the death}} of Roland Ratzenberger during qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix. Traditionally the other team driver would withdraw in such a situation, but seeing the demoralisation around him, Brabham decided to race on, only to crash out after a suspension failure of his own. In Ratzenberger's memory the team made a collective decision to see out the season, with Brabham's <b>strong</b> <b>leadership</b> often cited as a key factor. While the Simtek was uncompetitive he won considerable acclaim for his determination and for gradually improving the speed of the underfunded package, also handily out-performing his various teammates.|$|E
