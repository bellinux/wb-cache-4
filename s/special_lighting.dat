Other events held during the 125th anniversary celebrations, which coincided with the Memorial Day weekend, included a film series, historical walking tours, information tents, a series of lectures and readings, a bicycle tour of Brooklyn, a miniature golf course featuring Brooklyn icons, and other musical and dance performances. Just before the anniversary celebrations, artist Paul St George installed the Telectroscope, a video link between New York and London, on the Brooklyn side of the bridge. The installation lasted {{for a few weeks}} and permitted viewers in New York to see people looking into a matching telectroscope near London's Tower Bridge.

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, <b>special</b> <b>lighting,</b> transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know where they are going. This happens all the time and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{sound and}} {{graphics}} were praised positively. IGN's Casamassina described the sound effects as [...] "dead-on and crystal clear" [...] {{and felt that}} the soundtrack was [...] "some {{of the very best}} ever put into a Nintendo 64 game." [...] Similarly, Johnny Liu of Game Revolution said that the game [...] "goes for a more operatic feel than the generic video game techno." [...] Nintendo Power credited the game's [...] "visually stunning" [...] settings and [...] "state-of-the-art" [...] animations and <b>special</b> <b>lighting,</b> while Game Informer noted that the game's [...] "enormous" [...] explosions help intensify the action. Despite the praise, critics remarked that the frame rate can drop significantly when the action increases. Edge also criticized the camera for refusing to move when the situation calls for such action, requiring players to manually enter the aiming mode to center it behind the protagonist.|$|E

500|$|Development {{began in}} earnest during {{the second quarter of}} 1995. The game was officially {{unveiled}} by both Mario creator and producer Shigeru Miyamoto and co-director Chihiro Fujioka at the 1995 V-Jump Festival event in Japan. Miyamoto led teams at Nintendo and Square, who spent over a year developing the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the Super Mario Bros. series. Square reported that the game was about 70% complete in October 1995. The developers created the interior elements such as columns, stairways, and exterior elements with advanced computer modeling techniques. <b>Special</b> <b>lighting</b> effects were used to create shadows and reflections that were meant to improve the 3D elements. With guidance from Miyamoto, Square developed the game, combining role-playing aspects of previous Square games like Final Fantasy VI with the platforming elements of Nintendo's games. Square's Final Fantasy series was the model for the battle sequences, while the tradition of Super Mario Bros. games demanded a lot of action. Mario's ability to jog in eight directions and jump up or down in three–quarter perspective gave him a (comparatively) large range of motion. [...] At 70% completion, the mix of adventure and action game play elements placed it in a category closer to [...]|$|E
500|$|Since 2000, {{the entire}} tower has been {{illuminated}} {{in a pink}} light on 1 October to highlight the beginning of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The tower has also had a variety of <b>special</b> <b>lighting</b> arrangements for Christmas since 1994. During New Year's Eve, the tower lights up at midnight with a year number displayed {{on one side of}} the observatory to mark the arrival of the new year. Special Japanese events have also been cause to light the tower in several nontraditional ways. In 2002, alternating sections of the tower were lit blue to help celebrate the opening of the FIFA World Cup in Japan. Alternating sections of the tower were lit green on Saint Patrick's Day in 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Japanese-Irish relations. On a few occasions, Tokyo Tower has even been specially lit to correspond with corporate events. For example, the top half of the tower was lit green to correspond with the Japanese premiere of The Matrix Reloaded and different sections of the tower were lit red, white and black to commemorate the first day of sales of Coca-Cola C2. The tower was also lit for the new millennium in 2000 with Motoko Ishii again reprising her role as the designer. In December 2008, Nihon Denpatō spent $6.5million to create a new nighttime illumination schemetitled the [...] "Diamond Veil"to celebrate the tower's 50th anniversary. The arrangement featured 276lights in seven colors equally distributed across the towers four faces.|$|E
500|$|Taylor had {{a crew of}} six camera operators, {{including}} three Denver cinematographers and three others brought in by Taylor. Due to the thick fog and heavy rain {{on the night of}} the concert, very little aerial footage was suitable for the final edit. Although two [...] "master angle" [...] cameras on tripods provided wide and overview shots, most of the camera operators filmed with hand-held cameras. The video cameras used had tube sensors, which created trails in the footage when they were pointed at direct light sources. As a result, much of the concert footage contains red streaks, prompting a notice on the future home video release informing viewers that the coloured lines in the footage [...] "are a result of <b>special</b> <b>lighting</b> effects, and are not caused by a tape defect or your equipment". The weather was cold enough that steam was coming out of the band members' mouths, and the Edge had difficulty playing guitar because his hands felt [...] "frozen stiff". Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. believes the weather contributed a dramatic atmosphere to the concert. Reduced attendance at the event was largely obscured in the concert footage by the thick mist that filled the air that evening, as well as strategic shots of the crowd. Taylor had a B-stage built onto the set to reduce the gap between the audience and Bono, allowing him to perform close to the audience, surrounded by fans on three sides. Sound mixing was managed by Steve Lillywhite, who produced U2's first three studio albums. Ezratty's portable 24-track recording system, Effanel Music, was used because a conventional mobile recording studio could not be moved close enough to the stage.|$|E
