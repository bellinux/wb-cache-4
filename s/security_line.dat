50|$|During 2014, the Fayetteville Airport Commission, airport management, and the Fayetteville City Council began {{exploring}} {{options for}} {{expansion of the}} terminal at the airport. This expansion will involve {{the removal of the}} original Concourse A, which is an older-style ground level concourse {{that was part of the}} original design. It will be replaced with an elevated concourse that matches the current Concourse B. This will create a new total of 8 gates, all of which will be fitted with jet-bridges, and two of which will be fitted with adjustable-height jet bridges capable of accommodating larger jet aircraft, as well as expanded seating areas and new restrooms and dining facilities. The expansion will also provide expanded facilities for the Transportation Security Administration to allow for multiple security lanes, replacing the current single <b>security</b> <b>line</b> format. Additional airline counter space would be created by relocating TSA baggage operations from the main ticketing lobby to the rear service area. These terminal renovations and expansions will make it possible for Fayetteville to be served by additional air carriers in the future, with a goal of adding hub connections and destinations to make travel easier for passengers from the Fayetteville metro area.|$|E

5000|$|The Soviet Union, which feared Western {{powers and}} the {{possibility}} of [...] "capitalist encirclements", had little faith either that war could be avoided, or faith in the Polish army, and wanted nothing less than an ironclad military alliance with France and Britain that would provide a guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany; thus, Stalin's adherence to the collective <b>security</b> <b>line</b> was purely conditional. Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the Soviet Union, weakened by the Great Purge, could not be a main military participant, a point that many military sources were at variance with, especially given the Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung Army on the Manchurian frontier. France was more anxious to find an agreement with the USSR than was Britain; as a continental power, it was more willing to make concessions and more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany. These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France while secretly considering propositions from Germany.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simulation}} heuristic is used {{to judge}} how likely certain outcomes {{are based on the}} ease with which one can imagine a particular ending. This heuristic can be used for many tasks, including prediction (Will the Jets win this football game?) and causality (Did Jim eat the last slice of pizza?). An application of this heuristic is to the case of near misses. Consider the following example from Kahneman & Tversky:Mr. Crane and Mr. Tees were scheduled to leave the airport on different flights, at the same time. They traveled from town in the same limousine, were caught in a traffic jam, and arrived at the airport thirty minutes after the scheduled departure time of their flights.Mr. Crane is told his flight left on time.Mr. Tees is told that his flight was delayed, and just left five minutes ago.Who is more upset?Mr. Crane or Mr. Tees?Almost everyone says, [...] "Mr. Tees", because they cannot imagine how Mr. Crane could have caught his flight, while Mr. Tees might have made it if not for that slow pedestrian, or the exceptionally long <b>security</b> <b>line.</b> The simulation heuristic has this ability to generate [...] "if only" [...] conditions, which can be used to understand the negative feelings of frustration, indignation, etc. that arise from near misses such as that of Mr. Tees.|$|E

Ou's intended destination was Bismarck, North Dakota but, after passing through the initial <b>security</b> <b>line</b> at the airport, he was flagged by custom agents for secondary screening and pulled aside. They questioned his purpose for traveling to the United States and when he last visited Iraq, a routine experience for him as a journalist reporting in dangerous regions. He explained that he was on assignment as a photographer to cover the pipeline protests at Standing Rock for the CBC and that he had not been to Iraq in more than a year. He was then detained in a room where he was asked to provide details of his trips to every country he had visited {{in the last five years}} and all extremist groups he had come in contact with. Officials then requested that he unlock his three encrypted cell phones to search for images of him [...] "posing with a dead body". After he refused to comply to protect his sources, they denied him entry into the United States, confiscated his phones and other materials, searched his checked baggage, and made photocopies of his reporter's notebook and personal diaries against his wishes. When his phones were returned to him, there was evidence of tampering with the SIM cards suggesting that copies of them may have been made. A border official later stated that his name matched a [...] "person of interest" [...] on an unspecified U.S. federal law enforcement watch list, however, no official reason was provided for his detention aside from it being [...] "classified". [...] Ou's travel rights into the United States have been revoked.|$|E
