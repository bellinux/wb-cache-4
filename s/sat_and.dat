He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (<b>SAT)</b> <b>and</b> enrolled at Harvard College {{in the autumn of}} 1973. He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses. While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Defence {{minister}} Rudolf Walden {{called a}} meeting held on 3 and 4 March 1943 to explore {{solutions to the}} acute shortage of vehicles. The meeting was attended by representatives {{of the government and}} military leadership, and key personnel from leading Finnish industrial companies. A committee was formed to propose founding a company in which <b>SAT</b> <b>and</b> the state were both involved. The proposal was presented in a meeting on 20 March. The name of the company was Oy Yhteissisu Ab ("mutual Sisu"), which meant the intention was joint production of Sisu vehicles. The private owners were A. Ahlström, Ata, Fiskars, Kone, Kymin Oy, Lokomo, W. Rosenlew & Co., Suomen Autoteollisuus, Suomen Gummitehdas, Suomen Kaapelitehdas, Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus, Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat and Strömberg. The headquarters was in Erottaja in Helsinki. The company chairman was Heikki H. Herlin and the reluctant Tor Nessling was appointed general manager.|$|E
5|$|Speculation about {{a merger}} between <b>SAT</b> <b>and</b> VAT began in Swedish {{newspapers}} in 1967 {{and was soon}} {{picked up by the}} Finnish media. The major owner, the state of Finland with its 45% share, suggested a merger to Nessling in December 1967. The financial situation of VAT was unsustainable; the whole year's turnover was 19.5 million new Finnish marks when the company had debts of 14.5 million; 100 old Finnish marks became 1 new mark in 1963. The contract for the merger of Suomen Autoteollisuus and Vanajan Autotehdas was signed on 30 May 1968. VAT was formally discontinued at the end of 1968. After the merger, the state owned 17.2% of the new SAT, becoming the third-largest shareholder of the company.|$|E

They held that title until April 22, 2006, when they dropped it to the S.A.T. After further appearances in 2006, which were all matches they lost, the Briscoe Brothers entered PWU's Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup on October 20. They advanced past the first round match, winning over the Krash Krew, but {{in the course of}} this match, Mark was injured when Jay inadvertently struck him in the mouth with the backswing of a chairshot. Mark was taken to the hospital after the match and subsequently lost a number of teeth and sustained damage to his gums as well.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland. VAT sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, rear-wheel driven vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all vehicles were continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The vehicles were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} rear-wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of the vehicles were clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for <b>SAT</b> <b>and</b> VAT.|$|E
5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by <b>SAT</b> <b>and</b> Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E

Georgetown accepts the <b>SAT</b> <b>and</b> ACT, though it does not consider the writing portion of either test. Over 55% of undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets 100% of demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $23,500 and about 70% of aid distributed in the form of grants or scholarships.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{could offer}} only petrol engines until 1953. The most common ones were the Hercules engines made {{domestically}} under licence by <b>SAT</b> <b>and</b> Tampella. The SAT-made engine {{was called the}} Sisu AMG or SA5, and the engine made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The second most common engine was the Cadillac V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX, which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe. Some Bedford petrol engines were used in Defence Forces lorries in the 1960s and Ford V8 engines were used for fire engines. The first diesel Vanajas were powered by Saurer and Kämper engines. The vast majority of diesel engines were supplied by Leyland and AEC. A few Vanajas were equipped with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader 510E. In some cases, the engine {{was provided by the}} customer; one Vanaja was powered by a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine.|$|E
