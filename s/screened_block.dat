40|$|Background A <b>screening</b> <b>block</b> {{followed}} by a confirmatory block using different anesthetic agent is a common method used to identify the zygapophysial joint (ZJ) as a tissue origin of LBP. While previous studies have identified potentially valuable clinical tests, identification of patients unlikely {{to respond to the}} initial <b>screening</b> <b>block</b> is desirable. Purpose To estimate the predictive power of specific clinical findings in relation to <b>screening</b> ZJ <b>blocks.</b> Study Design A prospective blinded study carried was out in a private radiology clinic specializing in the diagnosis of spinal pain. Patient sample Chronic LBP patients received <b>screening</b> ZJ <b>blocks</b> (N= 151) with 120 patients included in the analysis after exclusions. Outcome Measures Pre and post procedure pain intensity was measured using a standardized VAS. A 95 % reduction in pain following ZJ block was defined as a positive response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the process of sieve holes blocking. A series of tests and their results revealed a dependence describing the value of an average <b>screen</b> <b>blocking</b> coefficient as a function of two main factors affecting the process. These parameters are the toss indicator and the content of difficult-to-screen particles in the feed. The experiments presented in the paper showed that description in mathematical terms of the sieve holes blocking process is complex and difficult. A third degree polynomial function with two variables enables determination of the value of an average <b>screen</b> <b>blocking</b> coefficient in the processes of screening for specific arrangements: screen–particle–toss indicator–content of difficult-to-screen particles...|$|R

50|$|SameGame {{is played}} on a {{rectangular}} field, typically initially filled with four or five kinds of blocks placed at random. By selecting a group of adjoining blocks of the same color, a player may remove them from the <b>screen.</b> <b>Blocks</b> that are no longer supported will fall down, and a column without any blocks will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to one side (often the left).

"Pick and Roll" [...] is an {{offensive}} play {{in which a}} player stops to <b>screen</b> (<b>block)</b> a defender for the teammate handling the ball and then slips behind the defender to accept a pass as the handler makes a move towards the basket.

Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire when playing for the Phoenix Suns proved to be extremely effective at the pick and roll throughout the 2000s.

In basketball and field lacrosse, {{it is also}} known as a pick. Screens can be on-ball (when set for the ball-handler), or off-ball (when set for a teammate moving without the ball to get open for a pass).

30|$|In {{the process}} of well {{completion}} with mechanical screen to control sand, once the water content of the reservoir increased, the montmorillonite in clay minerals would swell which combined with formation sand has an obvious effect on the plugging of screen pipe in production string. According {{to the prediction of}} water production of reservoir, shale expansion instrument was used to establish the relationship between the different water content and swelling properties of montmorillonites and combined with the clogging test of screen under different water content to evaluate the blocking effect of montmorillonite under different water content on the clogging of screen in {{the process of}} sand control. It {{can be found in the}} experiment that: (1) If the reservoir products water, the expansion height of two kinds of montmorillonites is similar when the water content of oil is less than 10 % or more than 20 %, the expansion height of montmorillonites is large of which expansion rate can reach to 188 % when the water content is between 10 and 20 %. (2) Through the simulation experiment of sand control, when the water content is 10 and 30 %, the <b>screen</b> <b>blocking</b> is the fastest, and the productivity index per meter is the lowest, the blockage rate is increased by nearly three times when the water content of oil is 0. (3) The influence of concentration ratio of oil and water on the productivity index per meter of metal mesh screen is larger than the swelling of montmorillonites which is mainly reflected in the water content is close to 20 – 30 %. The degree and speed of <b>screen</b> <b>blocking</b> can be reduced by reducing the water content of produced fluid.|$|R
