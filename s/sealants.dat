40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the penetration and adaptation of two different <b>sealant</b> materials applied under different conditions of contamination using scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Materials and Methods: A total of 56 extracted human third molar teeth were randomly assigned into eight equal groups. The treatment groups were defined by the combination of two <b>sealant</b> materials (glass ionomer fissure <b>sealant</b> "Fuji Triage" or resin-based fissure <b>sealant</b> "Clinpro TM") and four surface conditions (dry condition, water contamination, saliva contamination or saliva contamination and air-drying). Penetration depth, <b>sealant</b> adaptation and fissure types were evaluated under SEM after sectioning the teeth. Tukey′s test and multiple linear regression analyses were used for statistical analysis. Results: No significant difference in the <b>sealant</b> penetration and adaptation was found between both materials under dry conditions. However, under wet contaminations, resin-based <b>sealant</b> showed less adaptation and penetration with a significant difference when compared to glass ionomer <b>sealant</b> (P < 0. 05). The multiple linear regression analyses revealed significant impact of different materials and types of contamination on the <b>sealant</b> penetration and adaptation. Conclusion: Glass ionomer <b>sealant</b> has better fissure penetration and more intimate adaptation than resin-based <b>sealant</b> under wet contamination conditions...|$|R
40|$|Oral bacteria, {{including}} Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, {{contribute to}} tooth decay and plaque formation; therefore, {{it is essential}} to develop strategies to prevent dental caries and plaque forma-tion. We recently showed that organo-selenium com-pounds covalently attached to different biomaterials inhibited bacterial biofilms. Our current study investi-gates the efficacy of an organo-selenium dental <b>sealant</b> (SeLECT-DefenseTM <b>sealant)</b> in inhibiting S. mutans and S. salivarius biofilm formation in vitro. The organo-selenium was synthesized and covalently attached to dental <b>sealant</b> material via standard poly-mer chemistry. By colony-forming unit (CFU) assay and confocal microscopy, SeLECT-DefenseTM <b>sealant</b> was found to completely inhibit the development of S. mutans and S. salivarius biofilms. To assess the durability of the anti-biofilm effect, we soaked the SeLECT-DefenseTM <b>sealant</b> in PBS for 2 mos at 37 °C and found that the biofilm-inhibitory effect was not diminished after soaking. To determine if organo-selenium inhibits bacterial growth under the <b>sealant,</b> we placed SeLECT-Defense <b>sealant</b> over a lawn of S. mutans. In contrast to a control <b>sealant,</b> SeLECT-DefenseTM <b>sealant</b> completely inhibited the growth of S. mutans. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of SeLECT-DefenseTM <b>sealant</b> against S. mutans and S. salivarius biofilms is very effective and durable.

5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly <b>sealants,</b> carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets.

25|$|<b>Sealants</b> are an {{alternative}} to solder where additional strength is not required. In most cases, <b>sealants</b> should not be necessary with a properly designed copper installation.

Regardless, sealant-filled joints have been used successfully as a secondary waterproofing measure for standing seam and batten seam roofing applications where low-sloped roofs are less than three inches per foot. <b>Sealants</b> {{can also be used}} in joints that are primarily designed to accommodate thermal movement of the copper.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of dental}} <b>sealants</b> {{is a means}} of prevention. A sealant is a thin plastic-like coating applied to the chewing {{surfaces}} of the molars to prevent food from being trapped inside pits and fissures. This deprives resident plaque bacteria of carbohydrate, preventing the formation of pit and fissure caries. <b>Sealants</b> are usually applied on the teeth of children, as soon as the teeth erupt but adults are receiving them if not previously performed. <b>Sealants</b> can wear out and fail to prevent access of food and plaque bacteria inside pits and fissures and need to be replaced so they must be checked regularly by dental professionals.|$|E

MethodsA total of 46 patients underwent immediate breast reconstruction utilizing a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous island flap.

40|$|Introduction: Contamination of etched {{enamel to}} saliva before {{placement}} of <b>sealant</b> prevents the appropriate bonding {{and results in}} microleakage. Using bondings is effective for decreasing the microleakage. This experimental study aimed to evaluate the effect of bonding agent on microleakage of a fissure <b>sealant</b> before or after contamination to saliva. Methods: In this experimental study 40 sound premolar teeth were randomly divided into four groups. The prophylaxis was done and the teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid gel, then they were washed and dried. In the first group, Seal-Rite fissure <b>sealant</b> and Dentastic (Pulpdent, USA) without saliva contamination, {{and in the second}} group <b>sealant</b> with bonding agent after saliva contamination for 10 s, were applied and cured for 40 s. In the third group, fissure <b>sealant</b> without bonding agent or saliva contamination, and in the fourth group fissure <b>sealant</b> without bonding application was applied after contamination with saliva and then was cured. After thermocycling, the teeth were placed in 50 % silver nitrate for 2 hours. The buccolingual sections were applied and microleakage evaluation was made by stereomicroscope at 4 X magnifications and results were evaluated with mann-whiteny test. Results: The fissure <b>sealant</b> group without bonding agent showed the most microleakage after contamination to saliva and use of <b>sealant</b> with bonding agent significantly showed decrease of microleakage.
