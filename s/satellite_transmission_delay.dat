40|$|A {{method for}} realizing a circuit and packet {{integrated}} access scheme in a satellite communication channel is considered. Two kinds of terminals are assumed, namely, bursty terminals for handling bursty traffic and heavily loaded terminals for long-holdingtime message traffic. In this method, the channel frame {{is divided into}} two subframes: one is for bursty terminals, and the other is for heavily loaded terminals. The subframe for heavily loaded terminals is further divided into two subchannels, a reservation subchannel (consisting of small slots) and a message subchannel. The bursty terminals transmit their packets in their dedicated subframes on the slotted ALOHA protocol. The heavily loaded terminal having a message transmits, first of all, a reservation packet in a randomly selected small slot of the reservation subchannel to reserve slots in the coming message subchannels. One slot in the same position of each of the succeeding message subchannels is reserved for the terminal until the end-of-use flag, transmitted from the terminal, is received by the <b>satellite.</b> Mean <b>transmission</b> <b>delays</b> for both kinds of traffic in this method are analytically obtained. We show that there exists an optimal frame length which minimizes mean <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> for one kind of traffic while keeping mean <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> for the other kind under some permissible value...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} interaction between speech codec output quality and simulated <b>satellite</b> or VoIP <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> time on talker performance in a complex interaction. A hardware test codec (both single and tandem) was compared against a number of processed speech reference conditions to determine the relative subjective quality of the test codecs against conditions with known Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). The two codec conditions plus an additional higher quality condition were then used in an experiment that examined {{the effect of the}} interaction of transmitted speech quality and simulated <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> on a speech shadowing task and an accompanying error repair task involving two speakers. One person (the “reader”) read a passage. The second person (the “shadower”) shadowed the read passage by repeating immediately the words spoken by the reader. The reader, whilst reading, also listened for errors spoken by the shadower and repaired those errors by verbally reporting them to the shadower. A significant interaction between codec quality and <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> was found for the error repair task, but only for cases where the shadower made a significant number of errors. These results suggest that, for highly complex interactions which involve significant cognitive load, human performance will degrade more rapidly with increases in <b>delay</b> for <b>transmission</b> systems using speech codecs with lower quality output. This is assumed to be due to the additional demands upon working memory imposed by the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay.</b> 22 page(s...|$|R

In {{order to meet}} the quality of service requirements of real-time transmissions, {{there is a need to}} reduce the average <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> while ensuring a bigger throughput especially under the high network load. The MAC <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> is defined as the total duration that a packet is successfully transmitted by the MAC access layer or discarded after reaching the maximum number of retransmission times. The MAC <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> is impacted by several factors, including the MAC layer random access delay which is impacted by backoff and collisions, the actual packet <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> determined by the packet size and the channel capacity, and the delay caused by channel errors and the resulting retransmissions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{stability}} {{and performance of}} a networked control system (NCS) strongly depends on the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay.</b> However, the randomness of the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> is an intrinsic property in the network communication, e. g. Ethernet. Aiming at NCS with random <b>transmission</b> <b>delay,</b> a novel control approach is proposed. The <b>transmission</b> <b>delays</b> from sensorto-controller (SC) and controller-to-actuator (CA) are modelled by two independent Markovian processes. A controller, which is able to monitor the SC delay and synchronously switches according to it, is considered. The resulting closed-loop system is a Markovian jump linear system with randomly piecewise continuous delay. The exponential mean square stability for the given model is established by using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The performance benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated in a numerical example. 1...|$|R

40|$|A set {{of tools}} {{that allows us to}} measure and examine the effects of <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> and errors on the {{performance}} of TP- 4 implementations has been developed. The tools give insight into both the large- and small-scale behaviors of an implementation. These tools have been systematically applied to a commercial implementation of TP- 4. Measurements show, among other things, that a 2 -second one-way <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> and an effective bit-error rate of 1 error per 100, 000 bits can result in a 95 percent reduction in TP- 4 throughput. The detailed statistics give insight into why <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> and errors affect this implementations so significantly and support a number of 'lessons learned' that could be applied to TP- 4 implementations that operate more robustly across networks with long <b>transmission</b> <b>delays</b> and <b>transmission</b> errors...|$|R

30|$|From Figure  4, we {{can obtain}} {{that with the}} {{increase}} of the number of nodes, the corresponding message <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> will reduce, and the delay will no longer continue to reduce when the number of nodes is more than a certain value. When the number of nodes in the network is more than 60, the message <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> of Epidemic algorithm will increase instead. And for several other algorithms, the message <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> will remain unchanged. The delay value of DTSNS algorithm proposed in this paper remains unchanged all the time, because of the control of the number of copies of message. For DTSNS algorithm, {{with the increase of}} the number of nodes in the network, the number of copies of message is not to continue to increase. As a result, this algorithm has higher message delivery rate and lower message <b>transmission</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|R

Based on these measurements, the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> on an 802.11 link is modeled {{as a function of}} the MAC overhead time, packet size, and the effective transmission rate, as in [19] and in alignment with [23, 24].|$|R
30|$|From {{the results}} of the graph, {{it can be seen that}} the method of {{non-mandatory}} priority queueing system is adopted, although the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> of data packets with lower priority is increased, the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> of the highest priority packet is effectively reduced, which improves the timeliness of packet transmission with higher priority. In this way, the queuing delay of the data packet is allocated to data packets with different priority levels, which makes WK[*]<[*]WK[*]−[*] 1 [*]<[*][*]…[*][*]<[*]W 0, while in general λ 0 [*]>[*][*]>[*]λK, that is, the number of data packets with high priority is small. Therefore, on average, the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> of data packets with high priority is reduced a lot, while on average the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> of each data packet with low priority level is not much increased, which is a good way to reduce the delay. Therefore, the routing protocol can effectively reduce the <b>transmission</b> <b>delay</b> of high priority packets in the case of ensuring the network lifetime. On the basis of the existing hardware conditions, five communication technologies of the above eight modules are tested on the number of packets sent successfully through the instant uplink and downlink of the train at high speed.|$|R
