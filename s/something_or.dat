5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for <b>something</b> <b>or</b> someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E

25|$|To further complicate matters, it {{has been}} noted that Gene Roddenberry was {{something}} of a revisionist when it came to canon. People who worked with Roddenberry remember that he used to handle canon not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind on <b>something,</b> <b>or</b> if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point non-canon.|$|E

25|$|Dabney Hovse is the {{smallest}} of Caltech's Houses. Residents of Dabney House {{are referred to as}} Darbs, a combination of the name of the House with a 1920s slang term darb, meaning <b>something</b> <b>or</b> someone very handsome, valuable, attractive, or otherwise excellent. Joseph B. Dabney, owner of the Dabney Oil Syndicate, was a trustee of California Institute of Technology. Dabney Hall of the Humanities, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Dabney, is one of the four corner buildings of Caltech's central courtyard. It was built in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Consciousness in mammals (this {{includes}} humans) is {{an aspect}} of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as subjectivity, sentience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. It is a subject of much research in philosophy of mind, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain. Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as qualia. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness of <b>something</b> <b>or</b> about something, a property known as intentionality in philosophy of mind.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear. The idea that <b>something,</b> <b>or</b> someone, might be destroying intelligent life in the universe has been explored in the scientific literature. A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would {{be an act of}} prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator, as are humans.|$|E

25|$|Grief is {{a natural}} {{response}} to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when <b>something</b> <b>or</b> someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve {{in connection with a}} variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person’s social interactions.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{experiments}} conducted {{in order to}} test how early speakers gain the ability to judge grammaticality in their native language. In an experiment by Cairns et al., preschool children aged 4–6 were presented sentences such as (15) and (16) orally. (To make sure that the meaning of the sentences was clear to the children, sentences were enacted with toys.) While sentence (15) is well-formed in the adult grammar, sentence (16) is not, as indicated by the asterisk (*). The source of the ill-formedness is that the verb hug is a transitive verb and so must have a direct object, namely <b>something</b> <b>or</b> someone who receives the action of the verb. Sentence (16) is missing the receiver of hug.|$|E
25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when <b>something</b> <b>or</b> someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself {{with the prospect of}} uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling to admit to himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the other boy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Chronic and {{sporadic}} parties make it so. There are {{few days}} without that <b>or</b> <b>something</b> else. Cricket <b>or</b> the band at the barracks." ...|$|R
25|$|Moreton, however, is not unconcerned of the {{situation}} of the decent poor people and vagrants, so he suggests that barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends of the town, where all vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour, where they should have clean straw allowed them, and be kept orderly and out of harm's way; they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood, otherwise they should be sent to the workhouse of their respective parish, or to a general workhouse, of which there is great need; and of which more hereafter. This proposition can be valued as an hint of the eighteenth-century ambivalent frame of mind towards these individuals. On one hand restrictions and penalties were vigorously demanded by the English society. On the other hand, not only some kinds of begging activities were allowed but, common people strongly felt a social and religious obligation to give <b>something</b> <b>or</b> to answer a plea.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss <b>something,</b> <b>or</b> account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E
25|$|Although {{promises}} {{are made}} to be kept, parties to an agreement are generally free to determine how a contract is terminated, can be terminated and remedial consequences for breach of contract, just as they can generally determine a contract's content. The courts have fashioned only residual limits on the parties' autonomy to determine how a contract terminates. The courts' default, or standard rules, which are generally alterable, are first that a contract is automatically concluded if it becomes impossible for one party to perform. Second, if one party breaches {{her side of the}} bargain in a serious way, the other party may cease his own performance. If a breach is not serious, the innocent party must continue his own obligations but may claim a remedy in court for the defective or imprecise performance he has received. Third, the principle remedy for breach of contract is compensatory damages, limited to losses that one might reasonably expect to result from a breach. This means a sum of money to put the claimant in mostly the same position as if the contract breaker had performed her obligations. In a small number of contract cases, closely analogous to property or trust obligations, a court may order restitution by the contract breaker so that any gains she has made by breaking the agreement will be stripped and given to the innocent party. Additionally where a contract's substance is for something so unique that damages would be an inadequate remedy courts may use their discretion to grant an injunction against the contract breaker doing <b>something</b> <b>or,</b> unless it is a personal service, positively order specific performance of the contract terms.|$|E
