25|$|Pseudo-Apollodorus records an archaic legend, {{which claims}} that Hephaestus once {{attempted}} to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, {{causing him to}} ejaculate on her thigh. Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool, which <b>she</b> <b>tossed</b> into the dust, impregnating Gaia and causing her {{to give birth to}} Erichthonius, whom Athena adopted as her own child. The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since {{he was the one who}} had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.|$|E

500|$|The singer {{then headed}} to Chicago, Illinois {{to perform a}} free outdoor concert on July 27, 2003, held at the Hutchinson Field in the south-side of Grant Park.

NBC executives sought Twain for the special because they believed her lengthy career and crossover history would translate into more viewers. She accepted the offer, and the show was directed and produced by Beth McCarthy-Miller. Prior to performing at Grant Park, Twain spent a week in Chicago to film behind-the-scenes footage {{that would be used}} for the television special.
