40|$|As someone {{fascinated by}} the {{diversity}} and eclecticism of higher education pedagogy, this paper offers a reflection {{on some of the}} various approaches adopted to higher education pedagogy in tertiary colleges and universities globally. Working as a consultant in between six and ten nations annually {{for more than two decades}} has caused me to ponder these divergences, and here I seek to consider some of them, and illuminate practices both for staff working outside their home nations and for those teaching international students. Diverse approaches to the language of teaching It is famously said that America and England are two nations divided by a single language and that is certainly the case in terms of the terminology of higher education teaching among Anglophone nations. ‘Faculty ’ in the US means teaching staff, while in the UK it is a term describing organisational systems. The term ‘Administrators ’ refers largely to <b>secretarial</b> <b>and</b> <b>clerical</b> <b>staff</b> in Ireland and the UK, but implies the senior staff running universities in the US. Anyone (like me) inviting an American expert on ‘Classroom Assessment ’ to speak at a U...|$|E
