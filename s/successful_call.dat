5|$|Titanfall is a {{multiplayer}} first-person shooter {{video game}} developed by Respawn Entertainment {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One on March 11, 2014; an Xbox 360 version ported by Bluepoint Games was released April 8, 2014. The game was highly anticipated as the debut title from developers formerly behind the <b>successful</b> <b>Call</b> of Duty franchise.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so {{they can}} sneak {{him out of the}} house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a <b>successful</b> <b>call</b> home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael {{searches}} for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.|$|E
25|$|By 1880, {{the company}} was in serious {{financial}} difficulties. The Russian debts were never paid, and a dubious method was used to write off the loss made on the marine engines. Despite a <b>successful</b> <b>call</b> to shareholders for more money, the company chose voluntary liquidation as the best option in July 1880. Liquidators ran the business {{for three and a}} half years, during which time turnover increased and profits of £9,419 were made. In September 1883, the second Yorkshire Engine Company was launched, by issuing 2,400 shares valued at £25, giving a capital of £60,000. Few locomotive manufacturers were profitable at the time.|$|E

50|$|Where the {{existing}} busy-hour carried traffic, Ec, is measured on an already-overloaded system, {{with a significant}} level of blocking, {{it is necessary to}} take account of the blocked calls in estimating the busy-hour offered traffic Eo (which is the traffic value {{to be used in the}} Erlang formula). The offered traffic can be estimated by Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb). For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting blocked <b>calls</b> and <b>successful</b> <b>calls,</b> Pb can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked. Failing that, Pb can be estimated by using Ec in place of Eo in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of Pb can then be used in Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb) to estimate Eo. Another method of estimating Eo in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, λ (counting <b>successful</b> <b>calls</b> and blocked calls), and the average call-holding time (for <b>successful</b> <b>calls),</b> h, and then estimate Eo using the formula E = λh.|$|R

30|$|Nonadaptive Case (NA). This case {{presents}} high blocking {{and dropping}} probabilities leading to less active calls, as expected, since no adaptation is possible.

Obviously, here the percentage of nodes participating on the adaptation has no influence.|$|R
