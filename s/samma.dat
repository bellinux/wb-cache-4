In 1520, in the hopes of establishing a new power base, he invaded Sindh, where the <b>Samma</b> dynasty was struggling under Jam Feroz. Shah Beg defeated Jam Feroz's army and proceeded to sack Thatta. The two sides agreed to a peace, where Shah Beg gained the upper half of Sindh (Thatta) while the Sammas retained the lower half (Bukkur). Jam Feroz almost immediately broke this agreement, but was defeated by Shah Beg and forced to flee to Gujarat. This marked the end of <b>Samma</b> rule in Sindh, as Shah Beg gained control of the whole region.|$|E

40|$|Purpose : This {{study is}} carried out to analyze the {{relation}} of weight raise and hemoglobin level during pregnancy of pregnant adolescents to their nutriational attitudes. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study carried out {{to examine the relationship}} between nutrition habits vs weight and level of hemoglobin in the 49 pregnant adolescents participants (≤ 18 years of age) who had applied to pregnant and emergency services in <b>Sammas</b> Vehbi Ekecik Gynecology and Children’s Hospital in the city of Aksaray, Turkey, between February 15 and March 25 2004, and accepted to participate in this study. General information regarding the pregnant adolescents, their knowledge on nutrition and nutritional habits were filled in during face-to-face interviews. These pregnant adolescents were monitored during the months of April, May, June and July and their measurements were taken. Data of the study were analyzed in a computer. Results: When the nutritional knowledge scores of the pregnant adolescents are considered, it was seen that 30 (61. 2 %) had a good knowledge level, 10 (20. 4 %) had a knowledge of intermediary level, and 9 (18. 3 %) had a low or insufficient level of knowledge. As for the nutrition habit scores, 28 of pregnant adolescents (57. 1 %) had fine, and 21 of them (42. 7 %) had poor and inadequate levels of nutrition habits. Conclusion: When the relation between the hemoglobin levels measured of the pregnant adolescents’ according to the their nutrition knowledge scores and the distribution of their habits was analysed, it was not found meaningful (p > 0. 05). </p...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Sammas,</b> a Rajput tribes, {{which was}} ruling Kutch, {{gained control of}} Thatta in the {{southern}} Sindh from the Soomras around 1351, and expanded their territory northward to Bhakkar and beyond. Around that time, the Khudabadi Sonara Community started returning to their home towns (Bhambore, Tando & Nayrun Kot etc.), {{and some of them}} settled on a [...] "empty land" [...] on the banks of Sindhu River near Dadu, in Sindh. Members of Khudabadi Sonara Community developed the empty land and called it [...] "Khud-Abad" [...] Later, due to Muslim domination, the Khud-Abad was renamed as Khudabad, a Muslim name. Families of Bhambrai Bradri (the ancestors of Purswani Family) returned to their home town Bhambore around 1400 AD. They are called Bhambrai Bradri because they lived in Bhambore for many centuries (before migration to Lakhpat around 1200 AD and after returning from Lakhpat). Bhambore was later abandoned due to a change in the river's course. Evidence of earthquakes and regional invaders is also cited as an explanation for the population's movement away from the area and the crumbling of the castle. The former river delta is now a creek. And later, they shifted to Khudabad around 1700 AD. They changed their business from cloth merchants to jewelry and goldsmith business while living in Khudabad. Khudabadi Sonara invented Khudabadi Script for Sindhi Language around 1750 AD while living in Khudabad. It is called Khudabadi Script because it was invented in Khudabad. It was later known as Vaniki, Hatvaniki and Hatkai. Mian Noor Mohammad Kalhoro, who became the ruler of Sindh (1720-1755), then, chose Khudabad as his capital. The Khudabad was capital of Sindh between 1720 and 1783.|$|R
2500|$|Several Islamic kingdoms (sultanates) {{under both}} foreign and, newly converted, Rajput rulers were {{established}} across the Northwestern subcontinent (Afghanistan and Pakistan) {{over a period}} of a few centuries. From the 10th century, Sindh was ruled by the Rajput Soomra dynasty, and later, in the mid-13th century by the Rajput <b>Samma</b> dynasty. Additionally, Muslim trading communities flourished throughout coastal south India, particularly on the western coast where Muslim traders arrived in small numbers, mainly from the Arabian peninsula. This marked the introduction of a third Abrahamic Middle Eastern religion, following Judaism and Christianity, often in puritanical form.

2500|$|Sarambha can be {{translated}} as [...] "accompanied by violence". As the mind filled with lobha, dosa and moha (lust, hatred and delusion) is led to actions which are akusala. Indulging in violence {{is a form of}} self-harming. The rejection of violence in society is recognized in Buddhism as a prerequisite for the spiritual progress of society's members, because violence brings pain to beings with similar feelings to oneself. The Buddha is quoted in the Dhammapada as saying, [...] "All are afraid of the stick, all hold their lives dear. Putting oneself in another's place, one should not beat or kill others". Metta (loving kindness), the development of mindstates of limitless good-will for all beings, and karuna, compassion that arises when you see someone suffering of the human being, are attitudes said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beings (sattesu <b>samma</b> patipatti). The Sutta Nipata says [...] "'As I am, so are these. As are these, so am I.' Drawing the parallel to yourself, neither kill nor get others to kill." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century the Kutch chief did not have good relationship with the Arghun dynasty , the overthrowers of the Thatta <b>Sammas.</b> According to the Sindh historians on one occasion, about 1530, Shah Husain (1522 -1544) entered Kutch, and inflicted on the Rao a severe defeat. At this time the representatives of the three branches of the Jadeja family were Jam Dadarji, Jam Hamirji, and Jam Raval. Of these Jam Hamirji and Jam Raval were neighbours and rivals, and in 1537, Raval, by a solemn promise of friendship drawing Hamirji into his power, killed him. At the time of Jam Hamirji's death, Aliyaji, the eldest of his four sons, was on a visit to his sister, the wife of Mahmud Begada, the king of Ahmedabad and Gujarat Sultanate; and Khengarji the second son, was on a visit at Virawah in Parkar. The two youngest sons, Sahebji and Rayabji, were secretly carried off to Rapar in Vagad region; and Khengarji I, returning from Parkar, took them with him to Ahmedabad, where they were joined by a number of their family and followers. At an Ahmedabad hunting party, Khengar, though only a boy of fourteen, slew a tiger with his sword. Pleased with the boy's courage Begada promised to grant him any thing he might ask. Khengarji I asked the fiefdom of Morbi on the Rann in 1538 and Khengarji I was ennobled with the title of Rao. He also received military from Begada. From Morbi, Khengarji I kept constantly attacking the villages of Jam Dadarji, who was then on friendly terms with Jam Rawal. He also tried to get permission to settle in Rapar, and after an unsuccessful attempt, succeeded. He next, by the help of his relation the Hothi chief, tempted the Rapar chief out of his fort, and slaying both him and his sons took his possessions. After a fourteen years struggle, Khengarji I in 1548 drove Jam Rawal, his father's murderer, out of Kutch, and, acting with kindness to the chiefs, induced them to stay on their estates and established himself as ruler of Kutch. Jam Raval who ruled Kutch for two decades fled to Kathiawar, founded the town of Nawanagar State, and became independent. Settled as ruler of Kutch, Khengar determined to make Bhuj, a city established by his father Rao Hamirji in 1510, his capital. The country round had long been a haunt of robbers and marauders. After much difficulty they were driven out, and, his dependents agreeing to settle there, Khengarji I's capital was established. He is considered the founder of Cutch State who ruled from 1548 to 1585. Khengarji I also founded the port city of Mandvi.|$|R
