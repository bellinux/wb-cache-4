Such knowledge is frequently gathered from studies relating abundance data to a set of influential variables in a regression setup. In particular, generalised linear models are used to analyse binary presence/absence data or counts of a certain species at locations within an observation area. However, one of the key assumptions of generalised linear models, the independence of the observations is often violated in practice since the points at which the observations are collected are <b>spatially</b> <b>aligned.</b> While several approaches have been developed to analyse and account for spatial correlation in regression models with normally distributed responses, far less work has been done in the context of generalised linear models.

We propose a weakly-supervised, label-driven formulation for learning 3 D voxel correspondence from higher-level label correspondence, thereby bypassing classical intensity-based image similarity measures. During training, a {{convolutional neural network}} is optimised by outputting a dense displacement field (DDF) that warps a set of available anatomical labels from the moving image to match their corresponding counterparts in the fixed image. These label pairs, including solid organs, ducts, vessels, point landmarks and other ad hoc structures, are only required at training time and can be <b>spatially</b> <b>aligned</b> by minimising a cross-entropy function of the warped moving label and the fixed label. During inference, the trained network takes a new image pair to predict an optimal DDF, resulting in a fully-automatic, label-free, real-time and deformable registration.

40|$|Abstract—A new framework, termed <b>spatially</b> <b>aligned</b> pyramid matching, is {{proposed}} for near duplicate image identification. The proposed method robustly handles spatial shifts {{as well as}} scale changes, and is extensible for video data. Images are divided into both overlapped and non-overlapped blocks over multiple levels. In the first matching stage, pairwise distances between blocks from the examined image pair are computed using earth mover’s distance (EMD) or the visual word with χ 2 distance based method with scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features. In the second stage, multiple alignment hypotheses that consider piecewise spatial shifts and scale variation are postulated and resolved using integer-flow EMD. Moreover, to compute the distances between two videos, we conduct the third step matching (i. e., temporal matching) after spatial matching. Two application scenarios are addressed—near duplicate retrieval (NDR) and near duplicate detection (NDD). For retrieval ranking, a pyramid-based scheme is constructed to fuse matching results from different partition levels. For NDD, we also propose a dual-sample approach by using the multilevel distances as features and support vector machine for binary classification. The proposed methods are shown to clearly outperform existing methods through extensive testing on the Columbia Near Duplicate Image Database and two new datasets.
