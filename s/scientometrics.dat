25|$|Leydesdorff's {{research}} interests {{are in the}} fields of the philosophy of science, social network analysis, <b>scientometrics,</b> and the sociology of innovation. His studies in communication in science, technology, and innovation enabled him to specify theory and methods for understanding the dynamics of knowledge-based development.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} of {{communications}} research and informetrics, the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications. <b>Scientometrics</b> and bibliometrics are areas of research in which discrete data are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as sociolinguistics. Social complexity is also a concept used in semiotics.|$|E
25|$|Leydesdorff {{is on the}} {{editorial}} boards of several journals since 1987. He further worked for the Enterprise and Innovation Management Studies journal 1999-2001, for Science, Technology and Society in 2001-02 and for the Journal of the International Society for <b>Scientometrics</b> and Informetrics from 1995 to 1998. As contributing editor he also worked for Science, Technology & Human Values 1988-1990 and for Science & Technology Studies 1987-1988.|$|E
25|$|He {{received}} the Derek de Solla Price Award for <b>scientometrics</b> in 2003. Since 2006 {{he has been}} Honorary Research Fellow at the Virtual Knowledge Studio of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. And since 2007 Honorary Fellow of SPRU – Science and Technology Policy Research of the University of Sussex. Currently he {{is president of the}} Dutch Systems Group society, the society that cofounded the International Federation for Systems Research in the begin of the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The University Ranking by Academic Performance, {{abbreviated}} as URAP, {{was developed}} in the Informatics Institute of Middle East Technical University. Since 2010, it has been publishing annual national and global college and university rankings for top 2000 institutions. The <b>scientometrics</b> measurement of URAP is based on data obtained from the Institute for Scientific Information via Web of Science and inCites. For global rankings, URAP employs indicators of research performance including the number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. In addition to global rankings, URAP publishes regional rankings for universities in Turkey using additional indicators such as the number of students and faculty members obtained from Center of Measuring, Selection and Placement ÖSYM.|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>scientometrics</b> {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} work of Derek J. de Solla Price and Eugene Garfield. The latter created the Science Citation Index and founded the Institute for Scientific Information which is heavily used for scientometric analysis. A {{dedicated}} academic journal, <b>Scientometrics,</b> was established in 1978. The industrialization of science increased the quantity of publications and research outcomes and the rise of the computers allowed effective analysis of this data. While the sociology of science focused on the behavior of scientists, <b>scientometrics</b> focused on the analysis of publications. Accordingly, <b>scientometrics</b> is also referred to as the scientific and empirical study of science and its outcomes.|$|E
