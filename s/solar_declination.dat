40|$|The leaf {{inclination}} angle distribution (LAD) {{is an important}} characteristic of vegetation canopy structure affecting light interception within the canopy. However, LADs are difficult and time consuming to measure. To examine possible global patterns of LAD and their implications in remote sensing, a model was developed to predict leaf angles within canopies. Canopies were simulated using the SAIL radiative transfer model combined with a simple photosynthesis model. This model calculated leaf {{inclination angle}}s for horizontal layers of leaves within the canopy by choosing the leaf inclination angle that maximized production over a day in each layer. LADs were calculated for five latitude bands for spring and summer <b>solar</b> <b>declinations.</b> Three distinct LAD types emerged: tropical, boreal, and an intermediate temperate distribution. In tropical LAD, the upper layers have a leaf angle around 35 with the lower layers having horizontal inclination angles. While the boreal LAD has vertical leaf inclination angles throughout the canopy. The latitude bands where each LAD type occurred changed with the seasons. The different LADs affected the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with similar relationships between fAPAR and leaf area index (LAI), but different relationships between NDVI and LAI for the different LAD types. These differences resulted in significantly different relationships between NDVI and fAPAR for each LAD type. Since leaf inclination angles affect light interception, variations in LAD also affect the estimation of leaf area based on transmittance of light or lidar returns...|$|R

50|$|The {{ephemeris}} is a {{table of}} the calculated positions of astronomical objects and various other data, usually for a specific time of the day, either noon or midnight. A uniform time measurement is needed to establish accuracy, and ephemerides will use variously Greenwich Mean Time, Universal Time or Ephemeris Time. Historically, the ephemeris was used for astrology and dates back to ancient Babylon. However, ephemerides became highly useful to navigators and astronomers, and were officially recognised by governments from about the early modern period. The first national astronomical ephemeris, Connaissance de Temps, was published in France in 1679. In 1767 came the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris, which is issued annually by the British Royal Observatory at Greenwich. There are different types of ephemerides, and a distinction {{needs to be made}} between those used for astronomy and those for astrology. In the former case, values based on right ascension and declination are obtained. Right ascension is longitude, measured eastwards, on the celestial equator - the earth’s equator projected into space to encircle the <b>solar</b> system. <b>Declination</b> is the other co-ordinate, measured north to south, on this hypothetical, great sphere.|$|R
40|$|Equatorial Spread F (ESF) is {{a manifestation}} of ionospheric {{interchange}} instabilities in the nighttime equatorial F region. These instabilities generate plasma density irregularities with scale sizes ranging from centimetres to thousands of kilometres. The irregularities can be detected {{from a variety of}} instruments such as digisonde, coherent and incoherent scatter radars, in situ space probes, and airglow photometers. In the present study, occurrence statistics of the ESF, based on various parameters are presented using data obtained from the VHF radars located at three longitudinally separated equatorial stations: Christmas Island (2 ° N, 202. 6 ° E, 2. 9 ° N dip latitude), São Luís (2. 59 ° S, 315. 8 ° E, 0. 5 ° S dip latitude) and Jicamarca (12 ° S, 283. 1 ° E, 0. 6 ° N dip latitude). The ESF parameters presented here are the onset altitude, onset time (onset refers to first appearance of signal in the radar field of view) of the bottom-type and plume, and the peak altitude of the plume. Recent studies have used these parameters to classify the spread F occurrence characteristics. The present study reveals novel features namely, the dependence of ESF parameters on the seasonal, <b>solar</b> flux, <b>declination</b> angle and longitudinal dependence from the three radar sites. In addition, we also present an empirical model to determine the nature of these ESF parameters {{as a function of the}} solar flux which may enable us to forecast (with 30 min to 1 h tolerance) the plume occurrence at any longitude located in between São Luís and Christmas Island...|$|R

This paper illustrates a new application of NNs {{in developing a}} global model of the ionospheric propagation factor M(3000) F 2. NNs were trained with daily hourly values of M(3000) F 2 from various ionospheric stations spanning the period 1964 – 1986 with the following temporal and spatial input parameters: Universal Time, geographic latitude, magnetic inclination, magnetic <b>declination,</b> <b>solar</b> zenith angle, day of the year, A 16 index (a 2 -day running mean of the 3 -h planetary magnetic ap index), R 2 index (a 2 -month running mean of sunspot number), and the angle of meridian relative to the subsolar point. The performance of the NNs was verified by comparing the predicted values of M(3000) F 2 with observed values from a few selected ionospheric stations and the IRI (International Reference Ionosphere) model (CCIR M(3000) F 2 model) predicted values. The results obtained compared favourably with the IRI model. Based on the error differences, the result obtained justifies {{the potential of the}} NN technique for the predictions of M(3000) F 2 values on a global scale. ...|$|R

The observation of the Sun instead of Polaris enabled the measurement of latitude in the Southern hemisphere but required the use of <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> tables. One of the most famous tables, but certainly not the first one, was published in 1496 by the Castilian Jew Abraham Zacut, then exiled in Portugal.|$|E
50|$|The real Earth's orbit is elliptical. The Earth moves {{more rapidly}} around the Sun near perihelion, in early January, than near aphelion, in early July. This makes {{processes}} like the {{variation of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> happen faster in January than July. On the graph, this makes the minima more acute than the maxima. Also, since perihelion and aphelion do not happen on exactly the same dates as the solstices, the maxima and minima are slightly asymmetrical. The rates of change before and after are not quite equal.|$|E
50|$|The {{declination}} of the Sun, δ☉, is {{the angle}} between {{the rays of}} the Sun and {{the plane of the}} Earth's equator. The Earth's axial tilt (called the obliquity of the ecliptic by astronomers) is the angle between the Earth's axis and a line perpendicular to the Earth's orbit. The Earth's axial tilt changes slowly over thousands of years but its current value of about ε = 23°26' is nearly constant, so the change in <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> during one year is nearly the same as during the next year.|$|E
50|$|The solar noon {{shadows of}} objects on points beyond and below subsolar points will point towards true north and true south {{respectively}} {{only when the}} <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> has its maximum positive (δ☉ = +23.44°) or maximum negative (δ☉ = −23.44°) value. On the other hand, on the equinoxes {{when the sun is}} neither declined north nor south (δ☉ = 0°) and solar time noon shadows point NNW north of the equator and SSE south of the equator on the vernal equinox (and point NNE north of the equator and SSW south of the equator on the autumnal equinox).|$|E
50|$|In Arctic and Antarctic latitudes in wintertime, {{the polar}} night only rarely {{produces}} complete darkness for 24 hours each day. This can occur only at locations within 5.5 degrees of latitude of the Pole, and there only on dates {{close to the}} winter solstice. At all other latitudes and dates, the polar night includes a daily period of twilight, when the Sun is not far below the horizon. Around winter solstice, when the <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> changes slowly, complete darkness lasts several weeks at the Pole itself, e.g., from May 11 to July 31 at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. North Pole has the experience of this from November 12 to January 30.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} method {{was to take}} recourse {{to the position of}} the sun at noon. This had been suggested since at least the 1470s, but was really only opened up with the publication of the Almanach perpetuum of Abraham Zacuto in 1496, with its tables of <b>solar</b> <b>declination.</b> As the sun could not be observed directly by the quadrant, Portuguese navigators brought on board ship the old land-based astrolabe (which allows measuring the sun's height without looking directly at it). Unfortunately, astrolabe readings required stability which is not possible at sea, so new small hand-held nautical astrolabes were being experimentally introduced at this time.|$|E
50|$|In some U.S. colonial-era houses, a noon-mark {{can often}} be found carved into a floor or windowsill. Such marks {{indicate}} local noon, and provide a simple and accurate time reference for households that do not possess accurate clocks. In modern times, in some Asian countries, post offices set their clocks from a precision noon-mark. These in turn provide the times {{for the rest of}} the society. The typical noon-mark sundial was a lens set above an analemmatic plate. The plate has an engraved figure-eight shape, which corresponds to plotting the equation of time (described above) versus the <b>solar</b> <b>declination.</b> When the edge of the sun's image touches the part of the shape for the current month, this indicates that it is 12:00 noon.|$|E
50|$|The table below {{shows the}} total cost in US cents per kWh of {{electricity}} generated by a photovoltaic system. The row headings on the left show the total cost, per peak kilowatt (kWp), of a photovoltaic installation. Photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in Germany, for example, {{were reported to have}} fallen to USD 1389/kWp by the end of 2014. The column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kWh expected from each installed kWp. This varies by geographic region because the average insolation depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight. It also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon. Panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude, and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing <b>solar</b> <b>declination.</b> Solar tracking can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight, thereby raising the total energy output.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{their general}} secretiveness, several early India pilots {{compiled}} written navigation manuals, probably initially merely as notes for themselves, but eventually passed on and copied by others. These included general {{instructions on how}} to read, plot and follow routes by nautical chart, how to use the principal nautical instruments of the day—the mariner's compass, the quadrant, the astrolabe, the nocturlabe and the balestilha (cross-staff)—and astronomical tables (notably that of <b>solar</b> <b>declination,</b> derived from Abraham Zacuto and later Pedro Nunes's own) to correctly account for [...] "compass error" [...] (the deviation of the magnetic north from the true north) by recourse to the Pole Star, Sun and Southern Cross, the flux and reflux of tides, etc. These manuals often contained a roteiro (rutter), giving the detailed instructions (by geographical coordinates and physical description) of the routes to India. Two of the few which have survived were Duarte Pacheco Pereira's Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis (c. 1509) and João de Lisboa's Livro da Marinharia (c. 1514).|$|E
5000|$|Imagine {{that the}} Earth is spherical, in a {{circular}} orbit around the Sun, and that its axis is tilted 90°, so that the axis itself is in {{the plane of the}} orbit (similar to Uranus). At one date in the year the Sun would be vertically overhead at the North Pole, so its declination would be +90°. For the next few months, the sub-solar point would move toward the South Pole at constant speed, crossing the lines of latitude at a constant rate, so that the <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> would decrease linearly with time. Eventually the Sun would be over the South Pole, with a declination of -90°. Then it would start to move northward at a constant speed. Thus the graph of the Sun's declination, as seen from this highly tilted Earth, would not resemble a sine wave [...] - [...] it would be a sawtooth, zig-zagging between plus and minus 90°, with linear segments between the maxima and minima.|$|E
5000|$|Zacuto's Almanach perpetuum (or Biur Luhoth) helped {{immediately}} revolutionize ocean navigation. Prior to the Almanach, navigators {{seeking to}} determine {{their position in the}} high seas had to correct for [...] "compass error" [...] (the deviation of the magnetic north from the true north) by recourse to the quadrant and the Pole Star. But this proved less useful as they approached the equator and the Pole Star began to disappear into the horizon. Zacuto's Almanach supplied the first accurate table of <b>solar</b> <b>declination,</b> allowing navigators to use the sun instead. As the quadrant could not be used to look directly at the sun, Portuguese navigators began using the astrolabe on board (an old land-based instrument to measure the height of the sun indirectly). Zacuto's tables in conjunction with the new metal nautical astrolabe allowed navigators to take accurate readings anywhere. Already in 1497, Vasco da Gama took Zacuto's tables and the astrolabe with him on the maiden trip to India. [...] It would continue to be used by Portuguese ships thereafter to reach far destinations such as Brazil and India.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the analemma, where the <b>solar</b> <b>declination</b> and the {{equation}} of time are both zero, rises and sets at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. local mean time on {{every day of the}} year, irrespective of the latitude of the observer. (This estimation does not take account of atmospheric refraction.) If the analemma is drawn in a diagram, tilted at the appropriate angle for an observer's latitude (as described above), and if a horizontal line is drawn to pass through the position of the Sun on the analemma on any given date (interpolating between the date markings as necessary), then at sunrise this line represents the horizon. The origin moves along the celestial equator at a speed of 15° per hour, the speed of the Earth's rotation. The distance along the equator from the point where it intersects the horizon to the position of the {{origin of the}} analemma at sunrise is the distance the origin moves between 6 a.m. and the time of sunrise on the given date. Measuring the length of this equatorial segment therefore gives the difference between 6 am and the time of sunrise.|$|E
