50|$|The Pacific antwren {{was first}} {{described}} in 1911 by the Austrian ornithologist Carl Eduard Hellmayr. It {{was at one}} time considered to be conspecific with the Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> (Myrmotherula surinamensis) and the Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> (Myrmotherula multostriata) but the three have different songs and there are certain differences in their plumage.|$|E
50|$|The Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> {{is about}} 10 cm long {{and is very}} similar in {{appearance}} to the Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> (Myrmotherula surinamensis) and the Pacific antwren (Myrmotherula pacifica), {{and for a long}} time they were considered to be conspecific; however, there are some differences in the plumage and the vocalizations of each are distinctive. The male Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> has a black head, black upper parts streaked with white, a semi-concealed white dorsal patch, and black wings with two white bars. The underparts are white streaked with black. The female has an orange-rufous crown and nape but otherwise the upper parts are similar to the male. Her underparts are ochre with fine black streaks and a paler belly. The song is more musical than that of the Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren.</b> It also utters various trills and call notes.|$|E
50|$|The Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1788 as Sitta surinamensis by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin, but was later {{transferred to the}} genus Myrmotherula. It was at one time {{considered to be the}} same species as the Pacific antwren (Myrmotherula pacifica) and the Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> (Myrmotherula multostriata) but differences in their plumage and voice indicate that they are separate species.|$|E
50|$|It weighs 8.5-11.5 grams. The {{adult male}} has brown upperparts. The face, throat, breast and upper belly are black bordered with white. The lower belly and vent are grey and the flanks are brown. The upperwing-coverts are black with white spots while the underwing-coverts are grey and white. The tail {{feathers}} are grey below with white tips {{and a black}} subterminal band. The bill is black and the feet are grey with yellowish soles. Adult females are paler above than the males and have a white face and underparts with heavy black <b>streaking.</b> The rusty-backed <b>antwren</b> (F. rufa) {{is similar to the}} Sincor√° antwren but has paler and more rufous upperparts, yellowish flanks and entirely white underwing-coverts.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific antwren, or Pacific <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren,</b> (Myrmotherula pacifica) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador and Panama, living in forests, clearings, {{woodland}} verges and gardens.|$|E
50|$|The Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> (Myrmotherula multostriata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in South America where its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical swamps.|$|E
50|$|Most antwrens forage {{in small}} mixed-species flocks, but both this species and the Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> are usually seen in pairs. It {{is an active}} bird, usually found not far from water {{including}} in mangrove areas, searching through dense foliage for insects and spiders.|$|E
5000|$|The Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> has a {{very wide}} range and {{is said to be}} fairly common in {{suitable}} habitat. The population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|This antwren is a small, short-tailed {{passerine}} bird {{growing to}} {{a length of}} about 9.5 cm. The male is similar in morphology to the Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> and the Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren,</b> having black upper parts streaked with white, two white wingbars and white underparts streaked with black. The female is also similar to the females of those two species, but has a more orange-rufous head, dark streaking on the crown, and unstreaked buff underparts. The Pacific antwren {{is not likely to}} be confused with those two species as it is found exclusively west of the Andes, while they only occur to the east. The song is a fast, lively series of staccato notes, ascending slightly in pitch. Other calls include [...] "chee-cher" [...] and [...] "chee-pu", uttered by both sexes.|$|E
50|$|The Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> (Myrmotherula surinamensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in {{tropical}} South America where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, tropical swamps, and heavily degraded former forest. It is a small, black and white streaked bird, the female being distinguished by its rufous-cinnamon head and buff underparts.|$|E
50|$|The Guianan <b>{{streaked}}</b> <b>antwren</b> has {{a maximum}} length of about 10 cm. The male is black with the upper parts streaked with white and two white wing bars. The underparts are whitish {{with a few}} black streaks. The female has a rufous-cinnamon head, black and white streaked upper parts, an orange-buff throat and pale buff underparts. This antwren's voice is an unmelodious rattle.|$|E
50|$|The Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> is {{native to}} the northeastern region of South America. Its range {{includes}} southern Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana and northern Brazil, {{to the north of}} the Rio Negro and the Amazon River. It is found in the middle and understoreys of seasonally flooded forests and permanently flooded areas as well as shrubby undergrowth in secondary forest at altitudes of up to 550 m.|$|E
5000|$|The Guianan <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} and is fairly common over parts of its range. Although its population has not been quantified, it {{is thought to be}} declining, particularly in Brazil where its habitat is being cleared to make way for cattle ranching and the cultivation of soybeans. It may not be adaptable to the breakup of its habitat into smaller areas, and for this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "vulnerable".|$|E
50|$|The Amazonian <b>streaked</b> <b>antwren</b> {{occurs in}} eastern Colombia, {{southern}} Venezuela, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, and western and central Brazil. The northernmost boundary of its range {{coincides with the}} Amazon River and the lower stretches of its left-bank tributary, the Rio Negro. The southernmost boundary is Mato Grosso and northern Bolivia. Its typical habitat is the undergrowth and middle storey of seasonally-flooded forest, swamps and the vicinity of rivers. It typically forages for spiders, caterpillars and other small invertebrate prey in pairs or small groups. Its maximum altitude is around 550 m.|$|E
