25|$|Although {{control systems}} {{of various types}} date back to antiquity, a more formal {{analysis}} of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the centrifugal governor, conducted by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1868, entitled On Governors. This described and analyzed the phenomenon of <b>self-oscillation,</b> in which lags in the system may lead to overcompensation and unstable behavior. This generated a flurry {{of interest in the}} topic, during which Maxwell's classmate, Edward John Routh, abstracted Maxwell's results for the general class of linear systems. Independently, Adolf Hurwitz analyzed system stability using differential equations in 1877, resulting in what is now known as the Routhâ€“Hurwitz theorem.|$|E

2500|$|Flutter is {{a dynamic}} {{instability}} of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by positive feedback between the body's deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow. In a linear system, 'flutter point' is {{the point at which}} the structure is undergoing simple harmonic motion - zero net damping - and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a <b>self-oscillation</b> and eventual failure. 'Net damping' can be understood as the sum of the structure's natural positive damping, and the negative damping of the aerodynamic force. Flutter can be classified into two types: hard flutter, in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and soft flutter, in which the net damping decreases gradually. Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the p-method, the k-method and the p-k method. In water the mass ratio of the [...] pitch inertia of the foil vs that of the circumscribing cylinder of fluid is generally too low for binary flutter to occur, as shown by explicit solution of the simplest pitch and heave flutter stability determinant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Self-oscillation</b> is {{manifested}} as a linear instability of a dynamical system's static equilibrium. Two mathematical tests {{that can be}} used to diagnose such an instability are the Routh-Hurwitz and Nyquist criteria. The amplitude of the oscillation of an unstable system grows exponentially with time (i.e., small oscillations are negatively damped), until nonlinearities become important and limit the amplitude. This can produce a steady and sustained oscillation. In some cases, <b>self-oscillation</b> can be seen as resulting from a time lag in a closed loop system, which makes the change in variable xt dependent on the variable xt-1 evaluated at an earlier time.|$|E

40|$|Spin torque from spin current {{applied to}} a {{nanoscale}} region of a ferromagnet can act as negative magnetic damping and thereby excite <b>self-oscillations</b> of its magnetization.

50|$|<b>Self-oscillation</b> is the {{generation}} {{and maintenance of}} a periodic motion by a source of power that lacks any corresponding periodicity. The oscillator itself controls the phase with which the external power acts on it. Self-oscillators are therefore distinct from forced and parametric resonators, in which the power that sustains the motion must be modulated externally. In linear systems, <b>self-oscillation</b> appears as an instability associated with a negative damping term, which causes small perturbations to grow exponentially in amplitude. This negative damping {{is due to a}} positive feedback between the oscillation and the modulation of the external source of power. The amplitude and waveform of steady self-oscillations are determined by the nonlinear characteristics of the system. Self-oscillations are important in physics, engineering, biology, and economics.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a simple kinetic model {{of an open}} monosubstrate enzyme reaction with substrate inhibition and product activation. A comparison between the model and the phospho-fructokinase reaction shows a close resemblance between their dynamical properties.

The condition of self-excitation is satisfied more readily with a lower source rate, larger product sink rate constants, lower product-enzyme affinity and higher enzyme activity. 3. <b>Self-oscillations</b> exist only in a certain range of values of the parameter determining the degree of substrate inhibition. This range increases with decreasing source rate. Too strong or, conversely, too weak substrate inhibition leads to damped oscillations. 4. The period of <b>self-oscillations</b> depends on the degree of substrate inhibition, the source rate, the sink rate constant, the enzyme activity, the affinity of the substrate and the product for the enzyme; it decreases with an increase in these values. 5.

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a model of}} the influence of atmospheric infrasonic waves on VLF magnetospheric whistler wave excitation. This excitation occurs {{as a result of a}} succession of processes: a modulation of the plasma density by acoustic-gravity waves in the ionosphere, a reflection of the whistlers by ionosphere modulation, and a modification of whistler wave generation in the magnetospheric resonator. A variation of the magnetospheric resonator Q-factor has an influence on the operation of the plasma magnetospheric maser, where the active substances are radiation belt particles, and the working modes are electromagnetic whistler waves. The magnetospheric maser is an oscillating system which can be responsible for the excitation of <b>self-oscillations.</b> These <b>self-oscillations</b> are frequently characterized by alternating stages of accumulation and precipitation of energetic particles into the ionosphere during a pulse of whistler emissions. Numerical and analytical investigations of the response of <b>self-oscillations</b> to harmonic oscillations of the whistler reflection coefficient shows that even a small modulation rate can significantly change magnetospheric VLF emissions. Our results can explain the causes of the modulation of energetic electron fluxes and whistler wave intensity with a time scale from 10 to 150 s in the day-side magnetosphere. Such quasi-periodic VLF emissions are often observed in the sub-auroral and auroral magnetosphere and have a noticeable effect on the formation of space weather phenomena.|$|R
