And then when Captain Dan swore and I gave up there came a great <b>splash</b> <b>back</b> of my bait. I yelled and my comrades echoed me. The tuna missed. I skipped the bait. A sousing splash--and another tuna had my bait. My line sagged. I jerked hard. But too late! The tuna threw the hook before it got a hold.|$|E

30|$|Conclusions: The newly {{developed}} Essure® device (ESS 305) {{was supposed to}} have several advantages in comparison with the old one (ESS 205), with respect to ease of use, such as easier release and detachment, better visible markers and an anti-splash valve. Problems with release and detachment, which incidentally had caused dramatic trouble and increase of duration of treatment with the ESS 205, indeed did not occur with the new device. The mean duration of session was shorter and the VAS score lower with the new device, but both not statistically significant. The new inserter sleeve, with a valve to prevent <b>splashing</b> <b>back</b> fluid during treatment and which cannot rupture anymore, was also appreciated very much by the nurses and physicians.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{formed in}} 1995 as Casa Diablo by {{frontman}} Huey [...] "Zero Delorean" [...] Diablo and drummer Shane [...] "Meatwhistle" [...] Diablo, Casa Diablo released 2 albums before disbanding in 2000. Later in 2000, Delorean and Meatwhistle re-emerged as Diemonsterdie. Including {{the years as}} Casa Diablo, DMD has endured 17 years as a band, and to date have released 7 full-length studio records, a limited edition split 7" [...] vinyl (with fellow horror punks The Crimson Ghosts of Germany) and a live album. Reviews of DMD records have appeared in publications all over the world, most notably {{in the pages of}} Rue Morgue Magazine and on Rue Morgue Radio. The band's 7th album, Fall to Your Knees (2010), was received very well and was featured in a glowing review on Fear Net in November 2010. During their long tenure, Diemonsterdie have shared the stage with fellow shock rock / horror punk / grave rock legends 45 Grave, The Misfits, GWAR, Type O Negative, Celtic Frost, Graves, Impaler, Lizzy Borden and Dr. Chud's X-Ward, among many others. Despite commanding a global audience of thousands and a loyal worldwide fan base, the band has never been signed to a major label. In 2003 DMD formed their own indie horror-punk label Doctor Cyclops Records, which has served as the US label not only for Diemonsterdie, but other top acts in the genre, such as the Crimson Ghosts (Germany), Left For Dead (USA), The Dead Next Door (Sweden), Others (USA) and The Nightshift (Sweden). Currently Dr. Cyclops provides digital distribution for all of these bands with exception of the Crimson Ghosts. In recent years, Dr. Cyclops Digital has also signed the up-and-coming German band, Jamey Rottencorpse and the Rising Dead. Long hailed as the love child of Type O Negative, The Dwarves, The Cramps and The Misfits, Diemonsterdie are the flagship band of Dr. Cyclops and hail from the deep hell of Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The band consists of four members; founding members, lead singer Zero Delorean and drummer Shane [...] "Meatwhistle" [...] Diablo and more recent additions, lead guitarist Shadow Windhawk and bassist Stikki Nixx.DMD are currently at work completing their fan-funded 8th studio release, entitled [...] "October 21st 1976", which is scheduled to drop in Summer 2013.

The album will feature 13 unreleased tracks celebrating 13 years since Casa Diablo transformed into Diemonsterdie and officially began defining themselves as horror punk.2012 has also seen the revival of Diemonsterdie's free fan club, the secret order of the Zealots of the Bloody Circle. In July 2012, the band elected Steven Godfrey, an American fan from PA, {{as the president of the}} Zealots of the Bloody Circle.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} studies {{regarding}} {{the effect of}} rainfall about aircraft are briefly reviewed. It is found that performance penalties on airfoils {{have been identified in}} subscale tests. For this reason, it is of great importance that scaling laws be dveloped to aid in the extrapolation of these data to fullscale. The present investigation represents an attempt to develop scaling laws for testing subscale airfoils under heavy rain conditions. Attention is given to rain statistics, airfoil operation in heavy rain, scaling laws, thermodynamics of condensation and/or evaporation, rainfall and airfoil scaling, aspects of <b>splash</b> <b>back,</b> film thickness, rivulets, and flap slot blockage. It is concluded that the extrapolation of airfoil performance data taken at subscale under simulated heavy rain conditions to fullscale must be undertaken with caution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{many years}} {{the problem of}} {{dampness}} has assumed alarming dimensions {{in public and private}} buildings in Ghana. This paper presents a case study of a three bedroom residential bungalow of the Department of Urban Roads in Kumasi which suffers from the problem of dampness since four years after the building was constructed and occupied. The study adopted a holistic approach to dampness surveying involving a two-stage protocol of damp investigation to identify the areas in the walls severely affected by dampness. Results from the visual survey (site inspection) identified symptoms such as blistering of paints, flaking of mortar, damp patches in horizontal bands, surface efflorescence and in some cases mold growth {{to be associated with the}} walls of the building. The findings showed that dampness in the building could be due to a combination of several sources including plumbing leakages, rain water <b>splash</b> <b>back,</b> lateral penetration and rising dampness. Results from the non-destructive tests revealed higher moisture contents in the walls of the bathrooms (externally and internally), living room and bedrooms. The moisture content recorded in the bathrooms were unusually higher than the other rooms and a detailed analysis revealed that plumbing leakage was a contributory factor, especially in the internal walls. Though the study identified plumbing leakages and water penetration as contributory factors to the dampness experienced in the walls of the bathrooms, further destructive tests are recommended for the confirmation of the true source(s) of dampness in the walls of the bedrooms and living room to greatly assist in targeting the correct remediation to manage or cure the problem...|$|E

3000|$|The {{challenge}} {{resulted from}} oversized gloves seemed more obvious to small-handed firefighters, especially females, prompting {{them to use}} better-fitting work gloves (lacking fire and flame protection) for non-fire related duties. Firefighters also reported that donning the wet gloves once they had been taken off was difficult because the gloved fingers tended to turn inside out when their hands were wet, thus {{making it hard to}} rearrange them. This seemed to render firefighters hesitant to take off their wet gloves despite thermal discomfort and loss of grip. Such firefighters’ behavior in the field could cause increased risk of burn injury from quicker heat transfer in the wet gloves compared to dry gloves, as described in the following account: “My hands sweat from doing stuff with water and then I pull the glove off and the whole lining comes off with my hand. And I can’t get it back in”, “If you were holding a hose and {{you get a lot of}} <b>splash</b> <b>back</b> on your gloves, you gloves can get wet and be very hot right away (Site # 6).” Another account also illustrated the firefighting risk factor associated with wet gloves: “Due to the poor dexterity, firefighters often feel temptation to take gloves off. For example, when you need to use axes and your gloves get wet, think about it…. Using an ax and wearing slippery gloves is not a good match (Site # 6).” Additionally, a wide range of glove sizes offered by manufacturers were also reported as a confusing factor in finding the right size, as a firefighter asserted like: “You get a box of gloves and you just try them on until you find one (Site # 6).” [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a fuel filler pipe is based solely on experience and physical experiment. The challenge lies in designing the pipe to fulfill the customer needs. In other words designing the pipe such as the fuel flow does not <b>splash</b> <b>back</b> on the fuel dispenser causing a premature shut off. To improve this “trial-and-error” based development a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the refueling process is investigated. In this thesis a CFD model has been developed that can predict the fuel flow in the filler pipe. Worst case scenario of the refueling process is during the first second when the tank is partially filled. The most critical fluid is diesel due to the commercially high volume flow of 55 l/min. Due to limitations of computational resources the simulations {{are focused on the}} first second of the refueling process. The challenge in this project is creating a CFD model that is time efficient, thus require the least amount of computational resources necessary to provide useful information. A multiphase model is required to simulate the refueling process. In this project the implicit volume of fluid (VOF) has been used which has previously proven to be a suitable choice for refueling simulations. The project is divided into two parts. Part one starts with experiments and simulations of a simplified fuel system with water as acting liquid with a Reynolds number of 90 000. A short comparison between three different turbulence models has been investigated (LES, DES and URANS) where the most promising turbulence model is URANS, specifically the SST k-ω model. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the chosen turbulence model. Between the chosen mesh and the densest mesh the difference of streamwise velocity in the boundary layer was 2. 6 %. The chosen mesh with 1. 9 M cells and a time step of 1 e- 4 s was found to be the best correlating model with respect to the experiments. In part two a real fuel filling system was investigated both with experiments and simulations with the same computational model as the chosen one from part one. The change of fluid and geometry resulted in a lower Reynolds number of 12 000. Two different versions of the fuel system was investigated; with a bypass pipe and without a bypass pipe. Because of a larger volumetric region the resulting mesh had 3. 7 M cells. The finished model takes about 230 h on a local workstation with 11 cores. On a cluster with 200 cores the same simulation takes 30 h. The resulting model suffered from interpolation errors at the inlet which resulted in a volume flow of 50 l/min as opposed to 55 l/min in the experiments. Despite the difference the model could capture the key flow characteristics. With the developed model a new filler pipe can be easily implemented and provide results in shorter time than a prototype filler pipe can be ordered. This will increase the chances of ordering one single prototype that fulfills all requirements. While the simulation model cannot completely replace verification by experiments it provides information that transforms the {{development of}} the filler pipe to knowledge based development...|$|E

They had evidently fled and left him to shift for himself. He stood a minute considering, with the boys clamoring about him, and then made up his mind. The rebels were streaming back up the gorge, and it seemed to him just possible that if he separated himself from them he might slip away unobserved in the press of the pursuit.
