25|$|There are {{a number}} of domains that are thought to {{contribute}} to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure <b>satisfaction</b> was found to predict unique variance in life <b>satisfaction,</b> supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being. Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure <b>satisfaction.</b> The relationship between leisure <b>satisfaction</b> and life <b>satisfaction,</b> however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure <b>satisfaction</b> may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure <b>satisfaction</b> may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the link}} between {{attachment}} styles and marital <b>satisfaction</b> has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital <b>satisfaction</b> remain poorly understood. One mechanism may be communication. Secure attachment styles may lead to more constructive communication and more intimate self-disclosures, which in turn increase relationship <b>satisfaction.</b> Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship <b>satisfaction</b> include emotional expressiveness, strategies for coping with conflict, and perceived support from partners. Further {{studies are needed to}} better understand how attachment styles influence relationship <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{intrinsic}} <b>satisfactions</b> derived from the recycling of household solid waste materials. Data from 107 respondents to a mail-back questionnaire were subjected to factor analysis and analysis of variance. The results indicate that people derive a series of separate and distinct <b>satisfactions</b> from both recycling and reusing materials. The <b>satisfactions</b> were quite specific, involving, for example, frugality and participation. These findings suggest that our understanding of why people bother to conserve resources may be improved by investigating the personal <b>satisfactions</b> derived from environmental stewardship behavior...|$|R
40|$|Ron Widmar, Deborah Simmons, Janet Talbot, and Rachel Kaplan {{were members}} of the {{research}} team. This article deals with the concerns, the predicted rewards, and the intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> that people who do conserve derive from their conserving behaviors. In order to investigate the factors that play a role in maintaining energy-conserving behavior, interviews were conducted which focused on the intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> that are derived from people's everyday pursuits. The thirty participants were individuals who were known to be concerned about energy conservation issues, and special emphasis was placed on those <b>satisfactions</b> associated with their daily environmental stewardship activities. Eleven distinct types of <b>satisfactions</b> were found in the data with only one being economic in nature. The range of intrinsic <b>satisfactions</b> found suggests that many potentially fruitful avenues exist for encouraging the adoption of energy conservation practices among a much broader population...|$|R

The full {{dynamics of the}} quadcopter describing the attitude and position are nonlinear, which are quite sensitive to changes of inputs and disturbances. By means of constraint <b>satisfactions,</b> partial nonlinearities and modeling errors of the control-oriented model of full dynamics can be transformed into the inequality constraints.

25|$|Job <b>satisfaction</b> {{is often}} thought {{to reflect the}} extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or {{individual}} aspects or facets of jobs. It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job <b>satisfaction</b> has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{decision}} theory appropriate {{for use in}} serious choices such as insurance. It extends standard decision theories like expected utility or cumulative prospect theory which are atemporal single stage theories. Instead it employs stages of knowledge ahead to track <b>satisfactions</b> and dissatisfactions. In {{the first stage of}} the risk, the uninsured face dissatisfactions of worries and planning difficulties (avoided by the insured), also perhaps positive <b>satisfactions</b> of thrills (missed out by the insured). In the second stage when the risk is past, the uninsured may face the dissatisfactions of ridicule and blame if they learn that they were unlucky. From experimental and questionnaire data, 80 % of our subjects are influenced by such secondary <b>satisfactions.</b> Only five percent of our participants employ the usage of integrated quantitative aggregation rules for evaluating acts as assumed under expected utility theory.
