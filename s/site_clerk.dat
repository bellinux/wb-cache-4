The patterning makes reference to the local tradition of diaper and zigzag patterns in the brickwork of cottages and farm buildings. Tiles were extensively employed, forming the surrounds of the first floor windows, as lintels in herringbone patterns and as decorative bands and patterns. Tiles and narrow courses of brick were used in twisted neo-Tudor chimney stacks. Prior did not employ a general contractor in the building. Electrical services were executed under contract, but the main construction work was supervised and labour and materials purchased by Prior's <b>site</b> <b>clerk,</b> Randall Wells (1877-1942) and Mr Blower, a local bricklayer.

Nowadays, occupational fatalities and injuries caused by fall accidents pose a serious problem in the construction project in the world. To develop the best development, many hazards and risk will be measured {{for success in the}} development project. Falls accident is a risk in development project especially in construction project. This problem must be study how to overcome or to reduce fall accidents at the construction project. The purpose of the study is about risk assessment on fall accidents at construction sites in Malaysia. The objectives of this research are to identify the types and causes of fall accidents at construction sites. To identify hazard related to fall accident.
