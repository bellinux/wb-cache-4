40|$|Esophagojejunal {{anastomosis}} fistula is {{the main}} complication after a total gastrectomy. To avoid a complex procedure on friable inflamed perianastomotic tissues, a coated <b>self-expandable</b> <b>stent</b> is mounted {{at the site of}} the anastomotic leak. A complication of stenting procedure is that it might lead to distal esophageal stenosis. However, another frequently encountered complication of stenting is stent migration, which is treated nonsurgically. When the migrated stent creates life threatening complications, surgical removal is indicated. We present a case of a 67 -year-old male patient who was treated at our facility for a gastric adenocarcinoma which developed, postoperatively, an esophagojejunostomy fistula, a distal esophageal stenosis, and a metallic coated <b>self-expandable</b> <b>stent</b> migration.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the feasibility of off-pump transapical mitral valve-in-ring implantation and to test the per-formance of a custom-made <b>self-expandable</b> <b>stent</b> valve, {{in comparison with the}} standard SAPIEN valve. METHODS: Acute experiments were performed in five pigs. Animals (mean weight 58. 4 ± 7. 3 kg) underwent mitral valve annuloplasties under cardiopulmonary bypass using 26 -mm rings (SJM™). Then, a 30 -mm custom-made <b>self-expandable</b> <b>stent</b> valve or a 23 -mm balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (Edwards SAPIEN XT™) was deployed within the annuloplasty rings through a transatrial access and under direct vision. Subsequently, the stent valves were inserted transapically under fluoroscopic guidance and off pump. RESULTS: The procedural success of transatrial and transapical mitral valve-in-ring procedures was 100 % (10 of 10). Mean transatrial and transapical procedure time was 2. 0 ± 1. 1 and 22. 0 ± 5. 7 min, respectively. Haemodynamic status during transapical implantation remained stable, and differences in data collected before and after the stent-valve deployment were not statistically significant. Mean mitral annulus diameter and mean mitral orifice area in the group of <b>self-expandable</b> <b>stent</b> valves were 2. 60 ± 0. 02 cm and 4. 16 ± 0. 48 cm 2, respectively, whereas in the SAPIEN group they were 1. 95 ± 0. 18 cm and 2. 26 ± 0. 20 cm 2, respectively.

ResultsSeventeen fractured <b>self-expandable</b> metallic <b>stents</b> were found; the incidence was 12. 2 % (17 / 139 patients) among patients with tracheobronchial disease. Tortuous airway (odds ratio, 4. 06; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 – 18. 34; P =. 04) independently predicted <b>self-expandable</b> metallic <b>stent</b> fracture.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Advanced gastric {{carcinoma}} often decreases {{quality of}} life because of upper gastrointestinal tract stenosis. <b>Self-expandable</b> metal <b>stents</b> have been thought to be an effective, minimally invasive treatment for stenosis. However, the effectiveness of <b>self-expandable</b> metal <b>stent</b> placement for carcinomatous stenosis of the gastric body and antrum has not been clarified, {{and there have been}} few reports of such cases. Case presentation A 74 -year-old Japanese woman developed stenosis of the gastric body and antrum caused by advanced gastric cancer during first-line chemotherapy. She developed weight loss and poor nutrition due to inadequate intake. <b>Self-expandable</b> metal <b>stent</b> placement for stenosis of the gastric body and antrum ameliorated her symptoms rapidly and improved her general condition and {{quality of life}}. Eight days after <b>self-expandable</b> metal <b>stent</b> placement, second-line chemotherapy could be administered safely. Oral intake and nutritional status were maintained for 117 days after <b>self-expandable</b> metal <b>stent</b> placement, and she died of gastric cancer 176 days after <b>self-expandable</b> metal <b>stent</b> placement and initiation of second-line chemotherapy. Conclusions <b>Self-expandable</b> metal <b>stent</b> placement for carcinomatous stenosis in the gastric body and antrum could be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with inadequate oral uptake.

RESULTS: All pigs survived until the study termination 6 weeks after stent implantation. Control angiography revealed stent closure in three pigs.

The difference in MSLD after stent implantation and at control after 6 weeks was not significant (4. 9 +/- 0. 5 mm [...] > 4. 7 +/- 1. 0 mm).

Stents were mainly placed for refractory strictures (49. 2 %) and fistulae (49. 8 %). Of the removed stents, 52 % were fully covered <b>self-expandable</b> metal <b>stents</b> (FCSEMSs), 28. 6 % were partially covered <b>self-expandable</b> metal <b>stents</b> (PCSEMSs), and 19. 5 % were <b>self-expandable</b> plastic <b>stents.</b> A total of 35 (10. 6 %) procedure-related adverse events were reported, including 7 (2. 1 %) major adverse events.

Methods: We reviewed 16 cases (17 procedures) treated by SMART STENT in Nakamura memorial hospital. The stenosis rates were calculated {{based on the}} classification of NASCET. We compared the stenosis rates of carotid artery between pre-treatment and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the endovascular treatment. Results: Mean arterial stenosis rate was reduced from 72 % to 10 % after the treatment. In 8 cases, three and 6 months follow-up angiography after the treatment showed reduction of stenosis 10. 9 % and 12. 4 %, respectively. There was one neurological event (TIA). Discussions: It is reported that the balloon expandable stent has a tendency of gradual deterioration of the stenosis rate after the treatment.
