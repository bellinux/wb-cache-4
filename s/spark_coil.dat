50|$|This cycle {{leads to}} an exotic-looking display of {{electric}} white, yellow, blue or purple arcs, which is often seen in films about mad scientists. The device was a staple in schools and science fairs of the 1950s and 1960s, typically constructed out of a Model T <b>spark</b> <b>coil</b> or any other source of high voltage in the 10,000-30,000-volt range, such as a neon sign transformer (5-15 kV) or a television picture tube circuit (flyback transformer) (10-28 kV), and two coat hangers or rods built into a V shape. For larger ladders, microwave oven transformers connected in series, voltage multipliers and utility pole transformers (pole pigs) run in reverse (step-up) are commonly used.|$|E
5000|$|In 1905 a [...] "state of the art" [...] {{spark gap}} {{transmitter}} generated a signal having a wavelength between 250 meters (1.2 MHz) and 550 meters (545 kHz). 600 meters (500 kHz) became the International distress frequency. The receivers were simple unamplified magnetic detectors or electrolytic detectors. This later {{gave way to}} the famous and more sensitive galena crystal sets. Tuners were primitive or nonexistent. Early amateur radio operators built low power spark gap transmitters using the <b>spark</b> <b>coil</b> from Ford Model T automobiles. But a typical commercial station in 1916 might include a 1/2 kW transformer that supplied 14,000 volts, an eight section capacitor, and a rotary gap capable of handling a peak current of several hundred amperes.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ignition}} coil (also called a <b>spark</b> <b>coil)</b> is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the {{ignition coil}} to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|E

They were used by Hertz to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves, as predicted by James Clerk Maxwell and by Lodge and Marconi in the first research into radio waves. Their largest industrial use was probably in early wireless telegraphy spark-gap radio transmitters and to power early cold cathode x-ray tubes from the 1890s to the 1920s, after which they were supplanted in both these applications by AC transformers and vacuum tubes. However their largest use was as the ignition coil or <b>spark</b> <b>coil</b> in the ignition system of internal combustion engines, where they are still used, although the interrupter contacts are now replaced by solid state switches.

5000|$|An {{electric}} current is {{passed through the}} primary, creating a magnetic field. [...] Because of the common core, most of the primary's magnetic field couples with the secondary winding. The primary behaves as an inductor, storing energy in the associated magnetic field. When the primary current is suddenly interrupted, the magnetic field rapidly collapses. This causes a high voltage pulse to be developed across the secondary terminals through electromagnetic induction. Because of {{the large number of}} turns in the secondary coil, the secondary voltage pulse is typically many thousands of volts. This voltage is often sufficient to cause an electric spark, to jump across an air gap (G) separating the secondary's output terminals. For this reason, induction <b>coils</b> were called <b>spark</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
