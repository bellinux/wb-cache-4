This approach produces fuzzy test statistics and fuzzy critical values in hypothesis testing. In addition, the sample size is fixed for this test. When data comes sequentially, however, it is not suitable to study with a fixed sample size test. In such cases, sequential and group <b>sequential</b> <b>tests</b> are recommended. Unlike a <b>sequential</b> <b>test,</b> a group of <b>sequential</b> <b>test</b> provides substantial savings in sample and enables us to make decisions as early as possible. This intends paper to combine the benefits of group <b>sequential</b> <b>test</b> and Buckley's approach using α-cuts.

O 2 ̆ 7 Brien and Fleming stated that their group <b>sequential</b> <b>testing</b> procedure has the same Type I error rate and power {{as that of a}} fixed one-stage chi-square test, but gives the opportunity to terminate the trial early when one treatment is clearly performing better than the other. We studied and tested the O 2 ̆ 7 Brien and Fleming procedure specifically by correcting the originally proposed critical values. Furthermore, we updated the O’Brien Fleming Group <b>Sequential</b> <b>Testing</b> procedure to make it more flexible via three extensions. The first extension is combining the O’Brien Fleming Group <b>Sequential</b> <b>Testing</b> procedure with the Optimal allocation, where the idea is to allocate more patients to the better treatment after each interim analysis. The second extension is combining the O’Brien Fleming Group <b>Sequential</b> <b>Testing</b> procedure with the Neyman allocation which aims to minimize the variance of the difference in sample proportions. The last extension is that we can allow for different sample weights for different stages, as opposed to equal allocation for different stages.
