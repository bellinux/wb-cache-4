40|$|Qualitative {{samples of}} Collembola were {{obtained}} {{from a range of}} substrates near Husvik, Stromness Bay, South Georgia, between January anti March 1996. Collections made at Hope Point near Grytviken (Cumberland East Bay) in 1980 / 1982 and 1997 were also examined. Fifteen species of Collembola were recorded around Husvik; most were widely distributed. Two of these, Friesia sp. nov, and Cryptopygus badasa, represent additions to the previously recognised fauna of 17 species. A new record of an introduced species, Hypogastrura purpurescens, was identified in collections from Hope Point in 1980 / 1982, bringing the total <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> fauna to 20 species. A key to <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> Collembola is included. H. purpurescens and the congeneric Hypogastrura viatica, both cosmopolitan invasive species, have also been recognised on other sub-Antarctic islands and have displaced resident species from some habitats. Their presence on South Georgia, and the dominance of H. viatica in some habitats, highlight the importance of strict quarantine measures to avoid the introduction of further alien invertebrates...|$|R
40|$|Colonization of {{artificial}} substrata was monitored on sheltered rocky shores at Husvik, South Georgia (54 ° 11 ′S; 36 ° 40 ′W) and Cumbrae, Scotland (55 ° 46 ′N; 4 ° 55 ′W) from mid summer to early autumn. South Georgia is a remote island (1, 330 km from other land); Cumbrae is only 2 km from nearby coasts. Both islands were heavily glaciated {{for a period}} up to about 10, 000 ybp, so the intertidal fauna is of geologically recent origin. The <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> fauna is depauperate and consists mainly of direct developers; that of Cumbrae is rich and largely larviparous. Colonization rates at Cumbrae were one to four orders of magnitude greater than at Husvik. It is suggested that the fauna of <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shores stems from colonization by rafting from remote sources, while Cumbrae has been supplied predominantly by short-range pelagic larval dispersal. The measured differences in colonization rates reflect the substantial local advantage of larval dispersal over direct development in established communitie...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} aspect of foraging ecology {{is the extent to}} which different individuals or genders within a population exploit food resources in a different manner. For diving seabirds, much of this information relates either to short-term dietary data or indirect measures such as time budgets. Moreover, dietary specialisation can be difficult to detect due to biases associated with conventional sampling techniques. We used stable isotope ratios in blood and feathers to infer trophic and habitat specialisations among 4 diving seabird taxa—the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus, the <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shag Phalacrocorax (atriceps) georgianus and the Kerguelen shag P. (atriceps) verrucosus. This allowed us to investigate foraging specialisation and assess whether social dominance or differences in foraging preferences explained the observed patterns. In all taxa where sexes were known we found that males foraged at a higher trophic level (δ 15 N values) than females, although this was not significant in macaroni penguins. We believe that this is linked to a dual foraging strategy among female macaroni penguins. For <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shags, we found that sex-related dietary differences persisted for long periods (inferred from stable isotope analyses of feathers and blood). We suggest that the trophic differences are driven by differences in physiological performance, with males tending to dive deeper than females because of their larger size, and hence able to access higher trophic level prey items. Moreover, male and female shags tend to forage at different times of day; therefore, social dominance by males is unlikely to be driving the observed differences. We also recorded highly significant relationships between stable isotope signatures in blood (representing the breeding season diet) and those in feathers (mostly representing the previous non-breeding season diet) in both the <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> and Kerguelen shags. This strongly suggests that these 2 taxa include individuals with distinct foraging specialisation (and most probably foraging locations) that are maintained over long periods...|$|R
40|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shag (Phalacrocorax georgianus) shows a {{remarkable}} diving ability {{comparable to that}} of penguins, yet nothing is known of the physiology of these birds. In this study, heart rates and abdominal temperatures were recorded continuously in four free-ranging <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shags using an implanted data-logger. A time­depth recorder was also attached {{to the back of the}} implanted birds to record their diving behaviour. The diving behaviour of the birds was essentially similar to that reported in other studies, with maximum dive durations for individual birds ranging between 140 and 287 s, and maximum depths between 35 and 101 m. The birds, while at the nest, had a heart rate of 104. 0 ± 13. 1 beats min- 1 (mean ± s. e. m.) and an abdominal temperature of 39. 1 ± 0. 2 °C. During flights of 221 ± 29 s, heart rate and abdominal temperature rose to 309. 5 ± 18. 0 beats min- 1 and 40. 1 ± 0. 3 °C, respectively. The mean heart rate during diving, at 103. 7 ± 13. 7 beats min- 1, was not significantly different from the resting values, but the minimum heart rate during a dive was significantly lower at 64. 8 ± 5. 8 beats min- 1. The minimum heart rate during a dive was negatively correlated with both dive duration and dive depth. Abdominal temperature fell progressively during a diving bout, with a mean temperature at the end of a bout of 35. 1 ± 1. 7 °C. The minimum heart rate during diving is at a sub-resting level, which suggests that the <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shag responds to submersion with the 'classic' dive response of bradycardia and the associated peripheral vasoconstriction and utilisation of anaerobic metabolism. However, the reduction in abdominal temperature may reflect a reduction in the overall metabolic rate of the animal such that the bird can remain aerobic while submerged...|$|R

40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{quantify}} how significant the polar archipelago of South Georgia is {{as a source}} of regional and global marine biodiversity. We evaluate numbers of rare, endemic and range-edge species and how the faunal structure of South Georgia may respond to some of the fastest warming waters on the planet. Biodiversity data was collated from a comprehensive review of reports, papers and databases, collectively representing over 125 years of polar exploration. Classification of each specimen was recorded to species level and fully geo-referenced by depth, latitude and longitude. This information was integrated with physical data layers (e. g. temperature, salinity and flow) providing a visualisation of South Georgia’s biogeography across spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, placing it in the wider context of the Southern Hemisphere. This study marks the first attempt to map the biogeography of an archipelago south of the Polar Front. Through it we identify the <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> shelf as the most speciose region of the Southern Ocean recorded to date. Marine biodiversity was recorded as rich across taxonomic levels with 17, 732 records yielding 1, 445 species from 436 families, 51 classes and 22 phyla. Most species recorded were rare, with 35 % recorded only once and 86 % recorded, 10 times. Its marine fauna is marked by the cumulative dominance of endemic and range-edge species, potentially at their thermal tolerance limits. Consequently, our data suggests the ecological implications of environmental change to the <b>South</b> <b>Georgian</b> marine ecosystem could be severe.
