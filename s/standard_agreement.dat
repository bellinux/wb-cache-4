(Nonstandard Agreement) Previous studies of subject-verb agreement (Wolfram & Christian 1976; Feagin 1979; Woods 1979; Eisikovits 1991; DeWolf 1992; Meechan & Foley 1994) have found that <b>standard</b> <b>agreement</b> is particularly infrequent in existential constructions. Indeed, existential constructions are typically characterized as triggering high frequencies of nonstandard agreement as in (1 b). Most studies exploring the agreement pattern in existentials, however, have focused on informal speech situations, such as Meechan and Foleys (1994) corpus survey of Ottawa and Nova Scotian English, where speakers are recorded in general interview or casual conversation style situations.
