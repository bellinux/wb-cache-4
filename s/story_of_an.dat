Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months. It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. The Titans failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.|$|E

5|$|Four Times of the Day is {{a series}} of four {{paintings}} by English artist William Hogarth. Completed in 1736, they were reproduced as a series of four engravings published in 1738. They are humorous depictions of life in the streets of London, the vagaries of fashion, and the interactions between the rich and poor. Unlike many of Hogarth's other series, such as A Harlot's Progress, A Rake's Progress, Industry and Idleness, and The Four Stages of Cruelty, it does not depict the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual, but instead focuses on the society of the city. Hogarth intended the series to be humorous rather than instructional; the pictures do not offer a judgment on whether the rich or poor are more deserving of the viewer's sympathies: while the upper and middle classes tend to provide the focus for each scene, there are fewer of the moral comparisons seen in some of his other works.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, List and Fanny Wschiansky {{founded a}} belletristic society devoted to {{encouraging}} German nationalist and neo-romantic literature in Vienna, the Literarische Donaugesellschaft ("Danubian Literary Society"). The group was partly {{based upon the}} 15th-century Litteraria Sodalita Danubiana created by the Viennese humanist Conrad Celte, about whom List authored a brief biography in 1893. He also authored two further novels during the 1890s, {{both of which were}} historical romances set in Iron Age Germany. The first appeared in 1894 as Jung Diethers Heimkehr ("Young Diether's Homecoming"), which told {{the story of a young}} Teuton living in the fifth century who has been forcefully converted to Christianity but who returns to his original solar cult. The second was Pipara, a two-volume story published in 1895 which told the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eponymous Quadi maiden who escaped captivity from the Romans to become an empress. In 1898, he then authored a catechism exhibiting a form of pagan deism titled Der Unbesiegbare ("The Invincible").|$|E
