40|$|There are {{different}} {{ideas about the}} appropriate age of circumcision and unfortunately medical researchers have not agreed on the same idea yet. Circumcision is performed for various reasons in different communities including: cultural, religious, preventive and therapeutic. So, {{to answer this question}} some points should be considered. There are two facts in medical aspect. First is the treatment aspect of circumcision that most physicians have consensus opinions on it, such as the phimosis treatment which should be done as soon as possible. <b>Second,</b> the common <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> including 2 - 10 % of the circumcisions shows that the prevention o...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} life, several {{treatments}} are administered routinely that lack <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> and may cause significant harm to patients. Examples include artificial hydration and oxygen therapy in the dying phase, as well as enteral nutrition in advanced dementia. <b>Medical</b> <b>indication</b> {{is defined as the}} appropriateness of a therapeutic or diagnostic measure in the patient's concrete clinical situation, in light of the best available evidence. The decision about the absence or presence of a <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> is a core competence of physicians. They have no obligation to perform or even mention measures that are not indicated. The decision about <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> is a clinical compound decision, composed of both a factual, evidence-based judgement and a value judgement, which should always be patient-centred. Acknowledging the crucial role of <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> in clinical decision making in medicine generally {{and at the end of}} life specifically opens up ways of enhancing patient-physician communication by clarifying roles, responsibilities and competencies.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} thorny {{issue of the}} rationale of the exclusion from patentability of medical treatment methods and the patentability of <b>medical</b> <b>indications.</b> This quest is the consequence of our earlier findings that <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents present a real life risk for many players in the medical chain, i. e. the generic manufacturer, the clinician and the pharmacist of patent infringement (see to that effect our contribution at [2016] I. P. Q., 151). We {{come to the conclusion}} that the rationale for the exclusion from patentability of medical treatment methods is not very clear and can be interpreted very broadly. It has changed over time but seems now to be based on a rather wide socio-ethical rationale, aiming at protecting healthcare, which, even if justified, seems to be so broad that not only medical treatment methods but also the very patentability of pharmaceutical products can be subsumed under it. We also conclude that the rationale for allowing <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents is equally not very clear, and their allowability was most definitely not a "love at first sight" affair with the legislature. It is submitted that certain <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents sit very close to the activities of clinicians, which makes the argument that <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents do not directly touch the physician not always correct. It is argued that, looking at the historical rationale of both the exclusion from patent protection of medical treatment methods and the patentability of <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> inventions, there is some force in arguing that <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents are not desirable. We formulate a number of possible solutions. It is argued that abolishing the exclusion from patentability of medical treatment methods, even though feasible if accompanied by the introduction of a therapeutic freedom exemption, is in view of the historical rationale of the exclusion, at least in EPC territories, not very likely to find support. It is further also argued that abolishing <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents could be such a drastic action that it might come at the detriment of at least some genuine innovation in medicinal research, and would require further reflection...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{worldwide}} {{debate about}} the appropriateness of caesarean sections performed without <b>medical</b> <b>indications.</b> In this analysis, we aim to further investigate the relationship between caesarean section without <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> and severe maternal outcomes. Methods: This is a multicountry, facility-based survey that used a stratified multistage cluster sampling design to obtain a sample of countries and health institutions worldwide. A total of 24 countries and 373 health facilities participated in this study. Data collection took place during 2004 and 2005 in Africa and the Americas and during 2007 and 2008 in Asia. All women giving birth at the facility {{during the study period}} were included and had their medical records reviewed before discharge from the hospital.

40|$|Abstract Background The rate of cesarean {{delivery}} was 35 % in 2007 in Taiwan. It {{is unclear}} {{how many of the}} cesarean deliveries were without <b>medical</b> <b>indications.</b> Women's preference for cesarean delivery during their course of pregnancy has rarely been studied and therefore our objectives were to examine rate of cesarean deliveries without <b>medical</b> <b>indications,</b> to explore women's preference for cesarean delivery as their gestation advances, and to compare background and perinatal factors among women who underwent different modes of delivery in Taiwan. Methods This prospective study applied a longitudinal design. The study participants were 473 women who received prenatal care at four hospitals in Taipei and answered structured questionnaires at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, and 5 to 7 weeks after delivery. Results Of the 151 women (31. 9 %) who had cesarean deliveries, 19. 9 % were without <b>medical</b> <b>indication.</b> Three indications: malpresentation, prior cesarean section, and dysfunctional labor together accounted for 82. 6 % of cesarean section with <b>medical</b> <b>indications.</b> The prevalence of maternal preference for cesarean delivery was found to be 12. 5 % and 17. 5 % during the second and third trimester, respectively. Of the women who preferred cesarean delivery during the second trimester, 93. 2 % eventually had a cesarean delivery. Women who were older, with older spouses, and who had health problems before or during pregnancy {{were more likely to have}} cesarean deliveries. Conclusions About 20 % of cesarean deliveries were without <b>medical</b> <b>indications.</b> Women's preference for cesarean delivery during the second trimester predicts subsequent cesarean delivery. Counseling regarding mode of delivery should be offered early in pregnancy, especially for women who are older or with older spouses, have health problems, or had a prior cesarean section. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides for}} the first time an in-depth analysis of the scope of protection of <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> claims. This analysis leads to the inevitable conclusion that virtually all players in the chain, i. e. the generic drug manufacturers, the drug wholesalers, the physician and the pharmacists, run a credible and documented risk of committing patent infringement {{in the case of an}} off-label use by producing drugs for the use in medical treatment, by prescribing them and by dispensing those drugs. The introduction of a therapeutic freedom exception for clinicians and pharmacists is advised. Such an introduction is not sufficient to guarantee full therapeutic freedom at a reasonable cost for both patients and the healthcare system at large. It is evidenced that <b>medical</b> <b>indication</b> patents do not only come very close to the therapeutic activities of the clinician, and present serious risks from that perspective; other players in the pharmaceutical product chain also run the risk of committing patent infringements which they cannot necessarily control. It is likely that under the current state of the law, generic manufacturers will be liable for patent infringement, knowing that their drugs, which are not authorised and offered for sale for patented <b>medical</b> <b>indications,</b> will be used off-label by physicians for the use in the treatment of a patented <b>medical</b> <b>indication.</b> Such a situation is not desirable, as it will expel generics from the pharmaceutical product market, even in markets which are no longer patent protected. This can come at a potentially very high cost for the healthcare system, which is already under financial pressure in most countries.
