40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue that {{pervasive}} tracking and data-mining are leading to shifts in governmentality {{that can be}} characterised as algorithmic <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception.</b> I also argue that the apparatus that performs this change owes as much to everyday business models {{as it does to}} mass surveillance. I look at technical changes at the level of data structures, such as the move to NoSQL databases, and how this combines with data-mining and machine learning to accelerate the use of prediction as a form of governance. The consequent confusion between correlation and causation leads, I assert, to the creation <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception.</b> I set out what I mean by <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> using the ideas of Giorgio Agamben, focusing on the aspects most relevant to algorithmic regulation: force-of and topology. I argue that the effects <b>of</b> these <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> escape legal constraints such as concepts of privacy. Having characterised this as a potentially totalising change and an erosion of civil liberties, I ask in what ways the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> might be opposed. I follow Agamben by drawing on Walter Benjamin's concept of pure means as a tactic that is itself outside the frame of law-producing or law-preserving activity. However, the urgent need to respond requires more than a philosophical stance, and I examine two examples of historical resistance that satisfy Benjamin's criteria. For each in turn I draw connections to contemporary cases of digital dissent that exhibit some of the same characteristics. I conclude that it is possible both theoretically and practically to resist the coming <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> and I end by warning what is at stake if we do not...|$|R

[...] "The entire Third Reich can be considered a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> that lasted twelve years. In this sense, modern totalitarianism can be defined as the establishment, by means of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception,</b> of a legal civil war that allows for the physical elimination not only of political adversaries but of entire categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be integrated into the political system" [...] (Agamben, pg 2).|$|E
50|$|A <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> (Ausnahmezustand) is {{a concept}} in the legal theory of Carl Schmitt, similar {{to a state of}} emergency, but based in the sovereign's ability to transcend the rule of law {{in the name of the}} public good.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the debated relationship between liberal- democratic politics and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> in conditions <b>of</b> emergency. After Walter Benjamin and Giorgio Agamben, it is often maintained that today {{we live in a}} situation of perennial exceptionalism, where emergency measures have become a regular practice even by governments we name ‘democratic’. In these circumstances, exception is deemed to threaten democracy and hinder individual and collective political agency. Yet, such interpretation remains rigidly focused on the expanded governmental powers ushered by the exception. The article first unpacks how the relationship between exception and democracy has been differently addressed by juridical and biopolitical approaches. Then, it attempts an alternative heuristic: it discusses possibilities of democratic associative practices in emergency by looking at the notion of resistance that Michel Foucault links with power. This route remains unexplored in the literature on the concept <b>of</b> the <b>exception...</b>|$|R

In particular, I reflect on how US-based Italian Studies—joining forces with scholars in other fields on the two sides of the Atlantic—engage in practices of trans-lation that fundamentally contribute to the ‘‘packing’’ of contemporary Italian political philosophy as ‘‘Italian Theory’’. Such practices have significantly impacted on Human Geography and the social sciences in general, and influenced how highly theoretical work originated outside the Anglophone ‘‘academic core’’ is (re) produced, legitimated, and circulated internationally...|$|R

5000|$|Derek Gregory and Alan Pred {{assembled}} the influential edited collection Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence, which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost {{factors in the}} real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present. Evidently, political violence often gives a part {{for the state to}} play. When [...] "modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law", the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben's concepts of <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> and homo sacer are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, {{in the grip of a}} perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this [...] "in limbo" [...] reality is designed to be in place [...] "until further notice…the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself". For Agamben, the physical space of the camp [...] "is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space". At the scale of the body, in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception,</b> a person is so removed from their rights by [...] "juridical procedures and deployments of power" [...] that [...] "no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime"; in other words, people become only homo sacer. Guantanamo Bay could also be said to represent the physicality of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>exception</b> in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.|$|E
