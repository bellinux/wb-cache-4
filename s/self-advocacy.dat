25|$|The {{right to}} have an {{independent}} life, using paid assistant care instead of being institutionalized, if the individual wishes, is a major goal of the disability rights movement, and is the main goal of the similar independent living and <b>self-advocacy</b> movements, which are most strongly associated with people with intellectual disabilities and mental health disorders. These movements have supported people with disabilities to live as more active participants in society.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} {{of this book}} may {{be regarded as the}} first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.Successful lawsuits against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and <b>self-advocacy</b> also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980.|$|E

25|$|Advocacy is {{a burgeoning}} support field {{for people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare benefits or when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for <b>self-advocacy,</b> teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{non-profit}} agency that DPSD works with is People First, a <b>self-advocacy</b> organization {{for people with}} disabilities. This organization has many chapters in Utah. They help their members advocate for issues surrounding intellectual disabilities. The Division often includes People First members and leadership in stakeholder meetings. Together, they deliberate on how services are delivered and pertinent human rights issues. DSPD also encourages the private entities who deliver waiver services to include People First members' input on improvements.|$|E
2500|$|Advocates for {{the rights}} of people with {{developmental}} disabilities focus their efforts on gaining acceptance in the workforce and in everyday activities and events from which they might have been excluded in the past. Unlike many of the leaders in the physical disability rights community, <b>self-advocacy</b> has been slow in developing for people with developmental disabilities. As a result, much of the work done by the Disability Rights Movement was completed by allies, or those without disabilities but with a strong connection to someone with disabilities. Parents, friends, and siblings fought for education and acceptance when their loved ones with cognitive disabilities could not. Public awareness {{of the civil rights movement}} for this population remains limited, and the stereotyping of people with developmental disabilities as non-contributing citizens who are dependent on others remains common. Today, the movement has a more social focus to increase this public awareness, as evidenced by the [...] "R-Word" [...] Campaign, in which they try to eliminate the colloquial use of the word [...] "retard." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Self-advocacy</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the success of students with disabilities in higher education. While examination of <b>self-advocacy</b> skills has been largely limited to the impact in academic settings, <b>self-advocacy</b> skills, or the lack thereof, do also impact non-academic situations. A 2004 study noted only 3 percent of students with disabilities had <b>self-advocacy</b> training. Students with disabilities who are confident about their disability identity and <b>self-advocacy</b> skills are more likely to disclose their disabilities and advocate for their needs when interacting with faculty and staff. Students with disabilities who were embarrassed of their disability identity and did not understand their needs as learners looked to faculty and staff for solutions to accommodation needs. [...] Education helps students with disabilities learn <b>self-advocacy</b> skills that affect their ability to advocate for their health, insurance, and other needs.|$|E

50|$|The <b>self-advocacy</b> {{movement}} {{for people with}} disabilities {{has its roots in the}} broader civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s but is in many respects still in its infancy.

[...] This is due to many factors including low literacy and other communication challenges that are a barrier for people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E

5000|$|Lupton {{questions}} whether <b>self-advocacy</b> is always possible or even beneficial for patients. He claims that {{in cases of}} intense suffering and maybe even possibility of death, for the doctor to take on an absolutely authoritative controlling role may be important {{as a form of}} comfort. Ideas on <b>self-advocacy</b> tend to promote ideas of patients as being rational at times of illness, so detached from one's emotions, themselves maybe be produced by one's illness. Nevertheless, such detachment is not always possible. Lack of rationality here may be considered as negative in that it can create dependency seen as weakness. However, Lupton says there are also disadvantages for patients responding with greater levels of <b>self-advocacy.</b> To question the doctor's expert knowledge, can undermine the trust in doctors, and faith in their expert knowledge, needed to comfort the extremely ill.|$|E
