Local competencies with national involvment in alternative energy netwoks and national policy processes were located in the Biovallée :Enertech, an engineering <b>office</b> <b>specialised</b> in thermal simulations and involved in several pionneering experiments in efficiency buildings; the négaWatt Institute, dedicated to training, research and engineering studies about energy efficiency solutions. The director of Enertech, involved in the Grenelle de l’Environnement in 2007, failed to promote in this arena the idea that the refurbishment of residential buildings could be a legal requirement. The Biovallée project raised for him the opportunity to test an alternative ‘market’ solution through the making of global low energy retroffitting offer for private owners. This model consists in assembling the local officers as energy advisors, with craftsmen collectives as coherent entities (38 companies) to propose energy and cost efficiency solutions, and the experts (Enertech, négaWatt) as trainers and conductors. This creates a new agency through which the private owners are empowered so as to strategically choose how to make the appropriate investment for the better energy efficiency solution. Thus, two key emerging dimensions unsually gathered are adjusted through this new sociotechnical assemblage, one of decentralisation of the housing policy, one of marketisation of the energy-efficient refurbishment issues of private housings still today neglected by the building sector...|$|R

40|$|With {{interest}} rates {{at an all-time}} low in Australia, investment managers are quickly adjusting tact and constantly seeking feed to maximise return. Many have traditionally resorted to the Australian real estate investment trusts (A-REITs) as a means to growing return. A-REITs are listed property investment vehicles that constitutes around A$ 125 billion (10 %) of the total Australian share market value. The A-REITs have been popular for yielding some of the best returns until 2009, when the global financial market collapse led to 70 % fall in value from a peak of A$ 148 billion. A-REITs with higher debt levels were significantly affected which lead to the collapse and recapitalisation of several leading A-REITs. Since the GFC, with low {{interest rates}} the A-REITs have performed well compared to the broader stock and bond markets. This paper will seek to further investigate this relationship by analysing the trends in Australian interest rate cycles and A-REITs performance using the capital asset pricing model. In particular, it will review performance data across five A-REITs sectors: diversified, industrial, retail, <b>office</b> and <b>specialised</b> (non-core) REITs. The analysis was undertaken over a 20 year period (1995 - 2015) involving A-REIT returns, macro-economic data, with the 90 -day bank bill yield and 10 -year government bond yield rates used respectively for short-term and long-term interest rate proxies. Findings indicate that both the diversified and retail sector exhibit strong relationship to market risk, short and long-term interest rates. Rising short-term interest rates contribute to positive returns while rising long-term interest rates result in lower returns. However, the impacts of movements in interest rates on industrial, <b>specialised</b> (non-core) and <b>office</b> sectors were not well explained by the asset pricing model. This could due to the relatively small size of these funds...|$|R
40|$|International {{examples}} {{prove that}} the concept of architecture, being as a total work of art, was adopted and used to support corporate image in office buildings. Since the Twenties, thanks to the designers of department stores, the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk became a sales tool and this new interpretation then transferred into office buildings. At the end of the Forties, in Italy, the typology of office-building was perfectly defined through the adoption of functional circulation schemes, conditioning systems, appropriate lighting, clear signposting and safety equipment. "Corporate modernism" was therefore completely established. In Italy, through a process of formal simplification and careful research of functional solutions, few office buildings epitomised the utilitarian and anti-monumental idea that characterised the Modern Movement. The taste for colour re-entered office design with a new perceptive function. Inlays in linoleum underlined the perfect geometries and the smooth surfaces of modernity. The new autarchic materials like Buxus (based on cellulose) were extensively used in furniture design to replace more expensive materials. The choice of materials was related to comfort, maintenance and durability. Important Italian architects of the period conceived the geometrical design of furniture as a reflection of the pure geometry of the architectural design. Right angles and smooth surfaces created abstract patterns of reflection on pure volumes which evoked cubic paintings. Giuseppe (Pogatschnig) Pagano (Parenzo 1896 - Mauthausen 1945) and Gino Levi Montalcini (Milano 1902 - Torino 1974) were among the Italian architect-designers involved in modern office design. They built and furnished Palazzo Salpa, alias Palazzo Gualino (Torino, 1928 - 1930) for Riccardo Gualino's Salpa company. Since the time of its construction, Palazzo Salpa is recognised as a prime example of the new rationalist architecture in Italy. It {{was the result of a}} total work of art where every detail was conceived to be a part of a whole. Salpa leather - the autarchic material patented by Salpa - was used to line the Stigler elevators and to cover the pavement of the boardroom with the aim of strengthening the corporate image. Ahead of its time, furnishings and furniture were designed by assigning an advertising value to the material produced by the company. In Palazzo Gualino all materials, colours, lighting, textiles, furniture and furnishings were carefully studied to realise the concept of company image that anticipated Olivetti's. For Palazzo Gualino, the architects designed 67 different pieces of furniture that were supposed to be the prototype for the new <b>specialised</b> production of <b>office</b> furniture in Fabbrica Italiana Pianoforti - F. I. P., bought by Gualino in 1927. Over the years much of the furniture disappeared and Palazzo Gualino was sold by the municipality in 2007. There is now a high risk of losing the original value of the building because it is soon to be reconverted into luxury apartments. On the one hand, the identity of office buildings is interrelated to the corporate image which may extend to interior design. On the other hand, the materials used in Modern Movement interiors were conceived to be renewed and replaced, not due to the wear of the material but in order to adapt to changing needs and fashions. The questions are: are the interior design changes compatible with the architectural conservation of office buildings? How can a unique interior design be preserved when a change of its functions occurs...|$|R
40|$| (originally {{known as}} maandschepenen) {{in the justice}} system, this is preceded by a {{discussion}} of the office of burgomaster. Two aldermen would hold this post for four weeks at a stretch, i. e. one administrative month. Known as richters in der tijt (judges of the period), they were also responsible for collecting the fines they imposed for breaches of the ordinances. The section on criminal justice successively discusses the matters of feuds and oorveden (pledges), fines and banishment, and kindergoed (orphans’ inheritances). Feuds between the town and extraneous persons or groups would be formally notified by means of ontzegbrieven (declarations of hostility). From 1336 on, the relevant data from incoming ontzegbrieven were recorded in a special register, known as the oorvedenboek. An oorvede could be either a pledge of peace from the losing party in a feud or a solemn oath by a freed prisoner to desist from revenge or judicial action (in German: Fehde-Urfehde and Haft-Urfehde). Feuds could be temporarily suspended by means of a vrede; their termination was marked by a formal reconciliation (zoen). Entries relating to settled feuds would be cancelled. The need for registration of feuds arose when their frequency increased. The prisoners’ oorveden found in the register were made by offenders against the municipal ordinances. From 1395 on, separate registers for the prisoners’ oorveden were used. In the course of the 15 th century, imprisonment and the oorvede, originally means of maintaining the peace, evolved into disciplinary measures. As regards fines and banishment, there is evidence that from 1344 there was a separate administration for criminal justice. More or less systematic registration of criminal cases took place from 1395 onwards. The information kept in the criminal-justice administration was used in drawing up the draft and fair editions of the cameraars’ accounts, particularly for entries under the heading of ‘receipt of fines’. Standing wholly by itself within the criminal justice system was the obligation for remarrying widows and widowers to declare the share of their dead spouse’s estate due to their children. From 1362 such notifications were recorded in registers. Failure to declare would result in a fine. The earliest extant kindergoed register covers the 1467 - 1494 period. Older records were destroyed when the information they contained became outdated. The municipal authorities of Deventer acquired competence in the area of voluntary jurisdiction even in the early 12 th century. Systematic registration was not adopted until the mid 222 1380 s. The following subjects are discussed successively: legacies outside Deventer, real-estate transactions (renunciaties), bonds, authorisations and local legacies. The straatschepenen {{played a key role in}} placing legatees in possession of their inheritance and in settling any conflicts arising from local legacies. It is only here that we see any competence, be it a limited one, delegated to the ward level. In the late 1450 s clerks employed by private individuals from outside the town clerk’s office, including schrijfmeesters (calligraphists) besides the notaries public, undermined the near-monopolistic position of the municipal authorities in the area of voluntary justice. Finally, the system of justice in disputes (contentious justice) is elucidated. The Deventer magistrate had powers in this field presumably from around 1325, and definitely after 1356. Initially the reported cases were not systematically recorded. This changed in 1423, most probably on the initiative of the meente. Henceforth the aldermen were obliged to have their judgements in contentious cases recorded in order to guarantee equality before the law. The judgements were entered in a register, known at the time as the clageboeck. In it, the town scribes also recorded the claims and pleas. In any case, dissenting parties would turn to the bench of aldermen only as a last resort. Besides the clageboeck also a register of property sequestrations (panding and besate) belongs to the sphere of contentious justice. By the mid- 14 th century, the Deventer municipal government had jurisdiction in all three areas discussed. The chronology of the documentalisation process without doubt reflects a hierarchy in the various parts of the justice system: registration of criminal cases enjoyed priority, because these touched upon civil order. Conflicts were in principle dealt with privately, and matters of voluntary law could be recorded as the parties desired. Political and economic factors - the call for equality before the law from the meente, and the growth of the urban population and the concurrent proliferation of trade fairs and transfers of goods and capital - in the 1420 s made it necessary to commit even voluntary matters to paper. Chapter 5 outlines the evolution of the various raadsambten, <b>specialised</b> <b>offices</b> held for a year by aldermen (and sometimes councillors) which developed in the early 14 th century. The central office was that of cameraar. In this study a new hypothesis is put forward with respect to the origin of the accounts kept by the cameraars: it appears that around 1330 a number of older, separate accounts were integrated into a single system, the cameraars’ accounts. Until 1344 the two cameraars kept communal accounts; after this year these were split up. In the course of the financial year, in summer and winter, the cameraars gave account before their fellow aldermen. A third, ‘great’ account would close the financial year. Because of the increasing complexity of municipal finance, the cameraars around 1390 started each to draw up six intermediate monthly accounts. Around the same time the cameraars also began to give account to the newly appointed bench of aldermen. From the mid- 15 th century, the meente exercised increasing supervision over municipal accounting. The cameraars’ accounts had an administrative substrate of lease registers, distraint registers (pandboeken), citizen registers and tax assessment lists. The condensed data from these were incorporated in the cameraars’ accounts. The lease registers of tenants and excise farmers in their turn were based on lists written out during the leasing sessions held in public buildings. After the cameraars, the offices of wijnheer, gruitmeester, hopmeester, timmermeester, tolmeester, weidegraaf, and straatmeester are examined. These were concerned with the excise on wine and beer, with tolls, and with the maintenance and management of public buildings, municipal pastures and streets. The tenure of these offices by aldermen involved the keeping of more or less extensive accounts, which also were part of the substrate for the cameraars’ accounts. Like the cameraars, all of these officials were financially accountable to their fellow administrators twice yearly from 1396 on. External and internal factors determined the timing and course of the documentalisation process in these departments. External factors might be of a political or economic nature such as the acquisition of princely privileges (excise on gruit, brewing ingredients), the growth of commerce (tolls) and innovations in food technology (the use of hops in brewing). Internal factors were the increasing professionalisation of the administrative apparatus, in which the ‘bureaucracy’ not only became more formally organised, but also employed increasing numbers of people. Naturally, the system of remuneration (under municipal control or through farming-out) also played a role. The accounts of the various officials allow conclusions to be drawn about the relationship between Latin and Middle Dutch as the language of administration, and about literacy rates among various sections of the population. It has emerged that initially the aldermen used the vernacular in the exercise of their raadsambten while the cameraars’ accounts were in Latin. This means that at some point in the administrative chain translations had to be made. In 1361 this inefficient procedure was abruptly and definitively abandoned, and Middle Dutch became the official written language at all levels. From then on, Latin was only exceptionally used at the town clerk’s office. Possibly political factors underlay this change of policy. A striking finding is that even in the 14 th century not only the administrative elite and much of the bureaucracy, but also many (master) artisans were literate. The 15 th century saw a further expansion of literacy in the urban community. To summarise, it can be said that the late- 13 th-century process of administrative documentalisation in Deventer was started off by closely associated social, political and cultural factors. These can all be linked to the emergence of a literate merchant class which managed to struggle from the grasp of the prince-bishop of Utrecht. The acceleration which the process underwent in the first half of the 14 th century was institutionally determined; it was associated with a specialisation of tasks within the municipal executive. From the early 15 th century new impulses arose from demands by the meente for, on the one hand, equality before the law and legal certainty and, on the other, greater supervision over the municipal finances. Besides this political factor, an economic force was felt at the same time: commercial and demographic growth. The process of administrative documentalisation took a different course in every medieval town. Even so, in the Northern Netherlands the developments within Deventer in terms of chronology as well as form and content are quite comparable to those of Utrecht, which was the capital of the prince-bishopric of the same name. A remarkable parallel in the earliest phase is the part played by chapters of secular clergy. In the county of Holland-Zeeland and in Friesland these did not exist; there the documentalisation of society originated in the monasteries. Deventer is the first town in the Northern Netherlands for which a study has been made of the entire municipal administration, covering such a long period. It is clear that research relating to the process of documentalisation in towns will produce fruitful new insights into the dynamism of urban society in general and the development of municipal institutions in particular. ...|$|R
