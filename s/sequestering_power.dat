40|$|A {{study on}} the {{interactions}} between CH 3 Hg+ and some S, N and O donor ligands (2 -mercaptopropanoic acid (thiolactic acid (H 2 TLA)), 3 -mercaptopropanoic acid (H 2 MPA), 2 -mercaptosuccinic acid (thiomalic acid (H 3 TMA)), D,L-penicillamine (H 2 PSH), L-cysteine (H 2 CYS), glutathione (H 3 GSH), N,N′-bis(3 -aminopropyl) - 1 - 4 -diaminobutane (spermine (SPER)), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -benzenehexacarboxylic acid (mellitic acid (H 6 MLT)) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H 4 EDTA)) is reported. The speciation models in aqueous solution and the possible structures of the complexes formed are discussed {{on the basis of}} potentiometric, calorimetric, UV spectrophotometric and electrospray mass spectrometric results. For the CH 3 Hg+–S donor ligand systems, the formation ofML 1 –z and MLH 2 –z complex species is observed, together with a diprotonated MLH 23 –z species for CYS 2 −, PSH 2 − and GSH 3 − and the mixed hydrolytic one ML(OH) −z for TLA 2 − and MPA 2 −. The dependence of the stability on ionic strength and on temperature is also analysed. In the other CH 3 Hg+-L systems (L 0 MLT 6 −, SPER and EDTA 4 −), ML 1 –z, MLH 2 –z and MLH 23 –z complex species are formed, together with the MLH 34 –z species for SPER, the mixed hydrolytic ML(OH) –z one for SPER and EDTA, and the M 2 L 2 –z for EDTA only. On the basis of the speciation models proposed, the sequestering ability of the ligands towards methylmercury(II) cation is evaluated. All S donor ligands show a good <b>sequestering</b> <b>power</b> (at 10 − 11 molL− 1 level, in the pH range 4 to 8) following the trend MPA 2 −<PSH 2 −<GSH 3 −<TLA 2 −<CYS 2 −<TMA 3 −, while significantly lower is the sequestering ability of MLT, SPER and EDTA (at 10 − 3 10 − 5 mol L− 1 level, in the pH range 4 to 8) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} objective of our project on CO 2 ocean sequestration is to investigate its technical feasibility {{and to improve}} the understanding of any associated environmental impacts. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} minimize any impacts associated with the eventual use of ocean carbon sequestration to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The project will continue through March 31, 2002, with a field experiment to take place in the summer of 2001 off the Kona Coast of Hawaii. At GHGT- 4 in Interlaken, we presented a paper detailing our plans. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an update on our progress to date and our plans to complete the project. The co-authors of this paper are members of the project’s Technical Committee, which has been formed to supervise the technical aspects and execution of this project. OVERVIEW One potential option to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 levels is to capture and <b>sequester</b> <b>power</b> plant CO 2. Commercial CO 2 capture technology, though expensive, exists today. However, the ability to sequester large quantities of CO 2 is uncertain. The deep ocean is one of only a few possible CO 2 disposal options (others include depleted oil and gas wells, coal beds, or deep saline aquifers), so it is important that we understand as much as possible about this option. In December 1997 an agreement was signed by Japan, Norway and the US under the auspices of th...|$|R
40|$|One {{option to}} reduce {{atmospheric}} CO{sub 2 } levels is {{to capture and}} <b>sequester</b> <b>power</b> plant CO{sub 2 }. Commercial CO{sub 2 } capture technology, though expensive, exists today. However, the ability to dispose of large quantities of CO{sub 2 } is highly uncertain. The deep ocean {{is one of only}} a few possible CO{sub 2 } disposal options (others are depleted oil and gas wells or deep, confined aquifers) and is a prime candidate because the deep ocean is vast and highly unsaturated in CO{sub 2 }. Technically, the term `disposal` is really a misnomer because the atmosphere and ocean eventually equilibrate on a time scale of 1000 years regardless of where the CO{sub 2 } is originally discharged. However, peak atmospheric CO{sub 2 } concentrations expected to occur in the next few centuries could be significantly reduced by ocean disposal. The magnitude of this reduction will depend upon the quantity of CO{sub 2 } injected in the ocean, as well as the depth and location of injection. Ocean disposal of CO{sub 2 } will only make sense if the environmental impacts to the ocean are significantly less than the avoided impacts of atmospheric release. In this project, we examined these ocean impacts through a multi-disciplinary effort designed to summarize the current state of knowledge. In the process, we have developed a comprehensive method to assess the impacts of pH changes on passive marine organisms. This final report addresses the following six topics: CO{sub 2 } loadings and scenarios, impacts of CO{sub 2 } transport, near-field perturbations, far-field perturbations, environmental impacts of CO{sub 2 } release, and policy and legal implications of CO{sub 2 } release...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{argue that}} {{sequestering}} of carbon waste is inherently {{more efficient and}} will probably cost less than using the carbon for biomass burning. The ratio of carbon emitted per unit of primary energy released through combustion, C/E, favors sequestration for fundamental reasons of chemistry and engineering, strongly suggesting a low C/E strategy. This is a more direct way of analysis than assigning dollar estimates to technologies of which we have as yet little or no direct experience. Crop residues can be a valuable resource for carbon <b>sequestering</b> and/or <b>power</b> generation. How should we assess the relative utilities of the two conflicting uses? We define residues as organic material remains left behind on fields after harvesting, such as corn stalks and husks. Often this bulk holds more carbon than the crop itself. During a growth season, crops store carbon from air, then exhale it as the crop residues rot, giving no net change in atmospheric CO 2. Rather than letting this carbon rot, one has two choices that reduce net carbon return to the atmosphere: (a) burn crop wastes to generate electrical power. This returns all the carbon content to the atmosphere (the same as in just letting it rot), but the powe...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium etli accumulates {{poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate}} (PHB) in symbiosis and in free life. PHB is {{a reserve}} material {{that serves as}} a carbon and/or electron sink when optimal growth conditions are not met. It has been suggested that in symbiosis PHB can prolong nitrogen fixation until the last stages of seed development, but experiments to test this proposition have not been done until now. To address these questions in a direct way, we constructed an R. etli PHB-negative mutant by the insertion of an Omega-Km interposon within the PHB synthase structural gene (phaC). The identification and sequence of the R. etli phaC gene are also reported here. Physiological studies showed that the PHB-negative mutant strain was unable to synthesize PHB and excreted more lactate, acetate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, fumarate, and malate than the wild-type strain. The NAD+/NADH ratio in the mutant strain was lower than that in the parent strain. The oxidative capacity of the PHB-negative mutant was reduced. Accordingly, the ability to grow in minimal medium supplemented with glucose or pyruvate was severely diminished in the mutant strain. We propose that in free life PHB synthesis <b>sequesters</b> reductive <b>power,</b> allowing the tricarboxylic acid cycle to proceed under conditions in which oxygen is a limiting factor. In symbiosis with Phaseolus vulgaris, the PHB-negative mutant induced nodules that prolonged the capacity to fix nitrogen...|$|R
