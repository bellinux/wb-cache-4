5000|$|Economically, the Queensland {{government}} {{supported the}} view advocated by Meston {{that the first}} duty of reserves was [...] "that they be <b>self-</b> <b>supporting</b> institutions". The labour of inmates as directed by the Superintendent focussed on grazing and agricultural production. Ringbarking and vegetation clearing, fencing, prickly pear cutting and tending to stock (initially sheep for wool and later beef cattle) were ongoing tasks throughout {{the life of the}} reserve. A range of crops were grown with varying degrees of success, with the reserve vulnerable to the extremes of flooding and droughts. Crops included cotton, potatoes, pumpkins, corn and melons, and stock fodder. An orchard of seven acres had been established by 1918 with 500 citrus trees. Between 1918 and 1922 another 9 acres (3.64 ha) is thought to have been used for orchard purposes and other fruits were grown. A 260 ft (79.25m) bore, capped by a windmill and connected to pipelines, tanks and stock troughs was sunk near the orchard for the reserve's water needs in 1916. The water's excessive iron content meant that it could not be used as effectively as hoped. Other infrastructure known to have been constructed included extensive fencing, horse yards, a woolshed in 1913, dams, a butcher's shop, new yards and a dip in 1919, a milling shed for a small sawbench and engine, and a bridge over the Dawson River.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{a body of}} {{work under}} the banner of 'spirituality in the workplace', which, {{although}} having precedents in numerous earlier writings examining the relationship between religion and organisational life, arguably began in the middle 1980 's and continues to the present. The literature appears to be broadly divided into those authors promoting the idea of a more spiritually informed workplace, and those offering more critical views; this study approaches the subject from this more critical position. More specifically, where most of the literature discusses the notion of 'spirituality in the workplace', and does not engage with theological or mystical work, this study offers a critical perspective based on empirical work carried out in two self-supporting spiritual communities, and therefore represents a consideration of 'work in a spiritual place'. Furthermore, the study is supported by reference to theological and mystical writing, as well as contributions from Jungian psychology. The empirical work takes the form of an ethnographic study of two <b>self-</b> <b>supporting</b> spiritual communities; a Benedictine monastery in Gloucestershire and a Buddhist giftware business based in Cambridge. Data was collected by in-depth interviews and participant observation spanning approximately two and a half years, and included substantial time spent in both communities. Essentially, the study finds that the form of spiritual workplace envisaged by much of the spirituality in the workplace writing differs from the experience of the people in these two communities in certain important respects. Most notably these communities do not adopt a managerial stance in regards to decision making and they also aspire to non-dualistic and non-reified orientations that contrast sharply with the emphases in the spirituality in the workplace literature. In addition, the communities studied here consciously engage with traditional symbol and ritual, and these represent the imaginal means by which the community is held together and by which the individual seeks spiritual growth. The conclusions drawn from these observations are that spiritual communities offer a rich source of understanding to organisation theory in general, and to the spirituality in the workplace discourse more specifically...|$|R

40|$|Power {{electronics}} based equipments {{are rapidly}} emerging as key {{components in the}} present modern power distribution system. Power processing utilizing these devices offer vast advantages such as flexible control, cost reduction, overall size optimization, etc. On the other hand, operation of these devices gives rise {{to some of the}} serious power quality problems, such as, the reactive power requirement and generation of harmonics that pollutes the power distribution system. Moreover, modern equipments are becoming highly sensitive to the voltage supplied to them. Increasing the generation capacities of existing power stations is difficult and expensive due to environmental constraints. Hence, improving the quality of power can not only make the power distribution systems healthier and more efficient, but also results in reduced power losses, and thus saving in terms of costs. Active power filters are widely used to tackle some of the important power quality problems. Recent trends are geared towards the realization of multitasking devices which can tackle several power quality problems simultaneously. The unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) {{is one of the most}} versatile active power filters that can compensate significant power quality issues, such as, voltage harmonics, voltage sag, voltage swell, voltage unbalance, voltage flicker, current harmonics, load reactive power, current unbalance, and neutral current. A UPQC consists of two voltage source inverters connected back to back with each other sharing a common <b>self-</b> <b>supporting</b> DC link. One inverter is controlled as a variable voltage source in same manner as in the series active power filter (APF), and the other as a variable current source which is similar in operation as that of the shunt APF. The existing literature suggests the dependency on shunt inverter to compensate the load reactive power demand. Moreover, the series inverter is always utilized to overcome all the voltage related problems. The voltage sags, swells and the flickers are short duration power quality problems. Hence, this traditional approach of utilizing the UPQC to compensate the power qualite problems shows a significant drawback of under usage of the available series inverter. Therefore, the utilization factor of the series inverter is much lower than that of the shunt inverter. The present doctoral work is based on the philosophy of optimal utilization of the available resources in a most effective and efficient way to improve the product efficiency and to reduce the overall cost. This work proposes a novel control concept, termed as power angle control (PAC), in which both the series and shunt inverters share the load reactive power in co-ordination with each other without affecting the basic UPQC compensation capabilities. This eventually results in a better utilization of the series inverter, reduction in the shunt inverter rating to some extent and ultimately in the reduction of the overall cost of UPQC. Moreover, this thesis also introduces a new functionality for UPQC in which, it is possible to extent the UPQC based three-phase three-wire system to a three-phase four-wire system. The developed PAC concept is successfully validated through digital simulation as well as extensive experimental investigations. The experimental results show that for the given laboratory test conditions with a highly inductive load, a boost in power angle 8 = 28 ° between the source and the resultant load voltage can reduce the shunt inverter rating by 50...|$|R

To support the vision, a great deal of research activity in pervasive computing and service systems has been devoted to solve problems such as: increasing dependability; <b>supporting</b> <b>self-</b> * features; enforcing context-awareness and adaptability; tolerating evolution over time and eventually ensuring that service frameworks can be highly-adaptive an...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} how {{health care}} provider communication was related to self-efficacy and caregiver burden in older spousal caregivers of oncology patients. A convenience sample of 66 older (over 60 years of age) spousal caregivers of patients with advanced disease, completed a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of {{health care provider}} communication, social <b>support,</b> <b>self-</b> efficacy, and caregiver burden. The communication and self-efficacy measures were developed for this study. A factor analysis was done on both measures and both had good validity (á >. 90). A multiple regression analysis was performed to test for predictors to caregiver burden. Neither communication, nor self-efficacy were significant predictors of caregiver burden. Nor was communication a predictor to self-efficacy. Gender and social support were the predictors of burden. Bivariate analyses had shown a correlation between a caregivers health status and increased burden. One major finding was that, although this {{was a group of}} caregivers caring for spouses with advanced or terminal disease, very few had seen a social worker and none had been referred to a hospice or palliative care program. No caregivers were using any community social services. Implications for social work include early assessments of older caregivers to help identify at-risk caregivers, and to provide appropriate referrals to alleviate burden. Other research implications include further testing of the communication and self-efficacy measures...|$|R
