25|$|In {{the time}} of the Roman Empire, silk {{textiles}} reached the West overland via the Silk Road across Asia from Han China, passing through the Parthian Empire and later Sassanid Empire to trading centers in Syria. Imports of raw silk, <b>silk</b> <b>yarn,</b> and finished fabrics are all recorded, but the techniques of producing these textiles from the silkworm bombyx mori remained a closely guarded secret of the Chinese until the Emperor of the East Justinian I (482–565) arranged to have silkworm eggs smuggled out of Central Asia in 553-54, setting the stage for the flowering of the Byzantine silk-weaving industry.|$|E
25|$|Silk {{and cotton}} were {{imported}} to Rome from China and India. As {{early as the}} 3rd century BC silk was being purchased by Roman traders from the Carthaginian ports of Tyre and Beirut, where it was woven and dyed after arriving from the far East. As Roman weaving techniques developed, <b>silk</b> <b>yarn</b> was used to make geometrically or freely figured damask, tabbies and tapestry. Some of these silk fabrics were extremely fine - around 50 threads or more per centimeter.

40|$|In {{the course}} of this {{research}} work woven synthetic prosthesis reinforced with natural <b>silk</b> <b>yarns</b> was designed and manufactured. Biomechanical properties of surgical natural silk were studied during designing {{of the structure of the}} walls of the prosthesis. The experiment gave good data of elasticity and strain properties in a process of laboratory testing of samples of natural fibers. The previous practical experience was also used, for example, various vascular prostheses made from polyurethane complex yarns and polyester monofilaments. As a result, the authors of the scientific work proposed a combined wall structure of vascular prosthesis, consisting of polyester, polyurethane, and natural <b>silk</b> surgical <b>yarns.</b> After the implantation of the synthetic prosthesis reinforced with natural <b>silk</b> <b>yarns,</b> these natural <b>silk</b> <b>yarns</b> completely dissolve in the body for several years. Living tissue is gradually growing into the walls of synthetic prosthesis, replacing dissolved natural <b>silk</b> <b>yarns.</b> Experimental tests confirmed that a modulus of elasticity of innovative prosthesis is close to modulus of elasticity of natural blood vessels.

40|$|Durable, {{electrically}} conducting yarns are {{a critical}} component of electronic textiles (e-textiles). Here, such yarns with exceptional wear and wash resistance are realized through dyeing silk from the silkworm Bombyx mori with the conjugated polymer:polyelectrolyte complex PEDOT:PSS. A high Young's modulus of approximately 2 GPa combined with a robust and scalable dyeing process results in up to 40 m long yarns that maintain their bulk electrical conductivity of approximately 14 S cm(- 1) when experiencing repeated bending stress as well as mechanical wear during sewing. Moreover, a high degree of ambient stability is paired with the ability to withstand both machine washing and dry cleaning.

40|$|Background: Dragon {{fruit is}} one of the plant that can be {{extracted}} to be a natural dye. This fruit is contained a betacyanin pigment which can be dyed on to the textile fibers. The natural dye was extracted using water extraction. The betacyanin pigment was applied onto the spun <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn.</b> Two kinetic models, the pseudo first order model and pseudo-second order model were selected to follow the adsorption process. Kinetic parameters such as rate constant, equilibrium capacities and correlation coefficients for each kinetic equation were calculated and discussed. Objective: The main objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the adsorption and kinetic parameters of dyeing betacyanin pigment extract from dragon fruit skin onto spun <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn.</b> Result: It was shown that the adsorption betacyanin pigment onto spun <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn</b> could be described by the pseudo-second order. The rate of constant was increased as temperature increased. The activation energy calculated was 55. 7 kJ/mol for spun silk and 44. 5 kJ/mol indicated that the adsorption process was controlled by chemisorption. The thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° were also calculated. The negative values of ΔG° and ΔH° obtained indicated that the process of adsorption of betacyanin pigment adsorbed onto spun <b>silk</b> and acrylic <b>yarn</b> were spontaneous and exothermic. The values of ΔS° is negative indicated that the randomness of dye molecule distribution was increased as temperature increased.
