50|$|Myoxocephalus scorpius, known {{variously}} as the shorthorn sculpin, <b>short-spined</b> <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion,</b> bull-head, bull-rout and the father-lasher, is a {{demersal fish}} of the Northern Atlantic and adjacent subarctic coasts, {{and of the}} Arctic including the coasts of Alaska and Siberia. It reaches maturity at 15 - 30 cm in length and specimens from the Arctic and subarctic, which grow to the largest size, can reach up to 60 cm. The fish has a squat appearance, a large spiny head and a tapering body. It is a mottled grey-brown in colour but can be darker, including black as base coloring. It has a large mouth and spiny gill covers.|$|E
40|$|During {{a three-year}} field study, {{interspecific}} and interannual {{differences in the}} trophic ecology of littoral fish species were investigated in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland Island (North Sea). We investigated trophic niche partitioning of common coexisting littoral fish species based on a multi tracer approach using stable isotope and fatty acids {{in order to show}} differences and similarities in resource use and feeding modes. The results of the dual tracer approach showed clear trophic niche partitioning of the five target fish species, the goldsinny wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus, the painted goby Pomatoschistus pictus, the <b>short-spined</b> <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> Myoxocephalus scorpius and the long-spined sea scorpion Taurulus bubalis. Both stable isotopes and fatty acids showed distinct differences in the trophic ecology of the studied fish species. However, the combined use of the two techniques added an additional resolution on the interannual scale. The sand goby P. minutus showed the largest trophic plasticity with a pronounced variability between years. The present data analysis provides valuable information on trophic niche partitioning of fish species in the littoral zones of Helgoland and on complex benthic food webs in general. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} a cellulase {{from the}} digestive organs of the <b>short-spined</b> <b>sea</b> urchin Strogylocentrotus intermedius {{using a combination}} of ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration together with an assay for carboxymethylcellulase activity. The isolated cellulase was stained as a single band by Congo red. The molecular weight of the isolated cellulase, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, was 59 kDa. The isolated cellulase exhibited hydrolytic activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose, with an optimum temperature and pH of 30 ℃ and pH 8. 0, respectively. The thermal stability of the enzyme was characterized by determining the temperature at which activity decreased by 50 % with treatment for 30 min at pH 7. 0 and found to be 32 ℃. Cellulase activity remained at a high level at 5 - 20 ℃, which is the growth temperature of the <b>short-spined</b> <b>sea</b> urchin. These results confirm that the <b>short-spined</b> <b>sea</b> urchin should preferably be reared at a water temperature of < 20 ℃...|$|R

50|$|Paracorynactis hoplites {{are highly}} {{efficient}} predators of echinoderms. They specialize in preying on <b>sea</b> stars and <b>short-spined</b> <b>sea</b> urchins. They are also known to prey on sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and nudibranchs {{to a lesser}} extent, which indicates that they can potentially prey upon all soft-bodied slow-moving animals. They are also believed to supplement their diet with plankton when prey is scarce, as with other corallimorphs and sea anemones. But they will also refuse additional food once a prey has been recently captured and digested.|$|R
5000|$|Megalograptus (Greek for [...] "big writing") is a 4 ft Ordovician {{eurypterid}} (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpion),</b> and {{was among}} the earliest known genera (and {{was a member of}} the family Megalograptidae). The generic name is derived from the fact that its first fossils were of its very spiny legs, which were mistaken for massive graptolites. It lived from 460 to 445 mya. Megalograptus preyed on fish, trilobites, other <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions,</b> and smaller orthocones, using the spines on their claws to feel for their prey hiding in the sand and mud. Adult Cameroceras, along with the bigger <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> species, preyed on it. Megalograptus did not have a stinger, but may have curled its tail and sword-like telson forward as a threat pose, much like a scorpion.|$|R

50|$|Fossils of Pterygotus are {{relatively}} common, although complete skeletons are rare. It {{was one of}} the last of the gigantic sea scorpions: later species were much smaller and more nimble. The decline of the larger <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> may be related to their relative slowness and possible vulnerability during moulting, since they could not escape to land like smaller <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions.</b> However, the latter is unlikely since Pterygotus was such a large creature.|$|R

5000|$|Pentecopterus decorahensis is an extinct <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{that lived}} during the Middle Ordovician period, {{as early as}} 467.3 million years ago.

Other notable <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> include the more recent Silurian-aged Acutiramus, and Devonian Jaekelopterus, the only arthropod currently known to surpass P. decorahensis in size.

50|$|Merostomata is a {{class of}} chelicerate {{arthropods}} that contains the extinct Eurypterida (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> and the extant Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs).

5000|$|Strobilopterus {{probably}} {{was one of}} the closest relatives of Dolichopterus, but overall the phylogeny and systematics of the family Dolichopteridae is disputed: some place it closer to the Eurypteridae, while others assign it to the second lineage of <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> which contains the Stylonuridae.|$|R

50|$|Horseshoe crabs were {{traditionally}} grouped {{with the}} extinct eurypterids (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> as the Merostomata. They may have {{evolved in the}} shallow seas of the Paleozoic Era (570-248 million years ago) with other primitive arthropods like the trilobites. The four species of horseshoe crab are the only remaining members of the Xiphosura, {{one of the oldest}} classes of marine arthropods.|$|R
50|$|Until a {{few decades}} ago it was thought that Palaeophonus, {{similarly}} to many other scorpions of the Silurian, was one of the earliest animals to have conquered the land. In fact, a closer examination of the fossils has determined that these animals possess well developed gills, very similar to those of contemporary Eurypterids (or <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions).</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions,</b> extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|R

2500|$|The long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion,</b> a small stout fish which grows about 29cm long, {{is another}} {{temporary}} resident of rocky pools. They have large black eyes, a large mouth, and four long spines—two {{on each side}} on the gill cover—that stick out when the fish {{is removed from the}} water. They also have an organ like a finger on each side of their mouths which helps them catch prey. Because of their broad heads, they are also called [...] "bullheads". They have a variety of effective camouflaged colours ranging from shades of browns with cream blotches, to orange and red with white blotches. They can also change their body colour to match their surroundings. They are found around the coasts of Northern Europe in shallow rocky waters hiding amongst seaweed. They are also found in rock pools and sometimes in waters 30 m deep. Long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> lay eggs amongst seaweed or attached to rock crevices. The young hatch after two or three weeks, and go through several development stages before maturing into adults.|$|R

50|$|Eurypterids (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> were {{a diverse}} group of aquatic and {{possibly}} amphibious predators that included the most massive arthropods to have existed. They survived over 200 million years, but finally died out in the Permian-Triassic extinction event along with trilobites and most other forms of life present at the time, including most of the dominant terrestrial therapsids. The Early Devonian Jaekelopterus reached an estimated length of 2.5 m, not including its raptorial chelicerae, and is thought to have been a freshwater species.|$|R
