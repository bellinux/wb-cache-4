40|$|Since {{executives}} typically receive new {{grants of}} stock options (ESOs) each year, longerserving executives often have portfolios of ESOs with differing strikes and maturities. Valuation models for stand-alone ESO grants {{have shown that}} trading restrictions, which force executives to bear unhedgeable risk until the options are exercised, induce earlier exercise and hence a lower cost to shareholders than in a risk-neutral setting. However, since unhedgeable risk varies non-linearly with portfolio size and composition, the executive’s exercise strategy and thus also the <b>shareholder</b> <b>cost</b> of an option held {{as part of a}} portfolio depend also on the remainder of the executive’s ESO portfolio. We show that such portfolio effects matter- lowering both the moneyness required for exercise and the <b>shareholder</b> <b>cost</b> of most options in a portfolio. In contrast to a risk-neutral setting, both exercise thresholds and costs depend on an option’s position in the optimal exercise order. An option’s cost varies with the maturities and, nonlinearly, with the strike prices of other options in the executive’s portfolio. The model explains several empirical findings in the literature- which options are attractive to exercise first, how exercise can be induced by a new grant, and the prevalence of early exercise...|$|E
40|$|How costly is the repriceable {{employee}} {{stock option}} This paper develops an intensity-based model, which reflects the special features of repriceable {{employee stock option}}s (ESOs), to assess their <b>shareholder</b> <b>cost</b> and explore their early exercise pattern. Several numerical analyses are used to examine how single or multiple resetting affects the value of ESOs. Three characteristics of repriceable options are found. First, their value does not monotonically increase {{with the amount of}} reduction of exercise price. Second, multiple resetting increases option value more than does single resetting. Lastly, option holders of repriceable ESOs postpone their exercise before repricing. But once the exercise price has been reset, option holders are more likely to exercise the ESOs early. The model used in this paper is proposed {{as an alternative to the}} Barrier Option pricing formula for measuring the cost of repriceable ESOs for accounting and regulation purposes. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} the cost of repriceable options, and to investigate whether repriceable employee stock options (ESOs) cost more than standard ESOs in providing incentives to employees. Design/methodology/approach – This paper develops an intensity-based model, reflecting the special features of repriceable ESOs. The model is used to assess <b>shareholder</b> <b>cost</b> of repriceable ESOs, to explore their early exercise pattern and to compare their incentive effect with standard ESOs. Findings – Two main conclusions arise. First, option holders of repriceable ESOs postpone their exercise before repricing. But, once the exercise price has been reset, option holders {{are more likely to}} exercise ESOs early. Second, option repricing is less cost-effective than standard options in providing incentives. Practical implications – This research finds that issuing new options proves more efficient than option repricing in providing incentives. In turn, this research offers a practical guideline to companies confronted with underwater options. Originality/value – Constructing and applying a more accurate valuation model than those previously developed, this paper investigates several important questions about ESOs repricing. Chiefly, this research helps academics and practitioners better understand the cost of repriceable options, how repricing influences employees’ early exercise decisions, and whether option repricing is cost-effective in providing incentives. These are important questions to ask, filling gaps in the existing literature. Compensation, Employees, Incentive schemes, Stock options...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether the {{presence}} of multiple large shareholders alleviates a firm's agency costs and information asymmetry manifested {{in the cost of}} equity financing. Using data for 1165 corporations from 8 East Asian and 13 Western European countries, we find evidence that the implied cost of equity decreases with the presence, number, and voting size of large shareholders beyond the controlling owner. We also find that the identity of the second largest shareholder is important in determining the risk of corporate expropriation in family-controlled firms. Our regional analysis reveals that, mainly in East Asian firms, multiple large shareholders structures exert an internal governance role in curbing private benefits and reducing information asymmetry, perhaps to sidestep deficiencies in the external institutional environment.

40|$|Using a new database, {{we study}} fees charged by 46, 580 mutual fund classes {{offered for sale}} in 18 countries, which account for about 86 % of the world fund {{industry}} in 2002. We examine management fees, total expense ratios, and total <b>shareholder</b> <b>costs</b> (including load charges). Fees vary substantially across funds and from country to country. To explain these differences, we consider fund, sponsor, and national characteristics. Fees differ by investment objectives: larger funds and fund complexes charge lower fees; fees are higher for funds distributed in more countries and funds domiciled in certain offshore locations (especially when selling into countries levying higher taxes). Substantial cross-country differences persist even after controlling for these variables. These remaining differences {{can be explained by}} a variety of factors, the most robust of which is that fund fees are lower in countries with stronger investor protection. The Author 2008.

30|$|Capital {{valuation}} adjustment (KVA) {{accounts for}} the cost of equity capital a bank incurs when entering a derivative trade. To explain the concept, some would say KVA is affine to FVA, in the sense that, in both cases, the cost is associated with a source of funding. The difference is that KVA, rather than measuring the funding cost coming from debt, refers to the funding cost from equity. That is, as a new deal is agreed on, it generates a cost of borrowing from the <b>shareholder.</b> That <b>cost</b> is normally of comparable scale to that of other valuation adjustments, which means its importance cannot be underestimated.|$|R

The model shows that as the efficiency of legal institutions decreases, <b>shareholder’s</b> monitoring <b>costs</b> increase, the price {{that they are willing to}} pay for shares of the company decreases, and, in consequence, the market value of publicly traded firms decreases. The low market value of public firms leads firm owners to avoid the capital market.

40|$|Inquiries {{about this}} {{document}} {{can be made}} to HARC@hawaii. edu This paper examines how the type of news affects firms’ voluntary disclosures. We exploit hand-collected product-level disclosures made by publicly-traded biotech firms, which provide evidence of drugs’ progression through key regulatory milestones towards marketability. Of note, the disclosures allow us to distinguish firms’ treatment of good news (i. e., when drugs progress towards marketability) versus bad news (i. e., when drugs are abandoned). We first document that firms increase disclosures following good news (e. g., consistent with incentives to maximize shareholder value), as well as following bad news (e. g., consistent with minimizing <b>shareholder</b> litigation <b>costs).</b> Critically, we then document that the increase in disclosure for good news is higher relative to that for bad news, suggesting that firms view the net benefits associated with disclosure of good news as stronger relative to those for bad news.

40|$|Financial {{report is}} a tool of agent’s (management’s) {{responsibility}} to principal (owner) in the agency relationship. Recently, more parties need the financial report because the entity has more contract relationships.

In preparing financial report, management uses accrual accounting which is considered able to provide more accurate information than cash accounting due {{to the possibility of}} applying matching principle. Earnings management phenomenon exist in financial reporting of an entity because accounting standards still provide opportunities to choose accounting treatment to be used. This would give chance for earnings management to happen. Assumptions laid behind earnings management are opportunistic consideration (personal interest), efficient contract, and decisions made based on accounting income.

40|$|ABSTRACT Milton Friedman {{argued that}} the social {{responsibility}} of firms is to maximize profits. This paper examines this argument for the economic environment envisioned by Friedman in which citizens can personally give to social causes and can invest in profit-maximizing firms and firms that give {{a portion of their}} profits to social causes. Citizens obtain social satisfaction from corporate social giving, but corporate giving may not be a perfect substitute for personal giving. The paper presents a theory of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and shows that CSR is costly when it is an imperfect substitute. When investors anticipate the CSR, shareholders do not bear its cost. Instead, the entrepreneurs who form the CSR firms bear the <b>cost.</b> <b>Shareholders</b> bear the <b>cost</b> of CSR only when it is a surprise, and it is to such surprises that Friedman objects. A social entrepreneur is willing to form a CSR firm at a financial loss because either doing so expands the opportunity sets of citizens in consumption-social giving space or there is an entrepreneurial warm glow from forming the firm. Firms can also undertake strategic CSR activities that increase profits, and a social entrepreneur carries strategic CSR beyond profit maximization and market value maximization. The paper also examines the implications of taxes and the effect of the market for control for the sustainability of CSR.
