25|$|There are {{two main}} interpretations for this disparity: either the {{universe}} began with a small preference for matter (total baryonic number of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second {{point of view is}} preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.|$|E
25|$|But <b>somehow,</b> <b>a</b> small {{misunderstanding}} arose between Mahatma Gandhi and Sree Narayana Guru, {{regarding the}} modus operandi of the Satyagraha. One of Guru's dialogues with the General Secretary of the SNDP was misinterpreted {{in such a}} way that it led to believe that the ideals of Gandhiji and Guru clashed. There was a stage when someone suggested to Gandhiji to withdraw the support for the Satyagraha because the spiritual leader of the Thiyyas was urging his followers to use violence, which is against the principles of Satyagraha.|$|E
25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of {{imagination}} scarcely ever recorded. It's breathtaking. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>a</b> bold assurance of intention {{has met with}} a hunger for experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity. The flesh of the song will balloon out or contort into unimaginable patterns; indecipherable echoes volley between {{the walls of the}} recording; glassy, splintered tones pierce the luxuriant sheen of the mix. Repeated listens trick the sense of balance; tremendous risks are taken.|$|E

[...] "Art of War" [...] was released as a single in early December. Somewhere Somehow was released on December 16 through Ozone Entertainment. Following a U.S. tour in March 2014, the group toured Japan and Australia, before joining Warped Tour. A music video was released for [...] "That Feeling" [...] in mid-January 2015. Somewhere Somehow peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200, and reached the top 10 on several other Billboard charts. It also charted in the top 20 on several UK charts. Despite receiving a mixed critical reception, Clark regarded the album as [...] "a huge success!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 19 September 1819, Keats walked near Winchester {{along the}} River Itchen. In {{a letter to}} his friend John Hamilton Reynolds written on 21 September, Keats {{described}} the impression the scene had made upon him and its influence on the composition of [...] "To Autumn": [...] "How beautiful the season is now [...] How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik'd stubble fields so much as now [...] <b>Somehow</b> <b>a</b> stubble plain looks warm [...] {{in the same way that}} some pictures look warm [...] this struck me so much in my sunday's walk that I composed upon it." [...] Not everything on Keats's mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon Hyperion. Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem. Keats did not send [...] "To Autumn" [...] to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, Keats's publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.|$|E
500|$|While Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{was pleased}} Blaine's season three {{transfer}} to McKinley {{in the first}} episode increased Criss' screen time with Colfer and the New Directions cast, she stated that the move [...] "screams of co-dependency." [...] In contrast, Entertainment Weekly Abby West found it romantic, and noted: [...] "Blaine and Kurt, with their budding love and witty, pseudo-urbane ways, are my favorite couple to watch. ... I {{look forward to hearing}} [...] sing more, watching him bump up against the insular Glee clubbers, and seeing him show off his non-uniform attire. Several reviewers were unhappy with the second episode's revelation that Blaine was a junior, not a senior like Kurt, as had been implied in the previous season. VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine [...] "seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer", Billboard Rae Votta noted [...] "the continuity-bending plot point that he's <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend", and Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News allowed her exasperation to show: [...] "Oh really, Glee? Blaine's a junior? Blaine's younger than Kurt? Fine. FINE." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on Kurt's storyline as he faced being {{perceived}} primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president. VanDerWerff {{said it was}} [...] "the most consistent" [...] storyline, and Canning called it [...] "the most familiar story", but also described Kurt as [...] "by far the most interesting and most layered" [...] character, his stories [...] "delivering the most emotional connections", and this episode's installments [...] "entertaining territory". Kubicek stated that there were [...] "tons" [...] of wonderful [...] "Kurt moments" [...] in the episode. Benigno called Kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on the show [...] "kind of awkward", and Hyman asked [...] "Was this Kurt Accepts He's Special 3.0 or 4.0? I can't keep track." [...] Votta summed up Kurt's audition quandary: [...] "Kurt is fighting typecasting, and while the ninjitsu, fingerless gloves and climbing routine {{might have been an}} attempt to butch it up, instead Kurt played right into expectations with the over-the-top Funny Girl piece." [...] His attempt to rescue the situation by reauditioning via performing a Romeo and Juliet scene with Rachel evoked laughter from the three directors and Rachel herself, but as Votta points out, Kurt was [...] "not actually being bad as Romeo". Jayma Mays, who plays Emma, one of the directors in that scene, stated in an interview that she thought Kurt was [...] "good". Kurt finding himself in competition with Blaine was also touched on, but several reviewers were unhappy with the revelation that Blaine was not a senior like Kurt, as had been implied in the previous season. VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine [...] "seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer", Votta noted [...] "the continuity-bending plot point that he's <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend", and Urban allowed her exasperation to show: [...] "Oh really, Glee? Blaine's a junior? Blaine's younger than Kurt? Fine. FINE." [...] MTV Jim Cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay: [...] "It's hard to keep my bearings straight / And oh, how it makes my heart ache / Kurt and Blaine were gonna move to New York together / But now they'll have to wait", referring to a scene in the [...] "New York" [...] episode where Kurt discussed the planned move with Rachel.|$|E
2500|$|As another example, Alan Hayward {{stated in}} Creation and Evolution (1985) that [...] "Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it {{presents}} them {{with one of}} their most insoluble problems. They believe that <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> whale must have evolved from an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea and lost its legs ... A land mammal that {{was in the process of}} becoming a whale would fall between two stools—it would not be fitted for life on land or at sea, and would have no hope for survival." [...] The evolution of whales has been documented in considerable detail, with Ambulocetus, described as looking like a three-metre long mammalian crocodile, as one of the transitional fossils.|$|E
2500|$|Rivera {{claimed that}} the Jesuit order was {{responsible}} for the creation of communism, Islam, and Nazism, and causing the World Wars, recession, the Jonestown Massacre, and the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy (a Catholic). Rivera further claims that the Catholic Church wants to spread homosexuality and abortion notwithstanding the church's stated opposition to homosexual acts and abortion, that the Charismatic Movement which is a non Catholic Christian movement is <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> [...] "front" [...] for the Catholic Church. He further {{claimed that the}} Popes are antichrists, and that the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon. He has also claimed that the Jesuits were the masterminds behind the Medieval Inquisition in the 13th century. The Jesuits were in fact founded in 1534.|$|E

2500|$|The {{doctrines of}} {{marginalism}} and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> response to Marxist economics. However {{the first volume}} of Das Kapital was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, Hayek or Bartley has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the British Museum, may have come across the works of {{one or more of these}} figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of Kapital before his death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1944, {{through the}} papal nuncio in Budapest, Angelo Rotta, the pope urged the Hungarian {{government}} to moderate {{its treatment of}} the Jews. The pope ordered Rotta and other papal legates to hide and shelter Jews. These protests, along with others from the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, and Britain led to the cessation of deportations on 8 July 1944. Also in 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept [...] "emergency passports", although it also took {{the intervention of the}} U.S. State Department for those countries to honor the documents. The Kaltenbrunner Report to Hitler, dated 29 November 1944, {{against the backdrop of the}} 20 July 1944 Plot to assassinate Hitler, states that the Pope was <b>somehow</b> <b>a</b> conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), as being a party in the attempt.|$|E

In July 2005, Manson told Rolling Stone that he was shifting his focus from music to filmmaking – [...] "I just don't think the world is worth putting music into right now.

2500|$|By 1894 Willamette Chief {{had come}} to the end of her useful life, and was moored at Albina, Oregon {{awaiting}} dismantling. [...] By this time the steamer was owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company which arranged to have its wheat dock located near the coal tipples for its steam locomotives. [...] Moored at the wheat dock, as was often the case, was a ship loading wheat, and across the river from the ship was the Willamette Chief. [...] <b>Somehow</b> <b>a</b> fire ignited at a coal tipple, perhaps caused by inflammable coal dust. [...] The burning tipple ignited the wheat dock. [...] Men on the dock desperately hacked at the ship's moorings to get her free before she could catch fire. [...] Just as the wheat ship came free of the dock, the coal tipple collapsed in flames and fire leapt up into the ship's rigging. [...] Drifting free, the burning ship crashed into Willamette Chief which herself was quickly consumed by the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Dawn of {{the second}} day blasted the hopes of the defenders. The weather moderated enough that the Union fleet could return and resume its bombardment; they were also able to drive off the {{transport}} bringing reinforcements. (<b>Somehow</b> <b>a</b> ship {{was able to get}} in, but rather than bringing in more troops she carried away some of the wounded.) The fleet initially kept in motion, but they soon found that they were out of range of the guns in the fort. After that, the ships did not alter their positions, but poured their fire into the fort with no danger of reply. There was nothing the men in the forts could do except endure. After about three hours, Barron called a council of the officers, and they decided to seek terms, even though casualties had been quite light. (The actual numbers of dead and wounded are known only very imprecisely. Various reports give the number of dead as from four to seven, and the wounded as from 20 to 45) [...] At a little after 11:00a.m., the white flag was shown. Butler insisted upon surrender, which Barron agreed to. The battle came to a close, and the survivors went into prisoner-of-war camps. The list of prisoners had 691 names, including those wounded but not evacuated.|$|E
