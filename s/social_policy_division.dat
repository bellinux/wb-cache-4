40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{analysis}} of pension systems in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The result of this analysis is the evaluation and comparison of these systems and their functionality {{for the needs of}} present and future generations of retired people. In 2016, the second pillar of the pension system in the Czech Republic was cancelled. This pillar was established in 2013. Its creation and existence was deemed unsuccessful. In contrast with the Slovak system where the second pillar operates eleven years and has a large number of participants. Theories of causes of failure of the second pillar in the Czech Republic in the last year came up a lot. The importance of initial conditions of the other pillars in the pension system before the reform was crucial for the success of the new, now canceled that second pillar. The theoretical part of thesis studies <b>social</b> <b>policy,</b> its <b>divisions</b> and implementation. Subsequently there are descriptions of general models of pension systems, their financing methods and possibilities of implementation. The practical part analyzes the historical development and current form of pension systems in the Czech and Slovak Republics.

This chapter seeks to illustrate the importance or other wise {{of the nature of the}} public-private mix in incomes in old age both in producing this improvement in wellbeing and in leading to differences in the level of wellbeing enjoyed by different types of person.

This Appendix, set up as a reference guide, introduces the reader to ten methods that have been used in different development situations to achieve various objectives. These include: workshop-based and community-based methods for collaborative decisionmaking, methods for stakeholder consultation, and methods for incorporating participation and social analysis into project design. The methods are first introduced in a matrix; then each is briefly described, including background, a step-by-step description, suggested further readings, and an example. Each method is compared and contrasted with the others and their advantages and disadvantages noted to help Task Managers choose those most useful to them. A glossary of available tools, many of which are components of the methods, follows the summaries. More details on both the methods and the tools {{can be found in the}} forthcoming Environment Department Paper Methods and Tools for Social Assessment and Participation. Reading about participatory techniques will familiarize Bank staff and others with terminology and context, but learning from one’s colleagues who have experience with these methods and tools is also helpful.

40|$|In {{this article}} a current European multi-national project in patient safety is described. This project began in Feb. 2005 and {{will run for}} two years. It is managed by a {{consortium}} of seven NGO’s led by the CBO (Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement) and receives 60 %of its funding from DGSANCO (the health and <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> <b>division</b> of the European Commission). The policy framework within which the project evolved is also described. Despite the constraints of Art 152 of the Treaty, support from Commissioner Byrne encouraged a High Level Reflection process (HLRP) on patient mobility and healthcare developments in the EU, which started in June 2002 and involved European Health Ministers. As a result a series of very positive recommendations were made {{at the end of}} 2003 which subsequently were accepted and have affected policy direction {{in a number of areas}} e. g. co-operation on e-health, better use of resources as well as quality issues such as patient safety and quality implications of cross-border patient flows. The paper then reviews current issues in patient safety activity within Europe. Finally the Simpatie project is described. It is comprised of four main elements. First, a mapping exercise to determine the present status of patient safety activity within at least 20 European countries. It utilises extensive existing networks within and between the members of the consortium and other relevant stakeholders within Europe. Secondly, a “tool-box” exercise attempts to define common terminology and an expert consensus on measurement tools. This is complemented by the third element, a strategy component which aims to define the basic elements of different approaches to implementing patient safety within health systems. Finally, the last element is dissemination, where involvement of both public and health user organisations will be an important component...|$|E
40|$|This {{creative}} project {{resulted in}} a student-athlete <b>social</b> media <b>policy</b> and crisis communications plan for Ball State University’s athletics department. This particular research focused on the crisis management practice developed by W. Timothy Coombs (1999, 2007, 2014). Coombs argues crisis management occurs in three stages and describes crisis management should be accomplished through internal and external communication. This formed the theoretical foundation of the creative project. The researcher sought to discover the most common elements of a purposive sample of Division I universities and how they employ their student-athlete <b>social</b> media <b>policies</b> by determining the most common steps to monitor student-athlete social media activity. This was achieved through a content analysis of <b>social</b> media <b>policies</b> from <b>Division</b> I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Mid-American Conference (MAC) universities. These universities are a convenience sample and were chosen because Ball State University is in the MAC and is a FBS university. This analysis was evaluated and combined with the researcher’s previous qualitative research that examined Ball State University’s athletics department {{and its role in}} monitoring student-athlete social media. From these two studies, two theory-based materials were developed. First, a <b>social</b> media <b>policy</b> was developed specifically for Ball State University. Secondly, a crisis communication plan was constructed based on Coombs’ theoretical crisis management foundation in order to help in future crises that might occur in the Ball State Athletics Department as a result of student-athlete social media behavior.

40|$|An {{exploration}} of the emerging <b>policy</b> <b>divisions</b> within <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and practice {{in responding to the}} needs of children on the one hand, and parents on the other. The child and family policy divide is an analytical study of the principal areas of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> affected by this split. It is a split that pervades family law, government planning structures for children and parents, and almost every service associated with family life, including health, education, criminal justice, financial support and child protection. Drawing on both UK and international evidence, this study examines the nature of the interests involved, and its causes and consequences, and formulates possible resolutions to the policy, administrative and legal difficulties emerging in this area. It assesses the relationship between child and family policy, considers trends associated with the pivotal Children Act 1989, and examines its consequences in the context of recent thinking and developments. It also assesses ways of balancing the interests of adults and children and supporting the family as a whole where this is to mutual advantage. The authors propose a comprehensive family policy informed by principles that are consistent with human rights legislation. They emphasise the importance of safeguarding children’s rights and promoting child welfare and child protection. Coming at a time when government responses to child and family policy issues are subject to radical change, the report is critical reading for all those engaged in shaping <b>social</b> <b>policy,</b> family law and human rights.
