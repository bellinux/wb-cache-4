40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the tensile strength properties of Rx Naturelle Plus and Option (high-palladium) alloys on <b>soldered</b> <b>connectors</b> under simulated preceramic and postceramic soldering conditions. Materials and methods: Eighty cylindrical castings were fabricated (40 using Rx Naturelle Plus alloy and 40 using Option alloy). The 40 castings for each alloy were subdivided into 2 groups of 20 each. In the first group, castings for each alloy were randomly paired and soldered with SMG 2 solder to produce 10 preceramic test connector specimens for each alloy. In the second group, castings were similarly paired and soldered with 490 fine solder to produce 10 postceramic test connector specimens for each alloy. Each <b>solder</b> <b>connector</b> {{was subjected to}} tensile force until failure using an Instron testing machine. Statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test was performed. Results: No {{significant difference was found}} between the mean connector strength for Rx Naturelle Plus preceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 50, 000 Psi; STD, 11, 250) compared to Option preceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 59, 700. 4 Psi; STD, 16, 350) (p= 0. 1202). However, the connector strength for Rx Naturelle Plus postceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 37, 800 Psi; STD, 32, 450) was significantly lower than the Option postceramic solder (mean tensile failure stress, 45, 300 Psi; STD, 17, 550) (p= 0. 0407). Not only did Rx Naturelle Plus postceramic <b>solder</b> <b>connectors</b> show evidence of lower strength, but also an increased variation among specimens. Conclusions: Rx Naturelle Plus <b>solder</b> <b>connectors</b> provided better strength with the preceramic are opposed with the postceramic connectors. For postsolder connectors, Rx Naturelle Plus alloy had less acceptable strength and a wider variation, suggesting it is more technique sensitive than Option alloy connectors...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The goal {{of every}} {{prosthetic}} management is to simulate nature {{and be in}} harmony with nature within the physiological limits. The occlusal forces on a fixed dental prosthesis are transmitted to the surrounding structures through pontics, connectors and retainers and more stresses are seen at the connector region. To analyze the stress patterns in cast and <b>soldered</b> <b>connectors</b> between the two pontics and between the retainer and pontic of a four unit fixed dental prosthesis on axial and non axial loading and also to observe and ascertain the need to modify {{the design of the}} rigid connectors. Materials and Methods: Subsequently four models each of cast and <b>soldered</b> <b>connectors</b> with cylindrical and triangular design, of dimension 3 × 4 mm and thickness 0. 5 mm was designed for the study. The first premolar and second molar were considered as the abutments and 2 nd premolar and 1 st molar as the pontics. The analysis was done using ANSYS version 8. 0 software and by placing axial and non-axial load of 40 Newtons each. Results: Von Misses stresses were observed at the connector region between the two pontics, especially in the cervical region. Conclusion: The cylindrical cast connectors showed less stress in comparison to triangular design and the difference in the stress distribution of cast and <b>soldered</b> <b>connectors</b> were marginal. Clinical Significance: The occlusal forces on a fixed dental prosthesis are transmitted to the surrounding structures through pontics, connectors and retainers with maximum stresses concentrated at the connectors. Hence this three-dimensional finite element analysis study investigated stress distribution in a four unit posterior fixed dental prosthesis, having cylindrical and triangular connector designs...|$|R
40|$|For self-reconfiguring modular robots the {{function}} to autonomously form and break connections between neighboring modules is a defining trait. Connectors must be strong, reversible, transmit power and signal, consume little power, {{and should be}} small and light enough for several to fit into each robot module. To make the modular robot system as versatile as possible, the connector should also be genderless, rotation agnostic, and tolerant to misalignment and positioning errors. Traditionally, connectors add significant mechanical complexity to each module. This thesis introduces two hardware components that implement {{different aspects of the}} modular robot connection process in small lightweight packages that contain no moving parts: The thermorheological valve is a device for directing fluid flow in order to selectively attract robot modules in a stochastic fluidic self-assembly system. Suitable thermorheological fluids are identified, the mechanical and thermal design of the valve is optimized, and demonstrations of mesoscale thermorheological valves are presented. The <b>soldering</b> <b>connector</b> is a connection mechanism for modular self-reconfiguring robots that forms solder joints by heating a low melting point alloy. The connector is mechanically strong, reversible, electrically conductive, only requires power when connecting and disconnecting, and supports ten to hundreds of connection cycles. Compared to other connection methods for modular robots the <b>soldering</b> <b>connector,</b> which is contained on a single printed circuit board, is very low in complexity, weight, size, and cost. Several designs of the connector are presented and evaluated and general guide- lines for application specific connector designs are provided. The thermorheological valve and <b>soldering</b> <b>connector</b> are then applied in the design of two modular robotic systems. The first proposed application is a fluidic self-assembly system of one-inch-sized, cube shaped modules that rely on stochastic external actuation to form predefined target shapes. Module prototypes and proof-of-concept experiments for this system are presented. A second application implements a system of 40 cube shaped modules that uses the self-soldering connector for self-reconfiguration. Several demonstrations of interactions that mimic the flow of matter through an ecosystem are shown in experiments and simulation, including growth and self-refinement. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{lead free}} {{connector}} products involves {{at least two}} distinct steps: removing the lead from the product and ensuring the product has sufficient thermal stability. Lead is most commonly found in terminal finishes and {{has been removed from}} most thermoplastic materials used in connectors. Ensuring sufficient thermal stability requires knowledge of the thermal excursions involved in soldering and how these excursions translate into product performance metrics. For reflow soldering, we know the maximum soldering temperatures will increase by 20 to 30 C. The magnitude of this change is not large, however, the temperature value, 260 C, exceeds the melt point of many engineering thermoplastics. Since the cost of these plastics typically scales with melt temperature, an increase in thermal requirements can mean a significant cost increase. In this paper we strive to understand the fundamental response of the plastics to the transient thermal excursions involved in wave soldering. FEM simulations demonstrate the thermal gradients that exist during these processes. These results can be used to understand the heat transfer and then to engineer the products to ensure reliability. Wave solder process simulation shows that the pin to plastic interface resides at a temperature very near to that of the <b>solder.</b> <b>Connector</b> terminals, made from copper based alloys, often have very high thermal diffusivities, increasing heat flow from the solder pot into the plastic.

To find the correct bits in the boundary scan register one must know which processor and memory circuits are used and how they are connected to the system bus.

The JTAG port is not always <b>soldered</b> with <b>connectors,</b> such that it is sometimes necessary to open the device and re-solder the access port. The protocol for reading the memory must be known and finally the correct voltage must be determined to prevent damage to the circuit.|$|R

40|$|In {{industrial}} manufacturing of microelectronic components, non-destructive {{failure analysis}} methods {{are required for}} either quality control or for providing a rapid fault isolation and defect localization prior to detailed investigations requiring target preparation. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) is a powerful tool enabling the inspection of internal structures in optically opaque materials non-destructively. In addition, depth specific information can be employed for two- and three-dimensional internal imaging without the need of time consuming tomographic scan procedures. The resolution achievable by acoustic microscopy is depending on parameters of both the test equipment and the sample under investigation. However, if applying acoustic microscopy for pure intensity imaging most of its potential remains unused. The aim of the current work was {{the development of a}} comprehensive analysis toolbox for extending the application of SAM by employing its full potential. Thus, typical case examples representing different fields of application were considered ranging from high density interconnect flip-chip devices over wafer-bonded components to <b>solder</b> tape <b>connectors</b> of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel. The progress achieved during this work can be split into three categories: Signal Analysis and Parametric Imaging (SA-PI), Signal Analysis and Defect Evaluation (SA-DE) and Image Processing and Resolution Enhancement (IP-RE).

Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) is {{a powerful tool for}} the inspection of internal structures in optically opaque materials. Depth-specific information can be extracted and applied to create two- and three-dimensional images without the need for time consuming tomographic scan procedures. While traditional SAM imaging of the signal intensity is very valuable, it leaves most of the potential of acoustic microscopy unused. The aim of the current work was to develop comprehensive analysis algorithms to utilize the full potential of SAM and thus to extend the range of its applications. Examples representing different application fields were investigated in the current study. The examples include advanced flip-chip devices, bonded wafer pairs, <b>solder</b> tape <b>connectors</b> of a photovoltaic solar panel and high density chip-to-chip interconnects relevant for 3 D integration.

50|$|After {{the cells}} are constructed, {{conventional}} assembly system uses a robot {{to place the}} cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and <b>soldered</b> to the <b>connectors</b> {{on the front and}} back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back.|$|R
5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, flat SMD connector variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often <b>soldered)</b> for the <b>connector</b> shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|R
40|$|Bandpass {{filters are}} {{essential}} components in any wireless systems. They {{are designed for}} selecting desired signal from other signals. Especially in crowded frequency spectrums, accurate filter characteristics are required to guarantee {{the performance of the}} overall systems. DCS, UMTS and LTE systems are the actual communication systems used by hundred million users. Bandpass filters designed here is based on hairpin line structures and implemented in microstrip technology. The filters are five order Chebychev 2 ̆ 7 s bandpass filters. The center frequency of each system determines the total length of the U-form hairpin structure. The design starts with exploiting the coupling between the resonators. The coupling between two adjacent resonators is determined by the fractional bandwidth of the system and the element value derived from the Chebychev 2 ̆ 7 s approximation. The value of the coupling factor leads to the distance between two adjacent resonators. The simulation results conform to the specifications given in the standards. In general, the measurements verify the simulation. We see worse reflection factors and more insertion loss eventually due to bad <b>soldering</b> of the <b>connectors</b> to the filters. The shifting and width of the pass regions are also observed, which are probably due to the finite accuracy in prototyping the filters...|$|R

Bypass systems are found both in [...] "universal" [...] (non vehicle-dedicated) systems and in dedicated and OEM systems. It works by taking a small current signal from the vehicle's lighting harness to trigger a relay and send a direct power supply to the towing socket. It does not communicate with the vehicle and will not activate any safety or convenience systems. It has the built-in advantage of isolating the trailer wiring {{from that of the}} towing vehicle and thus preventing overloading the vehicle's own lighting harness which may be minimal gauge cabling. The connection onto this harness will cause damage if <b>solder</b> or crimp <b>connectors</b> are used! However, by-pass systems should protect the car's electrical modules from damage should the wiring in a towed trailer malfunction.

Included are a review of the choice of conductors and insulations, the wire splicing (i. e., crimping, and <b>soldering),</b> the wire <b>connectors,</b> and the fabrication of the wire harnesses. The problems in fabrication include the wires being the wrong length, the damage due to the sharp edges, the requried use of temproary protective covers and inadequate training. The problems in the wire harness installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent harnesses, connector damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective. In reference to wire splices and terminal boards the suggestions from the Apollo Era include the use of crimp splices as superior to solder splices, joining multiple wire to a common point using modular plug-ins might be more reliable, but are heavier than crimp splicing. For connectors, the lessons from the Apollo era indicate that a rear environmental seal that does not require additional potting is preferred, and pins should be crimped or welded to the incoming wires and be removable {{from the rear of the}} connector...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{analyses}} were performed on solder joints from two radar units: (1) a laboratory, N 57 tube-type radar unit and (2) a field-returned, B 61 - 0, tube-type radar unit. The cumulative temperature environments experienced by the units during aging were calculated from the intermetallic compound layer thickness and the mean Pb-rich phase particle size metrics for solder joints in the units, assuming an aging time of 35 years for both radars. Baseline aging metrics were obtained from a laboratory test vehicle assembled at AS/FM and T; the aging kinetics of both metrics were calculated from isothermal aging experiments. The N 57 radar unit interconnect board solder joints exhibited very little aging. The eyelet solder joints did show cracking that most likely occurred {{at the time of}} assembly. The eyelet, SA 1126 <b>connector</b> <b>solder</b> joints, showed some delamination between the Cu pad and underlying laminate. The B 61 field-returned radar solder joints showed a nominal degree of aging. Cracking of the eyelet solder joints was observed. The Pb-rich phase particle measurements indicated additional aging of the interconnects as a result of residual stresses. Cracking of the terminal pole <b>connector,</b> pin-to-pin <b>solder</b> joint was observed; but it was not believed to jeopardize the electrical functionality of the interconnect. Extending the stockpile lifetime of the B 61 tube-type radar by an additional 20 years would not be impacted by the reliability of the solder joints with respect to further growth of the intermetallic compound layer.

40|$|The {{premise of}} {{traditional}} methods of reliability predictions, such as MIL-HDBK- 217, is that the failure rate of a system is primarily determined by the components comprising the system. Historically, {{a significant number of}} failures also stem from non-component causes such as design deficiencies, manufacturing defects, inadequate requirements, induced failures, etc., that have not been explicitly addressed in prediction methods. The data in Figure 1 contains the nominal percentage of failures attributable to each of the eight identified predominant failure causes based on data collected by the Reliability Analysis Center. The definitions of these failure causes are as follows: Parts- Failure resulting from a part (e. g. microcircuit, transistor, resistor, connector, etc.) failing to perform its intended function. Design- Failure resulting from an inadequate design. Examples are tolerance stack-up, unanticipated logic conditions, a non-robust design for given environmental stresses, etc. Manufacturing- Failure resulting from anomalies in the manufacturing process, (i. e. faulty <b>solder</b> joints, bent <b>connector</b> pins, etc.). System Management- Failure to interpret system requirements, or failure to provide the resources required to design and build a reliable system. Wearout- Failure resulting from wearout related failure mechanisms. Examples of components exhibiting wearout related failure mechanisms are electrolytic capacitors, solder joints, tubes (TWTs), and switch and relay contacts. No Defect- Perceived failure that cannot be reproduced upon further testing. These failures {{may or may not be}} actual failures; however they are removals and therefore count toward the logistic failure rate. Induced- Failure resulting from an externally applied stress. Examples are electrical overstress and maintenance induced failures. Software- Failure of a system to perform its intended function due to the manifestation of a software fault. In 1994, the U. S. Military Specifications and Standards Reform initiative decreed the adoption of performance based specifications for acquiring and modifying weapon systems. This led to the cancellation of many military specifications and standards. This, coupled with the fact the Air Force has re-directed th...|$|R
