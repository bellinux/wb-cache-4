5|$|After {{several years}} {{serving as a}} {{switching}} engine (a locomotive used for moving railroad cars around within a railroad yard; {{also known as a}} <b>shunter)</b> and stationary boiler, the John Bull was retired in 1866 and stored in Bordentown, New Jersey. Toward the end of its life in revenue service, the locomotive worked as a pump engine and as the power for a sawmill.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class <b>shunter,</b> but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E

5|$|The {{locomotives}} received transformers in 1947, {{which were}} installed in Oslo, and 2064 was delivered on 24 May. The {{cost of the}} three locomotives was 1,297,905 million Norwegian krone. At first, only one unit was transferred to Flåm. The other two remained in Eastern Norway; one was stationed as a <b>shunter</b> at Oslo West Station, the other in Skien. The units operating in Oslo and Skien had problems with the rheostatic brake operating differently depending on the direction the train was running, something which was not observed in Flåm. The issue was fixed by marginally changing the excitation voltage. The unit stationed in Flåm was periodically sent for service in Oslo, and when this happened, a new unit would be stationed in Flåm. From 21 January 1949, 2064 was returned to Flåm without the other unit being sent back. From 17 February 1955, all three were stationed in Flåm. During the late 1950s, one of the units was stationed as Voss Station for shunting duty. Starting in the late 1950s, the class was also used on the Hardanger Line.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric <b>shunter</b> was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E
25|$|When diesel shunters {{began to}} be introduced, the 0-6-0 type became the most common. Many of the British Railways <b>shunter</b> types were , {{including}} Class 03, the standard light <b>shunter,</b> and Class 08 and Class 09, the standard heavier shunters.|$|E
50|$|Heritage <b>Shunters</b> Trust is {{a trading}} name of The South Yorkshire Railway Co. Ltd. {{which was founded}} in 1989. HST is a railway {{preservation}} society and is the only preservation society that solely specialises in the preservation of diesel <b>shunters</b> in the UK. The initials HST {{can be seen as a}} pun on High Speed Train (<b>shunters</b> being very low-speed machines).|$|R
50|$|At {{various times}} between 1966 and 2005, Class 08 <b>shunters,</b> Class 10, and Classes 20, 37, 47, 56 and 58 {{locomotives}} {{could be seen}} stabled at the depot.The depot had an allocation of Class 08 <b>shunters</b> until 1988.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} the class were tried out as <b>shunters</b> at Southampton Docks, {{and found to}} be useful, and six {{examples}} were retained for this purpose until their replacement by British Rail Class 07 diesel <b>shunters</b> in 1962.|$|R

25|$|Former LNER diesel and petrol <b>shunters</b> were {{numbered}} in the 15xxx series (though the petrol <b>shunters</b> initially {{carried their}} appropriate 68xxx series numbers until 1949), while the electric locomotives were numbered in the 26xxx series, leaving the 66xxx series unused.|$|R
25|$|Note: The LNER's petrol <b>shunters</b> were {{initially}} unclassified. When they were allocated a class {{number in the}} 1940s, it was 'Y11' in the steam locomotive class series.

50|$|The Western Region of British Rail used a PWM (Permanent Way Machinery) series which {{incorporated}} some locomotives. The two {{narrow gauge}} GWR petrol <b>shunters</b> were allocated numbers in this series, {{as were the}} five <b>shunters</b> PWM650-PWM654, which were later renumbered as 97650-97654.|$|R

50|$|Four Class 03 diesel <b>shunters</b> {{were also}} {{employed}} at the depot on dock shunting duties. The <b>shunters</b> were numbered 03073, 03162, 03170 and 03189. Since the Birkenhead Dock Branch fell into disuse, {{all four of}} these locomotives have been sold to railway heritage preservation groups.|$|R

25|$|The unusual {{shape of}} the books made them {{instantly}} recognisable. However, it did prompt complaints from booksellers that they were difficult to display, and even that they could easily be shoplifted. Nonetheless, the format was imitated by publishers Ian Allan for their Sammy the <b>Shunter</b> and Chuffalong books.|$|E
50|$|The GWR also owned {{a number}} of small petrol <b>shunters</b> built by Motor Rail, which carried numbers 15 and 22-27 in their {{departmental}} number series. These survived to be taken over by British Rail, which did not renumber them. These <b>shunters</b> are listed below.|$|R
50|$|From 1958 to 1991, Class 08 <b>shunters</b> and Class 10 {{locomotives}} {{could be}} seen at the depot. Until 1987, the depot had an allocation of Class 08 <b>shunters.</b> Around 1987, Classes 20, 31, 37, 45, 47 and 56 locomotives could also be seen stabled at the depot.|$|R
50|$|From 1959 to 2007, Class 08 <b>shunters,</b> Class 25, 27 and 45 {{locomotives}} {{could be}} seen at the depot. Around 1987, the depot had an allocation of Class 08 <b>shunters</b> and Classes 20, 31, 47, 56 and 58 could also be seen stabled at the depot.|$|R
25|$|In {{almost all}} cases, the {{constituent}} companies used only steam locomotives. The NER had 13 electric lomotives, numbered 1-13, {{but this was}} in fact in the company's main locomotive list as the lowest-numbered steam locomotive was numbered 14. The NBR owned a petrol <b>shunter,</b> and this was numbered '1' in its own series.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} double track {{comprising}} the C siding (essentially main lain and loop) provided {{only the most}} basic of facilities, and operating flexibility was limited. If ever a main line train failed to pick up loaded wagons (a booked operation), or if the High Peak <b>shunter</b> was slow to remove empties, the result was considerable congestion.|$|E
25|$|Before {{electrification}} in 1992, InterCity (latterly Network SouthEast) locomotives operated most services, normally hauling British Rail Mark 2b coaches. Many {{of these}} services featured full-service restaurant cars. The locomotives were usually Class 37 diesel-electrics, Freight services were operated by a similar array of diesel locomotives, as well as Class 20s, Class 31s, and the occasional Class 08 <b>shunter.</b> Off-peak links were often provided by Metro-Cammell diesel multiple units, such as the Class 101.|$|E
