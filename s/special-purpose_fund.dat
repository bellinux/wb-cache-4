40|$|Hereby {{presented}} diploma thesis {{discusses the}} financial management of Czech regions (more accurately "higher-level territorial administrative units") focusing on regional development funding, particularly {{demonstrated by the}} example of the South Moravian Region. Through a study of regional financial management the regional budget's income and expenditure have been thoroughly examined, especially those governable by the regions themselves. During the analysis of the South Moravian Region financial system the main focus has been aimed at its regional funding policy outlined by the corresponding strategic documentation entitled South Moravian Region Development Plan. The actual support for regional development in South Moravian Region is financed by the region's budget and a <b>special-purpose</b> <b>fund</b> named Development Fund of South Moravian Region...|$|E

This study attempts to provide a better explanation of the decentralization of the international development assistance system. The decentralization is defined as a dispersion of decision-making power among various organizations and the resistance of sovereign states to centralized majority decision. This study applies (1) sociological propositions developed in the national setting to explain the initial creation, growth, and decline of interorganizational relations with a focus on organizations' pursuit of autonomy, (2) sociological propositions developed in the international setting to explain how international organizations coopt sovereign states, and (3) realist propositions about state pursuit of national interest. The following hypotheses are supported: (1) resource scarcity and complementary domains motivated a funding organization and executing agencies to initiate their interorganizational relations; (2) they were concerned with acquiring power and protecting autonomy against eroding; (3) growing financial dependence of the executing agencies on their funding organizations led the latter to centralize the development system; (4) the convergence of interests in preserving autonomy and sovereignty led executing agencies and donor countries to introduce and support various <b>special-purpose</b> <b>funding</b> arrangements, as a means of mobilizing discretionary funds of their own and avoiding majority decision-making; (5) strong resistance to their centralization efforts forced the funding organization and recipient countries to establish and accept the <b>special-purpose</b> <b>funding</b> arrangements, as a means of regaining its organizational identity as the major fund supplier and meeting their financial interests; (6) intense competition for limited resources and the proliferation of those <b>special-purpose</b> <b>funding</b> arrangements blurred the division of labor and intensified the tendency to promote fragmented development initiatives; and (7) eroding domain consensus and subsequent conflicts led funding organizations and executing agencies to reach a temporary, impl icit compromise by acknowledging the newly evolving reality, but centralization and decentralization resumed pulling against one another. This study shows that the decentralization of the international development system can be better understood {{in the context of the}} dynamics of interorganizational relations, organization's pursuit of autonomy, and state pursuit of national interest or national autonomy...|$|R
5000|$|Terminology {{varies with}} country but {{investment}} funds are {{often referred to}} as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual <b>fund,</b> exchange-traded <b>fund,</b> <b>special-purpose</b> acquisition company or closed-end fund, or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund. [...] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.|$|R
40|$|The United States Defense (DoD) spends {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars each year on desktop computer software. While some of this expenditure goes to <b>fund</b> <b>special-purpose</b> military software, much of it is absorbed by license fees for computer operating systems and general purpose office automation applications. Although many of these tools may serve their respective purposes rather well, there are many reasons to consider adopting alternative software solutions alongside the existing standards. Improvements to cost, security, and flexibility are some of the benefits that may be realized by integrating some of the many available mature, robust Open Source Software (OSS) solutions. In particular, Linux-based operating systems have helped bring free, open source software into mainstream use in businesses, homes, and government offices around the world, precisely because of these potential benefits. This thesis examines the feasibility of using OSS, particularly Linux-based operating systems, on unclassified DoD desktop computers. Specific attention is paid to performing office automation tasks that are currently handled by U. S. Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration, Windows-based computers. Additionally, this document examines many of the regulations and policies that shape the procurement and operational environments in which OSS must compete and function.

40|$|With {{these changes}} in mind, it is {{important}} to analyze the effects that a transformed educational system and new educational policy can have on the conditions and nature of the work performed by personnel working in the field of education. The specific objective of the present report is to examine the restructuring of the profession of principal and its relationship to changes in the way Canada’s educational systems are regulated. It will do this by analyzing the way principals have dealt with changes in education, and the way they view and claim to practise their profession. At the same time, it will compare occupational experiences in the various Canadian provinces.

50|$|Commercial wind power, today one of {{the fastest}} growing energy sectors, was also enabled through {{government}} support. In the 1980's, the federal government pursued two different R&D efforts for wind turbine development. The first was a “big science” effort by NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) to use U.S. expertise in high-technology research and products to develop new large-scale wind turbines for electricity generation, largely from scratch. A second, more successful R&D effort, sponsored by the DOE, focused on component innovations for smaller turbines that used the operational experience of existing turbines to inform future research agendas. Joint research projects between the government and private firms produced a number of innovations that helped increase the efficiency of wind turbines, including twisted blades and <b>special-purpose</b> airfoils. Publicly <b>funded</b> R&D was coupled with efforts to build a domestic market for new turbines. At the federal level, this included tax credits and the passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA), which required that utilities purchase power from some small renewable energy generators at avoided cost. Both federal and state support for wind turbine development helped drive costs down considerably, but policy incentives at both the federal and state level were discontinued at the end of the decade. However, after a nearly five-year federal policy hiatus in the late 1980's, the U.S. government enacted new policies to support the industry in the early 1990's. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) continued its support for wind turbine R&D, and also launched the Advanced Wind Turbine Program (AWTP). The goal of the AWTP was to reduce the cost of wind power to rates that would be competitive in the U.S. market. Policymakers also introduced new mechanisms to spur the demand of new wind turbines and boost the domestic market, including a 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour tax credit (adjusted over time for inflation) included in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Today the wind industry's main subsidy support comes from the federal production tax credit.|$|R
