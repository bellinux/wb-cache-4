25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is <b>severable</b> is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.|$|E
25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the <b>severable</b> arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E
2500|$|Article 4 {{implies that}} the High Court may void a piece of {{legislation}} to the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution. At present, it is unclear how the Court will apply this requirement. If, say, an entire piece of criminal legislation or one of its provisions is found to be void, a person alleged to have committed an offence created by the impugned legislation may be able to escape liability. To circumvent this, a test of severability, also known as the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test, has been established in the UK. If the unconstitutional parts of the legislation are <b>severable</b> from the constitutional parts, the latter are preserved and remain valid and enforceable. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hutchinson (1988), the House of Lords held that two forms of severability must be established for a law to be held partially valid– textual severability and substantial severability. A provision is textually <b>severable</b> if it remains grammatical and correct after severance. It is substantially <b>severable</b> if its substance after severance remains true to its [...] "legislative purpose, operation and effect". However, the court also recognized that a rigid adherence to the test of textual severability may result in unreasonable consequences. It may defeat legislation with a substantial purpose clearly within the lawmaker's power but, by oversight, which was written in a way that exceeded that scope of power. Hence, the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test may still apply to rescue a provision that is not textually <b>severable</b> {{as long as it does}} not alter the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision.|$|E

2500|$|Second, {{because the}} Act gave {{the option of}} either a fine, imprisonment, or both, the United States {{maintained}} that the Act was not unconstitutional because the threat of imprisonment was <b>severable</b> {{from the threat of}} fine (which would not be infamous).

2500|$|On May 16, 1994, United States District Judge Charles C. Lovell {{granted the}} Sheriff declaratory judgment, {{finding that the}} {{provision}} requiring CLEOs to perform background checks violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also concluding that provision was <b>severable</b> from {{the remainder of the}} Act, effectively leaving a voluntary background check system in place. On June 29, 1994, United States District Judge John Roll reached the same conclusion. [...] Those judgments were reversed on September 8, 1995, by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judge William C. Canby Jr., joined by Judge Herbert Choy, over the dissent of Judge Ferdinand Francis Fernandez.|$|E
2500|$|At trial, Marquan M. filed {{a motion}} to dismiss, arguing that the law {{violated}} the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment because it was overbroad and unlawfully vague. [...] Specifically, the defendant contended that the law was overbroad because it proscribed protected expression and unlawfully vague because it failed to give fair notice to the public. [...] Following the City Court's denial of his motion to dismiss, the defendant pleaded guilty, but raised constitutional arguments on appeal. [...] The County Court affirmed the City Court’s denial of the motion to dismiss and held that the law did not violate the defendant's First Amendment rights. [...] The county found that while parts of law are invalid, they are nonetheless <b>severable,</b> rendering {{the remainder of the}} law constitutional if interpreted in a restrictive manner. [...] The New York Court of Appeals granted the defendant leave to appeal.|$|E
2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know perfectly well that I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But I also know if I can get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be <b>severable</b> from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contract}} law, a <b>severable</b> {{contract is}} {{a contract that}} is actually composed of several separate contracts concluded between the same parties, so that failing (breaching) one part of such a 'severable' contract does not breach the whole contract. Therefore, the other party must still honor the other subparts and cannot cancel the whole agreement. A <b>severable</b> contract generally must contain a [...] "severability clause" [...] that allows certain clauses and aspects of the contract to be [...] "severed" [...] without affecting {{the validity of the}} rest of the contract.|$|E

If specific activities involving exercise of official authority are <b>severable</b> {{from the rest of}} a profession, then art 51 cannot apply to exempt the whole lot.|$|E
