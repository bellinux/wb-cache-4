40|$|This Chapter on {{laboratory}} based investigations {{is aimed}} at Built Environment and civil engineering students who will develop their study skills, and look at areas associated with their interests. Civil engineering students {{would be expected to}} cope with mathematical analysis and design processes with relative ease whilst gaining the opportunity to extend their management skills associated with project planning, organising people and dealing with health and safety issues. The Built Environment students should have the management skills to permit a full investigation and they will benefit from the opportunity of expanding their numerical and analytical skills. A dissertation defines your degree and an interest in a technical area such as sustainable materials makes undergraduates very employable when they demonstrate an interest and ability in this area. In essence, laboratory based dissertations and softer management style investigations are very similar, in that, it is the logical process that is being examined. The skill sets required for an empirical based quantitative project is fundamentally no different to that of qualitative project. From the author’s experience, the easier of the two forms of analysis is quantitative research. The student should consider what it says on the title of their programme of study. If you are studying a BSc then surely; should there not be some science in the dissertation? A BSc in Construction Management need not necessarily be completely science or technology based, however if it is not, then the softer management style of investigation should at least be analysed with a reasonable degree of mathematical rigour to achieve a satisfactory pass grade. When a student embarks upon a BEng, the need for carrying out a technical investigation is much greater. The term project for a BEng and dissertation for a BSc can be interchanged reasonably easily as the final product will be much the same. An extract from a final year civil engineering project module descriptor sums up what is required of a BEng student. ‘The individual project provides a vehicle for the student to undertake a substantive piece of self-directed work which will focus on a chosen aspect of civil engineering, studied elsewhere in the programme. This technical investigation will be characterised by the determination of an area of research, that establishes aims and objectives to be realised in pursuit of the research question/ problem statement where contemporary literature on the subject area is presented and appraised. On determining and selecting a method for investigation, contextualised those that already exist, the student will pursue the collection and analysis of data to realise the project aims. The project will be examined by a presentation verbally and also in writing, a critical analysis, justifiable conclusions and a reflection on the study undertaken, through the production of a technical thesis and via a verbal voce’. To defend the research through the medium of a viva requires a thorough understanding of the subject studied and confidence of the results as presented. All dissertations must identify a worthwhile topic worthy of investigation, a means of carrying out the investigation, justifying the choices in terms of logic and selecting appropriate statistical analysis to present results that hopefully will remove the need for investigator judgement {{as to whether or not}} the results are significant. Industry partners will help identify areas in need of laboratory research. A well designed laboratory investigation will provide reliable data from which deductions can be safely made, free from interpretation. To achieve this reliability within the obtained results, a standard test procedure would normally be adopted. Alternatively a suitable bespoke test maybe carefully designed. The use of standard or non standard test procedures should be justified and informed by substantial background reading. Selecting a suitable test procedure is not as easy as it sounds. One view would be that it is simply following a pre-determined method without any operator input and this will provide suitable results. This could not be further from the truth. For example, a freeze thaw test that examines durability of concrete can be carried out to ASTM standards over a variety of freeze/thaw cycles, such as 300 cycles as detailed in ASTM 666 or 50 cycles as ASTM 672. The BS recommends 56 cycles and all standards have different measurement criteria from which conclusions can be drawn. Which one is best? How long do you have to complete a test? This may be the deciding factor. Can we accelerate the effect of the test by using conditions that are extremely aggressive? Has the laboratory sufficient equipment to carry out the test? Are suitably qualified staff available to assist and is there laboratory time available for all test proposals? Careful consideration of all of these factors should be made to determine a suitable test programme. One of the main parameters for a short duration investigation such as a dissertation, is the length of time available to design and manufacture test materials. If concrete is chosen as a test material, we must not forget the time required to cure the test materials and the interim and final test time required to provide <b>sound,</b> <b>defect</b> free data. This Chapter mainly focuses upon the design, batching and testing of concrete. It has been written because concrete being a conglomerate has many variables and is a perfect foil for this work. The testing of any other material may be subject to very similar constraints...|$|E

30|$|As well as accuracy, {{robustness}} {{is important}} in development of defect detecting method. Because the difference in spectrum between <b>sound</b> wood and <b>defected</b> wood is tiny, even small inconsistency can also cause misprediction.

Two different tool profiles, namely, convex and concave, {{were used for the}} refilling process. <b>Sound</b> and <b>defect</b> free joints were obtained by the refilling process. Joints refilled with convex tools showed better static shear strength than those with the concave ones. The variation of microhardness in different regions of the weld was analysed.

40|$|Abstract: Laser metal {{deposition}} (LMD) {{is one of}} the {{additive manufacturing}} technologies that is used in the production of fully dense parts layer by layer. This innovative manufacturing process has the potential to reduce the weight, time and cost of manufacturing components. It is able to process different metallic powders and also produce custom alloy or functionally graded material by consolidating different metallic powders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate and discuss the structural integrity, mechanical property and microstructure of 17 - 4 precipitation hardened stainless steel processed by laser metal deposition. In this study, the laser scanning speed was varied while other process parameters where kept constant. Material characterization was done using optical microscopy and Vickers indentation testing. The results show that, the processed material was structurally <b>sound</b> and <b>defect</b> free. The microstructure was predominantly martensitic and the laser scanning speed was observed to have an influence on the micro-hardness of the structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of grain defect traits is assuming greater importance in wheat germplasm selection. Late maturity a-amylase {{is one such}} characteristic that renders wheat unsuitable for high value end products, even though the grain may appear <b>sound.</b> Phenotyping <b>defect</b> traits typically involves a multi-phase process, where genetic material for assay has been affected by non-genetic sources of variation {{in one or more}} previous linked stages of experimentation or preparation. The adoption of appropriate statistical design and analysis methods in these situations is, however, not widespread. Substantial sources of non-genetic variation were identified in the analysis of a designed experiment to measure late maturity a-amylase expression, indicating the potential for improved selection decisions. A simulation study based on these results suggests that significant gains over current methods in the accuracy of phenotyping this grain defect can be achieved with sound multi-phase statistical design and analysis techniques. Although restricted in scope, the simulation also indicates that a considerable increase in estimated heritability could be expected from the proposed methodology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Laser metal {{deposition}} (LMD) {{presents a}} suitable substitute for conventional machining of titanium products. It is an additive manufacturing technology {{used to build}} prototypes, models, tools, dies and end products. The process is used to manufacture components from materials, which are difficult to machine through conventional methods. Titanium and its alloys {{are one of the}} difficult materials to machine since they cause galling on the cutting tool. This paper reports on the material characterization of Laser Metal deposited TiC on Titanium alloy grade 5 and the effect of varying the powder flow rate on the evolving properties of the material. The clads were characterized through microstructural analysis, hardness and degree of porosity. The physical appearances of the samples appeared <b>sound</b> without <b>defect.</b> However, the surfaces of the samples were rough. Furthermore, the average microhardness decreased as the powder flow rate was increased. The microstructural evaluation revealed that the grain size in the deposit zone becomes shorter as the powder flow rate was increased. The microstructure in the heat-affected zone had smaller grain sizes relative to the grain sizes in the deposit zone. In addition, the porosity characterization revealed that the number of pores increases when the powder flow rate increases...|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} of sawn timber has huge natural variations {{that the human}} inspector easily compensates for mentally when determining the types of defects and the grade of each board. However, for automatic wood inspection systems these variations are a major source for complication. This {{makes it difficult to}} use textbook methodologies for visual inspection. These methodologies generally aim at systems that are trained in a supervised manner with samples of defects and good material, but selecting and labeling the samples is an error-prone process that limits the accuracy that can be achieved. We present a non-supervised clustering-based approach for detecting and recognizing defects in lumber boards. A key idea is to employ a self-organizing map (SOM) for discriminating between <b>sound</b> wood and <b>defects.</b> Human involvement needed for training is minimal. The approach has been tested with color images of lumber boards, and the achieved false detection and error escape rates are low.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{composite materials}} on aircraft structures {{as well as their}} increasing average age have led to the search and the development of several global nondestructive testing techniques to scan large portions of the aircraft externally. One such technique is Infrared thermography. If rapid inspection can be expected, the size of the data and the complexity of the thermograms make the interpretation difficult. So in order to help the operator in the fulfilment of his job to achieve rapid, reliable and repeatable non destructive evaluation, we have caried out {{for the last four years}} a project named SEQUOIA, in which Artificial Intelligence has been integrated. The first approach presented at QNDE 93 was based on spatial analysis which revealed itself to be encouraging but insufficient and with not enough versatility [1]. A complementary approach is presented, it is based on the use of multi-layered Neural Networks. This classification technique is used to correlate temporal thermal signatures with <b>sound</b> and <b>defected</b> regions of an inspected part. As thermal modelling is now well developed and comprehensive, the investigative study relies on the training of the neural network on theoretical thermograms so that we can produce as many examples as one can think of. Different inputs for the neural network have been studied: raw data (temperature curves), derived data (derivative of temperature curves), contrast data (subtraction of reference from raw data). Multi-layer neural networks, as well as related algorithms such as Nearest Neighbour (KNN, Kmeans) and Learning Vector Quantization (L. V. Q) have been tested. The evaluation of the neural network process has mainly been based on its ability to reduce the errors, prior to uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{solid state}} {{innovative}} joining technique, widely being used for joining aluminium alloys in aerospace, marine automotive and many other applications of commercial importance. The welding parameters and tool pin profile {{play a major role}} in deciding the weld quality. In this paper, an attempt has been made to understand the influences of welding speed and pin profile of the tool on friction stir welded joints of AA 6082 -T 6 alloy. Three different tool pin profiles (tapered cylindrical four flutes, triangular and hexagonal) have been used to fabricate the joints at different welding speeds in the range of 30 to 74 mm/min. Microhardness (HV) and tensile tests performed at room temperature were used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the joints. In order to analyse the microstructural evolution of the material, the weld’s cross-sections were observed optically and SEM observations were made of the fracture surfaces.

40|$|Abstract. In {{an attempt}} to {{optimize}} the friction spot joining process of Al alloys for automobiles (Al 5000 and Al 6000 series, thickness 1 mm), effects of joining parameters such as tool rotating speed, plunging depth and dwelling time on the weld joints properties were evaluated. Experimental tests were carried out for lap joined Al plates. A wide range of joining conditions {{could be applied to}} join Al alloys for automobiles without defects in the weld zone except for certain welding conditions with an insufficient heat input. The microstructures and hardness variations in the weld regions are discussed. The microstructures of welds, corresponding to the pin hole, have dynamic-recrystallized grain similar to stir zone in FSW weld. In hardness distribution, minimum hardness region was located about 6 -mm away from the weld center, corresponding to the shoulder radius of the tool.

By using the first edgewise natural frequency, modulus of elasticity (MOE) was calculated. An ABAQUS 2 D Finite Element model was utilized to model the board and to extract the frequencies for the six first mode shapes in both axial and edgewise directions. The extracted frequencies from the model were compared with the frequencies from the tests. The analytical and experimental results, from the homogeneous boards, in edgewise direction has similar frequency variations. The defects in the timber boards decreased the natural frequencies. The bending modes with more curvature at the location of the artificial defect displayed more frequency deviation in that mode. The variation in response frequencies for uniform and defected boards was more noticeable in edgewise bending modes than in longitudinal modes...|$|R
40|$|In {{a highly}} {{competitive}} and demanding microelectronics market, reliable non-destructive methods for quality control and failure analysis of electronic components are highly demanded. Any robust non-destructive method should be capable {{of dealing with the}} complexity of miniaturized assemblies such as chip-scale packages and 3 D IC stacks. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) is indeed one the best non-destructive tools for failure analysis purposes. It is also a useful technique for imaging the morphology, location and size distribution of defects in different microelectronics components. SAM can detect delaminations at sub-micron thicknesses. It {{is also one of the}} only available techniques capable of efficiently evaluating popcorning in PBGA's and is a also useful device to detect sub-micron air gaps. SAM can also be used to measure the thickness of an internal layer of material.

40|$|Abstract—AA 5083 {{aluminium}} alloy has gathered wide acceptance in the fabrication of light weight structures requiring a high {{strength to weight}} ratio. Compared to the fusion welding processes that are routinely used for joining structural {{aluminium alloy}}s, friction stir welding (FSW) process is an emerging solid state joining {{process in which the}} material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and tool pin profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect of tool speed (rpm) and tool pin profile on Friction Stir Processing (FSP) zone formation in AA 5083 aluminium alloy. Friction stir welding between 5083 aluminium alloy plates with a thickness of 2. 5 mm was performed. Five different tool pin profiles (straight cylindrical, tapered cylindrical, triangular, square and cone) have been used to fabricate the joints at three different rotational speeds i. e. 900, 1400 and 1800 rpm under a constant traverse speed of 16 mm/min. The formation of FSP zone has been analysed macroscopically. Tensile properties of the joints have been evaluated and correlated with the FSP zone formation. From this investigation it has been found that the tool pin profiled designs had little effect on heat input and tensile properties, weld properties were dominated by thermal input rather than the mechanical deformation by the tool for the plate thickness of 2. 5 mm. straight cylindrical pin profiled tool produces mechanically <b>sound</b> and metallurgically <b>defect</b> free welds compared to other tool pin profiles.

40|$|Because of its low {{density and}} high strength, {{magnesium}} (Mg) and its alloys are being sought after in {{the automotive industry}} for structural applications. Although many road-going cars today contain cast Mg parts, in the fabrication of chassis structural members the wrought alloys are required. One of the challenges of fabrication with wrought Mg is welding and joining the formed sheets. Because of the commonly observed difficulties in fusion welding of Mg such as hot cracking and severe Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), this work aimed to establish the feasibility of the solid-state process Magnetic Pulse Welding in producing lap welds of Mg sheet. Mg AZ 31 alloy sheets have been lap-welded with Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW), an Impact Welding technique, using H-shaped symmetric coils connected to a Pulsar MPW- 25 capacitor bank. MPW uses the interaction between two opposing magnetic fields to create a high speed oblique collision between the metal surfaces. The oblique impact sweeps away the contaminated surface layers and forces intimate contact between clean materials to produce a solid-state weld. Various combinations of similar and dissimilar metals can be welded using MPW. Other advantages of MPW are high speed, high strength, {{and the possibility of}} being mounted on a robotic arm. The present research focuses on the feasibility and mechanical performance of an MPW weld of 0. 6 mm AZ 31 Mg alloy sheets made in a lap joint configuration. Tensile shear tests were carried out on the joints produced. Load bearing capacity showed linear increase with capacitor bank discharge energy up to a certain value above which a parabolic increase was seen. Strength was estimated to be at least as high as base metal strength by measuring the fracture surface area of selected samples. The fracture surface of samples welded at higher discharge energy showed two regions. In the beginning of the bond a platelet-featured fracture brittle in appearance and a ductile, micro-voiding fracture in the latter part. The joint cross section morphology consisted of a flattened area that had two symmetric bond zones 1 mm wide each separated by an unbonded centre zone ~ 3 mm wide. Reasons for the morphology were presented as a sequence of events based on the transient nature of the oblique collision angle. The interface microstructure was studied by optical and electron microscopy. Examination of the bonds has revealed <b>sound</b> and <b>defect</b> free interfaces. No microcracking, porosity, resolidification, or secondary phase formation was observed. Metallographic examination of the unbonded centre zone revealed anisotropic deformation and a lack of cleaning from the interface. This zone is formed as a result of normal impact in the initial stage of collision. The bond zone interface of the joint was characterized by a smooth interface consisting of refined grains. In samples welded at higher energy interfacial waves developed {{in the latter half of}} the bond zone. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the bond zone revealed a continuous interface having an 8 - 25 μm thick interlayer that coincided with the waves and had a dislocation cell structure and distinct boundaries with adjacent material. Equiaxed 300 nm dynamic recrystallized (DRX) grains were found adjacent to the interlayer as well as other slightly larger elongated grains. The interlayer is thought to be formed in plasticized state at elevated temperature through severe shear strain heating. The interlayer corresponds to a ductile fracture surface and, along with the interfacial waves, is responsible for the joint’s high strength...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, {{techniques}} traditionally used in Material Science, as the image- based analysis and the NIR spectroscopy, coupled to multivariate data analysis, were investigated {{in order to}} develop innovative approaches to evaluate quality parameters in agro-food products and for food process monitoring. The application of innovative approaches aims to overcome some of the disadvantages of the reference analysis, such as the time needed to prepare the samples, to carry out the analysis and to achieve the results, the specialized skills required to the operator, the invasive nature and the lack of environmental sustainability, since often solvents have to be used. Moreover, the reference analytical methods are not suitable for real-time applications and do not allow a prompt intervention of the automatic control in the case of out-of-range parameters. This thesis work is presented in four main parts. The first part (Chapter 1) gives an overview of the agro-food industry value, emphasizing the crucial role of the Material Science to improve the current analytical controls along the entire food supply chain and to develop new technologies. Furthermore, this part provides the conceptual elements, basics of control theory and some examples of the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) application in the agro-food industry. The second part (Chapters from 2 to 4) describes the fundamentals of the instrumental techniques explored in this thesis, while the third part (Chapter 5) presents the chemometric methods applied for data processing. The fourth part is the experimental section and includes three practical case studies, which make up the core of the thesis. The first case study (Chapter 6) focuses on developing an automatized method for hazelnut quality sorting, based on imaging techniques (RGB and multispectral) and the multivariate image analysis (MIA). The presented setup is an off-line method able to detect more than 90 % of ‘moldy' hazelnuts (defect type 1), while the discrimination between <b>sound</b> and ‘pest-affected' (<b>defect</b> type 2) hazelnuts was performed correctly at an 80 % degree. Enhanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques will be considered in future to detect hazelnut defects directly on the entire hazelnut kernel. In the second case study (Chapter 7), lab-scale drying tests were performed on in-shell hazelnuts in order to define a model of general applicability for hazelnut drying, since different cultivars and drying air parameters (Temperature and Relative Humidity) were considered. The hazelnut moisture content at the equilibrium (Me) and the drying rate (k) were calculated for each drying test by modelling the experimental data with a 2 nd order kinetics. Subsequently, the contribution of the drying air parameters and the cultivar on affecting Me and k was evaluated by means of the ANOVA and the MLR analysis. In the third case study (Chapter 8), NIR spectroscopy associated with chemometrics was investigated as a fast and non-invasive method to predict the Arabica/Robusta ratio and the colour of ground roasted coffee blends. The PLS 2 algorithm was applied to elaborate a model for the simultaneous determination of these two coffee parameters. A good predictive ability was achieved, with errors equal to 1. 28 A. U. and 4. 34 % w/w for the roasting degree and for the Arabica content, respectively. The final two chapters (9 and 10) summarize the results and perspectives of the research work, highlighting that all the approaches developed and discussed show the potential to be applied for real time determination of food quality parameters and process control at the industrial scale, according to the PAT guidelines. Overall, this thesis has shown that the combination of disciplines such as imaging, spectroscopy and chemometrics can provide practical insights and control possibilities that reference analytical methodologies cannot offer, and this can be also extended to the industrial process as a whole...|$|R
