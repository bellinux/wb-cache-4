25|$|Arthroscopy is a {{considered}} a low risk procedure {{with a very}} low rates of serious complications. Commonly, irrigation fluid may leak (extravasates) into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue,</b> causing edema which is generally a temporary phenomenon, taking anywhere from 7â€“15 days to completely settle. Rarely, this fluid may be {{the course of a}} serious complication, compartment syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{symptom of}} ONJ is {{the exposure of}} mandibular or maxillary bone through lesions in the gingiva that do not heal. Pain, inflammation of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue,</b> secondary infection or drainage {{may or may not}} be present. The development of lesions is most frequent after invasive dental procedures, such as extractions, and is also known to occur spontaneously. There may be no symptoms for weeks or months, until lesions with exposed bone appear. Lesions are more common on the mandible than the maxilla.|$|E
5000|$|Curb: a {{thickening}} or bowing on the caudal {{surface of}} the calcaneous. Classically associated with damage to the long plantar tarsal ligament of the hock, it is actually most commonly due to injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon, but may also involve the deep digital flexor tendon, or the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> structures.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a 30 -year-old haemophilic man with a pelvic {{pseudotumour}} compressing adjacent structures causing pain and swelling and destruction of <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> and bones. He underwent evacuation of the pseudotumour, acetabular reconstruction using the Harrington procedure, and total hip arthroplasty. Key words: arthroplasty, replacement, hip; hemophilia A introduction Haemophilic pseudotumour is a progressive cystic swelling caused by repetitive bleeding not treated adequately and involves bone {{in the form of}} osteolytic lesions. 1, 2 Destruction and formation of bone and calcification (ossification) of <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> are noted. This condition is similar to malignant bone tumours such as osteosarcoma and thus known as Pelvic haemophilic pseudotumour: a cas...|$|R
25|$|Dental caries {{can also}} cause bad breath and foul tastes. In highly progressed cases, an {{infection}} can spread from the tooth to the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> Complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis and Ludwig angina can be life-threatening.|$|R
25|$|A healthy {{fingernail}} has {{the function}} of protecting the distal phalanx, the fingertip, and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> from injuries. It also serves to enhance precise delicate movements of the distal digits through counter-pressure exerted on the pulp of the finger.|$|R
50|$|Flexion {{tests are}} rather nonspecific, as each test flexes {{multiple}} joints. So while {{they can help}} localize a lameness issue to one particular leg, or even to a few joints in the leg, they can not pinpoint it. Additionally, flexion tests affect not only the joints that are being flexed, but also the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> structures around the joint.|$|E
5000|$|Hip protectors {{are either}} of the [...] "crash helmet type" [...] or [...] "energy-absorbing type". The [...] "crash helmet type" [...] {{distributes}} impacts into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue,</b> while the [...] "energy-absorbing type" [...] is made of a compressible material and diminishes the force of impact. Both of these systems aim to reduce the focused force beneath an estimated fracture threshold.|$|E
50|$|Arthrofibrosis (from Greek: arthro- joint, fibr- fibrous and -osis abnormality) is a {{complication}} of injury or trauma where an excessive scar tissue response leads to painful restriction of joint motion, with scar tissue forming within the joint and <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> spaces and persisting despite rehabilitation exercises and stretches. Scarring adhesions {{has been described}} in most major joints, including knees, shoulders, hips, ankles, and wrists as well as spinal vertebrae.|$|E
30|$|On pathology, {{it appears}} as a lesion mainly {{constituted}} by spindle cells, with abundant collagen component and dilated vascular channels. It can infiltrate <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues,</b> although conserving its benign characteristics, without showing necrosis, cellular atypia or mitotic activity [20].|$|R
30|$|It is also {{important}} to recognize how the graft for CABG has been procured. Two major techniques are employed, namely pedicle grafts that include <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> and skeletonized grafts that lack them. Pedicle grafts can be difficult to distinguish from the falciform ligament of the liver and mesentery, which may result in injury to a pedicle graft.|$|R
30|$|The main {{limitation}} in {{our study}} {{was the use of}} sawbones which may differ from true human anatomy with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> that might affect the drilling technique. Nonetheless, standardizing the drilling technique and specimens with the drill guide assured reproducibility of the results. It is unlikely the aperture measurements would have been different in real bone.|$|R
50|$|The animal's leg {{is held in}} a flexed {{position}} for 30 seconds to up to 3 minutes (although most veterinarians do not go longer than a minute), and then the horse is immediately trotted off and its gait is analyzed for abnormalities and uneveness. Flexions stretch the joint capsule, increase intra-articular and subchondral bone pressure, and compress <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> structures, which accentuates any pain associated with these structures.|$|E
50|$|To {{obtain an}} image with {{any type of}} image {{detector}} {{the part of the}} patient to be X-rayed is placed between the X-ray source and the image receptor to produce a shadow of the internal structure of that particular part of the body. X-rays are partially blocked ("attenuated") by dense tissues such as bone, and pass more easily through soft tissues. Areas where the X-rays strike darken when developed, causing bones to appear lighter than the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{definitive}} {{symptom of}} ONJ is {{the exposure of}} mandibular or maxillary bone through lesions in the gingiva that do not heal. Pain, inflammation of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue,</b> secondary infection or drainage {{may or may not}} be present. The development of lesions is most frequent after invasive dental procedures, such as extractions, and is also known to occur spontaneously. There may be no symptoms for weeks or months, until lesions with exposed bone appear. Lesions are more common on the mandible than the maxilla.|$|E
30|$|A periprosthetic {{infection}} with segmental bone defect is a surgical disaster. Treatment is often demanding, involves multiple complex operations and {{is associated with}} significant morbidity and health care costs [2, 16]. The preferred management of large bone defects in this scenario has not been established [7]. The severity of bone loss largely influences implant selection, {{and the problem is}} often associated with poor <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> [11].|$|R
40|$|The common peroneal {{nerve and}} its {{surrounding}} muscles were cut and repaired in 14 rabbits. The injured limb was then either immobilized for 3 weeks or passively mobilized within a "safety range" every day. At 3 weeks after operation, the "stretch test" and "peel test" showed {{no difference in the}} biomechanical features of the adhesions between the nerve repair and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} surgical guidelines based on the growth pattern of ameloblastomas in relation to the possible infiltration of the cortical bone, the inferior alveolar nerve, the periosteal layer and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> Five male patients with voluminous mandibular ameloblastomas were treated by means of radical surgery. Ameloblastomas showed an invasive growth pattern in the cancellous bone with small tumour nests at a maximum distance of 5 mm away from the bulk of the tumour. Expansive and invasive growth in the Haversian canals was observed. There was no invasion of the inferior alveolar nerve. The mucoperiosteal layer was invaded but not perforated. No invasion was observed in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> of the periosteum and in the skin tissue. A local resection with a surgical margin of spongious bone of 1 cm is suggested. When the tumour is radiologically closer than 1 cm to the inferior border of the mandible, a continuity resection is mandatory. A conservative approach concerning the inferior alveolar nerve is suggested. Removal of an excess of perimandibular <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> is not indicated. The overlying attached mucosal surface should however be excised together with the underlying bone...|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> structures {{may be a}} source of pain for the horse. The horse may take a few uneven steps, or may be lame for several minutes following the procedure. Flexion tests are considered positive if lameness is increased, although usually lameness is forgiven for the first few steps following flexion. The horse's response should be graded with each flexion and recorded. This allows comparison in lameness when rechecking after treatment has been implemented.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} over traditional open surgery {{is that the}} joint {{does not have to}} be opened up fully. For knee arthroscopy only two small incisions are made, one for the arthroscope and one for the surgical instruments to be used in the knee cavity. This reduces recovery time and may increase the rate of success due to less trauma to the connective tissue. It is especially useful for professional athletes, who frequently injure knee joints and require fast healing time. There is also less scarring, because of the smaller incisions. Irrigation fluid is used to distend the joint and make a surgical space. Sometimes this fluid leaks (extravasates) into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue,</b> causing edema.|$|E
50|$|Linden {{flowers are}} used for colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, {{headache}} (particularly migraine), as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. The flowers were added to baths to quell hysteria, and steeped as a tea to relieve anxiety-related indigestion, irregular heartbeat, and vomiting. The leaves are used to promote sweating to reduce fevers. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue).</b> That wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection, such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of a sprain can often be made with a good degree of certainty by physical examination based on the clinical presentation and method of injury. In some cases, X-rays are obtained {{to ensure that there}} is no fracture. In some cases, particularly if the injury is prolonged or {{does not appear to be}} resolving as expected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed to look at <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> and the ligament.|$|R
40|$|Aneurysmal bone cyst is a pseudoneoplastic {{skeletal}} disorder. The {{material of}} the Tumor Center at the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute refers to 198 cases, 25 (12. 6 %) with spinal localization. The X-ray pattern of aneurysmal bone cyst {{is represented by}} an osteolytic area more or less evidently involving the vertebra, with frequent extension to the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> Its maturing evolution is typical, and occurs both spontaneously and after surgical and/or radiation therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{knee joint}} is a {{frequent}} focus of attention for rheumatologists when assessing patients presenting to a clinic and may represent underlying intra-articular inflammatory pathology or involvement of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> This study describes the correlation between clinical and ultrasound findings in patients presenting {{with a variety of}} rheumatic disorders and knee pain. US imaging provides for a sensitive and detailed identification of different intra- and peri-articular pathology responsible for knee pain...|$|R
5000|$|Linden {{flowers are}} used in {{herbalism}} for colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache (particularly migraine), and as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. [...] In the traditional Austrian medicine Tilia sp. flowers have been used internally as tea for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, fever and flu. New evidence shows that the flowers may be hepatoprotective. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue).</b> That wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg.|$|E
50|$|Flexion {{tests are}} a {{diagnostic}} tool involving {{the application of}} sustained pressure on {{a particular set of}} joints. The limb is forcibly flexed for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, depending on the joint and practitioner preference, and the horse is immediately trotted off. An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> structures may be a source of pain for the horse. Flexion tests help narrow down the source of lameness to a certain part of the leg, but they are non-specific because they almost always affect more than one joint and because they also affect the soft tissue structures around the joint, not just the joint itself. Additionally, they must be interpreted carefully due to the risk of false negatives and false positives.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the callus may place {{pressure}} on <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> structures. The callus of a splint bone fracture can push on the adjacent suspensory ligament, leading to lameness from secondary suspensory desmitis. Treatment usually involves {{the removal of}} the offending callus.On average, bone heals better than soft tissue. It requires less time to heal and, unlike soft tissue which is always weaker after healing, bone heals to 100% strength. However, fracture healing in horses is complicated by their size, flightiness, and desire to stand. Horses are at risk of re-injury of the fracture site, especially when trying to rise after lying down, or when recovering from anesthesia following fracture repair. Forced recumbency is not an option for horses, making healing more difficult. Weight bearing on a single front or hind limb increases the likelihood of support limb laminitis. Additionally, the cost of casting or surgical fixation makes treatment financially unattainable for some owners. While limb fractures are no longer a death-sentence for horses, it is still considered a very serious injury. In general, a horse is more likely to survive if it is small in stature and has a good temperament that will tolerate the months of inactivity required for healing. Fractures that are open, comminuted (very fragmented), or located higher on the limb tend to have a poorer prognosis.|$|E
40|$|Transient {{osteoporosis}} {{of the hip}} (TOH) is a rare condition mainly affecting {{pregnant women}} in their third trimester and middle aged men. We report a case of TOH/Bone marrow edema syndrome in pregnancy with involvement of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> on magnetic resonance image, {{which has not been}} previously reported. The presence of such edema in the <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> may help to differentiate this condition from early avascular necrosis of the hip, and may also provide an insight into the pathogenesis of the condition.

40|$|Osteomyelitis {{is defined}} as an {{infection}} of the bone, bone marrow, and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues.</b> Most cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, principally Staphylococcus aureus. We present a case where a 5 -month-old male had an acute onset of decreased movement of his left leg and increased irritability and was subsequently diagnosed with rickets and hematogenous osteomyelitis with bacteremia. The case explores a possible association between hematogenous osteomyelitis and rickets...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{lengthening}} of metatarsals by distraction osteogenesis are reported. One {{of these cases}} is an acquired deformity of the first metatarsal; {{the other is a}} congenital short fourth metatarsal. By following the prin-ciples set forth by IIizarov, it was possible to lengthen the metatarsal bones and <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> without open lengthening of tendons or secondary bone grafting of the distraction gap. We believe this method is an improvement over previously described methods of meta-tarsal lengthening...|$|R
30|$|Vital bone {{normally}} {{is surrounded}} by vital, non-infected soft tissue. Even vital affected bone may recover when the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> does not show any pathological changes {{especially in terms of}} the microcirculation. It is an alarming sign if the physiologically solid combination between bone and <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> does not exist because in these areas the bone may be necrotic (typical locations are the dorsal aspect of the femur or the medial surface of the tibia) [1].|$|E
30|$|It is {{of course}} clear that, before bone {{reconstructive}} surgery is begun, the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> should be found not to contain any pathological findings (i.e., no infection, optimal micro-vascularization, etc.). In other words, the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> {{should be in the}} best possible condition, a key factor in the successful bone reconstruction. If any malfunction or pathological finding is determined, appropriate procedures should be undertaken in response (i.e., surgical and antibiotic eradication of any local infection, optimizing the micro- and macro-vascularization by vascular surgical operations, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Calcaneal {{osteomyelitis}} {{presents a}} complicated situation. The specific {{anatomy of the}} os calcis and its <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> {{plays an important role}} in the planning and realization of the procedures needed in order to eradicate the osteomyelitic focus. The calcaneus represents a spongious bone; a fact that supports the developement of an osteomyelitis. It is the strongest bone of the foot and is highly important for the biomechanical features of physiological walking. The <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> are thin and contain various important anatomical structures. These might be damaged during the treatment of the osteomyelitis. In addition the vascularization of the os calcis is delicate and may be compromized during the surgical osteomyelitis treatment. Calcaneus osteomyelitis may be classified based on the routes of infection into exogenous and endogenous forms. Additionally from the clinical point of view acute and chronic forms may be distinguished from an early and a late infection. Exogenous calcaneal osteomyelitis mostly is the result of an infection with S. aureus. The treatment is equal to the therapy in other locations and based on: â€¢Eradication of the bone infection â€¢Sanitation of the <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> infection â€¢Reconstruction of bone and <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> Especially the preservation and restoration of the <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> is important. Thus plastic surgical procedures play an essential role. The main object of treatment is the preservation of a biomechanical functioning foot. This may be impossible due to the local situation. Calcanectomy or even below knee amputation may be needed in those cases...|$|R
30|$|Traumatic {{injury to}} the <b>surrounding</b> (periapical) <b>soft</b> <b>tissue</b> should be avoided at all times. To this end, {{instrument}} stops should be used and instruments should be confined entirely within the root canal (Grossman 1953).|$|R
30|$|Stab {{wounds to}} the neck can be {{potentially}} lethal. They are often associated with vascular injury of the carotid artery and jugular vein. Injury of the vertebral artery is rarely seen. The injury can vary from severe bleeding after transection with hemorrhage into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>soft</b> <b>tissues</b> of the neck to dissection and separation of the intimal lining from the subjacent media of an artery and subsequent occlusion of the vessel. We report a case of traumatic vertebral artery transection managed by minimal invasive balloon occlusion.|$|R
