Key issues for the forecast extension are trends in energy efficiency improvements, the effects of increasing production and productivity improvements on energy prices, and the reduction in nuclear generating capacity. Projections in AEO 98 also reflect a greater shift to electricity market restructuring. Restructuring is addressed through several changes that are assumed {{to occur in the}} industry, including a shorter capital recovery period for capacity expansion decisions and a revised financial structure that features a higher cost of capital as the result of higher competitive risk.

Rather, in an attempt to comply with the FERC’s order, groups of participants (or “Power Pools” composed of generators, transmission providers and utilities) partnered, and proposed to the FERC, for the right to establish designs of independent system operations. Through negotiation, collaboration and legal challenges, the first ISOs to emerge included California ISO, PJM Interconnection, New York ISO and New England ISO. Each proposed a slightly different market design according to their collaborative results. In order to facilitate competitive wholesale markets, Order No. 888 specified the unbundling of a utility’s operations separating generation and transmission and distribution.In addressing #2 above, the original order (and subsequent clarification by the FERC) allows utilities, under certain defined circumstances, to seek extra-contractual recovery of <b>stranded</b> <b>costs.</b> The FERC continues to receive rehearing petitions regarding stranded cost recovery as it has clearly placed the importance on remedying what it terms as “undue discrimination” at the forefront.|$|E

40|$|Restructuring of the {{electricity}} industry was expected to improve the operating efficiency of electric power generators, leading to lower production costs and retail prices. Most studies conclude {{that there have been}} some efficiency gains, but the subject of whether retail prices have fallen has been contentious. The existing literature has a number of shortcomings, including the use of blunt or inappropriate definitions of restructuring, failure to incorporate the effects of regulatory decisions regarding price caps and <b>stranded</b> <b>cost</b> recovery, and the use of highly aggregated data. Our study addresses many of these problems and thus represents a significant improvement on existing work. We use a detailed firm-level data set to estimate how the markets and institutions established as a part of “restructuring ” have affected the difference between prices and costs. Based on a number of different definitions, we find that utilities that have undergone restructuring display significantly higher price-cost markups than utilities that remained traditionally regulated. We find that some elements of restructuring are associated with higher price-cost margins, while others appear to be uncorrelated with prices and costs.

40|$|Without {{significant}} price reduction, high consumer switching {{rates to}} competitive power suppliers {{have been criticized}} {{as a result of}} either the artificially high price to compare (PC) acting as the benchmark price that competitive generators must meet, or the critical mass effect from switching consumers. This paper builds a simple model to explore how the restructuring policy determines residential switching behavior. When the PC increases over time, whether it reflects the rising wholesale price adequately or not, a consistent price reduction policy will naturally induce an early-stage high switching rate. In contrast, a required switching rate policy that is associated with both an artificial price cut at the early stage and a longer period of <b>stranded</b> <b>cost</b> recovery can accelerate switching effectively. Two high-cost Pennsylvania utilities, which demonstrate opposite movements of residential switching rate under different restructuring policies, are examined to confirm that the high switching rate just results from the policy design, not from the subsidy in PC discussed in (Joskow, Paul L. “Why Do We Need Electricity Retailers?

The aim of the paper is threefold. First, the paper {{discusses the}} place of the stranded cost concept in the variety of costs concepts encountered in the economic literature. In order to come to a proper description of <b>stranded</b> <b>costs,</b> we first define a new concept, i. e. strandable costs. These are the fixed or sunk costs to be paid by the incumbents that have been imposed by the regulator. Strandable costs become stranded when they cannot be recovered through the market after the introduction of competition. Second, we argue on the basis of a simple graphical analysis that from the point of view of economic efficiency, there is no need to allow for stranded cost recovery. Third, this view is illustrated with some numerical simulations, based on the Belgian electricity sector. These simulations suggest that, according to the assumptions and to the definition of <b>stranded</b> <b>costs</b> in our model, there will be no <b>stranded</b> <b>costs</b> for the Belgian electricity producers. A fortiori, the conclusion is that there is no need to allow for stranded cost recovery.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{electricity}} deregulation and restructuring {{on research and development}} (R&D) expenditures of investor owned utilities. The differing pace of deregulation in the fifty states provides heterogeneity in institutional structure and competitive forces, and showcases the response of R&D funding to changing institutional environments. Based on a panel of all major investor-owned utilities from 1989 - 1997, this paper analyzes various political constraints, institutional change, and firm-specific financial and structural factors that have contributed to the decline of R&D expenditure in the U. S. electric utility industry. R&D is modeled as a two-stage process where firms first decide whether to invest in research depending on their critical mass and state characteristics, and then conditional on a positive decision, decide on the level of expenditure. A variation of the Heckman model is estimated in a panel data setting, allowing for separate effects of selection and intensity. The primary findings are: First, greater deregulation and competition has a positive effect on R&D whereas a higher probability of deregulation adversely affects research spending. The start date for retail competition and level and policies for <b>stranded</b> <b>cost</b> recovery do affect spending. Second, the response of R&D to financial and other firm attributes varies with the state of deregulation and provides insights into firm behavior in a regulated context. Third, the institutional and competitive factors interact in a way that suggest that full deregulation, coupled with effective retail competition may mitigate the problem of declining electricity R&D by the utilities.

The architecture of the basic reform model that supports both wholesale and retail competition in the supply of generation services adopted by a number of pioneer states is developed. Recent trends in generation divestiture, mergers between electric utilities, and between electric and gas pipeline and distribution companies, and entry of unregulated merchant generating plants are then reviewed. The new institutional arrangements necessary to govern access to and the operations of electric transmission networks to support competition among competing decentralized generators of electricity are examined. Transmission pricing, market organization, congestion management and market power issues are included in this analysis. (cont.)

The artificial matrices were optimized on real protein-coding sequences based on Evolutionary Strategies approach to minimize or maximize the probability of non-synonymous substitutions and costs of amino acid replacements depending on their physicochemical properties. The results show that the empirical matrices have a tendency to minimize the effects of mutations rather than maximize their costs on the amino acid level.

We observed no substantial differences between the effects of mutational matrices on protein-coding sequences in genomes under study in respect of differently replicated DNA <b>strands,</b> mutational <b>cost</b> types and properties of the referenced artificial matrices.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{possibly}} unrecoverable cost incurred by a utility, or `stranded costs,` {{has emerged as}} a major obstacle to developing a competitive generation market. <b>Stranded</b> or transition <b>costs</b> are defined as costs incurred by a utility to serve its customers that were being recovered in rates but are no longer due to availability of lower-priced alternative suppliers. The idea of `stranded cost,` and more importantly arguments for its recovery, is a concept with little basis in economic theory, legal precedence, or precedence in other deregulated industries. The main argument recovery is that the ``regulatory compact`` requires it. This is based on the misconception that the regulator compact is simply: the utility incurs costs on behalf of its customers because of the ``obligation to serve`` so, therefore, customers are obligated to pay. This is a mischaracterization of what the compact was and how it developed. Another argument is that recovery is required for economic efficiency. This presumes, however, a very narrow definition of efficiency based on preventing ``uneconomic`` bypass of the utility and that utilities minimize costs. A broader definition of efficiency and the likelihood of cost inefficiencies in the industry suggest that the cost imposed on customers from inhibiting competition could exceed the gains from preventing uneconomic bypass. Both these issues are examined in this paper...|$|R

It uses an instrumental approach to determine the circumstances in which courts can outperform parties in improving welfare by intervention. It assesses the two dominant strands of scholarship for addressing the legal intervention question. One <b>strand</b> emphasizes the <b>costs</b> of parties achieving complete contracts and justified legal intervention as a means to reduce such transaction <b>costs.</b> The other <b>strand</b> of scholarship, represented by the new formalists, emphasizes the difficulty of supplying terms that depend on unverifiable or unobservable information. While both strands of the literature contain valid insights, this paper suggests that neither strand of scholarship provides an analysis of how intervention would advance or hinder the parties 2 ̆ 7 welfare when certain factors such as uncertainty, sunk costs and opportunism are taken into account.
