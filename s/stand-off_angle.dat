40|$|Euler and Navier-Stokes {{results are}} {{presented}} for a blunt delta wing at Mach 7. 15 and 300 angle of attack. The viscous calculations were done at a Reynolds number based on chord of 5. 85 x 106 with freestream and wall temperatures set to 74 K and 288 K respectively. The inviscid simulations were carried out using a finite volume, central difference code written by Roberts [21] and Goodsell [7]. The Navier-Stokes results were obtained on the semi-implicit extension of the inviscid code, developed by Loyd [17]. The inviscid results showed a strong shock on the windward side of the wing at a <b>stand-off</b> <b>angle</b> of about - 5 ' from the body. As the flow traverses around the leading edge it accelerates strongly through an expansion fan. On the upper surface of the wing, separation occurs at about 60 % span resulting in a region of reverse cross stream flow. The viscous calculations display a similar shock structure. Furthermore the boundary layer on the windward side is thin and variations in the circumferential direction are small. The flow on the leeward side of the wing separates in 2 places. The primary separation occurs just inside of the leading edge, and the secondary separation region is located further inboard. The inviscid CL and CD are 0. 547 and 0. 383 respectively, whereas the viscous values are 0. 547 and 0. 386. The viscous component contributes only an insignificant 2. 32 x 10 - S to the CD of the Navier-Stokes calculations...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study on grain noise suppression using baseline subtraction {{is presented in}} this paper. Monitoring is usually done with permanently installed transducers {{but this is not}} always possible; here instead monitoring is conducted by carrying out repeat C-scans and the feasibility of grain noise suppression by subtracting A-scans extracted from the C-scans is investigated. The success of this technique depends on the ability to reproduce the same conditions for each scan, including a consistent <b>stand-off,</b> <b>angle,</b> and lateral position of the transducer relative to the testpiece. The significance of errors are illustrated and a 3 D cross correlation is used which enables the same lateral position to be located within successive C-scans. The experimental results show that a noise reduction of around 15 dB is obtained after baseline subtraction, which will significantly improve the defect detection sensitivity. In practice however, successive C-scans may be conducted at different temperatures and with different transducers of similar specifications but a varying frequency response. Compensation techniques to reduce the impact of such variations are then presented and their effectiveness is verified experimentally. It is shown that it is feasible to obtain an overall improvement of around 10 dB in the signal to noise ratio via baseline subtraction, where a temperature difference of up to 10 ∘C and a peak frequency shift of as much as ± 250 kHz from a baseline value of around 7 MHz can be tolerated. However, this improvement was obtained in laboratory conditions with no changes {{to the surface of the}} specimen due to oxidation or corrosion. It is shown that differences in temperature and transducer frequency response are more difficult to compensate for than changes in test geometry and position...|$|E
50|$|The Sd. Kfz. 231, 232 and 263 were {{initially}} built on chassis slightly modified for their needs. From July 1942 {{they were built}} on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. From September 1941, a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. From late 1940 <b>Stand-off</b> <b>angled</b> armour plates were mounted about 50 cm {{in front of the}} vehicles. This additional armour was retrofitted to older vehicles and dropped with introduction of the strengthened front armour in July 1942.|$|R
40|$|The Robotics Technology Development Program {{now known}} as the Robotics Crosscut Program, funded the {{development}} and deployment of a small remotely operated vehicle for inspection and cleanout of small horizontal waste storage tanks that have limited access. Besides the advantage of access through tank risers as small as 18 -in. diameter, the small robotic system is also significantly less expensive to procure and to operate than larger remotely operated vehicle (ROV) systems. The vehicle specified to support this activity was the ROV Technologies, Inc., Scarab. The Scarab is a tracked vehicle with an independently actuated front and rear ''toe'' degree-of-freedom which allows the <b>stand-off</b> and <b>angle</b> of the vehicle platform with respect to the floor to be changed. The Scarab is a flexible remote tool {{that can be used for}} a variety of tasks with its primary uses targeted for inspection and small scale waste retrieval. The vehicle and any necessary process equipment are mounted in a deployment and containment enclosure to simplify deployment and movement of the system from tank to tank. This paper outlines the technical issues related to the Scarab vehicle and its deployment for use in tank inspection and waste retrieval operatio...|$|R
40|$|When {{a complex}} {{geometry}} is rotated {{in front of}} the thermal spray gun, the following kinematic parameters vary in a coupled fashion dictated by the geometry: <b>Stand-off</b> distance, spray <b>angle</b> and gun traverse speed. These fluctuations affect the conditions of particle impact with major implications on the coating’s properties. This work aims to probe into the interplay and isolated effect of these parameters on vital coating characteristics in applications requiring variable stand-off distance and spray angles. WC- 17 Co powders are sprayed via HVOF on steel substrates in a set of experiments that simulates the spray process of a non-circular cross section, while it allows for individual control of the kinematic parameters. Comprehensive investigation of their influence is made on deposition rate, residual stresses, porosity and microhardness of the final coating. It was determined that oblique spray <b>angles</b> and long <b>stand-off</b> distances compromise the coating properties but in some cases, the interplay of the kinematic parameters produced non-linear behaviours. Microhardness is related negatively with oblique spray angles at short distances while a positive correlation emerges as the stand-off distance is increased. Porosity and residual stresses are sensitive to the spray angle only in relatively short stand-off distances...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{spray coating}} is usually applied through {{directing}} molten or softened particles {{at very high}} velocities onto a substrate. An eddy current non-destructive inspection technique is presented here for thermal spray coating interface quality characterization. Several high-velocity-oxy-fuel (HVOF) coated steel plates were produced with different surface preparation conditions before applying the coating, e. g., grit-blasted surface, wire-brush cleaned surface, and a dirty surface. A quad-frequency eddy current probe was used to manually scan over the coating surface to evaluate the bonding quality. Experimental {{results show that the}} three surface preparation conditions can be successfully differentiated by looking into the impedance difference observed from the eddy current probe. The measurement is fairly robust and consistent. More specimens are also prepared with variations of process parameters, such as spray <b>angle,</b> <b>stand-off</b> distance, and application of corrosion protective sealant, etc. They are blindly tested to evaluate the reliability of the eddy current system. Quantitative relations between the coating bond strength and the eddy current response are also established with the support of destructive testing. This non-contact, non-destructive, easy to use technique has the potential for evaluating the coating quality immediately after its application so that any defects can be corrected immediately...|$|R
40|$|In arena blast testing, {{a common}} and {{economical}} practice employed is to distribute several targets radially around a central charge. However, if these targets are positioned too proximally, reflections and diffractions of blast waves off neighbouring cubicles {{can affect the}} nature of expected blast loading. Computational fluid dynamics software has been used through an extensive series of simulations to identify the levels of interference in incident pressure–time histories with and without an obstructing target present. The data were post-processed to identify the Cartesian co-ordinates in which different levels of interference in peak incident overpressure and incident positive phase impulse were achieved. The results indicated that in all cases, there was a greater interference in peak incident overpressure than incident positive phase impulse values directly proximal to the target but, at greater separations, significant differences in incident positive phase impulse existed where peak incident overpressure had returned to free-field equivalent magnitudes. When compared with the established ‘rules of thumb’ for cubicle placement, for targets at different <b>stand-off</b> ranges, an <b>angle</b> of 45 ° to the rear cubicle still holds some practical relevance, although it is too acute to cover all interference effects. For targets positioned at the same stand-off range, a separation distance of two cubicle widths is generally too conservative and, in many cases, more cubicles can be positioned around the charge. A bespoke recommendation table has been presented for targets at stand-off ranges between 15 and 50 m to allow users to identify the minimum distance from a target at which obstructed-field peak incident overpressure and incident positive phase impulse values differ negligibly from free-field equivalents...|$|R
40|$|Low-speed {{wind tunnel}} tests of a {{flexible}} wing semi-span model {{have been implemented}} in the 9 × 79 × 7 ft de Havilland wind tunnel at the University of Glasgow. The main objective of this investigation is to quantify the effect of removing the traditional peniche boundary layer spacer utilised {{in this type of}} testing. Removal of the peniche results in a stand-off gap between the wind tunnel wall and the model’s symmetry plane. This offers the advantage of preventing the development of a horseshoe vortex in front of the model, at the peniche/wall juncture. The formation of the horseshoe vortex is known to influence the flow structures around the entire model and thus alters the model’s aerodynamic behaviours. To determine the influence of the stand-off gap, several gap heights have been tested for a range of angles of attack at Re= 1. 5 × 106 Re= 1. 5 × 106, based on the wing mean aerodynamic chord (MAC). Force platform data have been used to evaluate aerodynamic coefficients, and how they vary with stand-off heights. Stereoscopic Particle Imaging Velocimetry (sPIV) was used to examine the interaction between the tunnel boundary layer and model’s respective stand-off gap. In addition, clay and tuft surface visualisation enhanced the understanding of how local flow structures over the length of the fuselage vary with <b>stand-off</b> height and <b>angle</b> of attack. The presented results show that a stand-off gap of four-to-five times the displacement thickness of the tunnel wall boundary layer is capable of achieving a flow field around the model fuselage that is representative of what would be expected for an equivalent full-span model in free-air—this cannot be achieved with the application of a peniche...|$|R
40|$|In {{large-scale}} arena blast testing, {{a common}} and economical practice undertaken is to position several cubicle targets radially around a central charge. To gain maximal benefit from this, targets should be positioned at their minimum permissible separation at which no blast wave interference is sustained from neighbouring obstructions. This interference typically occurs either when targets positioned {{at the same}} stand-off range are too close creating an amplification effect where a superposition forms between the incident blast wave and the reflected wave off the cubicle, or, where a target is positioned in the region behind another target, which causes a shadowing effect with decreased magnitudes of pressure and impulse. A comprehensive computational modelling study was undertaken using the hydrocode Air 3 D to examine the influence of cubicle positioning at different ranges on the surrounding blast wave pressure-time fields. A systematic series of simulations were conducted to show the differences in incident peak overpressure and positive phase impulse between free-field and obstructed-field simulation configurations. The predictions from the modelling study indicated {{that the presence of}} cubicle target obstructions resulted in differences in peak incident overpressure and positive phase impulse in nearby pressure waves. In all cases, at close separation distances, there were greater differences in peak pressure than positive phase impulse. However, with increased separation, peak pressure returned to free-field conditions sooner whilst differences in impulse remained significant, thus governing separation distance recommendations. The simulations showed that, for targets at the same stand-off range, clear separations of between 3. 88 m and 6. 92 m were required to achieve free-field equivalency, depending on the distance from the charge to the target. For targets at different <b>stand-off</b> ranges an <b>angle</b> greater than 54. 2 ° from the front corner of the cubicle has been shown to ensure free-field equivalent conditions. A bespoke recommendation table has been generated to provide precise positioning for cubicles at different stand-off ranges in a look-up matrix format that can be readily used by engineers in the field...|$|R
