50|$|Between 16 and 17 October 2011, the CAAB quietly {{upgraded}} {{it from a}} short take-off {{and landing}} (<b>STOL)</b> <b>port</b> to a domestic airport. This increased {{the importance of the}} airport. The CAAB had declared this on their website, however, its website details on navigational aides, air traffic service and aeronautical communications for air operations in Bangladesh territory didn't mention Tejgaon airfield as an airport. A domestic airport requires all the technical features and passenger services as an international airport as per rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation but the Tejgaon Airport does not have the services required for a <b>STOL</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{landing system}} was developed for the Augmentor Wing Jet STOL Research Airplane to establish the feasibility and examine the operating characteristics of a powered-lift STOL transport flying a steep, microwave landing system (MLS) glide slope to automatically land on a <b>STOL</b> <b>port.</b> The flight test results address the longitudinal aspects of automatic powered lift STOL airplane operation including glide slope tracking on the backside of the power curve, flare, and touchdown. Three different autoland control laws were evaluated to demonstrate the tradeoff between control complexity and the resulting performance. The flight test and simulation methodology used in developing conventional jet transport systems {{was applied to the}} powered-lift STOL airplane. The results obtained suggest that an {{automatic landing system}} for a powered-lift STOL airplane operating into an MLS-equipped <b>STOL</b> <b>port</b> is feasible. However, the airplane must be provided with a means of rapidly regulation lift to satisfactorily provide the glide slope tracking and control of touchdown sink rate needed for automatic landings...|$|E

For this aim search {{was made on}} published items, connection with related institutions was provided and investigations was made on Adnan Menderes Airport. The publishments made by International Institutions especially by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) on technical matters and master. planning, different books, periodicals and brochures have provided information on worldwide airport planning studies, planning criteria and standards. Development and present condition of civil aviation and planning studies in Turkey is {{another part of the}} study. In the privacy of Çeşme <b>STOL</b> <b>Port,</b> STOL system which has a widespread application today and will have weight in the long-term development evaluated from the planning point of view. As a result, it was observed that, there is lack and inefficiency in airport planning studies in Turkey and STOL Ports with their requirement programs and typical architectural projects have the same problems. For this reason, with the information achieved by research in hand, an alternative project in urban design scale have prepared for Ceşme <b>STOL</b> <b>Port...</b>|$|E

40|$|One {{proposed}} {{solution to the}} total short-haul transportation system problem is to use existing low-wing-loading turbopropeller STOL aircraft. Deflected slipstream turboprop aircraft have also been considered for early STOL service. Aspects of current aircraft research are discussed together with the NASA research aircraft, field length and aircraft performance considerations, crosswind landings, crosswind reducing fences, elevated <b>STOL</b> <b>ports,</b> a guaranteed friction STOL runway, and problems of runway containment...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been made}} to evaluate the impact on fuel requirements of a segregated short-haul system. A comparison has been made between two alternate scenarios: one with STOL, and the other without STOL. For the New York to Washington, D. C. city pair the results show: (1) the modal efficiency approach, while indicating the with STOL scenario requires more fuel than the without STOL scenario, is of questionable validity because it does not account for various effects which exist in realistic scenarios; (2) evaluation of fuel requirements based on more detailed modeling indicates that while a STOL scenario requires more fuel than without STOL when an idealized CTOL system is postulated, the STOL scenario requires less fuel than without STOL when the CTOL system has even moderate delays. These results are due to a combination of effects: the closer and more convenient locations of <b>STOL</b> <b>ports</b> to the traveler, congestion at the CTOL airports, and the impact of the through passenger traffic. Sensitivity of results to STOL aircraft block fuel and to CTOL congestion delays are considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{operating}} {{problems and}} equipment requirements for STOL airplanes in terminal area operations in simulated {{air traffic control}} (ATC) environments were studied. These studies consisted of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) arrivals and departures in the New York area to and from a downtown <b>STOL</b> <b>port,</b> STOL runways at John F. Kennedy International Airport, or STOL runways at a hypothetical international airport. The studies were accomplished in real time by using a STOL airplane flight simulator.

40|$|Noise {{measurements}} {{were obtained for}} a four-engine turbopropeller STOL airplane during a Federal Aviation Administration flight evaluation program at the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center. These noise measurements involved landing-approach, takeoff-climbout, and flyby operations of the airplane. A total of 13 measuring positions were used to define the noise characteristics around a simulated <b>STOL</b> <b>port.</b> The results are presented {{in the form of}} both physical and subjective measurements. An appendix is included to present tabulated values of various subjective reaction units which may be significant for the planning and operation of STOL ports. The main source of noise produced by this vehicle was found to be the propeller, and noise levels decrease generally in accordance with the inverse-distance law for distances up to about 457 meters. For similar slant ranges, somewhat lower noise levels were experienced during flyby than during takeoff or landing. Prepared by Langley Research Center. "December 1971. "N 72 - 11948.
