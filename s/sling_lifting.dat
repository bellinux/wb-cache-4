As safety {{is the number one}} priority in all work aspects, a solution must be devised to prevent accidents from occurring. A total of thirteen cases regarding synthetic sling failure were evaluated in order to determine their causes, effects, and preventative measures. From the collected data, it was found that all cases in which the synthetic sling contacted the edge of its load resulted in sling failure. It is required that adequate synthetic sling protection devices be used to protect <b>slings</b> in any <b>lift</b> where the <b>sling</b> comes in direct contact with the edge or corner of its load. However, there are no consensus codes or standards stating the type, material, or purpose of the type of protective device used to protect the sling from being cut. Numerous industry standards and codes provide vague descriptions on how to protect synthetic slings. Without a clear, concise statement of how to protect synthetic slings, it is common for inadequate materials and sling protection devices to be used in an attempt to meet the intent of these requirements. The use of an inadequate sling protection device is the main cause of synthetic sling failure in all researched cases.

50|$|The Helicopter Support Team (HST) is {{a unit of}} {{organization}} within the United States Marine Corps that manages the activities of a helicopter landing zone (LZ). It consists {{of a team of}} eight Landing Support Marines who are trained to hook up external loads to the hooks of primarily military helicopters. All kinds of gear can be lifted by helicopter and taken to locations with terrain that is not suited for other kinds of vehicles. For example communications equipment can be placed on top of a mountain within a few minutes of flight instead of a few hours of driving, if one could even drive the equipment to the designated location. The HST is a valuable resource to the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF)), as it provides an expedient manner of transportation for gear and supplies. Within the HST there is the HST commander whose job is to coordinate the mission between the airwing, the supporting unit, and the Marine Logistics Group who provides the HST. The HST Commander is usually a Sergeant and sometimes a Staff Sergeant. Subordinate to the HST Commander is the HST Safety NCO, the job of the safety NCO is to ensure that the gear or supplies are rigged properly, and to ensure that everyone underneath the Helicopter are doing their job in a safe manner. The Safety NCO is normally a Corporal or Sergeant. The primary members of the HST are the Leg-men and the inside and outside directors along with the hookman and the Static Man. The inside and outside directors direct the pilot of the aircraft as he centers his helicopter over the load that is being lifted. The leg-men ensure that the <b>slings</b> used to <b>lift</b> the gear do not get caught on anything and lift in a straight manner as to not disturb the load being lifted. The job of the Static man is to use a grounding rod to attach to the hook so that the static electricity conducted by the helicopter is grounded out and does not end up killing a Marine. The Hook Man the hooks up the load to the hook of the aircraft in a safe manner.|$|R
5000|$|Roine states, [...] "lumber longshoring was a {{difficult}} and often dangerous form of work, but it offered slightly higher wages than did general labour in a sawmill and provided {{the opportunity to work}} intermittently and pursue other activities when so desired". Lumber longshoring consisted of handling raw, unprocessed logs and milled lumber into the holds of ships. In the early days of longshoring, this entailed transporting logs by hand into sailing ships by maneuvering them through portholes or the stern, or by sliding them down [...] "a series of ramps to the ship's hold." [...] Milled lumber was loaded into a <b>sling</b> and <b>lifted</b> by cable with a steam-powered engine into the ship holds. The engines for these lift systems were called [...] "donkeys" [...] and were positioned on either docks or barges. According to dock worker Ray Mason, who began working on the waterfront in 1913,And at that time they had donkey engines on scows barges. The ships had stern ports and everything was hauled in with the donkey through or over the stern. Of course, at that time the Indians from the North Shore Burrard Inlet did all that work.By the 1920s, steam-powered vessels had almost entirely replaced sailing ships, leading to increased mechanization; deck-mounted winches and derricks or cranes were used to move the lumber. While repetitive and physically demanding, longshoring lumber was a skilled profession that saw men develop specialized positions within each work gang. Knowing how to maneuver lumber on and off a ship required significant know-how. For example, in the words of famed Tsleil-Waututh longshoreman, chief, Hollywood celebrity, and Native rights activist Dan George:Some of the timber were ninety feet long—so big that when the ship finally got to England, they didn't know how to handle the cargo, and we had to send men over to unload. Mostly I loaded forty-foot lengths. They could be loaded one at a time, so a five-masted schooner might take anywhere from three to six months to load.Edward Nahanee, a longshoreman and resident of the Squamish Reserve at Mission (Ustlawn), stated: When I was running side I used to watch the load coming down the hatch. There might be six or eight timbers in the load and I would size it up as soon as it landed I would know where each timber was going.The specialized ability to fit lumber into a ship was a role that many Aboriginals gained respect for, while also reinforcing a causal notion of race as a determinant of skill for certain tasks. According to historian Rolf Knight, the role of racialization in dock work was a factor in the prominence of Aboriginal men performing lumber longshoring: [...] "loading lumber was one of the more strenuous kinds of longshoring, so that employers attempted to maintain competition between racially distinct crews and that a reluctance seems to have developed among employers to hire Indians to handle non-lumber cargo". Forty-five-year veteran waterfront worker Sam Engler stated that white longshoremen were given preference for the best above-deck jobs, saying [...] "Indians used to call us white brothers and we were getting the choice jobs". In response to these pressures, the use by Aboriginal workers of the Squamish language helped establish camaraderie, while also enabling them to subvert authority by being able to keep their conversations socially encrypted from the oversight of white employers and colleagues.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructures made {{of glass}} {{reinforced}} plastic (GRP), often abbreviated GRP cover, are used to protect subsea equipment in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These structures need to be lifted during fabrication, transportation and during the installation. The present work investigates the lifting capacity of the GRP covers. The aim is to achieve a more accurate analytical estimate of the lifting capacity, with a desire to replace the simplified hand calculations used today. In order to investigate the lifting capacity, a lifting point (reinforced lifting holes made of GRP) is studied with both finite element analysis and experimental tests in a hydraulic tensile bench. Three different test setups, Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 are investigated. Case 1 is a representation of a lift through the splash zone during installation, where the GRP cover is in an upright vertical position. Case 2 is an approximation of a horizontal lift with the lifting point located on top of the cover, causing the lifting point to encounter out-of-plane loads. Case 3 is a representation of a horizontal four-point lift, with the lifting point placed on the side walls. The experimental tests were performed in collaboration with Highcomp AS at Westcon Løfteteknikk in Haugesund. The finite element analysis represents the test setup in the hydraulic tensile bench in order to achieve comparable data. Finite element analysis can reduce cost and time compared with physical experiments. For Case 1, with in-plane loads representing the lifting through the splash zone, the results achieved were within a 2 % error margin. For the out-of-plane situation (Case 2) with solid elements, the results were within a 20 % error margin. The results from the in-plane and out-of-plane scenarios were used in a capacity evaluation to create a graph which represents all results and takes into account the out-of-plane angle from the <b>lifting</b> <b>slings.</b> This graph is easy to use in design and provides good results. Based on the comparison of the results, it was concluded that the Puck criterion with gradual degradation provides the most accurate estimate for the capacity and that use of this criterion can replace simplified hand calculation and reduce the number of physical experiments in the future. Based on these findings, an improvement study was conducted for a 30 mm laminate with Puck criterion and gradual degradation with a new lay-up consisting of fibers at [0, 90, + 45, - 45] degrees, compared to the one used today [0, 90]. The results of the new study showed an increase of over 28 % for the capacity in Case 1 and an increase of over 16 % compared with Case 2. These are interesting results, leading to the conclusion that by introducing the fiber directions + 45 degrees, one can enhance the capacity of the material by about 20 %, and it is easy and efficient to implement in a new design of the lifting point used in GRP covers...|$|R
40|$|As the {{offshore}} industry operates on deeper seas, subsea technology {{becomes more and}} more important. As a consequence of this, marine lifting operations of subsea equipment has become very common. Prior to such an operation it is necessary to define the limiting sea states. Many methods for doing this are very conservative and will underestimate the operational conditions. Defining the limiting sea states can be done by numerical simulations using commercial software. However this may be very time consuming. The focus on this report is put on modeling lifting of objects through the splash zone using the computer program USFOS. Dynamic analyses of the lowering were performed. Even though this program is not initially intended for such use, it has features that makes such analyses possible. In this report the applicability of USFOS for such use will be studied. Three main models have been considered. The first of them was a very simple model of a horizontal pipe that was lowered into the sea. The wire forces was considered, and it was studied how different input parameters affected the results. The input parameters for this simple model was taken further by simulating the lowering of a subsea spool through the splash zone. This model consisted of a subsea spool, a spreader bar, 4 <b>slings</b> and a <b>lifting</b> wire. Both flat sea and regular waves were simulated. For the regular wave cases, the forces in the wires and slings was studied. This showed that slack in the <b>lifting</b> wire or <b>slings</b> would occur in 3 out of 4 sea states. Further the elastic utilization of the structure was evaluated according to API-RP- 2 A-WSD, which is implemented in USFOS. In this study {{it was found that the}} utilization of the structure increases as the wave height in- creases. However it is questioned how accurately USFOS calculates the forces in the splash zone for the most extreme cases of regular waves. The last and most realistic model that was considered in this thesis, was lowering of the subsea spool into irregular waves. These waves were simulated according to the JONSWAP wave spectrum. Different sea states were modeled by changing the value of significant wave height and peak period. In addition the top end of the lifting wire was connected to the moving crane tip of a vessel. The vessel motions were defined by RAO functions that were included in the input files. For all of the sea states that were modeled, the minimum wire forces were found. This resulted in an overview of which sea states that would give slack in <b>lifting</b> wire or <b>slings.</b> The trend showed that as the significant wave height was increased, the minimum forces in the wires and slings decreased. From the work that was carried out it was concluded that USFOS can be used for modeling simple marine lifting operations. The program calculates the equilibrium forces in the top end of the wire element in the right way. But its use for this purpose is limited. If damping is introduced to the system, the force in the wire element will decrease due to this, and thus give an error in the equilibrium value. Further the special beam formulation used to model the elongating wire element, requires that a dynamic analysis is performed. Thus there will be oscillations in the system due to initiation of gravity and self weight. Therefore this initial phase should be neglected when considering the structural response. One of the advantages of the program for this type of use is its ability to evaluate non-linear structural behavior, and calculate elastic utilization of the structure. There are, however, uncertainties in the elastic utilization calculations when it comes to definitions of parameters such as buckling length. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has become more challenging the past years and marine operations must be performed in smarter and more cost-effective ways. Waiting on weather should be minimised and design and planning will be of high importance. A marine operation shall be designed to bring an object from one safe condition to another safe condition. A subsea lift consists of different phases that should be evaluated during the planning process, where the through splash zone phase is usually most critical. In order to account for uncertainty in weather forecast, the operation's design criterion is reduced by an alpha-factor. Installations of protection covers are common offshore operations, but only a few hydrodynamic investigations have been performed on such objects. This Master Thesis describes a study aimed at finding as high operational criterion as possible for an installation of a GRP pipeline protection cover. Further investigations were performed on the differences in use of numerical simulations and DNV GL's Simplified Method. The operation's operability was investigated for the two different operational criteria. For a light lift operation, the occurrence of slack in slings are critical and does usually determine the maximum operational sea state. Slack arises when the total hydrodynamic force acting on the object exceeds 90 % of its submerged weight. The lift was simulated for the splash zone phase in the non-linear time domain simulation program, SIMA. The minimum tension that arose in the slings for each wave condition with random seed number, were used to develop a Gumbel distribution. The sea state was categorised as operational if the 10 % quantile, found by an inversed Gumbel CDF, was above the slack requirement. The lifting system consisted of the vessel s crane tip, a crane wire, a hook, a hook winch, four slings, a spreader bar and the cover. The cover was implemented as slender elements in SIMA, were each slender element was given depth dependent added mass and drag. The implemented hydrodynamic parameters were estimated by CFD-analyses. The cover was lifted with an angle of 68 degrees, and the short-term environmental conditions were characterised by short-crested JONSWAP wave spectra. The installation was defined as a weather restricted level B marine operation. The total hydrodynamic force was manually estimated by the Simplified Method. The respective added mass and drag were calculated by use of tabulated coefficients for rectangular flat plates, in two directions; longitudinal and perpendicular to the cover flanges. The total added mass for a rotated cover was found by summing the vertical components of the longitudinal and perpendicular added mass. The largest tension variations occurred right after the cover was fully submerged, hence slamming and varying buoyancy forces could be omitted. The inertia and drag forces were dependent on the most probable largest crane tip motion, found by the crane tip and vessel COG locations. The maximum sea state was assessed by use of linear scaling. The average manually estimated design criterion was 1. 64 m and constant for all peak periods. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 76 the operational criterion was 1. 25 m. For each wave condition, 20 - 30 lowering simulations were performed with random seed numbers. The average winch speed was 0. 2 m/s and the cover was lowered to a depth of approximately 33 m. Both the spreader bar and the cover experienced large motions in air. The motions diminished when the cover entered the water. The tension variation in the lifting system increased when the cover entered the splash zone and calmed down when the cover was lowered to 20 meter depth. The simulated design criteria were found by investigating the tension in the <b>lifting</b> <b>slings.</b> No large snap forces were observed after a slack condition. The simulated design criteria were dependent on both significant wave heights and peak periods. The average design criterion was independent of peak periods and determined to be 2. 5 m. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 81 the operational criterion was 2 m. The operation can take place if the wave conditions are below the operational criteria over a longer duration than the operation's reference period. The operability was investigated for two fields; Heidrun and Tanzania Block 2. The reference periods were dependent on the water depth, and thus determined to be 2. 5 hours and 9. 3 hours for the two fields respectively. The operability and actual duration of operation with a random start were heavily season dependent, and were studied for both the manually estimated and simulated operational criteria. When the operational criterion increased from 1. 25 m to 2 m the operability increased with 30 - 50 % at both fields. At the same time the actual duration of operation with a random start decreased with up to 80 % at Heidrun. That is, for a given reference period, the waiting on weather decreased with the corresponding. Generally, at both fields the reason of waiting on weather was due to storm periods, where the wave conditions were above the operational criterion. The operational limit was determined by several factors; the installation method, the environmental conditions, the crane tip motion, the alpha-factor and the tension airing in the slings. According to this one can say that an operation should be short {{in order to be able}} to take place often. For increased operational criteria the operability increased and waiting on weather decreased. If the operation should take place at a random time, the risk of waiting on weather will increase. Usually, a marine operation is planned ahead of execution and is based on weather forecasts. Such planning will with a high probability reduce waiting on weather and increase the operation efficiency. In order to determine the highest operational sea state as possible in such a way that waiting on weather can be reduced, simulations should be performed prior to installations of pipeline protection covers. Hence operational costs, engine idling and pollution can be significantly reduced compared to only relying on the simplified method...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologySpools are {{rigid pipe}} {{sections}} which {{are parts of}} the infrastructure for transporting produced hydrocarbons and injection fluids subsea. Installing them includes a subsea lifting operation commonly carried out by use of the crane on an offshore construction vessel. Such operations are highly sensitive to waves, and usually limited by conditions such as excessive pendulum motions of the lifted structure and occurrence of slack <b>lifting</b> <b>slings</b> during transition through the wave zone. The industry practice is to perform software analyses of vessel motions and hydrodynamic loading acting on the spool(s) when deployed and lifted through the wave zone, {{in order to establish}} a limiting operational wave criterion. That is to determine acceptable sea states for such a lifting operation to be safely carried out. A new Offshore Standard was recently issued, the DNV-OS-H 206 “Loadout, transport and installation of subsea objects (VMO Standard – Part 2 - 6) ”. The new standard distinguishes between characteristic vessel motions generated by wind seas and the once generated by swell. A new requirement is introduced demanding that the wind sea is regarded as short crested when analyzing vessel response for operations that are independent of vessel heading. In addition, a minimum requirement to consider the situation where the wind sea and swell is acting with 90 ° degrees difference in propagation direction is introduced for subsea lifting operations. This report addresses the problem of whether or not including spreading when describing the wind sea is more conservative for spool installation lifting as compared to earlier recommended practice where waves could be assumed being long crested. Furthermore, the question about potential benefits of doing more detailed assessments of the combination of the wind sea and swell than the minimum required by DNV-OS-H 206 is raised. Both aspects are referring to the resulting limiting operational wave criterion, where conditions in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea are of interest. A case study including a thorough process of establishing a model in the software package OrcaFlex, of a state of the art spool installation lift has been the basis for the investigations carried out. The model consists of an installation vessel, lifting arrangement and spools with properties modeled at a level of detail making it representative for the real world system. A range of dynamic time domain analyses have then been carried out where the system is subjected to sea states relevant for the problem defined. The methodology is, however, similar for all analyses carried out. Simulating the lowering from approximately 2 meters above deck level down to the sea surface identifies potential excessive pendulum motions, whereas as the wave zone crossing is assessed by running simulations for selected positions through the wave zone, ensuring that loads from the irregular sea is transferred to the system. Vessel motions are described by detailed RAO values and all relevant wave induced hydrodynamic loads experienced by the lifted spools are accounted for. Analyses in a wind sea comparison study showed that modeling the wind sea as short crested waves described by the JONSWAP spectrum introduces significantly higher roll motions to the installation vessel. This subsequently leads to both excessive pendulum motions {{for a wide range of}} wave peak periods and large hydrodynamic loading on the spools because of increased crane tip motions, slamming loads in particular. The acceptable significant wave height for carrying out the lifting operation reduces. Considering this particular spool installation lift as representative also for other similar operations one can in general conclude that the limiting operational wave criterion for deployment and lifting through the wave zone for spool installations is more conservative as a result of these regulations being implemented. A combined wind sea and swell study revealed that the situation where wind sea and swell is acting with 90 ° difference in propagation direction and where the swell approaches the vessel as beam sea with periods coinciding with the natural period of the vessel’s roll motion and/or the horizontal motion of the lifted spools, as the most critical wave situation one can encounter. This study also showed that there are several benefits of doing analyses that are more refined where the wind sea and swell are modeled as separate wave trains. First, it allows one to identify a range of sea states characterized by other possible directions of the wind sea and swell than the worst case scenario, for which the operation is considered safe to carry out. Another profound merit is the opportunity to account for the vessel’s heading relative to the wind sea and swell directions. This allows one to benefit from performing analyses based on conditions more similar to the actual offshore operation, where the vessel will be able to obtain an optimal heading relative to the wind sea and the swell. This advantage is particularly evident for situations of swell dominated sea states due to the essential assumption that it is reasonable to model wind sea and swell as separate wave trains, where the swell is assumed regular and not prone to the requirement of analyzing response for directions ± 15 ° of the assumed vessel heading, as is the requirement for wind sea. The new standard’s distinction between characteristic vessel motions generated by wind seas and the once generated by swell should be seen as an encouragement to establish a new practice where these consistently also are analyzed separately. This is further supported by the fact that weather forecasts providing information about wave conditions at an installation site, which the decision to initiate an operation is based upon, can now provide information on a level much more detailed than what is currently utilized for establishing the actual limiting operational wave criterion for an operation. That is, information about height, period and direction of wind sea and swell, separately. The draft of a possible future practice where such detailed analyses, performed during transit or waiting on weather is presented in this report. An interesting continuation of the work in this report would be to investigate the new regulations’ level of conservatism. This would require a comparison of analyses results and actual measured vessel motions. Also the issue of dynamic positioning accuracy and hence level of uncertainty related to the vessel’s ability to maintain heading throughout an operation should be included in such a study. The usefulness of the presented possible future practice of establishing limiting operational criteria and initiating operations offshore should be further assessed by applying it in practice for an actual spool installation lift operation. This includes preparing a methodology where also uncertainty in forecasted wave period can be accounted for, as an extension of todays ∝-factor which accounts only for uncertainty in the forecasted significant wave height...|$|R
