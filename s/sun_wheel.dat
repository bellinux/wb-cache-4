It is not known if the SS had a special name for the ornament, or if they attributed a special meaning to it.

5000|$|According to Heinar Schilling, the Germanic {{peoples of}} the Late Bronze Age had adopted a four-spoke wheel as {{symbolic}} of the sun [...] "and this symbol has been developed into the modern swastika of our own society Nazi Germany which represents the sun." [...] Under {{the sign of the}} swastika [...] "the light bringers of the Nordic race overran the lands of the dark inferior races, and it was no coincidence that the most powerful expression of the Nordic world was found in the sign of the swastika". Very little had been preserved of the ancient rites, Professor Schilling continued, but it was a striking fact [...] "that in many German Gaue today on Sonnenwendtage (solstice days) burning <b>sun</b> <b>wheels</b> are rolled from mountain tops down into the valleys below, and almost everywhere the Sonnenwendfeuer (solstice fires) burn on those days." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "The Sun is the All-Highest to the Children of the Earth".|$|R
50|$|The Teufelsstein, {{which gave}} the hill its name, is a rock {{formation}} about 2.50 metres high and up to 4 metres wide. Five steps have been carved into the rock, staircase-fashion, leading to the top {{where there is a}} hollow which is thought to be a sacrifice bowl (Opferschale) for religious rites of its former, probably Celtic users and from which a blood channel (Blutrinne) runs down the rock by the steps. In addition the rock has numerous symbols carved into it, dating to various periods. As well as <b>sun</b> <b>wheels,</b> runes and Roman letters there are several markings that recall the stonemason's marks of the 12th and 13th centuries. According to older accounts, two coarsely drawn human figures as well as other carvings used to be visible as well, but they have since weathered away or been deliberately destroyed. In the near vicinity of the Teufelsstein are several large rocks which could be the remains of a former enclosure of the summit plateau.|$|R

We inhabit a dead ember swimming wide in the blank of space, dizzily spinning as it swims, and lighted up from several million miles away by a more horrible hell-fire than was ever conceived by the theological imagination. Yet the dead ember is a green, commodious dwelling-place; and the reverberation of this hell-fire ripens flower and fruit and mildly warms us on summer eves upon the lawn.
