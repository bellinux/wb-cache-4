5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a <b>set</b> <b>length</b> of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E

500|$|To {{address these}} problems, a final set of designs, [...] "XVI-B"–"XVI-D", was {{presented}} by Preliminary Design in October 1936. They were modifications of the [...] "XVI" [...] {{plan for a}} ship that was 714ft. long, had twelve [...] guns in three quadruple turrets, a belt of [...] sloped at °, and a deck [...] thick. In the final <b>set,</b> <b>length</b> was fixed at [...] for greater speed, but this meant only eleven 14-inch guns could be mounted with a thin [...] belt. Alternatively, one gun could be traded for a [...] belt, and another could be swapped for a 30-knot speed and one more tenth of an inch of belt armor; this became design [...] "XVI-C". The General Board liked [...] "XVI-C" [...] very much, seeing in it a ship that had enough protection to fight—and survive—in a battle line formed with the older battleships while also having enough speed to operate in a detached wing with, for example, aircraft carrier or cruiser commerce raiding groups.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the system of}} <b>sets</b> of <b>lengths</b> of non-finitely {{generated}} atomic Puiseux monoids (a Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of Q_> 0). We begin by presenting a BF-monoid M with full system of <b>sets</b> of <b>lengths,</b> which means that for each subset S of Z_> 2 there exists an element x ∈ M whose <b>set</b> of <b>lengths</b> L(x) is S. It {{is well known that}} systems of <b>sets</b> of <b>lengths</b> do not characterize numerical monoids. Here, we prove that systems of <b>sets</b> of <b>lengths</b> do not characterize non-finitely generated atomic Puiseux monoids. In a recent paper, Geroldinger and Schmid found the intersection of systems of <b>sets</b> of <b>lengths</b> of numerical monoids. Motivated by this, we extend their result to the setting of atomic Puiseux monoids. Finally, we relate the <b>sets</b> of <b>lengths</b> of the Puiseux monoid P = 〈 1 /p | p is prime〉 with the Goldbach's conjecture; in particular, we show that L(2) is precisely the set of Goldbach's numbers.

2500|$|The tractrix horn is {{very similar}} in many respects to the {{exponential}} horn and has gained adherents among DIY horn enthusiasts, audiophile consumers, and now some manufactures as well. [...] It uses a curve formula derived by assuming that a tangent to any point on the horn's inner curve will reach the central axis of the horn with a line segment of <b>set</b> <b>length.</b> At the mouth, the tangent line segment becomes perpendicular to the axis and describes the radius of the mouth. This horn concept was studied by Paul G.A.H. Voigt in the mid-1920s and patented in 1927. The size of the tractrix horn is generated by specifying the desired low frequency [...] "cutoff" [...] or limit which will determine the mouth diameter. Two incremental improvements over the exponential horn include slightly better support for low frequency extension and a somewhat broader high-frequency coverage pattern.|$|E

40|$|Numerical monoids (cofinite, {{additive}} submonoids of the non-negative integers) arise {{frequently in}} additive combinatorics, and {{have recently been}} studied {{in the context of}} factorization theory. Arithmetical numerical monoids, which are minimally generated by arithmetic sequences, are particularly well-behaved, admitting closed forms for many invariants that are difficult to compute in the general case. In~this paper, we answer the question "when does omitting generators from an arithmetical numerical monoid $S$ preserve its (well-understood) <b>set</b> of <b>length</b> <b>sets</b> and/or Frobenius number?" in two extremal cases: (i) we characterize which individual generators can be omitted from $S$ without changing the <b>set</b> of <b>length</b> <b>sets</b> or Frobenius number; and (ii) we prove that under certain conditions, nearly every generator of $S$ can be omitted without changing its <b>set</b> of <b>length</b> <b>sets</b> or Frobenius number...|$|R
