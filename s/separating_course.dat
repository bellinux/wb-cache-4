40|$|With recent media {{attention}} on medication errors in nursing practice (Berens, 2000), nursing curricula must include {{a method of}} teaching pharmacology that promotes student learning. The purpose of this nonexperimental, descriptive exploratory study was to retrospectively compare two delivery methods: integrated pharmacology content throughout a 4 -year curriculum and a <b>separate</b> pharmacology <b>course</b> offered during the sophomore year. Data, from {{a convenience sample of}} 299 senior nursing students who wrote the National League for Nursing computerized adaptive pharmacology test, were analyzed using chi-square. Findings demonstrated that teach-ing a <b>separate</b> pharmacology <b>course</b> did not result in an increase in scores. Faculty are, there-fore, encouraged to plan defined content enhancement throughout the curriculum when pharma-cology is taught as a <b>separate</b> <b>course...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Central serous chorioretinopathy {{developed}} in 2 cases of retrobulbar neuritis during systemic treatment with corticosteroids. Fluorescein angiography confirmed leakage surrounded by central serous detachment of the retina. In one case the central serous chorioretinopathy recurred 3 times during 3 <b>separate</b> <b>courses</b> of treatment. Spontaneous recovery accompanied {{a reduction in}} steroid treatment to a low level. It is suggested that high dosage corticosteroids may damge the posterior blood-ocular barrier. Maculopathy complicating treatment with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone,') or corticotrophic hormone (depot tetracosactrin 2) has been reported. We have previously noted worsening of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) in 5 cases during systemic corticosteroid therapy. In this report we describe the development ofCSR during treatment of retrobulbar neuritis (RBN) in 2 cases, one of which developed 3 separate attacks of CSR during 3 <b>separate</b> <b>courses</b> o...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{recognition}} of economic illiteracy in the United States {{has led to}} policies aimed at increasing enrollment in high school economics in the 1970 s and 1980 s and to efforts by national organizations to increase the quality of precollege economics instruction. As a consequence, enrollment in high school economics has doubled {{over the last few}} decades, and researchers who have studied the high school economics course have identified the availability of instructional materials and better prepared instructors as evidence that high school economics instruction has improved. ^ This study examines the current state of economic literacy and economics instruction in U. S. high schools. Two general questions are addressed. First, how much more do students who take a <b>separate</b> <b>course</b> in economics know about the subject than students who do not take such a course? Second, what factors in addition to course type, such as student and teacher characteristics, are associated with greater knowledge of economics? This study contributes to the literature on high school economic literacy through its use of a new national data set and recent developments in the statistical analysis of multilevel data. ^ The 1999 – 2000 norming of the third edition of the Test of Economic Literacy provided the first national data set of high school economics achievement in over a decade. Average scores were compared across course type to identify the effectiveness of a <b>separate</b> <b>course</b> in economics. Multilevel regression analysis was employed to control for student, teacher and course factors that might otherwise explain differences in average scores across course type. This also provided information regarding the influence of these other factors on economics achievement. ^ The results of this study are both negative and positive. On the negative side, high school students continue to show a deficient knowledge of basic economics, even if they have taken a <b>separate</b> <b>course.</b> On the positive side, the <b>separate</b> <b>course</b> in economics is effective in increasing student understanding of economics. Teacher preparation was found to positively influence economics achievement in social studies courses. ...|$|R
