It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{state that}} colony collapse disorder is mainly {{a problem of}} feeding the bees a monoculture diet when they should receive food {{from a variety of}} sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as corn syrup (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey bees are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including sweet clover and mustard.|$|E

25|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} two-field system, a three-field system allows for {{significantly}} more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allows for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> failure will lead to famine. Three-field agriculture creates a surplus of oats {{that can be used}} to feed horses. Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use. The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century. It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen. Illuminated manuscripts depict two-wheeled ploughs with both a mouldboard, or curved metal ploughshare, and a coulter, a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare. The Romans had used light, wheel-less ploughs with flat iron shares that often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The potato was {{introduced}} to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food because the main diet still revolved around butter, milk, and grain products. However, {{in the first two}} decades of the 18th century, it became a base food of the poor, especially in winter. Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the Irish Lumper. The expansion of the economy between 1760 and 1815 saw the potato make inroads into the diet of the people and become a staple food year round for farmers. The large dependency on this <b>single</b> <b>crop,</b> and the lack of genetic variability among the potato plants in Ireland, were two of the reasons why the emergence of Phytophthora infestans had such devastating effects in Ireland and less severe effects elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a <b>single</b> <b>crop.</b> It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E

Two maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids (704, 301), vetch (Vicia villosa), bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) <b>single</b> <b>crops</b> as well as intercrops of maize hybrids with legumes were used. The results showed that neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber of forage maize in intercropping with legume decreased. The lowest neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was obtained from 301 hybrid-vetch mixture and 301 hybrid –bitter vetch mixture. The NDF was used to predict DMI and was negatively correlated with DMI, which means that when NDF is low the quality and DMI are high. Also, the lowest ADF content was achieved in intercropping of 301 hybrid with bitter vetch, vetch and bean. As ADF decreased there was an increment in TDN, which means that animals are able to utilize the nutrients present in the forage. In conclusion, with the decrease of NDF and ADF in intercrops, DMI, TDN and net energy for lactation (NEL) content increased. Intercropping of maize with legume improved the forage quality in terms of TDN, DDM, NEL, NDF and ADF concentrations, {{as compared with the}} <b>single</b> <b>cropping</b> of maize...|$|R
25|$|Yet, on the whole, {{it was an}} {{agricultural}} society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay {{and as a result}} the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; {{only a small part of}} the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.|$|E

Due to the introduction of engine-powered boats and gill nets, there was a rise in fish catches between the 1970s and 1990s, especially in the major fishing season (mid-July to mid-November). Over-fishing, however, has depleted the fish population and some fish species are facing extinction in the area, leading to seasonal food insecurity (February to April).

40|$|A major {{objective}} of soil- and water-management systems {{is to encourage}} water infiltration rather than runoff. This may be achieved by enhanc-ing soil surface storage and improving the soils physical and hydro-physical properties (Brady and Weil 1999). The change of physical condition immediately influence not only water regime but also aeration, biological and temperature status. Conservation tillage systems offer a possibility to cover more than 30 % of the soil surface by plant residues (Miština et al. 1993). This natural mulch reduces runoff, increases infiltration rate and de-creases the evaporation of the soils water (Arshad et al. 1999, Rasmussen 1999). Good soil water storage depends not only upon tillage management but also upon the forecrop. The least soil storage water was left by alfalfa, sugar beet and in a <b>single</b> <b>cropping</b> of maize. The biggest deficit of water was ascertained after alfalfa and the least after growing of peas. The investigation of different tillage treatments and crop rotation on water balance was reported by several authors such as Procházková (1986), Kováč and Žák 1999, and others. The influence of crop rotation on water balance is revealed predomi-nantly in warmer and semi-arid (non irrigated) areas with a deep water table level (Fulajtár 1986). The identification of alternative tillage practices requires field studies of crop responses to provide appropriate information (Reeder 2000). The aim {{of this paper was}} to evaluate the com-bined effects of different soil tillage (conventional, reduced tillage, mulch tillage, no-tillage system) and <b>cropping</b> system (<b>single</b> <b>cropping,</b> three year crop rotation) on the timing and profile of soil moisture dynamics...|$|R

You can make sure that the government will never kill fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year, and that it will newer quite reach 300,000--too much room for oscillation; good speculative stock, to bear or bull, and buy and sell long and short, and all that kind of thing, but not eligible for investment like the other.

60|$|A small {{tributary}} of the Connecticut divided the view into two nearly equal parts. The fertile flats that extended on each of its banks {{for more than a}} mile, had been early stripped of their burthen of forest, and they now lay in placid meadows, or in fields from which the grain of the season had lately disappeared, and over which the plow had already left the marks of recent tillage. The whole of the plain, which ascended gently from the rivulet towards the forest, was subdivided in inclosures, by numberless fences, constructed in the rude but substantial manner of the country. Rails, in which lightness and economy of wood had been but little consulted, lying in zigzag lines, like the approaches which the besieger makes in his cautious advance to the hostile fortress, were piled on each other, until barriers seven or eight feet in height, were interposed to the inroads of vicious cattle. In one spot, a large square vacancy had been cut into the forest, and, though numberless stumps of trees darkened its surface, as indeed they did many of the fields on the flats themselves, bright, green grain was sprouting forth, luxuriantly, from the rich and virgin soil. High against the side of an adjacent hill, that might aspire to be called a low rocky mountain, a similar invasion had been made on the dominion of the trees; but caprice or convenience had induced an abandonment of the clearing, after it had ill requited the toil of felling the timber by a <b>single</b> <b>crop.</b> In this spot, straggling, girdled, and consequently dead trees, piles of logs, and black and charred stubs, were seen deforming the beauty of a field, that would, otherwise, have been striking from its deep setting in the woods. Much of the surface of this opening, too, was now concealed by bushes of what is termed the second growth; though, here and there, places appeared, in which the luxuriant white clover, natural to the country, had followed the close grazing of the flocks. The eyes of Mark were bent, inquiringly, on this clearing, which, by an air line, might have been half a mile from the place where his horse had stopped, for the sounds of a dozen differently toned cow-bells were brought, on the still air of the evening, to his ears; from among its bushes.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of global}} warming on {{agriculture}} have attracted lots of attention; however, agricultural response to climate change has been hardly documented in alpine regions. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has a low agricultural portion, {{but it is an}} increasing minority, which {{plays an important role in}} regional food security due to growing population. The region of Brahmaputra River and its two tributaries in Tibet Autonomous Region (BRIT) is the main alpine agricultural area in the TP. Rapid warming has substantially affected agro-climate resources there and altered cropland pattern as well as cropping intensity. In this study, we explored how climate warming affected cropping intensity in past decades in BRTT. The potentially spatial distributions of <b>single</b> and double <b>cropping</b> systems in different decades (1970 s, 19805, 1990 s and 2000 s) were simulated based on a cropping suitability model, considering climatic, terrain and water factors. The results showed a significant increase of cropping intensity in some regions, in response to climate warming. The area suitable for <b>single</b> <b>cropping</b> increased from 19 110 km(2) in 1970 s to 19 980 km(2) in 2000 s, expanding from the downstream valleys of Lhasa River and Nyang Qu River of the tributaries of Brahmaputra to upstream valleys. The area suitable for double cropping gradually increased from 9 km(2) in 1970 s to 2015 km(2) in 2000 s, expanding from the lower reaches of Brahmaputra River in Lhoka Prefecture to the upper ones, as well as the Lhasa River tributaries. The upper limit elevation suitable for <b>single</b> <b>cropping</b> rose vertically from 5001 m above sea level (ASL) to 5032 m ASL from 1970 s to 2000 s, meanwhile that of double cropping rose from 3608 m ASL to 3813 m ASL. Overall, increased cropland area and cropping intensity due to climatic warming could increase food production in BRIT to some extent. Further investigation about potential uncertain effects from warming is still needed for regional agricultural adaption to climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} modern {{agriculture}} on natural resources {{has become a}} major global concern. Population growth and expanding demand for agricultural products constantly increase the pressure on land and water resources. A major point of concern for many intensively managed agricultural systems with high external inputs is the low resource-use efficiency, especially for nitrogen. A high input combined with a low efficiency ultimately results in environmental problems such as soil degradation, eutrophication, pollution of groundwater, and emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases. Evidently, {{there is a need for}} a transition of current agricultural systems into highly resource-use efficient systems that are profitable, but at the same time ecologically safe and socially acceptable. Here, opportunities to improve nitrogen-use efficiency in cropping and farming systems are analyzed and discussed. In the past and present, increased productivity of the major plant production systems has been derived from genetic improvement, and from greater use of external inputs such as energy, fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation water. Aiming at improving resource-use efficiencies, in high-input systems the focus should be on more yield with less fertilizer N. In low-input systems additional use of N fertilizer may be required to increase yield level and yield stability. Developing production systems that meet the goals of sustainable agriculture requires research on different scales, from <b>single</b> <b>crops</b> to diverse cropping and farming systems.

University of Missouri 1913 Among the {{experiments}} in soil fertility {{which are being}} {{carried out by the}} University of Missouri College of Agriculture is a series of plot experiments which have been in progress since 1889. There are thirty-nine plots in the field and each has received a definite treatment during this time, the aim being to compare the effect of rotations with continuous <b>single</b> <b>crops,</b> both with and without fertilizer, and to compare the effect of commercial fertilizers with that of barnyard manure. Some striking differences in yields have been obtained but no effort had been made to investigate the changes produced in the composition of the soil until 1909, when Dr. L. D. Haigh took samples from a series of the plots and determined the hygroscopic moisture, total nitrogen and acidity. The humus, total phosphoric acid and the phosphoric acid soluble in N/ 5 HC 1, total potassium, calcium, magnesium and the lime requirement by the Veitch method have since been determined on these samples and these data, as well as the determinations made by Dr. Haigh, are presented in the following thesis.

To reduce nutrient pollution and enhance sustainable development in Taihu Basin, China, an integrated assessment of the impacts of agricultural land use policies has been performed, using the technical coefficient generator TechnoGIN and the bio-economic farm model FSSIM. Results show that although promotion of site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), the first policy, can improve regional objectives such as nutrient pollution reduction and food security, its adoption is constrained by labour productivity and availability at farm level. SSNM is more knowledge and labour intensive than conventional management, whereas labour availability is decreasing due to off-farm employment possibilities. In policy scenarios for 2015, environmental impacts are projected to decrease compared to 2008, {{partly due to the}} adoption of SSNM. However, the main reason is the decreasing labour availability towards 2015 which causes a switch from double to <b>single</b> <b>cropping</b> already in the baseline scenario for 2015. This leads to lower food production. Abolishing fertilizer subsidies for farmers that do not adopt SSNM, in combination with training appears to {{be the best way to}} stimulate SSNM adoption for improving the different land use functions. A second policy, stimulating mechanical transplanting of rice, reduces labour use and can become profitable when subsidized, but on most farm types it will not reverse the trend towards <b>single</b> <b>cropping</b> and has little influence on nutrient pollution. Thirdly, the regional policy of creating riparian buffer zones along water bodies appears to be promising, as it can strongly reduce nutrient leaching from farm land to rivers and lakes.
