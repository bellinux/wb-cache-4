40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{case study}} regarding a site in the Murge karst (Apulia, southern Italy) where, {{in the course of}} time, anthropogenic activity has caused significant damage to the natural landscape and environment, also in terms of loss of human lives. The study site comprises the city of Bari and the neighbouring towns, belonging to the same catchment basin, which is characterised by a lowrelief karst very rich in natural cavities and dry valleys, the latter locally called lame. From {{the second half of the}} 1500 s until today, in the whole area, short rainfall storms (lasting less than 6 h) with disastrous and mortal consequences have been recorded many times. In the last decades, human activities, such as urbanization, <b>stone</b> <b>clearing</b> for agricultural purposes, quarrying and deforestation induced severe changes in the karst landscape causing the modification of the surficial and underground drainage. In particular, an examination is made of the factors causing the complete destruction of the ‘‘di Maso’’ Park on the night between 22 and 23 October 2005, in consequence of a high-intensity rainfall (152. 6 mm in a 6 -h period) accompanied by flash flooding. Finally, the need for a better understanding of natural processes and patterns in karst areas, and the interactions with human activities through to the development of environmental management systems ensuring further steps towards sustainable development is remarked...|$|E
40|$|The Murge plateau is a morphostructural high of the Apulian {{foreland}} (southern Italy) and is characterised by karst morphology due {{to widespread}} outcrops of Cretaceous carbonate rocks. The natural landscape {{is typical of}} a low-relief karst very rich in natural cavities and slightly incised valleys, the latter locally called “lame”. These karst valleys act as water flow channels only during and immediately after heavy rainstorms and, in the coastal area, generally, reach the shoreline. Human activity, such as urbanization, land use change and quarrying, with time, produced irreversible degradation of the natural landscape, and severe damage to the anthropogenic environment, {{also in terms of}} loss of human life. Recently, in the night between 22 and 23 October, 2005, exceptional rainfalls (160 mm in a few hours, in an area where the mean annual rainfall is about 600 mm), hit the city of Bari and the neighbouring towns, belonging to the same catchment area. The heavy rainfall caused a flood event with disastrous results: six dead and the destruction of roads, railways and bridges. The principal causes are due to the human activities (<b>stone</b> <b>clearing,</b> quarrying, inadequate hydraulic structures, modification of the surficial and underground drainage) which induced severe changes both in the karst landscape and in the hydraulic balance. The goal of this contribution is to highlight examples about the negative role played by man in causing irreparable damage on both the natural landscape and the built-up structures, and the importance of environmental management and land use planning in karst area...|$|E

40|$|The “Alta Murgia” region (Apulia, Southern Italy) is a karstic plateau, which {{constitutes}} the main recharge {{area of the}} Murgia karstic aquifer. The natural morphology of the plateau is defined by widespread surface karst features: karst, karren fields, layers of outcropping rock with discontinuous and thin soils. In general, these soils, relatively thin with sparse vegetation, are primarily used as pastures. Recently, agricultural activities have caused dramatic changes. In particular, ploughing and crushing of the karst surface {{has led to a}} conversion of the landscape to fields growing wheat and other crops. <b>Stone</b> <b>clearing</b> practice are carried out by means of the repeated grinding of the carbonate rocks with modern technologies, intensive use of bulldozers and machinery, besides destroying and removing rocks from the fields. Practically, the natural karstic soils were replaced with a layer of homogenous soil, useful for cultivation. This cultivated soil has increased the evapotranspiration and significantly reduced the infiltration thus affecting the water balance and the aquifer recharge. In the present study we analyze the impact of changes in soil texture and crop growth on the water balance in the “Alta Murgia” area by analyzing the features of the newly created soil. The characterization of the modified soil involved both field and laboratory measurements. The HYDRUS 2 D model was used to simulate the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone. The objective {{of this paper is to}} elucidate the effect of stone removal by presenting a water balance for new soils. The simulations demonstrate that the available infiltration rate at the top layer varies from 60 % of the overall amount of rainfall for the bare soil to only 25 % in the presence of vegetation. Knowledge of the interactions between vegetation, soil and climate is essential to quantify the vadose zone hydrology and, hence the hydrogeology of the underlying karst system...|$|E
40|$|Karst environments are {{particularly}} susceptible to negative impacts from human activities, {{due to a}} number of geological, morphological and hydrogeological features. The intimate connection between surface and underground drainage, and the rapidity with which surface water (and the potential contaminants as well) may enter and percolate down through the carbonate rocks, result in an overall fragility of the karst landscape, and in high vulnerability of the karst aquifers. The present contribution describes a case study in the Salento Peninsula (Apulian karst of southern Italy) : the Burgesi area has been intensely used to quarry limestones, and later on become site of several illegal landfills where solid and liquid wastes were dumped, with serious consequences for the groundwater resources. In the very flat landscape of the study area, the most typical karst feature is represented by dolines with a well-defined circular shape, deep less than 10 meters. They can be mostly considered as collapse dolines, being originated from sinking of vault caves. Some of them were originally filled, usually for most of their depth, by residual soils, but these materials have been extracted in the past, and the initial landform consequently changed. Heavy changes occurred in fact in the last years because of anthropogenic activities such as <b>stone</b> <b>clearing,</b> removal of the soil cover, and intense quarrying activities. Multi-year aerial photo interpretation, integrated with recent field surveys, allowed to assess the areal distribution of the quarrying activity during the last 30 years. Besides quarrying activity, further serious environmental problems occurred when the sites began to be used to dump solid and liquid wastes. Since 1980, several episodes of pollution had to be registered, the most serious of which consisted in heaping in the quarries of some hundreds of drums containing highly contaminated waste industrial oils. The possibility of ground water contamination at Burgesi has been analysed by considering a number of factors,including the characteristics of the landscape, the unsaturated (vadose) zone and the aquifer (or saturated zone). To evaluate the impacts of quarrying stones on the aquifer vulnerability, two levels of geological analyses have been performed. The first coincides essentially with the assessment of the pollution potential, that is the intrinsic vulnerability of ground water at the site. The second level consists of detailed geological mapping addressed at the identification of stratigraphy, tectonic features, and surface and underground karst landforms. In addition, this second level of geological analysis represents an attempt toward evaluation of the more likely propagation of polluting substances by means of a combination of real observations and characteristics of the karst system. A significant increase in the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer {{as a consequence of the}} quarrying activity has been assessed. Nevertheless, fast drainage from the landscape to the aquifers through discontinuities in the rock mass, and development of karst systems can be hypothesized. As a consequence, pollutants may be drained from the ground surface to the aquifers in a very short time. This paper intends to remark the high fragility of karst and the need to correctly manage such environment, aimed at the preservation of the natural landscape and of the quality of karst aquifers...|$|E

Boundary bunds, although better at reducing erosion rates and retaining sediment in the field, are rejected by some farmers in preference for piles of stones, which entail a smaller loss in crop area and easier access to the field. The findings of the study are used to identify opportunities and constraints for the successful introduction of soil conservation practices and to suggest explanations for the lack of spontaneous uptake of stone-faced terraces that have been promoted to farmers in the locality...|$|R
