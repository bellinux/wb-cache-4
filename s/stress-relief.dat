5000|$|One of the {{theories}} on the specific formation mechanism for bainite is that it occurs by a shear transformation, as in martensite. The transformation is said to cause a stress-relieving effect, which is confirmed by the orientation relationships present in bainitic microstructures. [...] There are, however, similar <b>stress-relief</b> effects seen in transformations that are {{not considered to be}} martensitic in nature, but the term 'similar' does not imply identical. The relief associated with bainite is an invariant—plane strain with a large shear component. The only diffusion that occurs by this theory is during the formation of the carbide phase (usually cementite) between the ferrite plates.|$|E
50|$|Annealing, {{in glass}} terms, is heating a piece until its {{temperature}} reaches a <b>stress-relief</b> point, that is, a temperature {{at which the}} glass is still too hard to deform, but is soft enough for internal stresses to ease. The piece is then allowed to heat-soak until its temperature is uniform throughout. The time necessary for this depends {{on the type of}} glass and thickness of the thickest section. The piece is then slowly cooled at a predetermined rate until its temperature is below a critical point, at which it can't generate internal stresses, and then can safely be dropped to room temperature. This relieves the internal stresses, resulting in a piece which should last for many years. Glass which has not been annealed may crack or shatter due to a seemingly minor temperature change or other shock.|$|E
5000|$|As {{one of the}} {{requirements}} for stress corrosion cracking {{is the presence of}} stress in the components, one method of control is to eliminate that stress, or at least reduce it below the threshold stress for SCC. This is not usually feasible for working stresses (the stress that the component is intended to support), but it may be possible where the stress causing cracking is a residual stress introduced during welding or forming.Residual stresses can be relieved by <b>stress-relief</b> annealing, and this is widely used for carbon steels. These have the advantage of a relatively high threshold stress for most environments, consequently it is relatively easy to reduce the residual stresses to a low enough level. In contrast austenitic stainless steels have a very low threshold stress for chloride SCC. This, combined with the high annealing temperatures that are necessary to avoid other problems, such as sensitization and sigma phase embrittlement, means that stress relief is rarely successful as a method of controlling SCC for this system.For large structures, for which full <b>stress-relief</b> annealing is difficult or impossible, partial stress relief around welds and other critical areas may be of value. However, this must be done in a controlled way to avoid creating new regions of high residual stress, and expert advice is advisable if this approach is adopted.Stresses can also be relieved mechanically. For example, hydrostatic testing beyond yield will tend to ‘even-out’ the stresses and thereby reduce the peak residual stress. Similarly laser peening, shot-peening, or grit-blasting tend to introduce a surface compressive stress, and are beneficial for the control of SCC. The uniformity with which these processes are applied is important. If, for example, only the weld region is shot-peened, damaging tensile stresses may be created at the border of the peened area. The compressive residual stresses imparted by laser peening are precisely controlled both in location and intensity, and can be applied to mitigate sharp transitions into tensile regions. Laser peening imparts deep compressive residual stresses on the order of 10 to 20 times deeper than conventional shot peening making it significantly more beneficial at preventing SCC. [...] Laser peening is widely used in the aerospace and power generation industries in gas fired turbine engines.|$|E
5000|$|To anneal glass, it is {{necessary}} to heat it to its annealing temperature, at which its viscosity, η, drops to 1013 Poise ("Poise" [...] is a measure of absolute viscosity; 1 poise = 1 dyne-second/cm²). For most kinds of glass, this annealing temperature is in the range of 850-900 °F (454 - 482 °C), and is the so-called <b>stress-relief</b> point or annealing point of the glass. At such a viscosity, the glass still is too hard for significant external deformation without breaking, but it is soft enough to relax internal strains by microscopic flow in response to the intense stresses they introduce internally. The piece then heat-soaks until its temperature is even throughout and the stress relaxation is adequate. The time necessary for this step varies {{depending on the type of}} glass and its maximum thickness. The glass then is permitted to cool at a predetermined rate until its temperature passes the strain point (η = 1014.5 Poise), below which even microscopic internal flow effectively stops and annealing stops with it. It then is safe to cool the product to room temperature at a rate limited by the heat capacity, thickness, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficient of the glass. After annealing is complete the material can be cut to size, drilled, or polished without risk of its internal stresses shattering it.|$|E

The film was the first aired Indian film in Hong Kong, where it grossed HKD $22 million since its showing from 1 September 2011, as of January 2012, and the equivalent of over US$3 million as of 4 March 2012.

Alongside the original Hindi version, a Chinese-dubbed version was also released, with the popular actress Tang Wei (best known for Lust, Caution) voicing Kareena Kapoor's role. One reason for its success in East Asian markets such as China and Hong Kong is because of their similar education systems, thus many students were able to identify with the characters, with some Chinese universities [...] "even prescribing the film in their coursework as a kind of <b>stress-relief</b> in their classrooms." [...] 3 Idiots added US$7 million from a wide release in Far Eastern markets like South Korea, China, Hong Kong, etc. Following its success in other Asian markets, Japanese distributor Nikkatsu announced plans to release the film in Japan. Upon its release in Japanese markets in June 2013, it went on to collect around ¥100 million (₹61 million) in its first two weeks of run - that makes the film the highest grossing Hindi film ever in Japan.|$|E

30|$|Coal mining {{disasters}} involving gas {{will result}} in severe safety accidents during high-efficient exploitation for coal resources. With coal production and mining depth increasing, gas leak prevention and control in gassy coal seams with low permeability and high occurrence of outbursts have become extremely important and high-cost issues (He et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2005; Yuan 2008). In recent years, scholars and engineers have developed effective methods, with significant progress in integrated coal and gas extraction with <b>stress-relief</b> mining, such as mining program selection, roadway design, and gas extraction drilling layout (Cheng et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2004; Tu et al. 2006; Shi and Liu 2008). <b>Stress-relief</b> mining {{has proved to be}} a successful method in gassy coal mining. It uses strata movement to release elastic energy, increase coal permeability, change the methane state in the pressure-relieved coal body (to prevent coal and gas outburst), and increase the gas extraction rate. Research results show that the distribution and deformation characteristics of the stress-relieved zone in the depressurized coal seam depend on the panel layout, the spacing of the layers and their thickness, the lithology, and the roof structure between the mining seam and <b>stress-relief</b> seam; however, few investigations have examined large mining height with multiple hard thick strata at long intervals (Xu et al. 2004; Tu et al. 2006, 2007; Shi and Liu 2008; Liu 2010; Shao 2012; Xie et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013; Guo 2014). In this study, we investigate the geological and engineering conditions of No. 3 and No. 4 seams (seams A 3 and B 4) in the Pan’er coal mine, Huainan Coalfield, Anhui Province, China. A numerical simulation model is established to investigate the <b>stress-relief</b> distribution, deformation, and breakage characteristics in the overlying strata and coal seam with large height and upward mining.|$|E

30|$|According to {{geological}} {{conditions of}} No. 3 and No. 4 coal seams (namely A 3 and B 4) of the Pan’er coal mine and {{the parameters of}} panels 11223, 11224, and 11124 with fully-mechanical coal mining, we built 2 D similar material simulation and FLAC 3 D numerical simulation models to investigate the development of mining-induced stress and the extraction effect of pressure-relief gas with large height and upward mining. Based on a comprehensive analysis of experimental data and observations, we obtained the deformation and breakage characteristics of strata overlying the coal seam, the development patterns of the mining-induced stress and fracture, {{and the size of}} the <b>stress-relief</b> area. The <b>stress-relief</b> effect was investigated and analyzed in consideration with mining height and three thick hard strata. Because of the group of three hard thick strata located in the main roof and the residual stress of mined panel 11124, the deformation, breakage, mining-induced stress and fracture development, and the <b>stress-relief</b> coefficient were discontinuous and asymmetrical. The breakage angle of the overlying strata, and the compressive and expansive zones of coal deformation were mainly controlled by the number, thickness, and strength of the hard stratum. Compared with the value of breakage angle derived by the traditional empirical method, the experimental value was lower than the traditional results by 3 °– 4 ° below the hard thick strata group, and by 13 °– 19 ° above the hard thick strata group. The amount of gas extracted from floor drainage roadway of B 4 over 17  months was variable and the amount of gas per month differed considerably, being much smaller when panel 11223 influenced the area of the three hard thick strata. Generally, the <b>stress-relief</b> zone of No. 4 coal seam was small under the influence of the hard thick strata located in the main roof, which played an important role in delaying the breakage time and increasing the breakage space. In this study we gained understanding of the <b>stress-relief</b> mechanism influenced by the hard thick roof. The research results and engineering practice show that the main roof of the multiple hard thick strata is a critical factor in the design of panel layout and roadways for integrated coal exploitation and gas extraction, provides a theoretical basis for safe and high-efficient mining of coal resources.|$|E

The microstructure of materials was investigated using a light microscopy. Columnar grains of martensite dominate in as-made microstructure. <b>Stress-relief</b> annealing led to the white acicular phase growth in the structure with a fishbone arrangement on the boundary of some original martensitic needles. Mechanical properties of materials were characterized through hardness measurement in two directions relating to the sample building direction.

Heat treatment does not affect the corrosion rate remarkably, however it leads to stabilization of corrosion potential of materials Ecorr. The surface of the samples was modified by an abrasive blasting using spherical (zirblast) and sharp-edged (white corundum) blasting abrasives and three levels of air pressure.
