Of the larger islands, Aspen Island {{is located in}} Central Basin while Springbank and <b>Spinnaker</b> Island {{are located in the}} West Lake. Aspen Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge, and is the site of the Australian National Carillon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being <b>spinnaker</b> ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, PÃ©ter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E

25|$|High Performance {{dinghies}} {{are fast}} and powerful dinghies designed for racing around an Olympic triangle (Olympic Racing Course). Examples of such dinghies are the International Flying Dutchman, the International 505, the Jet 14, the Fireball, the Osprey, the Thistle, the 14ft John Spencer Javelin and the International 470. They can all plane easily, even upwind {{and they use}} trapeze and a symmetric <b>spinnaker.</b> Not all are two handed boats: the International Contender and the RS600 are high performance single handed boats equipped with a trapeze, but not a <b>spinnaker,</b> and demonstrate a comparable performance. Skiffs are usually classed as High performance dinghies.|$|E

25|$|Due to the J/80 {{having an}} {{asymmetrical}} <b>spinnaker</b> with a retractable bowsprit, {{there is little}} clutter on the deck and in the cockpit, giving the crew more space and fewer tripping hazards on board.|$|E
25|$|Cruises often stop at Zihuatanejo, {{the city}} having {{become a major}} cruise stop and a major {{attraction}} for its beaches. The city is also famous for its catamaran tours of both Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa bay where snorkeling, <b>spinnaker</b> flying, and sunset cruises are offered.|$|E
25|$|A dinghy {{is a type}} {{of small}} open {{sailboat}} commonly used for recreation, sail training, and tending a larger vessel. They are popular in youth sailing programs for their short LOA, simple operation and minimal maintenance. They have three (or fewer) sails: the mainsail, jib, and <b>spinnaker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, <b>Spinnakers</b> Brew Pub {{opened in}} Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. It {{was the first}} ever {{custom-built}} brewpub in Canada, and {{was part of a}} new wave of brewpubs and craft breweries in British Columbia that followed a major deregulation of the brewing industry in that province. [...] <b>Spinnakers</b> also included inventive cuisine, and is claimed as world's oldest gastropub by Joseph Blake of Eat magazine.|$|R

50|$|<b>Spinnakers</b> for {{cruising}} {{boats are}} starting to be patterned after the roller furling code 0 racing <b>spinnakers,</b> as they provide the easiest handling. North Sails, for example, offers three gennaker sails, based on the racing code 0 asymmetrics, with different sizes and cambers for varying angles and wind speeds. Other manufacturers offer similar cruising code 0 designs under different names, such as the screecher and reacher for upwind and downwind use respectively.|$|R
25|$|Two islands (Castle Island and <b>Spinnaker</b> Island) in Boston Harbor are {{not part}} of the National Recreation Area, and other former islands (e.g. Apple Island, Governors Island and Noddle's Island) were obliterated by the {{formation}} of East Boston and the expansion of Logan International Airport before the area was designated.|$|E
25|$|The 470 (Four-Seventy) is a {{double-handed}} monohull planing dinghy with a centreboard, Bermuda rig, and centre sheeting. Equipped with a <b>spinnaker,</b> trapeze {{and a large}} sail-area-to-weight ratio, it {{is designed}} to plane easily, and good teamwork necessary to sail it well. The name comes from the overall length of the boat in centimetres (i.e., the boat is 4.70 metres long).|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} {{development}} team included three programmers (all previous employees of <b>Spinnaker</b> Software), one musician (Tony Trippi) and freelance writer Jonathan Merritt, who created the scripts and designs. Under DeSharone's direction, game development progressed similarly to that of his earlier-directed title, Below the Root, a game which Retro Gamers John Szczepaniak has suggested may {{have served as a}} forerunner of sorts. Background designs were created by local Cambridge artists.|$|E
50|$|Yachts {{were also}} {{accepted}} with a two-person crew with self-steering, {{and there were}} handicap concessions for yachts choosing to sail without <b>spinnakers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The winner on {{elapsed time}} in the race was the 77-foot SV Condor of Bermuda skippered by Peter Blake, which gained around 90 minutes on the leader at the Fastnet rock, the SV Kialoa by chancing a <b>spinnaker.</b> Jim Kilroy of the Kialoa had broken his ribs and there was damage to the yacht's runners. SV Condor of Bermuda broke the Fastnet record by nearly eight hours (71h25m23s).|$|E
25|$|The team uniforms for {{the tournament}} {{were based on the}} {{official}} shirts for the 1986-87 America's Cup being held concurrently in Fremantle. Each team's main colour made up {{the bottom half of the}} shirt, their secondary colour made up the top half and a white stripe surrounded the shirt over the chest. The official logo of the tournament was based on a 12-metre class yacht with a white cricket ball half doubling as the <b>spinnaker.</b>|$|E
25|$|Exactly {{when the}} fierce rivalry between the {{supporters}} of the two clubs began is not entirely clear. Until {{as recently as the}} early 1970s, many fans would go and watch the other team when their side was playing away, indicating anything but hatred. Some ascribe the growing rivalry since then to the cities' diverging economic fortunes. In 2015, 10,000 people signed a petition against using a red and white livery (Southampton colours) on the <b>Spinnaker</b> Tower in Portsmouth. The city council subsequently came to an agreement with sponsors Emirates to use blue and gold (Portsmouth colours) instead.|$|E
50|$|Beer can races {{allow people}} to {{experience}} yacht racing in a more relaxed environment {{than that of a}} major offshore race. They typically offer races on short courses. Many restrict the use of <b>spinnakers,</b> trapeze harnesses, and the use of twin headsails.|$|R
50|$|The Class {{has never}} been tempted to adopt {{construction}} materials other than wood.Traditionally the sails were made of calico, cotton, and subsequently silk. In recent years Terylene and nylon have been used with the effect that coloured <b>spinnakers</b> are now used by most boats.|$|R

25|$|The {{idea for}} a sail or balloon tip {{modification}} of Ronald Bradley's simple portex tubing method came about from Swan's observation from the Laguna Beach CA shore of sail boats on the water on a relatively calm day. Boats with conventional slot sails were still; one with a <b>spinnaker</b> {{was able to make}} reasonable headway. The concept of using thermodilution to measure cardiac output was originally the idea of Arnost Fronek. As a former colleague of Fronek, Ganz added the thermistor modification after Swan showed him the initial balloon design, which was fabricated by Edwards Laboratories, which had previously contracted with Swan as a consultant.|$|E
25|$|Filming started near Dublin on 11 April 2016, {{while the}} last two scripts were still being produced. Scenes {{in the setting of}} St Brendan's Catholic Church were filmed at St Matthias' Church, Killiney, on the first two days. On-location filming also took place in Dalkey's Coliemore Harbour between 5 and 11 May. Six weeks of on-location filming took place in the village of Dunmore East in County Waterford, {{starting}} on 25 May 2016. The scripts called for a seaside town or village and out of the options found by the location management team, Dunmore East was chosen. Dunmore East was essentially renamed to Redwater during filming, with the local council and businesses getting involved. Various locations in the village were used, including the beach, church, The Strand Inn and The <b>Spinnaker</b> Bar, with filming at The Strand Inn starting immediately, and interior filming at The <b>Spinnaker</b> Bar lasting three days from 31 May to 2 June 2016. The Strand Inn was used for five separate fictional locations in the series: a tourism office, restaurant, surf shop, sushi bar, and the exterior of the pub, called Peter Dolan's in the series, for which the facade of The Strand Inn was transformed. A country fair, called The Winking Fish, was set up outside The Strand Inn for the purpose of filming. The nearby village of Passage East was also used for filming. Filming ended on 26 July 2016. Wallace filmed some of her own stunts, including jumping from a boat into the sea and an underwater sequence, which were filmed in Dublin. Some filming was also done at Magheramore beach, County Wicklow, including a scene filmed at midnight where mist was created over the sea. The series was filmed with a single camera.|$|E
500|$|During major earthworks, {{at least}} [...] of topsoil was excavated. It was {{collected}} for use at several public parks and gardens, including the future Commonwealth Park {{on the northern}} shore. It was also used to create the six artificial islands including Springbank Island. The island was named after the former Springbank Farm that was situated there. Land excavated to create a sailing course at Yarralumla {{was used for the}} thematically named <b>Spinnaker</b> Island to its north, while excavated stone was moved beside the Kings Avenue Bridge at {{the eastern edge of the}} central basin from Aspen Island.|$|E
50|$|A jib is a {{triangular}} sail that sets {{ahead of the}} foremast of a sailing vessel. Its tack is fixed to the bowsprit, to the bows, or to the deck between the bowsprit and the foremost mast. Jibs and <b>spinnakers</b> are the two main types of headsails on a modern boat.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 <b>Spinnaker's</b> brewpub {{opened on}} Kimta Road off Esquimalt Road. The Westsong Way, a {{pedestrian}} walkway, winds {{along the shore}} around Songhees Point, offering views of Downtown Victoria and James Bay across the harbour. Parks and open space also include Victoria West Park, Banfield Park, Barnard Park, and Raynor Park.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of HyperCard at least two {{alternative}} tools were created outside of Apple, <b>Spinnaker's</b> Plus and SuperCard. Plus was very much like HyperCard, with the notable distinction of being cross-platform, operating on both Mac OS and Windows. SuperCard was Mac-only at the time, and is still a shipping product.|$|R
