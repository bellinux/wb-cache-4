It {{is believed that}} the fire was caused by <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E

5000|$|Cigarettes {{are often}} seen {{as the source of}} fire, as the {{improper}} disposal of <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> causes one of every four fire deaths in the United States. Natural causes such as heart attacks may lead to the victim dying, subsequently dropping the cigarette, which after a period of smouldering can ignite the victim's clothes.|$|E

50|$|A {{rolling machine}} is {{a machine that}} is {{designed}} to roll either tobacco, cannabis, or other products such as synthetic cannabis into individual cigarettes or joints. To roll a cigarette with cannabis, one must break up the <b>smoking</b> <b>material,</b> which can be done using a grinder, as well as remove any stems so they won't puncture the paper. Rolling a cigarette with tobacco does not require prep work because the leaf is already shredded.|$|R
5000|$|An U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the explosion occurred when a miner's cigarette lighter ignited a pocket of methane gas. Investigators found the mine operator at fault for failing to adequately ventilate the mineshaft, failing to evacuate workers from an area with high methane levels, and failing to effectively enforce regulations that banned <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> in mines.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{of the new}} powder {{magazine}} on land within the ramparts commenced in 1771. The Grand Magazine (as it became) was enclosed with a high brick wall to assist with security and to ensure no contraband items were brought into the magazine; these items included ferrous objects (to {{reduce the risk of}} sparks), alcohol and <b>smoking</b> <b>materials.</b> It took six years for the complex to be completed.|$|E

5000|$|Waste bins are {{fitted with}} Halon fire-extinguishing bottles and [...] "oxygen-smothering flapper lids", and the toilets {{equipped}} with smoke detectors. Over time these protective devices have {{been incorporated into}} aircraft lavatory designs due to fires that have started when the careless smoker of the past or the clandestine smoker of the present has incorrectly disposed of smouldering <b>smoking</b> <b>material.</b> Also, the danger from accidental fires in the toilet {{is considered to be}} higher than {{in other parts of the}} aircraft cabin as the fire would have more time to develop before being noticed by a passenger or crew-member.|$|R

But what I say is, that when you consider they are dear at six a half-penny, you can grumble. Well boiled, they might serve for greens; but as <b>smoking</b> <b>material</b> they are not worth the match with which you light them, especially not if the match be a German one. The German match is quite a high art work. It has a yellow head and a magenta or green stem, and can certainly lay claim to being the handsomest match in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Non-smoking {{rules were}} {{strictly}} enforced. No <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> {{of any kind}} were permitted aboard. If anything was seen or found, the passenger was fined $250 and put off at the next port (transportation home to be provided at passenger's own expense).Due to poor revenue, Carnival decided to discontinue the smoke-free ship in December 2003 because they claimed that non-smokers tend to not drink or gamble as much as those accustomed to smoke.|$|E
50|$|Some smokeasy {{operators}} simply operate openly, calculating {{that the}} fines {{they will pay}} are merely a cost of doing business. Others employ stealth tactics; for example, in Philadelphia, where {{it is illegal to}} have an ashtray in the workplace, smokeasy bartenders sometimes will use cups filled with some water to serve as ashtrays. A visit from the city inspector then merely requires getting customers to extinguish their <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> and disposing of the cigarette butts.|$|E

50|$|Spoon pipes (glass pipes {{or glass}} bowl pipes) have become {{increasingly}} common {{with the rise of}} cannabis smoking. Spoon pipes are normally made of borosilicate glass to withstand repeated exposure to high temperatures. They consist of a bowl for packing material into, stem for inhaling, and a carbureter (carb) for controlling suction and airflow into the pipe. These pipes utilize a two step process. First, the user inhales while lighting the <b>smoking</b> <b>material</b> and holding down the carb, allowing smoke to fill the stem. Then, the user releases the carb while inhaling to allow air to enter the stem and smoke to be pulled into the user's mouth.|$|R
5000|$|Pipes {{made for}} smoking cannabis, {{sometimes}} called pieces or bowls, {{are made of}} a variety of materials, including metal fittings, ceramic, Borosilicate glass, stone, wood, bamboo among other materials. Subtypes include one-hitters, bubblers, chillums, glass blunts, corn cob pipes, and standard hand pipes.Pipes vary greatly in shape and materials, and most are handmade. The common thread between them is having a narrow screened receptacle ("bowl"), a [...] "stem" [...] (which may be a long flexible tube as on hookahs and vaporizers), and a [...] "mouthpiece". The <b>smoking</b> <b>material</b> is placed in the receptacle and affected with a heat source while air is drawn through the bowl and stem to the user.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} smoke and smoke {{fractions}} from tobacco and a substitute <b>smoking</b> <b>material</b> (NSM) on the DNA content of mammaliam cells in culture were measured. Tobacco smoke caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of all the mammalian cells exposed compared with controls. NSM smoke {{did not have a}} significant effect on the DNA content of the exposed cells (P less than 0. 95). Smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixtures. Condensate from cigarettes containing tobacco or blends of tobacco and NSM caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in DNA content of mammalian cell populations in culture, whereas equal weights of condensate from NSM alone or NSM containing nicotine did not cause significant changes (P less than 0. 05). NSM produces 28 % of the weight of condensate per cigarette in comparison with tabacco and would, therefore, be expected to be far less biologically active than tobacco. Filtered smoke from cigarettes containing tobacco caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of mammalian cells in culture. These changes were quantitatively similar to those caused by whole smoke suggesting that the gas phase of cigarette smoke is biologically more reactive than the particulate phase. The filtered smoke from the substitute <b>smoking</b> <b>material</b> NSM did not cause significant (P less than 0. 95) changes in DNA content of cultured mammalian cells. Filtered smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixture...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of an ashtray is sometimes commented upon, given that smoking has been long banned on flights {{in many parts of}} the world. However it is a requirement of the Federal Aviation Administration that ashtrays continue to be fitted to the doors of aircraft toilets. This is due to the fire risk caused by the possible disposal of illicitly consumed <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> in the toilet's wastebin. In 2011, a Jazz flight from Fredericton, Canada to Toronto was prevented from taking off because an ashtray was missing - the aircraft instead flew to Halifax without passengers to have a new ashtray fitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{fire started}} in a {{materials}} store {{at the south}} end of the northbound Victoria line platform, which was being used by contractors working on the modernisation of the station. It gutted the northbound Victoria line platform tunnel and the passages leading off it. The adjacent northbound Bakerloo line platform suffered smoke damage, as did the escalator tunnel and the booking hall. Other areas of the station were undamaged. The most likely cause of the fire was a smoker discarding <b>smoking</b> <b>materials</b> through a ventilation grille into the materials store, which ignited rags or paint thinner.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{the safety}} lamps were found, however one {{was found that}} was unlocked. <b>Smoking</b> <b>materials</b> {{including}} matches {{were found in the}} clothes of the deceased, one man was found with a half full pipe in his hand. Several men had unofficial (and therefore illegal) lamp-keys on them. In the immediate vicinity of the seat of the explosion little burning was seen, the supposition was that a firedamp explosion had raised dust in the passageways and the coal dust had exploded. The official investigation tentatively suggested that shot firing had displaced the gas towards the area where men were smoking and that a naked flame there triggered off the explosion.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of World Wide Web-based tailored behavioral <b>smoking</b> cessation <b>materials</b> among nicotine patch users. DESIGN: Two-group randomized controlled trial. SETTING: World Wide Web in England and Republic of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3971 subjects who purchased a particular brand of nicotine patch and logged-on to use a free web-based behavioral support program. INTERVENTION: Web-based tailored behavioral <b>smoking</b> cessation <b>materials</b> or web-based non-tailored materials. MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-eight-day continuous abstinence rates were assessed by internet-based survey at 6 -week follow-up and 10 -week continuous rates at 12 -week follow-up. FINDINGS: Using three approaches to the analyses of 6 - and 12 -week outcomes, participants in the tailored condition reported clinically and statistically significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than participants in the non-tailored condition. In our primary analyses using as a denominator all subjects who logged-on to the treatment site at least once, continuous abstinence rates at 6 weeks were 29. 0...|$|R
