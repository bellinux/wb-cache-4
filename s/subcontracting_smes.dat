Even though some theoretical and a few empirical studies throw light {{on the nature of}} assistance provided by TNCs to local SMEs through subcontracting relationships,none of the studies so far analysed the diversity of assistance that <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> of India would be able to obtain from a TNC using quantitative measurement. This paper probes the extent of linkages and diversity of assistance that Indian <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> would be able to obtain from a TNC customer based on primary data from SME subcontractors of a major TNC automobile manufacturer. Statistical analysis of direct assistance revealed that SMEs receive more of product and purchase process assistance. The extent of assistance for their process related,marketing, human resource and financial requirements is low whereas the assistance for their organisational know-how requirements is moderate. The major indirect benefits these SMEs could achieve are knowledge transfer, business volume, superior work culture, reputation and quality improvement...|$|E

In the era of globalization the wellbeing of any national economy depends on the export performance of local companies and their integration in the world economy. Therefore in the past decade issues of internationalization of SMEs have been attracting much attention from academic researchers and policymakers. However, there are still gaps in the knowledge regarding international behavior of SMEs involved in subcontracting. This exploratory research looks at the international activities of a number of SMEs involved in subcontracting. The research is of qualitative nature and is based on in-depth interviews with eight senior managers of four Scottish SMEs operating as subcontracting firms. Further, the following issues arising from the international behaviour of the <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs,</b> namely, the motives for internationalization; the relationship between growth of the company and international expansion; the relationship between characteristics of management team and internationalization; the problems and the strategies of internationalization; and the use of government support programmes/initiatives to promote their international operations relating to <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> are analysed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) {{are one of}} the {{principal}} driving forces in the development of an economy because of its significant contribution in terms of number of enterprises, employment, output and exports in most developing as well as developed countries. But SMEs, particularly in developing countries like India, face constraints in the functional areas of technology, finance, marketing and human resources. Moreover these SMEs have been exposed to intense international competition since early 1990 s because of globalisation. However, globalisation, the process of continuing integration of the countries in the world has opened up new opportunities for SMEs of developing countries to cater to wider international markets which bring out the need for these SMEs to develop competitiveness for their survival as well as growth. Subcontracting relationship of SMEs with Large Enterprises (LEs) is an important source of access to technology and other infrastructural resources for SMEs of developing countries enabling them to develop their capabilities and become competitive. In the era of globalisation, Trans National Corporations (TNCs) are expanding their production facilities to developing countries for availing the advantages of productivity and distribution more than ever and India is no exception. These TNCs which concentrate on core operations and outsource non core activities offer better scope for local SMEs to have subcontracting relationship with them. Superior work culture of these TNCs would be reflected in their subcontracting relationships with local SME suppliers since TNCs place much emphasis on their value chain to be organised according to international standards. The key issue is whether Indian SMEs have entered into subcontracting relationship with TNCs and if so {{what is the nature of}} these subcontracting relationships? Does this relationship with the TNCs offer more scope for receiving assistance of various kinds for <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs?</b> What is the extent and diversity of this TNC assistance? Given the quantum of assistance, does it facilitate the innovations and economic performance of SMEs? These questions have been addressed in the study with reference to <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> of three major TNCs in the Indian automobile industrya Japanese TNC, a German TNC and a Swedish TNCall the three being located in Bangalore, India. A theoretical framework for subcontracting relationship between TNCs and SMEs is proposed focusing on TNC assistance, SME innovations and economic performance, based on literature review. The study is based on an Ex Post Facto Exploratory research using primary data collected from a sample of 81 SME subcontractors selected from the list of first level suppliers provided by the three TNCs. The relevant data were collected using a structured questionnaire by visiting the firms and having personal interviews with entrepreneurs/senior managers of the firms. An assessment of nature of the SME subcontractors and their subcontracting relationships with TNCs revealed that these SME subcontractors of the three TNCs are in different stages of TNCSME subcontracting relationship. The Swedish TNCSME subcontracting relationships are in the initial stage, the Japanese TNCSME subcontracting relationships are in the growing stage and German TNCSME subcontracting relationships are in an enduring stage of the relationship. Therefore they are alternatively referred to as initial stage SME subcontractors, growing stage SME subcontractors and enduring stage SME subcontractors. The assistance a subcontracting SME received from its TNC customer was measured using 20 item variables under 7 dimensions of assistance related to product, production process, managerial know-how, marketing, human resource, financial and purchase process. A model to measure the degree of assistance was formulated with these 20 item variables for measuring the seven dimensions of assistance. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to establish the validity of the model. The degree of assistance was calculated as a single summated score for each case by summing up the composite scores of the seven dimensions of assistance calculated using weighted average method. The assistance provided to SME subcontractors was more in the case of German TNC than those of Japanese TNC and Swedish TNC. Even though there was evidence of assistance from TNCs to SME subcontractors, these SMEs received more of product related and purchase process assistance whereas assistance for their production process, managerial know-how, marketing, human resource, financial requirements was not very high. This implies that subcontracting relationship of Indian SMEs with TNCs is confined more to a mere purchase supply relationship where both the parties are concerned about the basic requirements of purchase supply relationship like detailed specifications, proper feedback on product performance, advance information about future orders, preferential pricing and proper payment. Innovation of the <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> was measured based on six dimensions of innovation, namely, new product developments, product modifications, process improvements, informal R&D/NPD expenditure, informal R&D/NPD employees and raw material selection. Firms were classified into two groups as high innovators and low innovators based on the innovation score calculated using the six dimensions. To probe the role of TNC assistance in the innovations of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs,</b> a logistic regression analysis was performed using the equation with degree of assistance, capital and labour as explanatory variables and innovation level as criterion variable. Our analysis revealed the positive role of assistance in the innovations of SMEs. However, the positive role of this assistance was found to be decreasing as focus of our analysis shifted from the initial stage SME subcontractors to the growing stage SME subcontractors and then to the enduring stage SME subcontractors even when the assistance they received increased from one stage to the other. SME subcontractors operating in the initial stage of the relationships, who in general lack technological competence, rely more and make more use of the assistance, even when the assistance itself is low, for their innovative performance. As the relationship gets older, the SMEs may be able to enhance their inhouse competence using the assistance from the TNC and may make more use of their own resources for innovations along with the assistance from TNCs. Therefore, as SME firms begin to use more of their inhouse resources for their innovations, it is likely that the role of TNC assistance for SME innovations would decrease. Increasing positive role of labour for SME innovations as the relationship shifted from initial to enduring stages substantiate the argument of increasing utilisation of inhouse resources for innovations as relationship prolongs over a period of time. A comparative analysis of the economic performance of SME subcontractors revealed that the German subcontractors were having more labour productivity and value added to value of output and low capital productivity whereas Swedish subcontractors were having high capital productivity and low labour productivity and value of added to value of output compared to other two. In order to probe the role of degree of assistance on the economic performance of SMEs, a regression analysis was performed using the equation with degree of assistance, capital and labour as explanatory variables and value addition as criterion variable. The results revealed the contributory role of TNC assistance in the economic performance of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> but this contributory role of assistance was found to be decreasing even when the assistance itself is increasing whereas the contribution of labour increased, as our analysis shifted from the initial stage to the growing and then to the enduring stage of relationships. The extent of assistance might be low at the initial stage of the relationship but the small and young SME subcontractors who in general, lack technological competence might be able to make more use of this assistance since the assistance from TNCs would be one of their major sources for technical upgradation and growth. As the relationship prolongs both contracting and subcontracting firms may rely on trust and build up close relationship which would enable the SMEs to enhance their sales to the TNC and receive more assistance. At the same time, some of the SMEs might even strengthen their inhouse resources due to TNC assistance which in turn could be further used for their economic performance. This could be the reason for the decreasing contributory role of assistance and increasing contributory role of labour for the economic performance of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> as our analysis moved to more enduring relationships. Further analysis using other regression models revealed that the firms, which received more assistance from the TNC customers utilised labour more efficiently than firms which received lesser assistance. TNC assistance was found to be an important factor for the enhancement of labour productivity of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs,</b> especially for young and small firms operating in the initial stage of the relationship. The <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> were able to make use of the innovations which they could carry out with TNC assistance for their economic performance. Quantile regression analysis, performed to have a more comprehensive picture of the effect of degree of assistance on economic performance, revealed that that for SMEs having average factor productivities, the assistance from TNCs contributed less to their economic performance relative to those SMEs which had low and high factor productivities, respectively. Moreover, SMEs which had high factor productivities were able to make more use of their innovations for their economic performance. These findings clearly show that the TNC assistance enables <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> to enhance their innovations and economic performance. Initially, the SME subcontractors might receive less assistance but these SMEs who in general, have limited resources may make more use of this assistance for better performance and enhancing their internal capabilities. As the subcontracting relationship endures over a period of time, <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> would be able to enhance their performance and develop their internal resources which in turn could be further used for their performance. If that is so, even when the SMEs are able to receive more assistance from TNCs and deliver higher performance, the contribution of this assistance for their performance would decrease. Thus this diminishing role of assistance from TNCs in the economic performance of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> supports the fact that SME subcontractors are able to improve their internal capabilities and competitiveness through long term subcontracting relationships with TNCs. An assessment of the relative importance of SME factors which encourage subcontracting of the SMEs with TNCs indicated that inhouse R&D efforts and technological capability, frequent and proper communication, financial stability, skilled manpower, reputation of the subcontracting firm etc. are the most important factors, indicating the importance of inhouse/internal resources of the subcontracting firms. An assessment of the factors with respect to improvement needed for these SMEs revealed that the entrepreneurs/managers of the SMEs had realised the need to improve their inhouse resources and develop their technological capabilities with enhanced skilled manpower and better machinery. Given the importance of internal resources of SMEs for forging subcontracting relationships with TNCs, Indian SMEs need to place utmost priority for enhancing their own technical and manpower resources. Results of our study underlines the need for a policy thrust to expand the coverage of subcontracting involving local SMEs with domestic economy based global TNCs. The promotion of linkages of SMEs with TNCs depends on two factors: (i) the availability of local SMEs who have the prerequisite capabilities in terms of quality, delivery and cost and (ii) availability of information of such SMEs and their capabilities for TNCs. This context calls for the simultaneous strategy of competitiveness enhancement of local SMEs to the required level and providing information about the available capabilities of SMEs to TNCs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There is {{an ongoing}} debate in the {{literature}} on the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in less developed countries (LDCs) on two issues: the survival of SMEs in the course of economic development and the importance of government promotion programs for SME development. This research paper aims to examine those issues empirically with Indonesian data. For this purpose, it develops and tests a set of hypotheses. It shows that both real gross domestic product per capita and government development expenditure (especially that used to finance SME development promotion programs) have positive impacts on SME growth. With this finding, the research argues that SMEs in LDCs can survive, and even grow in the long-run, for three main reasons: (a) they create a niche market for themselves, (b) they act as a “last resort ” for the poor, and (c) they will grow along with large enterprises (LEs) because of their increasingly important production linkages with LEs in the form of <b>subcontracting.</b> Keywords <b>SMEs.</b> LEs.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{international}} trade and investment policy reforms on the Indonesian economy, focusing on economic growth and development of domestic manufacturing industry has been studied extensively enough. However, the implication of these trade and investment policy reforms on the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia remains an under-researched area of both the literature on SMEs in Indonesia and in general. This study, thus, attempts to make a contribution to fill this gap by examining the impact {{of international trade}} and investment policy reforms, particularly in the post-crisis period on the growth of SMEs in Indonesia. As this research seeks to bring to the fore benefits that have been or may be derived for SMEs from international trade and investment liberalization in Indonesia, it has three main questions: (1). how international trade and investment policy reforms affect local SMEs; (2) has growth of exports of SMEs accelerated since the reforms; and (3) does investment liberalization generate more <b>subcontracting</b> between local <b>SMEs</b> and FDI. ?

30|$|With {{regard to}} how {{entrepreneurship}} should be promoted, literature emphasized {{the role of}} the government, educational institutions, and business incubators. The government has a key impact not only on how many new businesses are created, but also — and perhaps more importantly — on the nature of these firms and their ability to grow through creating a favorable environment (GEN 2012). Koh and Wong (2005) identified four main roles for the government to play in innovation-based economies, including fostering a broad and productive R&D culture, closely linked to higher education. These are: investing in scientific research areas which are not feasible in the private sector; lowering the cost of risk taking by encouraging strong university–industry interactions; providing incentives for cooperative pre-market basic research; and finally, facilitating the commercialization of publicly financed research. An additional government role is in initiating strategic planning measures for SMEs. As discussed by Abonyi (2005), the government can provide support in six areas: (1) training in general business management entrepreneurship; (2) counselling and advice; (3) technology development and transfer; (4) marketing information; (5) business links between SMEs and large firms (e.g. <b>subcontracting)</b> and among <b>SMEs</b> (e.g. development of ‘enterprise clusters’); and (6) financing aimed at channeling funds to SMEs either directly (e.g. special purpose financial institutions such as ‘SME banks’) or indirectly (e.g. through special ‘windows’ of commercial banks), perhaps at preferential rates. Furthermore, the government has a noticeable role in improving the business climate (e.g. political and macroeconomic stability; laws, regulations and dispute resolutions; reduced corruption and bureaucratic barriers; fair competition and robust infrastructure).|$|R

40|$|The current {{business}} environment is typified by fierce global competition and rivalries, {{more sophisticated and}} ever-changing final markets, and profound transformations in production technologies and supply organizations. Inter-firm subcontracting offers a ready short cut to enhancing productivity and other non-price determinants of domestic and international competitiveness. However, a more objective and systematic approach is needed to induce convergence of supply-side capabilities and demand-side prerequisites from the partner firms. A framework of 78 guidelines and parameters is proposed to assess and benchmark the capabilities and competitiveness of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (<b>SMEs).</b> <b>Subcontracting</b> preconditions from transnational corporations and large enterprises, 14 in number but involving 36 mostly composite variables, are derived from a large number of case studies.

40|$|Otaru University of Commerce (小樽商科大学) 商学mastercourseIt {{is noted}} that inquiry on {{importance}} of specific advantages in determining {{not only how}} MNEs engage in FDI, but also in explaining why MNEs establish production in specific locations have been studied extensively. However, inquiry into what determines the FDI by SMEs, which face shortage in the management and financial resources, has not received much attention despite the increasing overseas production operations by SMEs. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the Japanese auto industry suppliers system in order to dentify the reason for SMEs to engage in overseas production operation. On the surface, the activities of SMEs and those of MNEs seem highly divergent. Until recently, they have operated in largely separate realms, each in its own competitive space with markedly different characteristics; SMEs largely considered to be operating on the domestic market place. However, globalization has dismantled the barriers that traditionally segmented local business opportunities and firms from international counterparts. Evidence indicate that SMEs which were considered passive victim of globalization, {{in the last few}} decades have become active players by setting up activities beyond their home market and their role is increasingly crucial in contributing to the growth of the industry. This is particularly observed in the Japanese automobile industry, where a large share of SMEs parent companies have their subsidiaries involved in the value chain of overseas subsidiaries of major Japanese automobile manufacturers. Although {{it is well known that}} the fundamental objective of firms is growth and development, the fact that SMEs increasingly engage in FDI brings crucial questions. The questions come because it has been studied that, as firms internationalize their operations they face a number of challenges such as liability of foreignness or disadvantages faced by firms to compete with local firms in their markets (Hymer, 1976). Other problems faced by firms when investing outside home country include geographical distance, which increases both the costs of communication and travel and the complexities of managing geographically dispersed assets. In addition, firms face the problem of psychic distance, because they must compete with local firms that have greater knowledge of the local culture and language, as well as of local legal, regulatory and marketing practices. These challenges bring up the concern about what offer SMEs the prospects to compete on a par with other global manufacturers. Considering that SMEs face the shortage of both management and financial resources to run overseas subsidiaries as compared to large-scale MNEs, this argument implies that, firm-specific advantages alone are much less in explaining the FDI by SMEs but need to consider the environments surrounding business relations among firms. To examine the FDI behavior by SMEs this paper develops an approach to explain the FDI by SMEs with the aid of the investment in the inter-firms relations. The model of this paper builds its logic upon the basic insights developed in network approach to industrial system and firm’s internationalization (Johanson and Mattsson, 1987, 1988) to identify the determinants for SMEs to engage in FDI. And in contrast to the most existing frameworks on FDI, the benchmark of this study is based on the assumption that there exists a coordination of activities between firms that can not achieved through a central plan or on organizational hierarchy, nor does it take place through the traditional market model (price mechanism). This coordination is achieved through continuous cooperative transactions and mutual orientation to each other (Richardson G., 1972; Asanuma B., 1987; and Itoh, M. et al., 1993). In this light, firms in the industrial systems are considered as embedded actors in the business relationships. By examining the distinctive features of the Japanese suppliers system(customer-supplier relationship) in automobile industry, it is evident there is a symbiotic relationship between major automobile manufacturers and suppliers of auto parts (about 96 % of which are SMEs) that explains the determinants of FDI by SMEs suppliers. The symbiotic relationship between firms makes it difficult to change the existing relation specific investment to orient to another customer. This can be described as due to the switching, monitoring and competitive cost as result of cumulative nature of activities to develop the relationship. And because the symbiotic relationships involve adaptations in a number of dimensions such as technically, logistically, administratively, knowledge development or specific capital investment there are costs involved in shifting the production lines to fit a new customer (SMEs lack enough resources for this transition). In light of the interpretation of the engagement of Japanese SMEs in the FDI it is indicated that since Japanese companies are mutually related to each other through keiretsu or <b>subcontracting</b> system, <b>SMEs</b> are feeling pressure to implement overseas production to meet the requirements of principal customers in order to ensure the continuation of their relationship with major customer, while looking for possibilities to diversify customers in the host country to become independent. This argument shows that since SMEs in auto parts industry depend more on the relationship with principal customers, any adjustment in the industrial or network landscape such as major customer’s increasing overseas production or increasing competition due to global procurement of cheap products by major supplier will force SME suppliers to implement overseas production operations. This means, as long as FDI can assure the continuation of business relationship with their major customer especially in Japan SMEs will be ready to engage in overseas production. This shows that the decision to invest abroad by SMEs is not necessarily the result of short-term economic profitability, but rather the reaction to other factors such as fear to lose major customer and maintaining the long time firm’s network relationship...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{explaining}} how a leader firm {{is able to}} manage the successful coordination of a Business Ecosystem (BE) by strategically managing its patents. From this perspective, patents are not only used as an “exclusion” and innovation protection tool but more as {{a new way to}} coordinate and secure BE. We show that thanks to an active licensing-out strategy to <b>subcontracting</b> <b>SMEs</b> a leader firm can ensure the stability and sustainability of the BE. Indeed the firm gives the opportunity to its subcontractors to exploit the patents and develop new products applied to new markets and consequently develop new businesses. So far, they maintain technological knowledge but also create unanticipated technological trajectories by enabling new potential applications. In this sense, the coordination of a BE through the management of IPR is also at the root of specific new uses of technologies, highly dependent on the context. The emerging literature on the determinants of technological change shows that radical innovation is not necessarily linked to an endogenous evolution of an industry. Indeed, radical innovation in an industry may result from the deviation of the technological trajectory of another industry. Technological exaptation or pre-adaptation indicate a generating entrepreneurial activity of technological innovations through the redeployment of an existing knowledge base for unanticipated applications. In this sense, entrepreneurs are trying to find new markets for their technologies instead of seeking new technologies to their markets. However, this literature has mainly studied technological exaptation at the firm level and remains silent on the inter-firm level. According to the Open Innovation paradigm (Chesbrough, 2003) innovation is increasingly an open process that leads to purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge. These flows rely on an active management of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) thanks to an extensive licensing strategy that improve innovation beyond firms’ boundaries. However this paradigm mainly focuses on a transactional approach of IPRs management and underestimates its collaborative dimension. The emerging literature on BEs mainly stresses this collaborative perspective of innovation and outlines how the convergence of industries conducts to the need for new coordination logics. In this perspective, BEs are particularly relevant, as the concept has precisely emerged to highlight new coordination and interactions logics between heterogeneous actors linked by a common fate. Some studies on BEs addressed this issue of the need for new coordination logics by emphasizing on the powerful coordination role of leader firms within an ecosystem. Other research has looked to the importance of coordination mechanisms and tools such as physical platforms (e. g. IT solutions) or intellectual ones (e. g. patents) to understand why BE are valuable for innovation and for its coordination processes. However this rich literature does not specifically focuses on the way IPRs may be used within BEs. So far, there is little discussion regarding the possibility that patents, although usually seen as a “protection tool” can be used by leader firms with the objective to coordinate and manage a BE and how this can influence BE’s survival and performance and what are the implications in terms of technological change. In article we address the question of how the sustainability of an ecosystem can be achieved and how does new technological trajectories can emerge through IPR management?We propose that both leader firms’ coordination role and coordination tools are important but we suggest that above all it is how such tools are mobilised in the coordination process that is interesting in order to understand BE development and survival. This conducted us to propose a framework showing a number of insights into the coordination mechanisms of a BE: we show that through a relevant management of patents leaders firms can secure a BE and protect their partners’ development from external threats and they are able to support upstream partners who are the most dependent and the most vulnerable through the grant of some of their patents’ operating licences. This study further demonstrate that leader firms of a BE need to adopt a proactive patent management approach in order to help their partners overcome external threats encountered {{while at the same time}} taking into account these partner’s specificities and conjectural needs. We also provide an illustration of the relevance of patents for successful BE’s coordination and management. So far we show that while ensuring the stability of its BE the leader firm also create new unanticipated technological trajectories.
