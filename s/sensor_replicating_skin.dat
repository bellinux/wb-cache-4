This study investigates {{the performance of a}} soft biologically-inspired artificial fingertip in active exploration tasks. The fingertip <b>sensor</b> <b>replicates</b> the mechanisms within human skin and offers a robust solution that can be used both for tactile sensing and gripping/manipulating objects. The softness of the optical sensor’s contact surface also allows safer interactions with objects. High-level tactile features such as edges are extrapolated from the sensor’s output and the information is used to generate a tactile image. The work presented in this paper aims to investigate and evaluate this artificial fingertip for 2 D shape reconstruction. The sensor was mounted on a robot arm to allow autonomous exploration of different objects. The sensor and a number of human participants were then tested for their abilities to track the raised perimeters of different planar objects and compared. By observing the technique and accuracy of the human subjects, simple but effective parameters were determined in order to evaluate the artificial system’s performance.

One of the possible reasons is the complexity in representing and understanding scientific content. Introducing tactile elements such as textures into existing Braille characters can potentially increase the information content of Braille and could likely simplify the complex notations. However, such a task requires a thorough understanding of the discrimination of textures through touch. The current dissertation focuses on: 1) Investigating the psychophysical factors involved in texture discrimination and, 2) Developing a testing system to assess friction induced skin damage from repetitive motion over textured surfaces. The tactile discrimination sensitivity for six fine textured non-patterned surfaces (fine-grit abrasive papers) was evaluated using a two-alternative forced choice technique. The surface roughness parameters and the coefficient of friction of the abrasive papers interacting with human skin were measured. Scanning electron microscopy images were used to observe the surface microstructure. The results suggest that differences in the mean spacing and the friction coefficients could be indicative of differentiability of fine textured samples. Three clearly differentiable textures identified from this study were used to investigate the effect of texture area on tactile discrimination sensitivity. A perception measurement experiment in combination with a friction measurement experiment was performed to understand the possible role of friction in touch-based texture discrimination. There was decrease in the discrimination ability with the decrease in the texture area.

Based on the current literature, the role of surface topography and elastic properties of the human skin on friction was uncertain.

In contrast to 248 -nm, treatments with the 193 -nm laser radiation below 70 J/m 2 did not cause significant pyrimidine dimer formation in the skin cells. This was indicated by the lack of excision repair activities (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay), and further demonstrated by direct analysis of pyrimidine dimers in DNA from irradiated cells.

In this paper, we show that there is a general framework based on the criterion of mutual information (MI) that can provide a realistic {{solution to the problem of}} feature selection for high-dimensional data. We give a theoretical argument showing that the MI of multi-dimensional data can be broken down into several one-dimensional components, which makes numerical evaluation much easier and more accurate.

Methods: After obtaining IRB approval and waiver of informed consent, a set of definitions, (hypovolemia, left ventricular shock, tamponade, hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia, and hemodynamically significant supraventricular tachycardia), were installed in the monitors in a 10 bed cardiothoracic ICU and evaluated over an 85 day study period. The logic of the algorithms was intended to replicate the logic of practitioners, and correlated information across sensors in a way similar to that used by practitioners. The performance of the alarms was evaluated via a daily interview with the ICU attending and review of the tracings recorded over the previous 24 hours in the monitor. True alarms and false alarms were identified by an expert clinician, and the performance of the algorithms evaluated using the standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results: Between 1 and 221 instances of defined events occurred over the duration of the study, and the positive predictive value of the definitions varied between 4. 1 % and 84 %.

40|$|The {{tegument}} proteins encoded by ORF 11 and ORF 9 of {{varicella-zoster virus}} (VZV) are conserved among all alphaherpesvirus. We previously {{demonstrated that the}} ORF 9 gene is essential, whereas ORF 11 is dispensable in vitro but its deletion severely im-pairs VZV infection of skin xenografts in the SCIDmouse model in vivo. Here we report that ORF 11 protein interacts with ORF 9 protein in infected cells {{as well as in}} the absence of other viral proteins, and we have mapped the ORF 11 protein domain in-volved in their interaction. Although ORF 11 is an RNA binding protein, the interaction between ORF 11 and ORF 9 proteins was not mediated by RNA or DNA bridging. VZV recombinants with mutations preventing ORF 11 protein binding to ORF 9 protein had no effect on 6 -day growth kinetics based on plaque numbers, but plaque sizes were reduced in vitro. However, disruption of the ORF 11 and ORF 9 protein interaction was associated with failure to <b>replicate</b> in <b>skin</b> xenografts in vivo. Further, we demon-strate that in the absence of their interaction, the ORF 9 protein displays an identical cellular localization, accumulating in the trans-Golgi region, whereas the ORF 11 protein exhibits aberrant localization, dispersing throughout the cytoplasm. Overall, our observations suggest that while complete tegument assembly may not be necessary for VZV replication in vitro, the interaction between the ORF 11 and ORF 9 proteins appears to be critical for the proper localization of ORF 11 protein to the assembly com-plex and for production of infectious virus during VZV pathogenesis in skin. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human alphaherpesvirus thatcauses varicella (chicken pox) and zoster (shingles) (1, 2). VZV virions, like those of all herpesviruses, contain a capsid tha...|$|R
