The cycle polarization test showed that the substrate with zirconia exhibited a better protection potential and a lower corrosion potential than the substrate without zirconia. For the wear test with a loading stress of 60 MPa, the ZrO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> and uncoated specimens were wore with UHMWPE for 1500 cycles. After the wear test, no ZrO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> films were peeled off. It indicates that the bonding strength between ZrO 2 and substrate {{are strong enough to}} prevent breaking during exercise. Also, the wore qualities of UHMWPE to the ZrO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> specimen is an half of that to the uncoated specimen. Obviously, the wear debris was reduced for the ZrO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> CoCrMo alloy. Further, it can prolong the use life of implant material...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the bioactivity of manganese-incorporated TiO <b>2</b> (Mn-TiO <b>2)</b> <b>coating</b> prepared on titanium (Ti) plate by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) technique in Ca-, P- and Mn-containing electrolytes. The surface topography, phase and element compositions of the coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spec-trometry (EDS), respectively. The adhesion of osteoblast-like MG 63 cells onto Ti, TiO 2 and Mn-TiO 2 surfaces was evaluated, and the signal transduction pathway involved was confirmed by the sequential expression of the genes for integrins β 1, β 3, α 1 and α 3, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the extracellular regu-lated kinases (ERKs), including ERK 1 and ERK 2. The results obtained indicated that Mn was successfully incorporated into the porous nanostructured TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating,</b> and did not alter the surface topography or the phase composition of the coating. The adhesion of the MG 63 cells onto the Mn-incorporated TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> was significantly enhanced compared with that on the Mn-free TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> and the pure Ti plates. In addition, the enhanced cell adhesion on the Mn-TiO 2 coatings may have been mediated by the binding of the integrin subunits, β 1 and α 1, and the subsequent signal transduction pathway, involving FAK and ERK 2. The study indicated that the novel Mn-TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> has potential for orthopedic implant applications, and that further investigations are required...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{for the first}} time that surface passivation of 2 D nanosheets of MoS 2 by an ultrathin and uniform layer of HfO 2 can significantly improve the cyclic performance of sodium ion batteries. After 50 charge/discharge cycles, bare MoS 2 and HfO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> MoS <b>2</b> electrodes deliver the specific capacity of 435 and 636 mAh g- 1, respectively, at current density of 100 mA g- 1. These results imply that batteries using HfO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> MoS <b>2</b> anodes retain 91 % of the initial capacity; in contrast, bare MoS 2 anodes retain only 63 %. Also, HfO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> MoS <b>2</b> anodes show one of the highest reported capacity values for MoS 2. Cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggest that HfO 2 does not take part in electrochemical reaction. The mechanism of capacity retention with HfO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> is explained by ex situ transmission electron microscope imaging and electrical impedance spectroscopy. It is illustrated that HfO 2 acts as a passivation layer at the anode/electrolyte interface and prevents structural degradation during charge/discharge process. Moreover, the amorphous nature of HfO 2 allows facile diffusion of Na ions. These results clearly show the potential of HfO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> MoS <b>2</b> anodes, which performance is significantly higher than previous reports where bulk MoS 2 or composites of MoS 2 with carbonaceous materials are used. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

30|$|Figure 1 c {{shows the}} {{polarization}} curves for pure TiO 2 and 1.2 % Ce-TiO 2 -coated 316 [*]L stainless steel {{in the presence}} and absence of light illumination in 3 [*]wt% NaCl solution. The polarization curves of cerium ion-doped TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> shifts to more negative values under illumination in comparison with that of pure TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating.</b> This phenomenon conforms to the variation of OCP for both samples, which has been explained in the former discussion. In the presence of illumination, the anodic current for each sample becomes {{higher than in the}} dark, which is due to the photogenerated electrons excited from the coating to the metal substrate. Compared with the undoped coating, the Tafel curve for the doped coating exhibits a positive corrosion potential in the absence of illumination, which can be correlated with the higher corrosion resistance of the coating. Moreover, the 1.2 % Ce-TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> displays a much lower anodic current as compared to the undoped coating in the dark condition. It is proved that cerium ion-doped TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> provides an enhanced corrosion protection either under illumination or even in the dark.|$|R

It can be found that the higher the gas pressure is, the higher the sp 2 /sp 3 area ratio, the greater the sputtering rate and the greater the optical absorption. The photothermal conversion efficiency of a SiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> on the amorphous diamond-like carbon (a-DLC) selective absorber films deposited on the Cr/mirror like Al substrate is 93. 2 % as the film thickness of a SiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> is 105 nm. The coatings also increase the protective properties for a longer service life. This makes the SiO <b>2</b> <b>coated</b> a-DLC film a promising new candidate material for solar selective absorber films.

30|$|In {{order to}} combine the photogenerated {{cathodic}} protection performance and the self-protection of TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> without the photo effect, it is highly required {{to find a new}} approach to improve the TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> as an excellent protective coating for metals. Herein a sol–gel method is used to modify nano-TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> with cerium ion by adding the concentrated solution of cerium nitrate. The cerium ion-doped TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> is taken into consideration for two reasons; on one hand, the Ce-doped TiO 2 has widely been used as a photocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 in the visible region [20 – 22] because it yields a large red shift compared to pure TiO 2 and suppresses electron–hole recombination with electron trapping at Ce 4 +. We make use of this advantage in the field of photocatalysis to verify its improvement in the photogenerated cathodic protection for metals. On the other hand, cerium nitrate is known as a corrosion inhibitor in an aqueous aggressive medium. The corrosion inhibition properties of cerium nitrate have been widely discussed in literatures [23 – 25]. It is generally accepted that cerium ions lead to the precipitation of cerium oxides or hydroxides that suppress the corrosion reactions in the defects. Moreover, the incorporation of corrosion inhibitors into the sol–gel films can improve the protective ability of the coatings [26, 27]. We expect that the cerium ions doped in the TiO <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> can also enhance the self-protection property of the coating based on its self-healing effect without photo effect.|$|R
40|$|NiCr clad BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 {{fluoride}} eutectic powders {{were added}} into chromium carbide-nichrome feedstock {{to improve the}} tribological properties of NiCr-Cr 3 C <b>2</b> <b>coating,</b> and the structures, mechanical, and ball-on-disk sliding wear performance of the coating were characterized. The results show that NiCr cladding can effectively decrease the density and thermophysical difference between the feedstock components, while alleviate the decarburization and oxidization of the constituent phases, and form the coating with a uniform and dense microstructure. However, the addition of BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 has {{a negative effect on}} mechanical properties of the coating. When the temperature reaches 500 A degrees C, the BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 eutectic is soften by the heat and smeared by the counterpart, thus the low shear stress lubricating film forms between the contact surface, that improves the tribological properties dramatically. At this temperature, the dominant wear mechanisms also change from splats spallation and abrasive wear at room temperature to plastic deformation and plawing by the counterpart. Within the temperature range from 600 to 800 A degrees C, the friction coefficient, the wear rates of NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 - 10 % BaF 2 center dot CaF <b>2</b> <b>coating</b> and its coupled Si 3 N 4 ball are 20 %, 40 %, and 75 % lower than those of the NiCr/Cr 3 C <b>2</b> <b>coating,</b> respectively.
