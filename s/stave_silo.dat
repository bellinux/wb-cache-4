40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was to determine}} effects from adding glucose, sucrose and starch to forage sorghum (DeKalb FSla) immediately prior to ensiling, on the feeding value of the subsequent silage. When the forage sorghum grain was at medium-to-hard dough stage, it was field chopped with a conventional silage cutter.

50|$|Concrete <b>stave</b> <b>silos</b> are {{constructed}} from small precast concrete blocks with ridged grooves along each edge that lock them {{together into a}} high strength shell. Concrete is much stronger in compression than tension, so the silo is reinforced with steel hoops encircling the tower and compressing the staves into a tight ring. The vertical stacks are held together by intermeshing of {{the ends of the}} staves by a short distance around the perimeter of each layer, and hoops which are tightened directly across the stave edges.|$|R
40|$|Three sorghum hybrid types {{were used}} to make six silages {{in the fall of}} 1983. Eight silage rations were {{compared}} using 160 steer calves in an 84 -day growing trial. Using forage sorghum silage as a base (100), grain sorghum silage had a feeding value of 133, and nonheading sorghum silage 89, when evaluated for comparative rates and efficiencies of gain. Silages from concrete <b>stave</b> <b>silos</b> produced faster and more efficient steer gains than silages from Silopress® bags. Rolling the grain sorghum silages at feeding time to break 95 % of the grain significantly improved steer performance. The feeding value of corn silage was not enhanced by processing...|$|R
50|$|The project {{itself was}} {{somewhat}} complicated, {{even for a}} round barn. The roof of the barn was to be an entirely self-supporting dome without structural support, to save the outside walls of the building. The four-section rafters of the roof would be reinforced {{at each of the}} joints. The project began with the digging of ditches where concrete foundation footings were poured. The footings would support the outer, circular wall. A 24 ft diameter circle was laid out in order to accommodate the silo and silage feeding bunk around the silo. A 40 ft <b>stave</b> <b>silo</b> was constructed at the site, with an 18 ft diameter. The silo was constructed out of Douglas fir staves that had been totally cleared of knots. The barn itself had siding of one inch by 12 in white pine, and long, wooden shingles made from Western red cedar. Of all the wood required to construct the Lewis Round Barn, only the shingles and siding materials had to be purchased; the rest came from the property's woodland that was logged to create the barn site.|$|E

The farm complex structures include a stone tenant house dated 1816, and four additional fieldstone buildings from the early 19th century: a smokehouse, a water storage house, a garden outhouse, and a large bank barn.

40|$|ELPWA (a lactobacillus {{inoculant}} with antioxidant), molasses, or both combined {{were evaluated}} as additives to high moisture sorghum grain ensiled in concrete <b>stave</b> <b>silos.</b> ELPWA treated grain {{had the greatest}} temperature increase during ensiling. Final lactobacillus counts {{were higher in the}} ELPWA + molasses treated grain, however, the initial rate of increase was greatest in ELPWA or molasses treated grains. Control and molasses treated grains had the fastest decline in pH and the lowest final pH. Aerobic stability of the ensiled grain depended on the strata of the silo sampled and the temperature to which the grain was exposed but aerobically stability was adequate in all grains. Group-fed steers receiving control grain were more efficient (P<. 05) than those receiving molasses + ELPWA treated grain. There were no significant differences among grain treatments for rates or efficiencies of gains for heifers or individually-fed steers...|$|R
40|$|Wheat silage, {{with and}} without sodium {{hydroxide}} (NaOH), was fed, with or without alfalfa haylage, in an 80 -day growing trial.

40|$|W used 135 {{yearling}} steers in two {{trials to}} compare dry with high moisture (HM) corn and soybean meal (SBM) supplement with urea supplement. Results of trail 1 (88 days) show HM corn either rolled or ensiled in a <b>stave</b> <b>silo</b> or ensiled whole in a fiberglass O 2 -limiting silo supported {{faster and more}} efficient gains than dry rolled, steam-flaked or HM-corn treated with a preservation.

40|$|Four alfalfa forages were evaluated: 1) hay; 2) low-dry matter (DM) silage; 3) medium-DM silage; and 4) high-DM silage.

Low- and medium-DM silages were better preserved than high-DM silage, which contained considerable spoilage due to yeasts and molds. High-DM silage also had the highest ensiling temperatures and it was slightly less stable in air on feedout than was either {{of the other two}} silages.

40|$|An {{inoculant}} (Sila-bac) and a {{non-protein nitrogen}} (LSA- 100) silage additive were evaluated with whole-plant, forage sorghum silage. Sila-bac silage had the fastest temperature rise and peaked at 10 C above its initial temperature. LSA- 100 silage had a slow, steady temperature rise and reached {{a maximum of}} 22 C above its initial. Control silage peaked at 15 C above its initial. Steers fed LSA- 100 silage gained 7 to 9 % faster than did those fed control or Sila-bac silages. LSA- 100 silage was consumed in greatest amount; Sila-bac silage, in the least. The two additives improved feed efficiency by 3 % over the control. Both additives improved aerobic stability; control silage heated after 3 days; Sila-bac and LSA- 100 after 7. Dry matter recovery from the <b>stave</b> <b>silos</b> was similar for control (78. 1 %) and LSA- 100 silages (77. 3 %), but higher for Sila-bac silage (81. 2 %).

40|$|Eight {{concrete}} <b>stave</b> <b>silos</b> (10 x 50 ft) {{were used}} in two trials to evaluate rapid (24 to 36 hr) and delay (15 days) filling, each with our without 1177 ® silage inoculant. Corn silage was used in Trial 1; forage sorghum in Trial 2. The delay-fill silages had a dry matter (DM) range of 34. 4 to 39. 9 % in Trial 1 and 24. 2 to 29. 6 % in Trial 1. All eight silages were well preserved with the four delay-fill silos having lower total fermentation acids than their rapid-fill counterparts. With corn silage, the rapid-fill silos had higher silage DM recoveries than the delay-fill silos. 1177 ® improved DM recovery in the rapid-fill silo {{but not in the}} delay-fill silo. With forage sorghum silage, the rapid-fill silos lost effluent which contributed to lower DM recoveries than in the delay-fill silos. 1177 ® improved DM recoveries with both fill procedures for the wetter sorghums. Steer performance was similar (P>. 05) for all four treatments within each silage. When silage recovery and steer performance were combined, the 1177 ® treated silages produced more pounds of beef than their respective controls.
