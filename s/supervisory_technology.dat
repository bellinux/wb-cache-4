40|$|In a {{principal}} - multi-agent relationship, we derive the optimal mutual monitoring - incentive pay mix. When agents are better informed about their effort choices than the principal, and when their information is suffciently "good" {{there is a}} substituability between those two modes of providing incentives. However the optimal mix {{will depend on the}} liability limit of the agents. Thus when it is suffciently slack the principal uses stronger incentive pay and less mutual monitoring. We derive the conditions for the adoption of costly <b>supervisory</b> <b>technology.</b> We finish by comparing two possible organizational structures: delegation with unilateral supervision versus mutual monitoring.

40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of {{supervision}} with endogenous transaction costs. A principal delegates part of his authority to a supervisor who can acquire soft information about an agent's productivity. If the supervisor were risk-neutral, the principal would simply make the better informed supervisor resid-ual claimant for the hierarchy's prot. Under risk-aversion, the optimal con-tract trades-o the supervisor's incentives to reveal his information with an insurance motive. This contract can be identied with the one obtained in a simple hard information model of hierarchical collusion with exogenous trans-action costs. Now, transaction costs are endogenous and depend on the col-lusion stake, {{the accuracy of the}} <b>supervisory</b> <b>technology</b> and the supervisor's degree of risk-aversion. We then discuss various implications of the model for the design and management of organizations. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper adopts the principal-supervisor-agent {{hierarchy}} model {{pioneered by}} Tirole [Tirole, J., 1986. Hierarchies and bureaucracies: {{on the role}} of collusion in organizations. Journal of Law, Economics and Organization 2, 181 - 214] to analyze the optimal architecture of supervision. We consider a principal who encounters a double moral hazard problem. In particular, we examine the endogenously determined supervisory effort and the possibility of untruthful revelation of supervisor's message. The degree of accuracy for this endogenously chosen information architecture hinges upon the <b>supervisory</b> <b>technology,</b> the supervisor's reservation utility and the agent's production technology. Besides, though the principal's welfare would be lowered when the possibility of untruthful revelation is taken into account, we find that his desired supervisory effort level may be enhanced instead.

40|$|OVERVIEW: The {{information}} & {{control system}} currently used in electric power systems is a client-server-type distributed system connected by networks. It offers remarkably operational improvement compared to conventional systems. Sophisticated <b>supervisory</b> control <b>technologies</b> are applied using enhanced-performance hardware. The information & control functions of individual servers enable analysis {{and assessment of}} on-line data {{from a range of}} perspectives. The system is designed for maximum compactness through the application of compact hardware. Furthermore, high-speed large-capacity network, real-time distributed-database structure, and sophisticated human-interface system assist operators of electric power systems to make decisions and contribute to secure electric power supply...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the positives and negatives, that {{individual or group}} supervision bring supervisees and supervisors. First part describes supervision, its objectives, functions and types. Further bachelor thesis presents definitions of two specific types of supervision - individual and group. There are described relationships and interactions {{that take place in}} them, organization of mutual meetings, methods and techniques. Final part contains analysis of theoretical facts and evaluation of positives and negatives. Comparison is presented under the three headings, namely: significant moments of the contract, <b>supervisory</b> relationship, supervising <b>technology...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{upcoming}} years, {{the strategies}} for maintenance, traceability, management {{and operation of}} productive processes will demand the use of novel information and communication <b>technologies.</b> <b>Supervisory</b> systems in these new scenarios {{will have to be}} able to integrate large volumes of information and knowledge coming both from local and remote points of large processors. In the fisheries industry, Artificial Reefs is one of the most important devices for the conservation and sustainability of fish and their biodiversity to make sure that the species will sustain and retain. In this work, the authors present an internet mapping technique for web-based remote supervision of artificial reefs positioning that incorporates powerful data and knowledge visualization too ls based on map. This architecture adds an intermediate layer (database) to well- known client and server layers that isolates the client part from the committee of the fishery bodies involved in storing data for artificial reefs positioning, and accessed and visualized it through on-line application...|$|R
40|$|<b>Supervisory</b> control <b>technology</b> {{is widely}} used to improve product quality in mineral {{grinding}} process (MGP). To ensure safety, new supervisory control method needs to be fully tested before practical application. However, conducting tests in a running process is costly and may put the process equipment in danger, which necessitates extensive simulations to ensure the stability and performance of supervisory controllers. Comparing with the field based test, the numerical simulation is more economic and safer. However, numerical simulations cannot capture all aspects of controlled object, such as sensors, actuators, process, control systems themselves and signal transmissions, which are important to evaluate the control performances. To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) platform for the supervisory control of MGP. By integrating a supervisory control system, a basic loop control system, a virtual actuator and sensor system, and a virtual plant system in to a coherent whole, the HILS platform provides a full-scope simulation environment for the supervisory control. The supervisory control system and the basic loop control system adopt real control systems. The detailed process dynamics are modeled and visualized by the virtual plant system. Further, as an interface between the physical controllers and virtual plant, the virtual actuator and sensor system is used to realize the signal conversion and to simulate the dynamics and faults of the actuators and sensors using data acquisition (DAQ) hardware and configuration software. Effectiveness of platform is demonstrated with a case study, where an intelligent supervisory control method for a typical one stage MGP is tested...|$|R
