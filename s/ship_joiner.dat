The three leaders, followed by 150 of their fellow strikers, immediately carried their petition directly to the office of Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson, located just a mile and half away on Capitol Hill, “to pray for redress of grievances.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Mackenzie {{was born}} on 28 January 1822 in Logierait, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of Mary Stewart (Fleming) and Alexander Mackenzie Sr. who were married in 1817. [...] The site of his birthplace is known as Clais-'n-deoir [...] "The Hollow of the Weeping", where {{families}} said their goodbyes as the convicted were led to nearby Gallows Hill. The house {{he was born in}} was built by his father and is still standing in 2017. [...] He was the third of ten boys, seven of who survived infancy. Alexander Mackenzie Sr. was a carpenter and <b>ship's</b> <b>joiner</b> who had to move around frequently for work {{after the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Mackenzie's father died on 7 March 1836 and at the age of thirteen Alexander Mackenzie Jr. was thus forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family. He apprenticed as a stonemason and met his future wife, Helen Neil, in Irvine, where her father was also a stonemason. [...] The Neils were Baptist and shortly thereafter, Mackenzie converted from Presbyterianism to Baptist beliefs. [...] Together with the Neils, he immigrated to Canada in 1842 to seek a better life. [...] Mackenzie's faith was to link him to the increasingly influential temperance cause, particularly strong in Canada West where he lived, a constituency of which he was to represent in the Parliament of Canada.|$|R
5000|$|A joiner is an artisan who builds {{things by}} joining pieces of wood, {{particularly}} lighter and more ornamental work than that {{done by a}} carpenter, including furniture and the [...] "fittings" [...] of a house, <b>ship,</b> etc. <b>Joiners</b> may work in a workshop, because the formation of various joints is made easier {{by the use of}} non-portable, powered machinery, or on job site. A joiner usually produces items such as interior and exterior doors, windows, stairs, tables, bookshelves, cabinets, furniture, etc. In shipbuilding a marine joiner may work with materials other than wood such as linoleum, fiberglass, hardware, and gaskets.|$|R
