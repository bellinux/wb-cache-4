5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1900s, the mountain's foothills were {{predominantly}} used for pear orchards and lignite mining. Mining ceased {{at the onset of}} World War I, and many of the orchards were abandoned during the Great Depression, but some <b>still</b> <b>remain.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{olive groves}} {{are no longer}} {{cultivated}} {{on the grounds of}} Beaumont House, but other notable additions by Davenport to the Romanesque style <b>still</b> <b>remain.</b> The house is occasionally described as 'Mediterranean', mostly due to the red Tuscan-styled roof, the olive groves and pillared exterior.|$|E
5|$|The wolf head crest {{also appears}} in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is {{decorated}} with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this <b>still</b> <b>remain.</b>|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which <b>still</b> <b>remain.</b>|$|E

5|$|The abbey church {{served as}} a monastic church and as a church of pilgrimage until the French Revolution.

5|$|The river {{system has}} also long {{been home to}} bird life. The {{negative}} effects of human development have not as significantly affected birds as fish due to the more limited changes to bird habitat (which includes the forests which <b>still</b> <b>remain</b> on surrounding mountains).

5|$|A 20-foot (6 m) wide ditch was dug at {{the north}} end of the moat to prevent tanks from {{breaking}} through and following the track south past the castle, and a 545-foot by 151-foot (166 m by 46 m) wide anti-personnel minefield was laid to the south-west to prevent infantry soldiers from circumventing the castle's defences and advancing down into Craster. After the end of the war, the barbed wire was cleared away from the beaches by local Italian prisoners of war, although the two pillboxes, the remnants of the anti-tank ditch and some of the trenches and weapons pits <b>still</b> <b>remain.</b>|$|E
