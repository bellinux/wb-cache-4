5|$|On May 12, 2009, New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority, {{the agency}} which manages the PATCO <b>Speedline,</b> {{announced}} plans for a Camden-Philadelphia BRT (bus rapid transit system) along the Route 42 freeway and the adjacent Route 55 freeway {{as part of a}} comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey that would include a diesel light rail line between Camden and Glassboro, improvements to the Atlantic City Line, and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 and County Route 573 {{continue}} {{north on}} Highland Avenue and cross into Haddonfield, {{where the road}} becomes Chews Landing Road. The two routes meet County Route 551 Spur (Kings Highway), and they bear to the right onto Kings Highway, heading northeast. They pass over New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line and the PATCO <b>Speedline</b> and then intersect County Route 561 (Haddon Avenue) Past CR 561, the road crosses the Cooper River into Cherry Hill Township. Route 41 and County Route 573 make a right turn onto a four-lane divided highway and intersect Route 154 (Brace Road). At this point, County Route 573 ends and Route 41 makes a left turn onto a six-lane divided highway, becoming state-maintained again and forming a concurrency with Route 154.|$|E
5|$|At this point, US 30 forms a {{concurrency}} with US 130 {{and the two}} routes head north, passing {{under the}} PATCO <b>Speedline</b> before meeting CR 561 at an interchange. Past CR 561, the road passes {{to the east of}} Harleigh Cemetery prior to crossing Cooper River into Pennsauken Township. In Pennsauken, US 30/US 130 comes to the Airport Circle. Airport Circle is an intersection with several flyovers; US 30 splits to the west, while Route 38 heads east, soon splitting with Route 70. US 130, meanwhile, continues northeast through more commercial areas. The road briefly enters Camden again right before an interchange with CR 537. The route crosses under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line before coming to a large interchange with Route 90 that provides access to the Betsy Ross Bridge. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 130 split. A short distance later, the route reaches an interchange with Route 73, which runs to the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge.|$|E
50|$|The River Line {{stops at}} the PATCO <b>Speedline's</b> Broadway Station (Walter Rand Transportation Center) and the NJ Transit Atlantic City Line's Pennsauken Transit Center, {{allowing}} passengers to transfer to and from these connections to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|R

50|$|The {{lifeboat}} {{was fitted}} with Decca 060 radar {{and all she}} carried Pye Westminster VHF and an Ajax MF Radiotelephone. In addition a radio Direction Finding set was carried, which gave a magnetic bearing to a transmitting station. The electric searchlight was standard along with Pains Wessex <b>speedlines.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{provides}} full-time {{local service}} between Saint George and Tottenville {{along the east}} side of the borough. There is currently no subway service offered for those residents living on the western or northern sides of the borough, but Staten Island light rail has been proposed for these corridors. The MTA is planning to implement Bus Rapid Transit on the North Shore, while a study is underway to determine whether light rail should be implemented on Staten Island's west shore. The line has a route bullet similar to other subway routes: the letters SIR in a blue circle. It is used on timetables, on the MTA's site, and on some signage, but not on trains. The line runs 24 hours a day every day of the year (since May 10, 2015, the overnight service is on a 30-minute headway) and is one of only six mass-transit rail lines in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO <b>Speedline,</b> the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago 'L', the Green Line of the Minneapolis-St. Paul METRO, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway).|$|E

40|$|How do {{we present}} {{the motion of}} objects in {{computer}} generated still images? Generally, we don’t. Or, if we do, we use motion blurring to simulate a real-world camera [PC 83]. Besides, it costs {{a great deal of}} extra rendering time, and the only thing it does is blur the objects so that their contours are unrecognizable. The goal to convey information about the movement per se is not entirely met. If, however, we consider the application of non-photorealistic rendering techniques, it is promising to adopt successful illustrative techniques from comics to depict past and future motions of objects in a single image. Presenting Motion <b>Speedlines</b> are an important stylistic element in comics, and although they are not based on an exact physical model, their use is well known to all of us [McC 93]. Starting from the very first cartoons Little Nemo and Krazy Kat, <b>speedlines</b> have always depicted past motion. Another technique to illustrate the movement of an object is to indicate former positions by drawing repetitions of its contour. The contour consists of the outline and inner lines. Often, only part of the outline is drawn in order to maintain clarity an...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between 'neural speedlines', form (shape), and fast motion-direction decisions, Glass patterns were constructed with dipoles assuming a tapered shape. The results of a 2 -alternative forced-choice direction-discrimination task, for both concen- tric and translational Glass-pattern sequences, suggest that with short stimulus presentations (< 1 s) form can influence direction decisions. This result implies that neural <b>speedlines</b> may be analogous to tapered lines and further supports Geisler's (1999, Nature 400 65 - 69) model of form/motion interaction. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Illustration-inspired {{techniques}} have provided alternative ways to visualize time-varying data. Techniques such as <b>speedlines,</b> flow ribbons, strobe silhouettes and opacity-based techniques provide temporal context {{to the current}} timestep being visualized.

We compared the ability of subjects to visually track features using snapshots, snapshots augmented by illustration techniques, animations, and animations augmented by illustration techniques. User accuracy, time required to perform a task, and user confidence were used as measures to evaluate the techniques. The results indicate that the use of illustration-inspired techniques provides a significant improvement in user accuracy and the time required to complete the task.

5000|$|In 1940, Asimov's {{humans were}} stripped-down {{masculine}} portraits of Americans from 1940, {{and they still}} are. His robots were tin cans with <b>speedlines</b> like an old Studebaker, and still are; the Robot tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable artificial intelligences, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no genetic engineering, aliens, arcologies, multiverses, clones, sin or sex; his heroes (in this case R. Daneel Olivaw, whom we first met as the robot protagonist of The Caves of Steel and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, {{because it is so}} deeply and strikingly orderly.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{time-varying}} {{data has}} been visualized using snapshots {{of the individual}} time steps or an animation of the snapshots shown in a sequential manner. For larger datasets with many timevarying features, animation can be limited in its use, as an observer can only track {{a limited number of}} features over the last few frames. Visually inspecting each snapshot is not practical either for a large number of time-steps. We propose new techniques inspired from the illustration literature to convey change over time more effectively in a time-varying dataset. <b>Speedlines</b> are used extensively by cartoonists to convey motion, speed, or change over different panels. Flow ribbons are another technique used by cartoonists to depict motion in a single frame. Strobe silhouettes are used to depict previous positions of an object to convey the previous positions of the object to the user. These illustration-inspired techniques can be used in conjunction with animation to convey change over time.

5000|$|In 1989, for the 1990 model year, North America {{received}} the Coupé quattro and 90 quattro models that all were {{powered by a}} detuned [...] of the 20v 2.3-litre 5-cylinder engine. These cars {{were considered to be}} in the [...] "Grand Tourismo" [...] (GT) style of a comfortable luxury car with sporting tendencies, as opposed to a dedicated lightweight sports car. Weighing between 3042 lb (1990 sedan model) to 3308 lb (1991 Coupé model), these cars were not lightweight, especially in consideration of the 164 hp powerplant (slightly de-tuned from the European version). These models can be recognised by their distinctive roadwheels (Coupé quattros had 15" [...] 6-star [...] "Speedline" [...] wheels, sedan quattros had 14" [...] BBS Mesh wheel or the 15" [...] <b>Speedlines).</b> They differed from regular 80/90 models in several ways. Notable differences include their standard leather interiors with Zebrano wood trim, additional VDO gauges mounted {{in the bottom of the}} centre console, a carbon fibre centre drive shaft, and push-button locking rear differential. The Coupé quattro is visually similar to the European-only S2 model, but does not have the S2's turbocharged engine.|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} process of {{compressors}} for gas turbines, the application of casing treatments showed a substantial contribution to the enhancement of total pressure ratio and stability. The development of a treated casing endwall remains quite demanding due to the complicated flow features and interactions, particularly when applied to transonic rotors with strong shock systems. To achieve an insight into these flow mechanisms, the axial single-stage Darmstadt Transonic Compressor Test Rig was equipped with a casing treatment with 56 bend axial slots. <b>Speedlines</b> and exit plane measurements were made for design speed and for a completely subsonic flow field. Time resolved measurement techniques were chosen to investigate the rotorcasing treatment interaction. The casing treatment was designed to provide an optical access through two slots. In addition, the land between these slots was replaced with a glass insert. The assembly allowed phase-resolved particle image velocimetry investigations in the rotor tip area and inside the tip gap underneath one axial slot. Results showed an increase in stall margin for both operating conditions. Efficiency declined slightly. At design speed, a second shock structure develops when the casing treatment is applied. This additional shock front has considerable effect on the flow field. Vortices inside the slots account for the efficiency losses...|$|R
25|$|The {{next step}} up was the Gr.A car, which was fitted with 16 <b>Speedline</b> 2012 rims (with {{optional}} extractors), further improvements on suspension and more tuned engine producing between 205–220 PS.

40|$|Deflections at {{off-design}} {{conditions can}} change the aeroelastic behavior of turbomachinery blades significantly. Therefore, steady-state deformations at each operating point cannot be neglected {{and need to be}} captured by CFD-CSM coupling. The implementation of an automated toolchain for the generation of a compressor map is presented. It includes steady FSC and is preceded by a flutter analysis. The CFD mesh is adapted to steady surface deflections via a mesh deformation using radial basis functions interpolation. Mode shape vibrations are computed at each operating point. Aerodynamic damping for each mode and IBPA is than assessed by unsteady RANS computations with time-linearization around the steady flow field. A detailed compressor map of a highly flexible CFRP fan, that was optimized within a multidisciplinary toolchain, is generated based on the geometry for design conditions. Elastic deformations affect a shift of the <b>speedlines</b> especially in near-choked conditions. At the surge line, some cases did not reach a steady-state deformation, oscillating between two deflections and indicating possible stall flutter. The impact of the steady deformation on predicting flutter boundaries for very elastic blades is pointed out by the comparison to a rigid setup. Significant differences are identified in the region of near-surged and stalled conditions and are due to large deformations, especially torsional deflections. The results of the underlying work of this paper will assist in identifying critical designs during optimization runs more quickly...|$|R
40|$|Time-varying data is {{huge and}} {{contains}} specific features {{of interest to}} an application expert. Standard techniques for visualizing time-varying data such as snapshots and animations are limited {{in their ability to}} convey change and draw the user's attention to regions of; interest. Art-inspired techniques are presented to provide temporal context to the domain expert. I present novel visualization techniques that convey change over time in a single image. Illustrators convey change over time using illustrative cues. Time-varying data, in which three-dimensional features are moving over time, can be effectively visualized using illustrative techniques such as <b>speedlines,</b> flow ribbons, strobe silhouettes and opacity based; techniques. I applied these techniques to computational fluid dynamics data and; evaluated the effectiveness of our techniques {{with the help of a}} formal user study. The illustration-inspired techniques were also applied to the field of atmospheric physics, where I generated novel hurricane visualizations that allowed collaborators to obtain insight into; the evolution and intensification of a hurricane.; For effectively visualizing time-varying data, such as infant mortality over eight years or global rainfall over an entire century, we developed a novel pointillism-based technique. This technique was inspired by paintings by Seurat, applied the visual color blending theory to place brush strokes close to each other. We applied techniques from pointillistic; paintings to convey variability in time-varying data and to convey trends over time in a single image. The formal user evaluation conducted to evaluate these techniques gave us insight into the strengths of our techniques and led us to the result that users though correct were less confident of their answers as compared to snapshots-based and animation-based techniques...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} casing treatments in a one-stage transonic compressor is presented. The reference case {{consists of a}} radially staggered blisk and six circumferential grooves. <b>Speedlines</b> show that this axisymmetric treatment already provided {{a substantial increase in}} operating range with relatively small losses in efficiency. Since the onset of rotating stall in tip-critical high-speed compressors is always linked to the tip-leakage flow and the built-up of blockage within the blade passage, high-resolution measurement techniques have been employed to investigate the corresponding effects. Results with Particle Image Velocimetry show that the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the shock front cause a blockage area. When throttled further, the blockage increases. The shock structure changes similar to the phenomena of vortex breakdown described by different researchers in the past, but a stagnation point is not present. Before reaching the stability limit, the interface line between the incoming flow and the blocked area moves towards the inlet plane of the rotor indicating spike-type stall inception. Wall pressure measurements confirmed this theory for the smooth wall, but with circumferential grooves applied, a part span stall cell develops prior to the stability limit. In order to assess the performance of circumferential grooves, two additional configurations are presented. The corresponding measurements addressed the questions whether circumferential grooves also provide an operating range extension when applied to an optimized rotor design with higher initial stall margin. Therefore, an identical casing treatment is applied to a forward swept rotor. The second question is, how circumferential grooves perform in direct comparison to a non-axisymmetric endwall structure. Axial slots have been applied to the radially staggered rotor. While the stall margin exceeds all other configurations, detrimential effects in efficiency are observed. A detailed anaylsis of probe data shows the changes of the radial profile at the rotor outlet which allows recommendations for more efficient CT designs. Parameters allowing to evaluate the CT influence are presented...|$|R
