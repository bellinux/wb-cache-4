Executive Producer David Mirkin once invited Swartzwelder to make a brief appearance in a prerecorded bit in which he would be asked if he wanted to take part, to which he would respond with [...] "No" [...] as an ironic punchline, but he refused. During the recording of the 2006 commentary for the ninth season episode, [...] "The Cartridge Family," [...] show runner Mike Scully called Swartzwelder's home on the phone. After presumably speaking with him for a minute, the man {{on the other end of}} the phone says, [...] "It's too bad this really isn't John Swartzwelder." [...] Scully and the others laugh, reply [...] "bye, John" [...] and then after he has hung up, Scully comments [...] "I know he's gonna sue us." [...] Swartzwelder has a Twitter account that has been described as [...] "the only Twitter Egg worth following." [...] When another writer was having a party at his house, he asked Swartzwelder if he'd like to be a guest at it, and Swarzwelder reportedly paused and <b>said</b> <b>evenly</b> [...] "I don't do that kind of thing." ...|$|E

In this paper, we collect some published results which show that this large class of convex sets enjoys a lot of the well-known properties of the subclass of closed convex sets. We also consider functions whose epigraphs are e-convex sets, the so-called e-convex functions, and we show the main properties of this class of convex functions that contains the important class of lower semicontinuous convex functions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the diversity of diurnal butterflies (Sub Order : Rhopalocera) in complex Mount Bromo KPH Karanganyar Surakarta in 2013. Research is explorative quantitative research done by analyzing the value of the Shannon diversity index and evenness of species in the population. Sampling was done by catching butterflies directly on the 4 pieces that have been deemed most representative of the entire complex regional characteristics and vegetation of Mount Bromo. Sampling results obtained in stage 4 for 211 individuals consisting of 4 familia, 21 genera and 26 species. Analysis showed diversity with Shannon index H 2 ̆ 7 value of 2. 249 at stage 1; 2, 558 at stage 2; 2, 664 to 2, 218 at stage 3 and stage 4. While the value of H 2 ̆ 7 for all the research stage is 2, 956 butterfly diversity means there is the category of being. The distribution of species in the study sites can be <b>said</b> to be <b>evenly</b> distributed with the value of E = 0. 907...|$|R
