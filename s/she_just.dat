5|$|Data, an android, and Jenna D'Sora {{are in the}} torpedo room {{configuring}} several probes {{with which}} the Enterprise will explore a nearby nebula. D'Sora explains that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> split up with her boyfriend and Data attempts to comfort her. Later they play together in a chamber concert along with Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao). D'Sora complains of her abilities as a musician, but Data insists {{that he could not}} hear anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> {{writes the}} most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and <b>she</b> <b>just</b> writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and <b>she</b> <b>just</b> made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} can work out if <b>she</b> <b>just</b> pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E
5|$|Carla {{has brought}} Isabella to the hospital, and {{everyone}} is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> lacked the people skills.|$|E

5|$|Due to her honesty, Marge {{does not}} sell any homes. Hutz informs {{her to use}} more {{positive}} descriptions when selling the houses, and also informs Marge if she does not sell {{a house in the}} first week, she will be fired. Marge tries to bend the truth, but fails as <b>she</b> <b>just</b> cannot lie to others. Marge does not disclose the entire truth of the house she sells to Ned Flanders and his family, which had been the site of a multiple homicide. The Flanders purchase the house and bid farewell to the Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or <b>she</b> <b>just</b> settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} gay lawyer Will Truman (Eric McCormack) {{talking on the}} phone with his best friend, {{heterosexual}} Jewish interior designer Grace Adler (Debra Messing), about their lives. The following day, Will hosts a poker game at his apartment with his friends, when Grace arrives and informs Will <b>she</b> <b>just</b> had an argument with her long-term boyfriend, Danny (Tom Verica). After the game is over, Will insists that Grace spend the nightmuch to the displeasure of Will's flamboyantly gay friend, Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes), who was planning to move in with Will temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> enjoyed shopping.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading {{magazines}} {{on a sofa}} in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. The Guardian compared this look with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. She is the {{granddaughter of}} an {{archeologist}} Vincent Perez. She carries a golden amulet, {{which was very}} important to her grandfather. She lived her youth with her grand father because her parents were shot when she was very young. <b>She,</b> <b>just</b> like Nate, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts and treasure hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know. When she calls someone her partner, that means that she trusts them. Her biggest difference to Elena is that she never uses a gun, even when she is getting shot at. She survived an RPG shot from Roberto Guerro during the events of the game. She finally decides to use a gun {{near the end of the}} game. She is voiced by Christine Lakin.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

25|$|Sources vary as to {{the causes}} of this absence, the Chinese media mostly cited the {{conflict}} {{between her and the}} China's National Tennis Team's administration and coaching staff.
