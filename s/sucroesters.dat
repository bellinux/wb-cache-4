Let us cite only: bio-ethanol, organic acids, amino acids, proteins, penicillin and other antibiotics, polyhydroxybutyrate, polyols (sorbitol and mannitol), <b>sucroesters</b> and sucroglycerids, enriched pulps, beet fibers and pectins [...] . For each of these products, are successively described: manufacturing process, yield, uses and applications, producing firms, current production and outlook, and comments. The consideration of bio-ethanol shows that the orientation towards these new ways depends chiefly on the EEC decision-making authorities and on the main financial groups. Being given these uncertainties, the strategies of the beet producers remain very simple. They consist primarily in the adoption, with more determination than ever, of technical improvements, and, if possible, in increasing the size of their farm...|$|E

Methods: First, excipients for enhancing the stability and solubility of sirolimus were screened. Second, using the SAS process, solid dispersions of sirolimus-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K 30 nanoparticles were prepared with or without surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), tocopheryl propylene glycol succinate, <b>Sucroester</b> 15, Gelucire 50 / 13, and Myrj 52. A mean particle size of approximately 250 nm was obtained for PVP K 30 -sirolimus nanoparticles. Solid state characterization, kinetic solubility, powder dissolution, stability, and pharmacokinetics were analyzed in rats. Results: X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated that sirolimus existed in an anhydrous amorphous form within a solid dispersion of nanoparticles and that no degradation occurred after SAS processing. The improved supersaturation and dissolution of sirolimus as a solid dispersion of nanoparticles appeared to be well correlated with enhanced bioavailability of oral sirolimus in rats. With oral administration of a solid dispersion of PVP K 30 -SLS-sirolimus nanoparticles, the peak concentration and AUC 0 &rarr; 12 h of sirolimus were increased by approximately 18. 3 -fold and 15. 2 -fold, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that preparation of PVP K 30 -sirolimus-surfactant nanoparticles using the SAS process may be a promising approach for improving the bioavailability of sirolimus.

40|$|The lipases from Thermomyces lanuginosus (immobilized by {{granulation}} with silica) and Candida antarctica B (adsorbed on Lewatit, "Novozym 435 ") were comparatively assayed for {{the synthesis}} of sugar esters by transesterification of sugars with fatty acid vinyl esters in 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol:dimethylsulfoxide mixtures. We found that lipase from C. antarctica B is particularly useful for the preparation of 6, 6 ’-di-acylsucrose, whereas T. lanuginosus lipase catalyzes selectively {{the synthesis of}} 6 -O-acylsucrose. The granulated T. lanuginosus lipase retained more than 80 % of its initial activity after 20 cyles of 6 hours. Both lipases were similarly effective for the regioselective synthesis of 6 ’-O-palmitoylmaltose and 6 -O-lauroylglucose. The effect of the synthesized sugar esters on the growth in liquid medium of various microorganisms (Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeasts) was evaluated. 6 -O-lauroylsucrose and 6 ’-O-lauroylmaltose inhibited the growth of Bacillus sp. at a concentration of 0. 8 mg/ml, and of Lactobacillus plantarum at 4 mg/ml. Sucrose dilaurates and 6 -O-lauroylglucose did not show antimicrobial activity, probably due to their low aqueous solubility. As regards the inhibition of yeasts, none of the tested carbohydrate esters inhibited significantly the growth of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Pichia jadinii.

Methods: Excipients used for enhancing the solubility and stability of sirolimus were screened. A phase-separation test, visual observation for emulsifying efficiency, and droplet size analysis were performed. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to optimize the liquid SMEDDS formulation. The selected liquid SMEDDS formulations were prepared into solid form. The dissolution profiles and pharmacokinetic profiles in rats were analyzed. Results: In the results of the oil and cosolvent screening studies, Capryol™ Propylene glycol monocaprylate (PGMC) and glycofurol exhibited the highest solubility of all oils and cosolvents, respectively. In the surfactant screening test, D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS) was determined to be the most effective stabilizer of sirolimus in pH 1. 2 simulated gastric fluids. The optimal formulation determined by the construction of ternary phase diagrams was the T 32 (Capryol™ PGMC:glycofurol:vitamin E TPGS = 30 : 30 : 40 weight ratio) formulation with a mean droplet size of 108. 2 ± 11. 4 nm. The solid SMEDDS formulations were prepared with <b>Sucroester</b> 15 and mannitol. The droplet size of the reconstituted solid SMEDDS showed no significant difference compared with the liquid SMEDDS. In the dissolution study, the release amounts of sirolimus from the SMEDDS formulation were significantly higher than the raw sirolimus powder. In addition, the solid SMEDDS formulation was in a more stable state than liquid SMEDDS in pH 1. 2 simulated gastric fluids. The results of the pharmacokinetic study indicate that the SMEDDS formulation shows significantly greater bioavailability than the raw sirolimus powder or commercial product (Rapamune® oral solution). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest the potential use of a solid SMEDDS formulation for the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs, such as sirolimus, through oral administration.
