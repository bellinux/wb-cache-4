40|$|This paper explores {{income and}} {{consumption}} smoothing patterns among the member countries {{of each of}} the CFA zones-the CEMAC 2 and the WAEMU 3 -during the period 1980 - 2000. I find that for the CEMAC, only about 15 percent of shocks to GDP are smoothed through the <b>standard</b> <b>channels</b> (that is, capital market, credit market, and remittances). On the other hand, I find that 44 percent of shocks are smoothed via foreign aid from France, and 5 percent via central bank contributions, while reserves pooling provides no shock smoothing. For the WAEMU, I find that only 13 percent of shocks are smoothed through the <b>standard</b> <b>channels,</b> while 63 percent are smoothed via foreign aid from France, 7 percent via central bank contributions, and no smoothing via reserves pooling. I compare these results with the risksharing pattern in the Unites States.

50|$|For example, in most DWDM equipment, the <b>standard</b> <b>channel</b> spacing is 100 GHz. But spacing the signal-carrying {{frequencies}} every 50 or even 25 GHz {{can double}} or even quadruple {{the number of}} channels per fiber. Thus, optical interleaver can expand the number of channels per fiber, and devices and/or networks can be upgraded without requiring that all devices be upgraded.|$|E
