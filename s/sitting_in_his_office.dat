2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> with {{his hands on his}} cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E

60|$|About {{the middle}} of the morning Mappin was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> which was {{situated}} above a store opposite the second-class hotel. The hotel was full, for some loggers had come in the previous night, and a number of railroad carpenters, whose work had been interfered with by a snowstorm, were staying there. Mappin had heard of Andrew's return and he was in a thoughtful mood, though he had so far avoided meeting with any of the party. He could not, however, continue to do so, and he felt that he might as well get the interview with Allinson over as soon as possible. Even if Allinson suspected treachery, he had no proof, and the worst charge he could make would be one of carelessness. On the whole, it had been a relief to see that the man had escaped: he had acted in the heat of passion when he cut off his supplies and had afterward experienced a twinge of remorse. Mappin felt that he was a match for the fellow, and he had gone a needless length in plotting to destroy him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{unfortunately}} true, {{though the}} lawbreakers have {{now and then}} come off second-best. A few days ago, Wilkie, the station-agent, was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> when {{a man who had}} some grievance against the railroad walked up to the window. Wilkie told him he must send his claim to Winnipeg, and the fellow retorted that he would have satisfaction right away out of the agent's hide. With that, he climbed in through the window; and I must confess to a feeling of satisfaction when I heard that he left the station in need of medical assistance. A week earlier, Taunton, of the store, was walking home along the track in the dark after collecting some of his accounts, when a man jumped out from behind a stock of ties with a pistol and demanded his wallet. Taunton, taken by surprise, produced a wad of bills, but the thief was a little too eager or careless in seizing them, for Taunton grabbed the pistol and got his money back. After that, he marched the man three miles along the track and into his store. I don't know what happened then, but I heard that there were traces of a pretty lively scuffle." ...|$|E
60|$|One day, when Albert {{came home}} from the village, he told Mary Erskine that he had an offer of a loan of two hundred dollars, from Mr. Keep. Mr. Keep was an elderly gentleman of the village,--of a mild and gentle {{expression}} of countenance, and white hair. He was a man of large property, and often had money to lend at interest. He had an office, where he used to do his business. This office was in a wing of his house, which was a large and handsome house {{in the center of the}} village. Mr. Keep had a son who was a physician, and he used often to ask his son's opinion and advice about his affairs. One day when Mr. Keep was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> Mr. Gordon came in and told him that he had some plans for enlarging his business a little, and wished to know if Mr. Keep had two or three hundred dollars that he would like to lend for six months. Mr. Keep, who, though he was a very benevolent and a very honorable man, was very careful in all his money dealings, said that he would look a little into his accounts, and see how much he had to spare, and let Mr. Gordon know the next day.|$|E

He was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> private <b>office</b> with <b>his</b> brother-in-law, giving away secrets that belonged not to him but to his department, conniving through the words which he spoke at the fleeing from justice of a criminal who belonged not to him but to the State.|$|R

60|$|Consider {{what happens}} when a blow is aimed at the eye.[75] Instantly, and without our {{knowledge}} or will, and even against the will, the eyelids close. What is it that happens? A picture of the rapidly advancing fist is made upon the retina {{at the back of the}} eye. The retina changes this picture into an affection of a number of the fibres of the optic nerve; the fibres of the optic nerve affect certain parts of the brain; the brain, in consequence, affects those particular fibres of the seventh nerve which go to the orbicular muscle of the eyelids; the change in these nerve-fibres causes the muscular fibres to change their dimensions, so as to become shorter and broader; and the result is the closing of the slit between the two lids, round which these fibres are disposed. Here is a pure mechanism, giving rise to a purposive action, and strictly comparable to that by which Descartes supposes his waterwork Diana to be moved. But we may go further, and inquire whether our volition, in what we term voluntary action, ever plays any other part than that of Descartes' engineer, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> and turning this tap or the other, as he wishes to set one or another machine in motion, but exercising no direct influence upon the movements of the whole.|$|E

To work his way through the University and take Holy Orders had been Ulick's ambition; he would gladly have endured privation for such an object, and it did seem hard that such aspirations should be so absolutely frustrated, and himself forced into the stream of uncongenial, unintellectual toil, in so obscure and uninviting a sphere. The resignation of all lingering hope of escape, and the effort to be contented, cost him more than even his original breaking in; and Mr. Kendal one day found him <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> little <b>office</b> parlour unable to think or to speak under a terrible visitation of his autumnal tormentor, brow-ague.|$|R
60|$|Harper went out, and Appleby, <b>sitting</b> down <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> wrote up {{accounts}} {{until the}} afternoon. He dare leave no word for Harding, but that appeared unnecessary, for if Harding found San Cristoval {{in the possession}} of the Sin Verguenza he would, Appleby felt certain, understand and profit by the position. The room resembled an oven, and no more light than served to make writing possible entered the closed lattices; but with the perspiration dripping from him Appleby toiled on, and the last Spanish dollar had been accounted for when Harper and the man who carried the comida came up the stairway. Then it was with a little sigh he laid down his pen and tied the neatly engrossed documents together. The life he led at San Cristoval suited him, and now he was to turn his back on it and go back once more, a homeless and penniless adventurer, to the Sin Verguenza. Glancing up he saw Harper leaning on a bureau and looking at him.|$|R
2500|$|Giving {{the order}} to start {{production}} in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, Anouk Aimée, and Sandra Milo in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living. The crisis {{came to a head}} <b>in</b> April when, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Cinecittà <b>office,</b> he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had [...] "lost his film" [...] and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of 8½, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he [...] "felt overwhelmed by shame… I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers.

30|$|As a first analysis, we {{evaluate}} {{the uniqueness of}} a single spatial and spatio-temporal point. Due to the precise nature of GPS information, we expect {{the uniqueness of the}}se points to be very high, provided that the spatio-temporal information is sufficiently accurate. In fact, we observe that taking the temporal dimension into account raises the uniqueness of the traces to nearly 100 %, over 2 out of 3 datasets. In the GeoLife dataset, despite the high spatio-temporal resolution, we measure a uniqueness of 89.5 %. We suspect that this is due to some duplicated trajectories. However, when the spatial location alone is taken into account, the uniqueness over the three datasets can be considerably different, remaining around 100 % for CenceMe and 89 % for GeoLife but dropping under 40 % for CabSpotting. This in turn suggests that the efficacy of anonymization methods that rely on attributes suppression to enforce k-anonymity [11] is largely dependent {{on the nature of the}} dataset. In fact, a possible reason for the high uniqueness of the mobility traces of the GeoLife and CenceMe datasets is that they contain mobility traces of users through their daily routines which, unlike the mobility of taxi cabs, contain many personal and unique locations such as home and work. In particular, a close look at the traces in the CenceMe dataset reveals that in several cases the GPS coordinates remain effectively constant for long periods, thus inevitably raising the uniqueness of that location. This may be for example the case of a person <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>office.</b> Despite making the identification task trivial, this is of particular interest, as our daily movements patterns do include this kind of very personal and unique location.|$|R
