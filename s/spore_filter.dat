40|$|Aquatic hyphomycetes {{strongly}} {{contribute to}} organic matter dynamics in streams, but {{their abilities to}} colonize leaf litter buried in streambed sediments remain unexplored. Here, we conducted field and laboratory experiments (slow-filtration columns and stream-simulating microcosms) to test the following hypotheses: (i) that the hyporheic habitat acting as a physical sieve for <b>spores</b> <b>filters</b> out unsuccessful strategists from a potential species pool, (ii) that decreased pore size in sediments reduces species dispersal efficiency in the interstitial water, and (iii) that the physicochemical conditions prevailing in the hyporheic habitat will influence fungal community structure. Our field study showed that spore abundance and species diversity were consistently re- duced in the interstitial water compared with surface water within three differing streams. Significant differences occurred among aquatic hyphomycetes, with dispersal efficiency of filiform-spore species being much higher than those with compact or branched/tetraradiate spores. This pattern was remarkably consistent with those found in laboratory experiments that tested the influence of sediment pore size on spore dispersal in microcosms. Furthermore, leaves inoculated in a stream and incubated in slow-filtration columns exhibited a fungal assemblage dominated by only two species, while five species were codominant on leaves from the stream-simulating microcosms. Results of this study highlight that the hyporheic zone exerts two types of selec- tion pressure on the aquatic hyphomycete community, a physiological stress and a physical screening of the benthic spore pool, both leading to drastic changes {{in the structure of}} fungal community...|$|R
40|$|AIR:EAU+SPI:PRE:WHE:CGUThe {{effects of}} UV-A and UV-C {{radiation}} on fungal spores were investigated {{before and after}} their germination in photocatalytic and non-photocatalytic air filters commonly used in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Immediately after the coating of <b>spores</b> on <b>filters,</b> exposure to both types of UV radiation induced the appearance of an inactivation threshold for long durations of exposure probably resulting from the presence of Aspergillus niger spores inside the activated charcoal layer. The use of a thin photocatalytic filter without activated charcoal demonstrated a better disinfection efficiency with total inactivation of the spores, due to an optimal contact between spores and TiO 2 coating. The effects of UV radiation were then assessed on spore germination for both types of filters. The inactivation of spores in illuminated photocatalytic filters resulted in an irreversible inhibition of the fungal germination under UV-A or UV-C radiation. In contrast, fungal spores were able to germinate in non-photocatalytic filters despite previous exposure to both types of UV radiation. The monitoring of ergosterol amounts, the major sterol of fungal membranes, corroborated these results. Finally, UV-A or UV-C radiation exposure of <b>filters</b> after <b>spore</b> germination had a lesser disinfection efficiency than experiments whereby spores had just been applied onto the filters, due {{to the absence of}} contact between the biological pollutants and the photocatalyst coating. Our results thus demonstrated the interest to use photocatalytic filters ensuring optimal contact between pollutants and TiO 2 coating to lead to a total inactivation of fungal <b>spores</b> in <b>filters</b> of HVAC systems.

The <b>spore</b> suspension was <b>filtered</b> into a beaker through 3 layers of nylon mesh (100, 50 and 20  µm) to remove debris. The beaker containing the spore suspension was plunged into ice, which concentrates the spores (spores swim towards {{the bottom of the}} beaker), which were pipetted into another beaker. This procedure was repeated and then the <b>spore</b> suspension was <b>filtered</b> through 2 layers of nylon mesh (20  µm pore size).

The spore suspension was diluted with filtered (0.22  µm) ASW to a final concentration of 1.3  ×  104 spores/ml for holography, or 1.0  ×  106 spores/ml for standard settlement assays. As only one holographic setup was available, the spores used for the experiments were released at different times. For the FOTS surfaces spores were released 7  h after collection from the seashore, for PEG 21  h and for AWG 30.5  h. One dataset obtained on each of the respective surfaces has been analysed. While the release time after collection did not have a major influence on the observed motion patterns, we noted that the mean velocity of the spores decreased over time.|$|R

The major assumptions were confirmed. In one system transmission success was increased fourfold in the presence of food and feeding infected hosts had lower spore loads. The other system showed evidence for these effects. Feeding activity correlated positively with food in both systems and spore loads in infected waterfleas partially determined spore loads in exposed waterfleas.

40|$|Microfluidic {{continuous}} flow filtration methods {{have the potential}} for very high size resolution using minimum feature sizes that are larger than the separation size, thereby circumventing the problem of clogging. Branch flow filtration is particularly promising because it has an unlimited dynamic range (ratio of largest passable particle to the smallest separated particle) but suffers from very poor volume throughput because when many branches are used, they cannot be identical if each is to have the same size cut-off. We describe a new iterative approach to the design of branch filtration devices able to overcome this limitation without large dead volumes.

A series of aliquots of Bacillus megaterium spores were prepared onto polycarbonate filters and irradiated with photons of 2159 eV compared to 2140 eV energy on the 2 -IDB beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. Flux density was approximately 10 (exp 18) photons/sec/sq mm. The phosphorous K-edge absorption spectrum in these spores was determined to peak at 2159 eV, wheras 2140 eV {{was determined to be}} outside that absorption spectrum. <b>Spores</b> on <b>filters</b> were irradiated at ambient conditions, and were either immediately plated for colony formation after irradiation, or were held for postirradiation exposure to oxygen prior to plating. Slopes of survival curves from the four conditions of irradiation, i. e., two photon energies each comparing immediate plating vs postirradiation holding, were used for quantitative determination of differences in rates of spore killing over a range of radiation doses. It was found that spores irradiated at the phosphorus K-edge were killed 20 % more efficiently than when irradiated with 2140 eV photons, and this was true for both immediate plating and postirradiation holding in air. Postirradiation holding in air increased killing efficiency by about 12 % for both photon energies compared to plating immediately after irradiation. The increase of killing efficiency with postirradiation holding is less than expected from earlier experiments using relatively low-flux X-rays, and raises the possibility of dose-mitigation by radical-radical recombination in the case of high-flux X-rays from the synchrotron...|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{quantitative}} PCR (qPCR) {{for rapid}} and specific enumeration of microbial agents is finding increased use in aerosol science. The {{goal of this}} study was to determine qPCR accuracy, precision, and method detection limits (MDLs) within the context of indoor and ambient aerosol samples. Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus vegetative bacterial cells and Aspergillus fumigatus fungal spores loaded onto aerosol filters were considered. Efficiencies associated with recovery of DNA from aerosol filters were low, and excluding these efficiencies in quantitative analysis led to underestimating the true aerosol concentration by 10 to 24 times. Precision near detection limits ranged from a 28 % to 79 % coefficient of variation (COV) for the three test organisms, and the majority of this variation was due to instrument repeatability. Depending on the organism and sampling filter material, precision results suggest that qPCR is useful for determining dissimilarity between two samples only if the true differences are greater than 1. 3 to 3. 2 times (95 % confidence level at n = 7 replicates). For MDLs, qPCR was able to produce a positive response with 99 % confidence from the DNA of five B. atrophaeus cells and less than one A. fumigatus spore. Overall MDL values that included sample processing efficiencies ranged from 2, 000 to 3, 000 B. atrophaeus cells per filter and 10 to 25 A. fumigatus <b>spores</b> per <b>filter.</b> Applying the concepts of accuracy, precision, and MDL to qPCR aerosol measurements demonstrates that sample processing efficiencies must be accounted for in order to accurately estimate bioaerosol exposure, provides guidance on the necessary statistical rigor required to understand significant differences among separate aerosol samples, and prevents undetected (i. e., nonquantifiable) values for true aerosol concentrations that may be significant...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{aerosols}} {{could cause}} various {{human and animal}} health problems and their control is becoming a significant scientific and technological topic for consideration. Filtration {{is considered to be}} one of the main processes of the removal of biological aerosols from the air carrier minimizing bioaerosol concentration in industrial and domestic dwellings. However, with regards to biologically active particles, their removal from the air carrier does not solely solve the problem of microbial contamination of the ambient air. Considering that in some situations bioaerosol particles collected on the filter could re-enter the air carrier, some disinfection is required to ensure that no biologically active particles could possibly be removed from the filter surface and reach human occupied areas.

Limits of 2 μg/kg in wine and 10 μg/kg in dried vine fruit have been introduced by the European Union. This study presents information on the ecology of ochratoxin A production by black Aspergillus spp. in Australian vineyards, and the passage of the toxin throughout winemaking. Aspergillus niger and A. carbonarius were isolated from vineyard soils in 17 of 17, and four of 17 Australian viticultural regions, respectively. A. aculeatus was isolated infrequently. All thirty-two isolates of A. carbonarius and three of 100 isolates of A. niger produced OA. Of Australian A. niger isolates analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms within the internal transcribed spacer region of 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA, 61 of 113 isolates, including the three toxigenic isolates, were of type N pattern, and 52 were type T. A selection of these A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate isolates, as well as imported isolates, were compared using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) -PCR, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. ERIC and AFLP clearly differentiated A. niger from A. carbonarius. AFLP further divided A. niger into types N and T. Six polymorphic microsatellite markers, developed specifically for A. niger, also differentiated strains into N and T types. There was no clear relationship between genotypic distribution and ochratoxigenicity, substrate or geographic origin. The survival of A. carbonarius <b>spores</b> on <b>filter</b> membranes was examined at water activities (aw) 0. 4 - 1. 0, and at 1 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C. Survival generally increased at lower temperatures. The lowest water activity, 0. 4, best supported the survival of spores, but 0. 6 - 0. 9 aw was often deleterious. Complex interactions between temperature and water activity were observed. Viability of A. carbonarius <b>spores</b> on <b>filter</b> membranes decreased ca 10 [superscript 5] fold upon exposure to sunlight, equivalent to 10 mWh of cumulative ultraviolet irradiation at 290 - 400 nm. Growth and toxin production were examined for five isolates of A. carbonarius and two of A. niger on solid medium simulating juice at early veraison, within the range 0. 98 - 0. 92 aw, and at 15 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C and 35 °C. Maximum growth for A. carbonarius and A. niger occurred at ca 0. 965 aw / 30 °C and ca 0. 98 aw / 35 °C, respectively. The optimum temperature for OA production was 15 °C and little was produced above 25 °C. The optimum aw for toxin production was 0. 95 for A. niger and 0. 95 - 0. 98 for A. carbonarius. Toxin was produced in young colonies, however, levels were reduced as colonies aged. Black Aspergillus spp. were more commonly isolated from the surface than from the pulp of berries, and increased with berry maturity, or damage. A. niger was isolated more frequently than A. carbonarius and A. aculeatus. Populations of A. carbonarius inoculated onto bunches of Chardonnay and Shiraz decreased from pre-bunch closure to early veraison. Populations from veraison to harvest were variable, and ncreased in bunches with tight clustering and splitting. In a trial with Semillon bunches, omitting fungicide sprays after flowering did not increase the development of Aspergillus rot. Inoculation of bunches with A. carbonarius spore suspension did not necessarily result in Aspergillus bunch rot. In vitro trials suggested that the severity of rot was mediated primarily by the degree of berry damage, followed by the extent of spore coverage. No clear trends regarding cultivar susceptibility were observed. For Semillon bunches inoculated with A. carbonarius spores with and without berry puncture, increased susceptibility to rot and OA formation was associated with berry damage, in particular at greater than 12. 3 °Brix (20 d before harvest). OA contamination of bunches was related to the number of mouldy berries per bunch, with shrivelled, severely mouldy berries the primary source of OA. Puncture-inoculation of white grapes (Chardonnay and Semillon) and red grapes (Shiraz) on the vine with A. carbonarius resulted in berries containing OA. Inoculated grapes displayed greater total soluble solids due to berry shrivelling, and greater titratable acidity due to production of citric acid by the fungus. Samples taken throughout vinification of these grapes were analysed for OA. Pressing resulted in the greatest reduction in OA (68 - 85 % decrease in concentration, compared with that of crushed grapes). Additional reductions occurred at racking from grape and gross lees, and after storage. OA was removed by binding to marc, grape and gross lees. Pectolytic enzyme treatment of white must, bentonite juice fining, recovery of juice or wine from lees, and static or rotary style fermentation of red must, had no effect on OA contamination. Bentonite in white wine (containing 56 mg/L grape-derived proteins) and yeast hulls in red wine were effective fining agents for removing OA. Findings from these studies may contribute to the improvement of strategies to minimise OA in Australian wine and dried vine fruit. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|International @ EAU+CGU:FSIInternational audienceIndoor {{air quality}} {{has become a}} major public health concern and it {{potentially}} poses a threat to the health of all types of populations. Actually, populations in developed countries spend more than 80 % of their time in confined indoor environments. Indoor air pollutants emanate from various sources, chemical or biological. Most of the studies deal with the removal of chemical sources but biological treatment of indoor air remains an emerging research theme. Indeed, the removal of biological agents is a complex issue. None of the traditional technologies for indoor air decontamination, such as activated charcoal filters, HEPA filters with or without UV radiation, ozonation, air ionization, are completely effective. Moreover, these technologies still need further investigation. The aim is not only to trap the microorganisms present in the indoor air, but also to alter them irreversibly. In this context, the combination, within air treatment plants, of both the photocatalytic and the filtering process is a promising technology that would combine the benefits of both processes to efficiently trap and alter chemical and microbiological pollutants through total mineralisation. Our researches deals with the effects of UV-A and UV-C radiation on the coating of aerosolised cells of fungal spores before and after their germination but also on an experimental bioaerosol of bacteria in presence of photocatalytic and non-photocatalytic air filters commonly used in Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. E. coli and Aspergillus Niger are used as model of bacteria and fungi because E. coli is commonly used to evaluate indoor air cleaning technologies and A. Niger is known for its resistance to any environmental stress conditions, and especially the spores which contain a black fungal spore pigment, protecting them from UV radiation exposure. In presence of E. coli or A. Niger the photocatalytic filters without charcoal demonstrated better disinfection efficiency with full damages of the cells, probably resulting from an optimal contact between TiO 2 coating and the microorganisms. In contrast, the use of filters with activated charcoal, even with UV-C, resulted in the apparition of an inactivation threshold that could be attributed to the penetration of cells within the activated charcoal layer and the absence of contact with the photocatalyst. However, UV-C photocatalysis was able to inactivate faster and, at the same time, mineralise biological pollutants than UV-A. In the case of A. Niger, the effects of UV radiation were also assessed on spore germination for both types of filters. The inactivation of spores in illuminated photocatalytic filters resulted in an irreversible inhibition of the fungal germination under UV-A or UV-C radiation. In contrast, fungal spores were able to germinate in non-photocatalytic filters despite previous exposure to both types of UV radiation. After spore germination disinfection efficiency is lower than experiments whereby spores had just been applied onto the filters, due to the absence of contact between the biological pollutants and the photocatalyst coating. Our results demonstrated the interest to use photocatalytic filters ensuring optimal contact between pollutants and TiO 2 coating to lead to a total inactivation of fungal <b>spores</b> in <b>filters</b> of HVAC systems...|$|R
