Such a framework may guide us in redefining the roles of the teachers, the students, and technology through empirical research to improve the students’ learning experiences and outcomes. When good scaffolding leads to positive learning processes and outcomes, these can be reified by creating representations which can serve as best practices to help future learners and teachers.

30|$|Recently, we {{reported}} a new method to synthesize the rod-like tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) superlattice. To explore its potentials in nanolattice templating and tissue <b>scaffolding,</b> this <b>work</b> focused the viscoelasticity of the superlattice {{with a novel}} transient method via atomic force microscopy (AFM). For measuring viscoelasticity, in contrast to previous methods that assessed the oscillating response, the method proposed in this work enabled us to determine the transient response (creep or relaxation) of micro/nanobiomaterials. The mathematical model and numerical process were elaborated to extract the viscoelastic properties from the indentation data. The adhesion between the AFM tip and the sample {{was included in the}} indentation model. Through the functional equation method, the elastic solution for the indentation model was extended to the viscoelastic solution so that the time dependent force vs. displacement relation could be attained. To simplify the solving of the differential equation, a standard solid model was modified to obtain the elastic and viscoelastic components of the sample. The viscoelastic responses with different mechanical stimuli and the dynamic properties were also investigated.|$|R

5000|$|Scaffolding {{theory was}} first {{introduced}} in the late 1950s by Jerome Bruner, a cognitive psychologist. He used the term to describe young children's oral language acquisition. Helped by their parents when they first start learning to speak, young children are provided with informal instructional formats within which their learning is facilitated. A scaffolding format investigated by Bruner and his postdoctoral student Anat Ninio whose scaffolding processes are described in detail is joint picture-book reading (Ninio & Bruner, 1978). Bed-time stories and read alouds are additional examples of book-centered interaction (Daniels, 1994). Scaffolding is inspired by Lev Vygotsky's concept of an expert assisting a novice, or an apprentice. Scaffolding is changing the level of support to suit the cognitive potential of the child. Over {{the course of a}} teaching session, one can adjust the amount of guidance to fit the child's potential level of performance. More support is offered when a child is having difficulty with a particular task and, over time, less support is provided as the child makes gains on the task. Ideally, <b>scaffolding</b> <b>works</b> to maintain the child's potential level of development in the ZPD. An essential element to the ZPD and scaffolding is the acquisition of language. According to Vygotsky, language (and in particular, speech) is fundamental to children's cognitive growth because language provides purpose and intention so that behaviors can be better understood. Through the use of speech, children are able to communicate to and learn from others through dialogue, which is an important tool in the ZPD. In a dialogue, a child's unsystematic, disorganized, and spontaneous concepts are met with the more systematic, logical and rational concepts of the skilled helper. Empirical research suggests that the benefits of scaffolding are not only useful during a task, but can extend beyond the immediate situation in order to influence future cognitive development. For instance, a recent study recorded verbal scaffolding between mothers and their 3- and 4-year-old children as they played together. Then, when the children were six years old, they underwent several measures of executive function, such as working memory and goal-directed play. The study found that the children's working memory and language skills at six years of age were related to the amount of verbal scaffolding provided by mothers at age three. In particular, scaffolding was most effective when mothers provided explicit conceptual links during play. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} not only suggest that verbal scaffolding aids children's cognitive development, but that the quality of the scaffolding is also important for learning and development.|$|R

40|$|Have {{you ever}} noticed how {{experienced}} teachers use almost instinctive ways of analyzing the tasks they are teaching, dissecting those tasks into manageable steps, and providing helpful hints {{to assist students}} as they learn challenging concepts? Researchers have studied these processes of highly effective teachers and adopted a metaphor from the building industry: scaffolding. Peregoy and Boyle (1997) explain that scaffolding involves the setting up of “temporary supports, provided by capable people, that permit learners {{to participate in the}} complex process before they are able to do so unassisted”(as cited in Celce-Murcia, 2001, p. 166). When teachers provide carefully designed support for students to tackle challenging linguistic material, they give the students a chance to first gain skills with assistance and confidence and then move toward learner autonomy. As teachers build their skill in using scaffolding techniques, they are better able to reflect on and share these techniques with others, as well as expand their own repertoires.
