40|$|Technical {{management}} {{is an important}} policy field for housing associations. Technical management processes influence the product, price, and exploitation characteristics of dwellings. At the higher level the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy concerns the complete stock of the housing association. The design of a model relationship between the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy and technical management by housing associations features prominently in the research, and common ground is sought between the two areas. Important points attended to in the study are the relationships between <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy, (de) investment policy, maintenance policy, and rental price policy; the relationships between investments, maintenance activities, performance levels, defects, life cycles and exploitation period; and the relationships between policy development, provision of information, organization, and management. By deriving the technical management from the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy, the housing association can carry out maintenance and adaptations efficiently and effectively [...] in other words in a professional, client-centred, sustainable manner. The likelihood of loss of capital is reduced. Product characteristics and maintenance performance levels can be adjusted to suit the target groups and clients served. Clients appreciate having more freedom of choice in the maintenance and adaptation of the (interior of their) dwellings, and set requirements with respect to maintenance work: information, approachability, client friendly attitudes, orderliness, and so forth. Through the mutual harmonisation of policy, the foundations of policy can be made clear and transparent for all parties concerned {{within and outside the}} organization. Thereby, opportunities are enhanced for controlling processes, costs and performance and contracting out parts of the management process in a responsible manner.

40|$|AbstractWithin {{the last}} decade, several {{cases of the}} supply chain {{vulnerability}} to major disruptions have been observed. The typical mitigation strategies such as safety inventory and excess capacity are inadequate to cover the major disruptions. Furthermore it is not economical to invest in such costly proactive strategies to recover from infrequent disruptions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide a decision making tool achieving robust supply flow by incorporating <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> and reconfigurable back-up supplier in mitigating disruptions. We consider a firm with two suppliers where the main supplier is cost-effective but prone to disruptions and the back-up supplier is reliable but expensive due to re-configurability characteristics. We present a multi-stage robust optimization model to determine optimal <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> levels and layout configuration of the back-up supplier for a supply chain subject to random realization of disruptions and available capacity during the ramp-up time. Furthermore, the partial available capacity of the backup supplier during the response time has been modelled using queuing theoretical models.

Despite suffering drought conditions for much of 1995, only salmon fry production {{appeared to have been}} affected. Coarse fish populations once found in the lower reaches of the Winster appear to have declined to very low levels with no fish sampled.

40|$|Holding {{strategic}} {{oil stocks}} is {{at first sight}} an obvious tool to address potential disturbances in supplies. Rationally defining the desirable size of stocks and designing rules for their predictable use is an elusive task, however. A key conceptual difficulty arises in the distinction between commercial and <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks,</b> because a physical shortfall in the oil supply will inevitably {{lead to an increase}} in prices. But if <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> are utilised when prices increase they become indistinguishable from commercial stocks. This paper reviews the legislation in force in the US and the EU on the use of strategic oil stocks as well as the emergency response systems of the International Energy Agency.

This paper uses a multi-market approach {{to assess the impact of}} complete wheat market liberalization, an international wheat price increase, the value of <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> and the impact of investment to generate higher yields and lower transaction costs for wheat producers. Results show that wheat market liberalization implies very substantial costs for consumers and producers. The estimated income losses that these groups suffer would appear to be below the current total subsidy costs and hence a cash transfer program would, in principle, be feasible. The results show that wheat price movements impact strongly on the supply and/or demand side in particular of berseem, rice, maize, cotton and livestock which has significant implications for their net imports as well as input use. Results indicate that <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> can be useful to neutralize the impact of a wheat price spike. Increasing wheat yields and reducing transportation boosts wheat self-sufficiency but does not dampen the impact of removing the wheat subsidy system on household’s welfare.

40|$|The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) {{includes}} a multi-step process for reducing national marine mammal bycatch. This process requires the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to publish annual marine mammal Stock Assessment Reports (SARs), which include best estimates of each stock’s abundance, population trend, maximum rate of increase, potential biological removal (PBR), and ‘annual human-caused mortality and serious injury’. On {{the basis of}} these estimates, NMFS determines ‘strategic’ stocks which are most at risk from bycatch. According to the MMPA, a stock should be considered strategic if is: a) Threatened or Endangered under the ESA, or decreasing in abundance and likely to be listed, or b) classified as depleted under the MMPA, or c) experiencing direct human-caused mortality and serious injury at a level which exceeds its PBR. If <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> interact with commercial fisheries that have significant levels of marine mammal bycatch, the agency is required to establish Take Reduction Teams (TRTs), which craft Take Reduction Plans (TRPs). TRPs include measures to reduce the fishery-related mortality of a particular strategic stock, given that the current level of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury exceeds the stock’s PBR. Therefore, without a TRT, the <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> interacting with fisheries that cause either frequent or occasional mortality will continue to remain imperiled because nothing is being done to reduce the unsustainable level of stock mortality. Because NMFS’ status determinations are data-dependent, deficient and/or imprecise stock data hinders the agency’s ability to appropriately determine strategic status. This project assessed {{the current state of the}} U.

40|$|Relief Aid in East Africa Over {{a period}} of six months during second half of 2011, the global {{humanitarian}} Community responded {{to one of the}} most severe droughts the world has ever seen. A total of 13 million people were given emergency assistance including food, water and shelter. Unfortunately, this intervention is not an isolated event. The countries located in East Africa have a dire history of political instability, civil war, regional conflicts as well as floods and draughts. As a consequence, millions of people live in poverty and daily struggle against the risk of starvation. To escape conflict zones, natural disasters and areas prone to extreme food shortages people flee their homes to live as refugees. For instance, it is estimated that about one million Somalis live as refugees in the Horn of Africa. Several decades of chronic food deficits in East Africa has led to massive support from the humanitarian community. Governments around the world, the United Nations as well as non-governmental organizations have responded by supplying food directly to the people in need. One of these organizations is Global Food Aid (GFA). GFA has operated in the various countries in East Africa since the 1980 s. Together with the respective governments, GFA is involved with food distribution in response to for instance sudden-onset disasters, refugee camps and long-term development programmes. Project: <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> In responding to the current drought, GFA has received substantial criticism from global media. Primarily, the reactions concern the inability to assist the people in need in a timely manner. It has simply taken too long time to transport and distribute the food. This is not the first time this type of criticism hits GFA and therefore headquarters (HQ) has informed about a new initiative for responding to various emergencies around the world. To decrease the lead times of GFA’s food supply chain, a new initiative to pre-position <b>stock</b> in <b>strategic</b> locations is going to be rolled out to the organization’s field offices. The roll out will be done in several steps where step one focuses on a selected pilot case.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at filling the gap between theory and {{practice}} in the area of safety stocks under MRP environments. It is focused on providing a new methodology for dimensioning an overall buffer against uncertainty in market demand, which often plagues SMEs – that act as sub-contractors or suppliers within large projects or they have a reduced bargaining power – and adversely affects their performances. The proposed methodology suggests to split the amount of safety stocks, as dimensioned according to the traditional methodology, in “new” safety stocks to face the “usual ” demand variance and in “strategic ” stocks, to face peaks in market demand. To this purpose, a set of recommended guidelines is reported to effectively dimension and position safety and/or <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> within products bills of materials and manufacturing pipelines. Finally, a case study is reported, where the benefits for the company coming from the adoption of the new proposed methodology lie in achieving the 95 % target service level even under peak demand conditions, being the value of safety stocks as a whole grown only by about 20 %.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] Concerns about energy {{security}} affect economic performance and political stability all over the world, but nowhere are these issues more critical than in Asia and the Pacific. Oil {{is at the heart}} of the region's energy challenge. Oil consumption is increasing nearly twice as fast in the region as in the world as a whole, while options for increasing production are severely limited. The result is a steadily growing dependence on imported oil, largely from the volatile Middle East. Apart from efforts to increase domestic production and slow consumption growth, recommendations for policymakers include initiating joint ventures with oil producers, improving the efficiency of domestic markets, building up <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks,</b> strengthening regional cooperation, reducing transportation bottlenecks, and establishing a regional market for oil futures. In the long run, policymakers need to devise new strategies for economic growth based on more efficient use of oil and natural gas, continuing dependence on coal, and ultimately, the development of alternative sources of energy.

They are highly dependent on hearing and underwater sound to enact key biological activities such as forage for prey, communicate with conspecifics and navigate. Therefore, understanding how noise might affect their sensory ecology is a priority to encourage their survival and address the broader potential acoustic impacts within the Arctic. Ocean noise levels are increasing in the Arctic due to an increase in human activities, which are related to the interests in Arctic resources and the opening of the Northwest Passage.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to link {{humanitarian}} logistics (HL) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) to provide an understanding of risk mitigation strategies that humanitarian organisations use, or could use, to improve their logistics preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Based on systematic reviews of RMS in SCRM and supply chain strategies (SCS) in HL literature, a framework is developed and used to review published case studies in HL. Findings: The study finds that humanitarian actors use a number of the strategies proposed in the framework, particularly those related to <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks,</b> postponement, and collaboration. Strategies related to sourcing and procurement, however, especially those on supplier relationships, seem to be lacking in both research and practice. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on secondary data and could be further developed through case studies based on primary data. Future studies should explore the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications: Practitioners can use the framework to identify potential new SCS and how strategies can be combined. Findings can help them to understand the abnormal risks of main concern, how they may impact normal risks, and provide ideas on how to tackle trade-offs between different risks. Social implications: The results can support improvements in humanitarian supply chains, which will provide affected people with rapid, cost-efficient, and better-adapted responses. Originality/value: The paper connects SCRM and HL to develop a framework and suggests propositions on how humanitarian actors can mitigate supply chain risks.

40|$|This {{project has}} {{investigated}} {{the degradation of}} freshly harvested Willow chips, thermally treated wood pellets and white wood pellets in both indoor and outdoor storage. Novel research has been carried out, by combining a range of fuels, storage scenarios, stockpile sizes and weather/seasonal patterns. A wide spectrum of tests was regularly performed on the stored fuel samples, {{to determine the extent}} of chemical, mechanical and biological degradation. The storage trials have been divided into Phase 1 and Phase 2, with Phase 1 starting in April 2011 and Phase 2 in November 2011. The results showed that the extent of chemical degradation was not significant for the different fuels. The main concern for the Willow storage was the high concentration of different fungi on the chips and two pathogenic fungi were identified. In order to fully appreciate the deposition, inhalation and ingestion potential of fungal spores, the release mechanism of the spores from the wood fuels into the air would be recommended as future work. The indoor white wood pellet pile stored in an open barn suffered severe mechanical degradation and it would be therefore advisable to store white wood pellets in a fully enclosed environment with no exposure to ambient temperature and humidity. For the thermally treated pellets, the extent of degradation in the outdoor piles was far more significant than in the indoor one, with rainfall and humidity having an impact on the extent of degradation. Therefore, while the long term storage of thermally treated wood pellets in an open barn with covered storage would be a viable option; pellets stored in outdoor stockpiles would still be vulnerable to mechanical degradation. So outside storage of thermally treated pellets might be an option for short term <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks,</b> but in the majority of cases, covered storage would still be necessary...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} information on the marine mammal stocks of Alaska {{under the jurisdiction of}} the National Marine Fisheries Service. Each stock assessment includes, when available, a description of the stock’s geographic range, a minimum population estimate, current population trends, current and maximum net productivity rates, optimum sustainable population levels and allowable removal levels, and estimates of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury through interactions with commercial fisheries and subsistence hunters. These data will be used to evaluate the progress of each fishery towards achieving the MMPA’s goal of zero fishery-related mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. The Stock Assessment Reports should be considered working documents, as they are updated as new information becomes available. The Stock Assessment Reports were originally developed in 1995 (Small and DeMaster 1995). Revisions have been published for the following years: 1996 (Hill et al. 1997), 1998 (Hill and DeMaster 1998), 1999 (Hill and DeMaster 1999), 2000 (Ferrero et al. 2000), 2001 (Angliss et al. 2001), 2002 (Angliss and Lodge 2002), 2003 (Angliss and Lodge 2004), 2005 (Angliss and Outlaw 2005), 2006 (Angliss and Outlaw 2006), and 2007 (Angliss and Outlaw 2008). Each stock assessment report is designed to stand alone and is updated as new information becomes available. The MMPA requires stock assessment reports to be reviewed annually for stocks designated as strategic, annually for stocks where there are significant new information available, and at least once every 3 years for all other stocks. New information for all <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> (Steller sea lions, northern fur seals, Cook Inlet beluga whales, AT 1 transient killer whales, harbor porpoises, sperm whales, humpback whales, fin whales, North Pacific right whales, and bowhead whales), were reviewed in 2007 - 2008. This review, and a review of other stocks, led to the revision of the following stock assessments for the 2008 document: Steller sea lion (western and eastern U. S. stocks), northern fur seal, beluga whale (Beaufort Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, Eastern Bering Sea, Bristol Bay, and Cook Inlet stocks), killer whale (AT 1 transient), harbor porpoise (southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea stocks), sperm whale, gray whale, central and western stocks of humpback whales, fin whale, North Pacific right whale, and bowhead whale.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the risk {{management}} of total supply chains by identifying the risk drivers that could appear simultaneously, and the determination of their common denominator to mitigate supply chain risk using the Net Present Value (NPV) approach in Extended Material Requirements Planning (Extended MRP) models. Any risk driver that is likely to disrupt the procurement, production, transportation, warehousing, delivery or financing of a good or service constitutes a realisation of supply chain risk. Risk drivers often appear simultaneously. It is imperative, therefore, that an a priori assessment of the risk drivers that pose risk to the global supply chain is undertaken and that contingency plans are developed at every level to monitor and mitigate these risks, even when they appear simultaneously. To avoid the ruin of a supply chain we must ensure the availability of adequate funds in conjunction with safety stock. Therefore, the risk-mitigation approach pursued in our paper follows from our conviction that money is the stock of purchasing power of any activity cell in a global supply chain that could influence the perturbation of material flows—on many stages simultaneously. In the paper, we provide a method appropriate for preventing the long-term disruption of a supply chain with probability determined in advance. How to assure resilience of a global supply chain is the question which has occupied the World Economic Forum since 2009. The Industry Agendas in Davos expressed the need to develop a risk assessment framework for the end-to-end supply chain which has not been developed yet. The article presents how company owners, regulators, and board members of supply chains can build the risk assessment framework on a similar requirement as that accepted in the insurance industry, capturing knowledge from the Solvency II framework, and embed the constraints in the extended MRP model. Such a quantitative tool can be used to exercise the “stress tests” of the total chain according to assumptions and plans. In the presented methodology, as a novelty first developed here, we show how the perturbation of intensity in production and logistics, simultaneous perturbations in the timing of financial flows, information flows, flows of items and market perturbations can be better evaluated simultaneously through Laplace transforms and the NPV expression which allow for a control of physical and financial flows simultaneously. Our paper follows the Davos 2013 conclusions analysed by Forbes that “To maintain effectiveness, supply chain managers can arrange to share <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks,</b> or to enter into joint supply agreements. They can also pre-arrange ways to access critical stocks”. Therefore risks should be evaluated on the level of the end-to-end supply chain, and not only on the level of the companies involved. The paper suggests that resilience of a chain is measured by the probability that the NPV of the chain will not fall under the critical value determined in advance, and the yearly mathematical reservations are derived...|$|E

Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) are required to publish Stock Assessment Reports for all stocks of marine mammals within U. S. waters, to review new information every year for <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> and every three years for non-strategic stocks, and to update the stock assessment reports when significant new information becomes available. This report presents revised stock assessments for 11 Pacific marine mammal stocks under NMFS jurisdiction, including six “strategic” and five “non-strategic” stocks (see summary table in Appendix 3.). A new stock assessment for humpback whales in American Samoa waters {{is included in the}} Pacific reports for the first time. New or revised abundance estimates are available for nine stocks, including Eastern North Pacific blue whales, American Samoa humpback whales, five U. S. west coast harbor porpoise stocks, the Hawaiian monk seal, and southern resident killer whales. The ‘Northern Oregon/Washington Coast Stock’ harbor porpoise stock assessment includes a name change (‘Oregon’ is appended to ‘Northern Oregon’) to reflect stock boundary changes supported by more recent genetic data. Information on the remaining Pacific region stocks will be reprinted without revision in the final 2009 reports and currently appears in the 2008 reports (Carretta et al. 2009). Stock Assessments for Alaskan marine mammals are published by the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) in a separate report. Pacific region stock assessments include those studied by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC, La Jolla, California), the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC, Honolulu, Hawaii), the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML, Seattle, Washington), and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC, Seattle, WA). Northwest Fisheries Science Center staff prepared the report on the Eastern North Pacific Southern Resident killer whale. Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center staff prepared the report on the Hawaiian monk seal. Southwest Fisheries Science Center staff prepared stock assessments for the remaining nine stocks. Draft versions of the 2009 stock assessment reports were reviewed by the Pacific Scientific Review Group at the November 2008, Maui meeting. The authors also wish to thank those who provided unpublished data, especially Robin Baird and Joseph Mobley, who provided valuable information on Hawaiian cetaceans. We also thank those who provided input during the public comment period. Any omissions or errors are the sole responsibility of the authors. This is a working document and individual stock assessment reports will be updated as new information on marine mammal stocks and fisheries becomes available. Background information and guidelines for preparing stock assessment reports are reviewed in Wade and Angliss (1997). The authors solicit any new information or comments which would improve future stock assessment reports. These Stock Assessment Reports summarize information {{from a wide range of}} original data sources and an extensive bibliography of all sources is given in each report. We strongly urge users of this document to refer to and cite original literature sources rather than citing this report or previous Stock Assessment Reports. If the original sources are not accessible, the citation should follow the format: [Original source], as cited in [this Stock Assessment Report citation]...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar a competitividade de uma cooperativa paranaense participante da cadeia de frango de corte, utilizando-se da anÃlise da cadeia de valor. Do ponto de vista metodolÃgico, a pesquisa Ã documental, explicativa e assume o carÃter de um estudo de caso. A pesquisa Ã explicativa, pois visa identificar os fatores que determinam ou contribuem para a ocorrÃncia dos fenÃmenos. Quanto ao procedimento documental, a dissertaÃÃo teve sua estrutura focada nos temas competitividade, gestÃo estratÃgica de custos e a compreensÃo do papel das empresas na promoÃÃo do desenvolvimento regional. Trata-se de um estudo de caso envolvendo a atividade de avicultura de corte de uma empresa cooperativa da MesorregiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ, especificamente a Cooperativa Agroindustrial Lar, com sede em Medianeira. Tal escolha se justifica pela semelhanÃa de sua cadeia produtiva de frango de corte com as demais empresas cooperativas da regiÃo, que adotam modernas tecnologias na produÃÃo dos frangos, no abate e na distribuiÃÃo dos produtos finais. Para o desenvolvimento do trabalho adotou-se a metodologia de construÃÃo da cadeia de valor inserida no referencial teÃrico da gestÃo estratÃgica de custos, sendo que a pesquisa utilizou como base a formaÃÃo de valor do peito de frango desossado vendido para o cliente Super Poultry da Europa. Verificou-se que as principais ligaÃÃes crÃticas na cadeia de valor envolvem as relaÃÃes entre a Ãrea de grÃos e o comitÃ gestor da avicultura de corte e as relaÃÃes entre a empresa estudada e o produtor rural integrado na criaÃÃo de frango. A pesquisa identificou a ocorrÃncia de contratos de curto prazo na cadeia de valor, quando envolve o ativo especÃfico pintinho matriz. Evidenciou-se ainda que a empresa necessita melhorar a sua competitividade a partir da reduÃÃo do custo do frango vivo pronto para o abate. A empresa se mostrou competitiva na parcela de custo do frango vivo que cabe ao produtor, mas necessita atuar sobre os custos variÃveis da parcela que lhe cabe na formaÃÃo do custo do frango vivo. Observou-se ainda que o custo do milho, o custo do farelo de soja, o custo do ovo fÃrtil e a quantidade produzida sÃo os principais componentes da cadeia de valor que alteram o custo mÃdio do peito de frango estudado. Finalmente, o trabalho identificou oportunidades de melhoria nos custos dos insumos e matÃrias-primas, via melhor gestÃo corporativa do processo de compras, estabelecimento de parcerias de longo prazo com fornecedores e empresas concorrentes, bem como na formaÃÃo de estoques estratÃgicos de matÃrias-primas. Nesse sentido, a hipÃtese da pesquisa foi confirmada ao identificar que alguns fatores crÃticos para a competitividade em custos nÃo eram conhecidos pelos gestores da avicultura de corte no momento de suas decisÃes sobre o planejamento e a comercializaÃÃo da carne de frango. The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{competitiveness}} of a cooperative from ParanÃ participant in the chain of poultry, using the value chain analysis. From the methodological point of view, the research is documentary, explanatory and takes a case study nature. The research is explanatory because it aims to identify factors that determine or contribute to the occurrence of phenomena. In relation to the documentary procedure, the investigation has focused on competitiveness issues, strategic cost management and on understanding of the role of companies in promoting regional development. This is a case study involving the poultry production activity of a cooperative that is present almost all over the West of ParanÃ, specifically Lar Agribusiness Cooperative, with its head office in Medianeira. This choice is justified by the similarity of its poultry production chain to the other cooperatives in the region, which adopt modern technologies in the production of chicken, slaughter and distribution of final products. To develop this study it was adopted the methodology of building the value chain inserted into the theoretical framework of strategic cost management, and the research has used as base the formation of the value of boneless chicken breast sold to the customer Super Poultry in Europe. It was found that the main critical links in the value chain involve the relationship between the area of grain and the poultry steering committee, and the relationship between the company studied and the farmer engaged in chicken rearing. The research has identified the occurrence of short-term contracts in the value chain, specifically when it involves the active matrix chick. The research has also revealed that the company needs to improve its competitiveness through reduced cost of live chicken ready for slaughter. The company has proved to be competitive in the share of the cost of live chicken that is the producerâs responsibility, but needs to act on the variable costs of the share of the cost of live chicken rearing. It was observed as well that the cost of corn, soybean meal, fertile egg and the quantity produced are the main components of the value chain that alter the average cost of the chicken breast studied. Finally, the study has identified opportunities for improvement in cost of inputs and raw materials, through better corporate management of the procurement process, establishment of long-term partnerships with suppliers and competitors, as well as the creation of <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> of raw materials. Accordingly, the hypothesis of this study was confirmed by identifying that some critical factors for competitiveness in costs were not known by the poultry industry managers at the time of their decisions on the planning and marketing of chicken meat...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{examination}} of over 40 years of data reveals that oil price shocks are invariably followed by 2 – 3 years of weak {{economic growth and}} weak economic growth is almost always preceded by an oil price shock. This paper reviews why the price-inelastic demand and supply of oil cause oil price shocks and why oil price shocks reduce economic growth through dislocations of labor and capital. This paper also reviews {{the current state of}} oil-supply security noting that previous episodes of supply instability appear to have become chronic conditions. While new unconventional oil production technologies have revitalized North American oil production, there are significant barriers to a world-wide uptake of these technologies. <b>Strategic</b> petroleum <b>stocks</b> could provide a large measure of protection to the world economy during an oil supply disruption if they are used promptly and in sufficient volume to prevent large oil-price spikes. Despite the large volume of world-wide emergency reserves, their effectiveness in protecting world economies is not assured. <b>Strategic</b> oil <b>stocks</b> have not been used in sufficient quantity or soon enough to avoid the economic downturns that followed past oil supply outages. In addition, the growth of U. S. oil production has reduced the ability of the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect the economy following a future oil supply disruption. The policy implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

In order to answer this question, we developed a framework for cost-benefit analysis and applied this framework to a number of policy options. The options chosen vary from government investments in <b>strategic</b> oil <b>stocks</b> to financial incentives for consumers to reduce their consumption of electricity. The set of options comprises several types of governmental action, including subsidies, regulation and government investments. Moreover, the selection includes measures meant to address risks on all three major energy markets: oil, natural gas, and electricity. ...|$|R
