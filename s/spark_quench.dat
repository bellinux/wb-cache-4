40|$|Up to the present, various <b>spark</b> <b>quench</b> {{methods have}} been devised in high tension circuit and d-c low tension circuit. But these are not devised yet in a-c low tension circuit. In this paper, the authors report a new <b>spark</b> <b>quench</b> circuit with {{thyristors}} used in a-c low tension circuit. This circuit ignites thyristors by arc voltage that generates at breaking of mechanical switch, and arc current is made extinct by its removement from the mechanical switch to the <b>spark</b> <b>quench</b> circuit. At {{the result of the}} experimentation by the use of rotary switches, worn amount of contact decreased in the ratio 1 : 3 at the rated current and the ratio became smaller over the rated current...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} on the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> circuits had {{been limited to}} D. C. circuit, {{but it has been}} carried out little by little in A. C. circuit by the development of thyristors. In this paper, first, the author suggested new <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> circuits for inductive load, and, second, showed the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> conditions. The conclusions obtained were as follows. (1) In the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> circuits for noninductive load, the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> conditions need not be considered except the area of large current. But there are the sphere that can not extinguish arcs in arc conditions. (2) In the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> circuits for inductive load, the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> conditions needs to be considered only re-discharge conditions, and other conditions need not be considered except the area of large current...|$|R

As a result of obtaining the capacitance in four inductive loads the measured values became about double the calculated values. The error of the measured values is due to practical diminution of capacitance by condenser charged by power source...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFast {{evacuation}} of avalanche ions in Micromegas makes these detectors capable of withstanding very high rates with {{no loss of}} gain. But this intrinsic high-rate capability is often compromised by sporadic sparking which introduces dead time and is potentially harmful for the readout. Resistive electrode designs, by limiting spark current and keeping voltage drop locally, provide an effective remedy. They are thus quite popular, but there is actually more to them than simply spark attenuation. We propose that the spark probability is also drastically reduced because of charge-up of the resistive electrode surface. The underlying mechanism is a progressive reduction of field (in the region where spark-initiating avalanches develop) by the charges successively incoming onto the surface. We predict that the time constant with which the surface potential is relaxed {{is crucial to the}} success of this quenching mechanism. Small prototypes with a time constant varying over 5 orders of magnitude were built to verify this model. During tests in a high intensity hadron beam, <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> was observed for time constants larger than roughly 1 - 10 ns, corresponding to the avalanche timescale in Micromegas. These findings shed light on the basic mechanism of <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> in resistive detectors. Of general interest to the gaseous detector community, they also open the way to an optimisation of the resistivity value for best rate capability and full spark suppression...|$|R
5000|$|The {{layout of}} the Wardenclyffe {{magnifying}} transmitter is well known, based upon Tesla's patents and various photographs in which the concept was implemented. The Wardenclyffe magnifying transmitter was not identical to the classic Tesla coil. It had the short thick primary and secondary inductor characteristic of the Tesla coil, although magnetic coupling between the two was tighter. Because of this, more aggressive measures {{had to be taken}} in terms of primary <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> and providing additional insulation between the primary and secondary. In addition to these two large-diameter coils that comprise the master oscillator at Wardenclyffe, Tesla added a third inductor called the [...] "extra coil." ...|$|R

40|$|Equipe MicromegasInternational audienceMicromegas, as a {{proportional}} {{and compact}} gaseous detector, {{can be used}} as an active medium in a sampling calorimeter. Moreover, its readout plane can be finely segmented to perform Particle Flow reconstruction of jets at a future linear collider or high luminosity LHC experiment. For this application, sparks that would result from the potentially very large ionisation released in the gas during a shower can be avoided by means of resistive eletrodes. By slowing down the charge evacuation to ground through an RC-network, they allow a field reduction when the avalanche grows too large. While this mechanism efficiently <b>quenches</b> <b>sparks,</b> it might compromise the Micromegas intrinsic proportionality and the overall calorimeter response linearity. A study was conducted to determine the resistive configuration that best suppresses sparks and preserves proportionality. Several configurations were implemented on small prototypes, with a resistivity varying over five orders of magnitude. Charging of the resistive electrodes depends on the detector current, therefore the gain dependence on the rate and the dependence on the charge density (or dE/dx) were examined separately. Then, the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> efficiency was assessed in a high intensity hadron beam used to generate showers that propagate through the prototypes. Our findings indicate that the resistivity necessary for quenching is surprisingly low, corresponding to an RC constant of the order of the avalanche time scale...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} three variants of single amplification-stage detector elements; they comprise THGEM electrodes closed at their bottom with metallic or resistive anodes to form WELL-type configurations. We {{present the results}} of a comparative study of the Thick-WELL (THWELL), Resistive-WELL (RWELL) and Segmented Resistive WELL (SRWELL), focusing on their performance in terms of spark-quenching capability, gain variation with position and counting rate, pulse shapes and signal propagation to neighboring readout pads; the study included both 30 x 30 and 100 x 100 mm$^ 2 $ detectors. It was shown that the WELL structures with resistive anodes offer stable operation even in a highly ionizing environment, with effective <b>spark</b> <b>quenching,</b> as well as higher gain than the standard THGEM/induction-gap configuration. Cross talk between neighboring readout pads was shown to be effectively eliminated in the segmented detector with a conductive grid underneath the resistive layer. The latter multiplier should allow for the design of very thin detectors, e. g. sampling elements in digital hadronic calorimeters planned for experiments in future linear colliders.

50|$|The {{original}} parallel plate-weighted wire {{design has}} evolved as more efficient (and robust) discharge electrode designs were developed, today focusing on rigid (pipe-frame) discharge electrodes to which many sharpened spikes are attached (barbed wire), maximizing corona production. Transformer-rectifier systems apply voltages of 50-100 kV at relatively high current densities. Modern controls, {{such as an}} automatic voltage control, minimize electric sparking and prevent arcing (<b>sparks</b> are <b>quenched</b> within 1/2 cycle of the TR set), avoiding damage to the components. Automatic plate-rapping systems and hopper-evacuation systems remove the collected particulate matter while on line, theoretically allowing ESPs to stay in continuous operation for years at a time.|$|R

40|$|High-yield and {{continuous}} synthesis of ultrapure inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) of well-defined size and composition has invariably {{been one of}} the major challenges in nanotechnology. Employing green techniques that avoid the use of poisonous and expensive chemicals has been realized as a necessity for manufacturing NPs on an industrial scale. In this communication, we show that a newly developed high-frequency <b>spark</b> (HFS) <b>quenched</b> by a high-purity gas yields a series of monometallic and bimetallic NPs in large quantities, with well-defined (primary) particle size (sub- 10 nm) and chemical composition. The mass production rate is linearly dependent on the operating frequency, and can reach up to 1 g hâˆ’ 1, providing a universal and facile technology for producing multicomponent hybrid NPs. Considering also that the methodology requires neither any specialized machinery, nor any chemical reagents, product purification, or any further waste processing, it provides a green, sustainable and versatile platform for manufacturing key building blocks toward industrial scale production.

5000|$|There {{are three}} cases for an arc oscillator. In the first case, the AC current in the {{condenser}} [...] {{is much smaller}} than the DC supply current , and the arc is never extinguished during an output cycle. The Duddell arc {{is an example of the}} first case, but the first case is not practical for RF transmitters. In the second case, the condenser AC discharge current is large enough to extinguish the arc but not large enough to restart the arc in the opposite direction. This second case is the Poulsen arc. In the third case, the arc extinguishes but may reignite when the condenser current reverses. The third case is a <b>quenched</b> <b>spark</b> gap and produces damped oscillations.|$|R
