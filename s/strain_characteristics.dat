5000|$|The {{proteoglycan}} {{components of}} tendons also {{are important to}} the mechanical properties. While the collagen fibrils allow tendons to resist tensile stress, the proteoglycans allow them to resist compressive stress. These molecules are very hydrophilic, meaning that they can absorb a large amount of water and therefore have a high swelling ratio. Since they are noncovalently bound to the fibrils, they may reversibly associate and disassociate so that the bridges between fibrils can be broken and reformed. This process may be involved in allowing the fibril to elongate and decrease in diameter under tension. However, the proteoglycans may also have a role in the tensile properties of tendon. The structure of tendon is effectively a fibre composite material, built as a series of hierarchical levels. At each level of the hierarchy, the collagen units are bound together by either collagen crosslinks, or the proteoglycans, to create a structure highly resistant to tensile load. The elongation and the strain of the collagen fibrils alone {{have been shown to be}} much lower than the total elongation and strain of the entire tendon under the same amount of stress, demonstrating that the proteoglycan-rich matrix must also undergo deformation, and stiffening of the matrix occurs at high strain rates. [...] This deformation of the non-collagenous matrix occurs at all levels of the tendon hierarchy, and by modulating the organisation and structure of this matrix, the different mechanical properties required by different tendons can be achieved. Energy storing tendons have been shown to utilise significant amounts of sliding between fascicles to enable the high <b>strain</b> <b>characteristics</b> they require, whilst positional tendons rely more heavily on sliding between collagen fibres and fibrils. However, recent data suggests that energy storing tendons may also contain fascicles which are twisted, or helical, in nature - an arrangement that would be highly beneficial for providing the spring-like behaviour required in these tendons.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} {{of the concept of}} the representative strain is often used in the stress-strain curve determination from indentation test because it can significantly simplify the analysis of the indentation response. A new methodology for determining the representative strain for Vickers indentation is presented in this article. Following a procedure based on finite element simulations of indentation of elastoplastic materials, two representative strains are defined: the representative <b>strain</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the mean pressure and the representative <b>strain</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the Martens hardness or the indentation loading curvature. The results obtained from this methodology show that there is no universal value of representative strain independent of the mechanical parameters of materials indented by Vickers indentation. It is also shown that the representative strain, obtained by Vickers indentation is much lower when it is obtained from the relationship between the applied force and the penetration depth, F-h, rather than from the relationship between the applied force and the contact radius, F-a. The values of the calculated representative strains show that simultaneous measurement of relationships F-a and F-h make it possible to characterize the hardening law with two unknown parameters by Vickers indentation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{microorganism}} Pichia pastoris is {{a commonly}} used microbial host for {{the expression of}} recombinant proteins in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry. To speed up process development, a fast methodology to determine <b>strain</b> <b>characteristic</b> parameters, which are needed to subsequently set up fed batch feeding profiles, is required. Results Here, we show the general applicability of a novel approach to quantify a certain minimal set of bioprocess-relevant parameters, i. e. the adaptation time of the culture to methanol, the specific substrate uptake rate during the adaptation phase and the maximum specific substrate uptake rate, based on fast and easy-to-do batch cultivations with repeated methanol pulses in a batch culture. A detailed analysis of the adaptation of different P. pastoris strains to methanol was conducted and revealed that each strain showed very different characteristics during adaptation, illustrating the need of individual screenings for an optimal parameter definition during this phase. Based on the results obtained in batch cultivations, dynamic feeding profiles based on the specific substrate uptake rate were employed for different P. pastoris strains. In these experiments the maximum specific substrate uptake rate, which had been defined in batch experiments, also represented the upper limit of methanol uptake, underlining the validity of the determined process-relevant parameters and the overall experimental strategy. Conclusion In this study, we show that a fast approach to determine a minimal set of <b>strain</b> <b>characteristic</b> parameters based on easy-to-do batch cultivations with methanol pulses is generally applicable for different P. pastoris strains and that dynamic fed batch strategies can be designed on the specific substrate uptake rate without running the risk of methanol accumulation. </p...|$|R

This study aimed to correlate growth rates of C. difficile with disease severity and <b>strain</b> <b>characteristics.</b> From 01 / 2003 to 10 / 2011, strains from a prospective cohort of all inpatients with CDI at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland were analyzed regarding binary toxin, presence of the tcdC deletion and ribotype. Isothermal microcalorimetry was performed to determine growth rates, quantified by the Gompertz function. Ordered logistic regression models were used to correlate disease severity with strain features and clinical characteristics. Among 199 patients, 31 (16 %) were infected with binary toxin-producing strains, of which the tcdC gene-deletion nt 117 was detected in 9 (4 %). Disease severity was classified as mild in 130 patients (65. 3 %), as severe in 59 patients (29. 7 %) and as severe/complicated in 10 patients (5. 0 %).
