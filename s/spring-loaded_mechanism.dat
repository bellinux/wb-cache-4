25|$|Hold down: The {{circular}} sawblade of a tablesaw {{will pick}} {{up a piece of}} wood if not held down. Hold downs can be a vertical version of featherboards, attached to a fence with magnets or clamps. Another type of hold down uses wheels on a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> to push down on a workpiece as it is guided past the blade.|$|E
2500|$|The hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed [...] "hats") {{consist of}} two cymbals mounted {{facing each other}} on a metal pole with folding support legs that keep a hollow support {{cylinder}} standing up. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin pole which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand cylinder. The thin pole is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, a mechanism causes the thin pole to move down, causing the cymbals to move together. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the cymbals move apart, due to the pedal's <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals {{with one or two}} sticks or just by opening and closing the cymbals with the footpedal, without striking the cymbals. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone enables drummers to use both sticks on other drums or cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking [...] "open hi-hats" [...] (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed [...] "sloppy hats") or a crisp [...] "closed hi-hats" [...] sound (with the pedal pressed down). As well, the high hats can be played with a partially depressed pedal.|$|E
50|$|The barrel is semi free-floated, {{since it}} is {{connected}} by a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> to the handguard/gas tube cover so the handguard can move with the barrel during firing.|$|E
50|$|Into the 1980s, the {{pressure}} necessary to blast the arc was generated mostly by gas heating using arc energy. It {{is now possible}} to use low-energy <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to drive high-voltage circuit breakers up to 800 kV.|$|R
50|$|Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a {{threaded}} sleeve over the gate {{which must be}} engaged and disengaged manually. They have fewer moving parts than <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than pull-lock, twist-lock or lever-lock.|$|R
25|$|Odontomachus bauri is {{a species}} of ponerinae ant known as trap jaw ants. The trap jaw {{consists}} of mandibles which contain a <b>spring-loaded</b> catch <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lamp changers {{in current}} use may have two, four, or six lamps and use either a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> or an {{electric}} motor to change lamps when required. They are used in aerodrome beacons and marine navigational aids.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{adjusts the}} angle of attack of the flukes using the water {{pressure}} from swimming. The rubber spring can be set on three tension settings from flexible for slow relatively efficient swimming to more rigid for sprinting.|$|E
5000|$|Temporary or {{informal}} trapshooting can utilize {{other methods}} to launch targets. The simplest is a [...] "hand thrower" [...] {{which is a}} hand-held arm which holds and releases that target when a person swings it. Another type of manual, non-electrical thrower utilizes a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> which is cocked and subsequently released by hand or foot.|$|E
40|$|Trap-jaw ants are {{characterized}} by high-speed mandibles used for prey capture and defense. Power-amplified mandibles have independently evolved {{at least four times}} among ants, with each lineage using different structures as a latch, spring and trigger. We examined two species from the genus Myrmoteras (subfamily Formicinae), whose morphology is unique among trap-jaw ant lineages, and describe the performance characteristics, <b>spring-loading</b> <b>mechanism</b> and neuronal control of Myrmoteras strikes. Like other trap-jaw ants, Myrmoteras latch their jaws open while the large closer muscle loads potential energy in a spring. The latch differs from other lineages and is likely formed by the co-contraction of the mandible opener and closer muscles. The cuticle of the posterior margin of the head serves as a spring, and is deformed by approximately 6 % prior to a strike. The mandibles are likely unlatched by a subgroup of closer muscle fibers with particularly short sarcomeres. These fast fibers are controlled by two large motor neurons whose dendrites overlap with terminals of large sensory neurons originating from labral trigger hairs. Upon stimulation of the trigger hairs, the mandibles shut in as little as 0. 5 ms and at peak velocities that are comparable with other trap-jaw ants, but with much slower acceleration. The estimated power output of the mandible strike (21 kW kg(- 1)) confirms that Myrmoteras jaws are indeed power amplified. However, the power output of Myrmoteras mandibles is significantly lower than distantly related trap-jaw ants using different <b>spring-loading</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> indicating a relationship between power-amplification mechanism and performance...|$|R
5000|$|Officer Dunn {{returns to}} the mall {{the next day to}} search the restaurant, but is {{attacked}} and killed by Dave. Charlie and John go to a library to research the history of Fredbear's Family Diner, and find an old newspaper article about Sammy's kidnapping with a photograph of Dave, who the newspaper identifies as the diner's co-owner. In the restaurant, Dave has Carlton trapped in one of the costumes, and explains that some of them can convert into robots through a series of <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanisms</b> called [...] "spring-locks". If these locks trigger while someone is wearing the costume, the metal components will crush the wearer to death. Dave's true identity is William Afton; the co-owner of both restaurants. He is a deranged psychopath {{responsible for the deaths of}} Sammy, Michael, and four other children.|$|R

5000|$|The {{low cost}} of CubeSats has enabled {{unprecedented}} access to space for smaller institutions and organizations but, for most CubeSat forms, {{the range and}} available power is limited to about 2W for its communications antennae. [...] They can use radio-communication systems in the VHF, UHF, L-, S-, C- and X-band. For UHF/VHF transmissions, a single helical antenna or four monopole antennae are deployed by a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
30|$|For {{fully and}} redundantly {{constrained}} CDPRs, {{the position and}} orientation of the EE only depends on kinematic and static. For instance, Liu et al. [23] introduced two novel architectures of planar CDPRs with spring. Actuation redundancy is not required with <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Azizian and Cardou [24, 25], solved the dimensional synthesis problem {{in order to find}} two fully constrained planar and spatial CDPRs with a prescribed workspace contained in wrench-closure workspace. Gagliardini et al. [26] dealt with a reconfigurable CDPR with movable cable connection points. The mentioned CDPR is more suitable and flexible in complex environment where cable collisions with obstacles cannot be avoided within the workspace of a CDPR with fixed cable connection points. Zi et al. [27] proposed and analyzed a winding hybrid-driven CDPR, combining the advantages of both planar five-bar hybrid-driven mechanism and CDPR.|$|R
50|$|After Mariner 3 was a {{total loss}} due to failure of the payload shroud to jettison, JPL {{engineers}} suggested {{that there had been}} a malfunction caused during separation of the metal fairing exterior from the fiberglass inner lining due to pressure differences between the inner and outer part of the shroud and that this could have caused the <b>spring-loaded</b> separation <b>mechanism</b> to become tangled and fail to detach properly.|$|R
5000|$|A stackfreed is {{a simple}} <b>spring-loaded</b> cam <b>mechanism</b> used {{in some of the}} {{earliest}} antique spring-driven clocks and watches to even out the force of the mainspring, to improve timekeeping accuracy. [...] Stackfreeds were used in some German clocks and watches from the 16th to the 17th century, before they were replaced in later timepieces by the fusee. The term may have come from a compound of the German words starke ("strong") and feder ("spring").|$|R
50|$|As {{they began}} their 74th and final orbit of the Moon, the crew {{positioned}} the spacecraft for the correct attitude for release. The subsatellite {{was released on}} schedule. The release process involved two pyrotechnic bolts being fired to release the satellite which was launched using a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a pin in a curved groove to impart a spin in the satellite. The spinning helped to stabilise the craft.|$|E
50|$|Archie prudently {{removes the}} film from the camera, and his {{foresight}} soon pays off when Inspector Cramer arrives. A needle containing strychnine {{has been found}} in Mrs. Bynoe's abdomen, and the theory is that the needle was shot from a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> such as a camera. Cramer appropriates the camera, but doesn't ask whether the film is still in it. Monday morning, Archie takes the film to a camera store to be developed.|$|E
50|$|In the European Union, since 1974 all {{new cars}} {{have had to}} conform to a European {{directive}} on vehicle exterior projections. Rolls Royce's mascot is now mounted on a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> designed to retract instantly into the radiator shell if struck with more than 10 kg of force. The Mercedes-Benz and many other ornaments were designed with a spring mount to fold on impact. For aftermarket ornaments, breakaway nylon fixings are available that comply with EC Directive 74/483.|$|E

The conventional mousetrap with a <b>spring-loaded</b> snap <b>mechanism</b> resting on a block of wood first appeared in 1884, and to this day is still considered {{to be one of the}} most inexpensive and effective mousetraps.|$|R
50|$|The Oishi brothers, {{owners of}} Hodaka, {{had taken an}} {{extended}} trip to Europe in the late '50s {{and during that time}} they purchased close to 50 European and English motorcycles to take back to Japan to study. It is also rumored Hodaka might have indeed designed the complete Yamaguchi SPB50, not just the engine. Hodaka was also a producer of machine tools and it has been said they borrowed the concept of one of their quick-change gear clusters in one of their metalworking lathes to construct the shift mechanism in the Hodaka gearbox, with the resulting <b>spring-loaded</b> shifting <b>mechanism</b> being patented.|$|R
50|$|Tracks {{used for}} {{professional}} speedway racing are {{regulated by the}} Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) who provide rules concerning construction, size and safety requirements. Speedway racing takes place on a level oval track consisting of two straights joined by two semicircles. Tracks must be between 260 and 425 metres (853 and 1394 ft) in length, this is measured {{at a distance of}} 1 m from the inner boundary. Tracks may be banked, but the gradient must under no circumstances exceed 5% in the straight, 10% in the bends, and must remain constant and grow from the inner edge to the safety fence. A white start line is marked across the track approximately mid-way along one of the straights. The starting area is also divided into four equal parts (known as gates) by white lines marked at right angles to the start line and extending back at least 1 m. Additional rules govern the placement of warning systems such as lights and also the construction of the starting mechanism. The minimum track width is 10 m on the straights and the bends must be at least 14 m wide. The minimum widths give each rider adequate space to safely navigate the track. The start line and starting gate assembly is halfway along one of the two straight sections of the track. Starting gates are simple <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that raise two or three strands of tape to start the race.|$|R
50|$|Mech Tech Weapons System is {{a gimmick}} {{available}} on selected Deluxe, Voyager, Human Alliance and Leader Class figures. Each figure {{comes with an}} oversized blaster that transforms into a different weapon using a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Only the Voyager Class, Deluxe Starscream's, and Deluxe Laserbeak's weapons have locking mechanisms to keep their secondary forms in place. In addition, the figures have multiple hardpoints on their body panels to place their weapons anywhere or add more weapons for enhanced customization.|$|E
5000|$|While not all {{action figures}} include accessories, the {{additional}} items often prove essential to characters and their effectiveness as interactive toys. Typical 3¾" [...] scale G.I. Joe figures include several intricately sculpted guns or hand weapons {{that can be}} fastened inside the figures' hands. Missile launchers are also commonplace in military and comic book figure lines and usually involve a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism.</b> However, possibly due to safety concerns, this method saw {{a decline in the}} mid-1990s. Some figures, particularly of the Joker, have incorporated water-squirting weapons.|$|E
50|$|A {{map holder}} {{attached}} to the handlebar of the bike is an essential piece of equipment in mountain bike orienteering, and most holders allow the map to be rotated. Known brands for map holders are Mapdec, Miry, Devotech, Nordenmark, Autopilot and Windchill. Many riders also use some type of a cord with a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> to draw the cord back after use for their electronic timing chips/cards. Compasses may be used but electronic navigational aids (such as GPS-based watches) are not permitted. Competitors may carry repair tools and spare parts during races.|$|E
50|$|The mine is a {{cylinder}} consisting of three sections. The top section contains the warhead, consisting of an upward facing Misznay-Schardin effect warhead that creates an explosively formed penetrator capable of punching through heavy bulldozer blades. The dimpled {{sides of the}} cylinder have a shotgun effect, generating a pattern of metal fragments capable of penetrating steel plate beyond 20 metres and aluminium plate beyond 50 meters. The middle section of the mine contains the fuze, comprising a battery, safety and arming mechanism and electronic sensors. The bottom contains the parachute and a <b>spring-loaded</b> self-righting <b>mechanism</b> which opens like the petals of a sunflower after the device hits the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Carabiners {{exist in}} various forms; {{the shape of}} the {{carabiner}} and the type of gate varies according to the use for which it is intended. There are two major varieties: locking and non-locking carabiners. Locking carabiners offer a method of preventing the gate from opening when in use. Locking carabiners are used for important connections, such as at the anchor point or a belay device. There are several different types of locking carabiners, including a twist-lock and a thread-lock. Twist-lock carabiners are commonly referred to as [...] "auto-locking carabiners" [...] due to their <b>spring-loaded</b> locking <b>mechanism.</b> Non-locking carabiners are commonly found as a component of quickdraws.|$|R
50|$|The Niskin bottle is a {{development}} of the Nansen bottle patented by Shale Niskin in March 1966. Instead of a metal bottle sealed at one end, the 'bottle' is a tube, usually plastic to minimize contamination of the sample, {{and open to the}} water at both ends. Each end is equipped with a cap which is either spring-loaded or tensioned by an elastic rope. The action of the messenger weight is to trip both caps shut and seal the tube. A reversing thermometer may also be carried on a frame fixed to the Niskin bottle. Since there is no rotation of the bottle to fix the temperature measurement, the thermometer has a separate <b>spring-loaded</b> rotating <b>mechanism</b> of its own tripped by the messenger weight.|$|R
50|$|Today's Spirit of Ecstasy, {{from the}} 2003 Phantom model onward, stands at 3 inches and, for safety, {{is mounted on}} a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{designed}} to retract instantly into the radiator shell if struck from any direction. There is a button within the vehicle which can raise/lower the emblem when pressed. She {{can be made from}} highly polished stainless steel, stainless with 24-carat gold plating, or from illuminated frosted crystal - the latter two being optional extras. Aftermarket customized versions are also available, including those covered in a matte black paint or studded in diamonds.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{entry into}} CD4-positive cells commences when three {{subunits}} of a glycoprotein 120 (gp120) bind to CD4 receptor and a coreceptor. Glycoprotein gp120 is closely associated to a trimer of gp41 via van der Waals interactions. Upon binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and coreceptor, {{a number of}} conformational changes in the structure leads to the dissociation of gp120 and to the exposure of gp41 {{and at the same}} time to the anchoring of the gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide sequence into the host cell. A <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> is responsible for bringing the viral and cell membranes in close proximity that they will fuse. The origin of the <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism</b> lies within the exposed gp41, which contains two consecutive heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) following the fusion peptide at the N terminus of the protein. HR1 forms a parallel, trimeric coiled coil onto which HR2 region coils, forming the trimer-of-hairpins (or six-helix bundle) structure, thereby facilitating membrane fusion through bringing the membranes close to each other. The virus then enters the cell and begins its replication. Recently, inhibitors derived from HR2 such as Fuzeon (DP178, T-20) bind to the HR1 region on gp41 have been developed. However, peptides derived from HR1 have little viral inhibition efficacy due to the propensity for these peptides to aggregate in solution. Chimeras of these HR1-derived peptides with GCN4 leucine zippers have been developed and have shown to be more active than Fuzeon, but these have not entered the clinic yet.|$|E
50|$|When the Generation 2 Laser Optimus Prime {{figure was}} reissued in Japan in 2006, online {{retailer}} eHobby offered an exclusive repainted {{version of it}} as {{a new version of the}} original Ultra Magnus, referencing - as other toylines had also since done - the connection between the original Prime and Magnus toys. As a repaint of Laser Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus has light-up eyes and headlights, and sword and gun which can also be illuminated when place in his fist. His trailer can, via a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>mechanism,</b> transform into a heavily armed battle station with a five-shot missile launcher, disc shooter and bellows-activated foam-tipped rocket launcher.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative design concept for an underactuated robotic finger which can perform adaptable closure and pinch grasping. The mechanically simple design combines an underactuated <b>spring-loaded</b> enclosing <b>mechanism</b> with a Variable Stiffness Actuator, {{which can be}} used to regulate the mechanical stiffness and interaction forces of the finger during grasping. This highly desirable property can enable the finger to be used as an adaptable and versatile gripper that can interact with its environment with minimal control effort. The design of the proposed underactuated robotic finger is presented and its main features are discussed. The interplay between the finger mechanism and its variably compliant actuation is analyzed for different grasps and load conditions, before the finger’s properties are experimentally validated and the pinch and enveloping grasp capabilities demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|The pickup {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} two tubular steel [...] "horns" [...] (30 feet long and spread at a 70° angle) protruding from its nose. The aircraft would fly into the line, aiming at a bright mylar marker placed at the 425-foot (130 m) level. As the line was caught between the forks on {{the nose of the}} aircraft, the balloon was released and a <b>spring-loaded</b> trigger <b>mechanism</b> (sky anchor) secured the line to the aircraft. After the initial pickup, the line was snared by the pickup crew using a J-hook and attached to a powered winch and the person or cargo pulled on board. To prevent the pickup line from interfering with the aircraft's propellers {{in the case of an}} unsuccessful catch, the aircraft had deflector cables strung from the nose to the wingtips.|$|R
40|$|A novel RF shield was {{developed}} for the circular expansion joint used throughout the PEP-II vacuum system straight sections. Existing RF shield designs, used in accelerators/storage rings throughout the world, have {{been the source of}} many failures at beam currents much smaller than the 3 amps planned for PEP-II. This RF shield uses a unique <b>spring-loaded</b> finger <b>mechanism</b> to maintain proper electrical contact across the joint, accommodate 1. 5 mm transverse and 32 mm longitudinal excursions, while minimizing geometry-driven trapped-mode RF heating at GHz frequencies. Alumina-dispersed, copper alloy fingers are used to maintain desired mechanical properties at higher temperatures instead of the more commonly used beryllium-copper alloys. A prototype expansion joint was assembled, mechanically tested, and subjected to 200 % of the expected operational RF load. This RF shield design can be easily adapted to non-circular geometries...|$|R
