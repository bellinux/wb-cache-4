50|$|In {{class-based}} programming, inheritance is done {{by defining}} new classes as extensions of existing classes: the existing class is the parent class and the new class is the child class. If a child class has only one parent class, {{this is known as}} <b>single</b> <b>inheritance,</b> while if a child class can have more than one parent class, this is known as multiple inheritance. This organizes classes into a hierarchy, either a tree (if <b>single</b> <b>inheritance)</b> or lattice (if multiple inheritance).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Single</b> table <b>inheritance</b> {{is a way}} {{to emulate}} {{object-oriented}} inheritance in a relational database. When mapping from a database table to an object in an object-oriented language, a field in the database identifies what class in the hierarchy the object belongs to. [...] All fields of all the classes are stored in the same table, hence the name [...] "Single Table Inheritance". In Ruby on Rails the field in the table called 'type' identifies the name of the class. In Hibernate (Java) and Entity Framework this pattern is called Table-Per-Class-Hierarchy and Table-Per-Hierarchy (TPH) respectively., and the column containing the class name is called the Discriminator column.|$|R

40|$|Protocols were {{developed}} for visualizing enzyme polymorphisms among rhodo-dodendrons using starch gel electrophoresis. Genetic interpretation of nine en-zyme systems comprising 15 polymorphic loci was facilitated by progeny testing of interspecific hybrid populations. In 53 of 58 segregations, phenotypic ratios at these loci fit Mendelian models for <b>single</b> gene <b>inheritance</b> at the diploid level. Dlsomic Inheritance was consistent across a {{diverse array of}} genetic backgrounds in complex hybrids averaging six species of Rhododendron per pedigree. The low frequency of segregation distortion in these highly Interspecific populations was attributed to two possible mechanisms: (1) lack of significant chromosomal differ-entiation among the Rhododendron species involved and (2) selection for chro-mosomal and genetic stability over many generations of rhododendron breeding...|$|R

5000|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} legal change that affected womenâs lives was the Law of <b>Single</b> <b>Inheritance</b> instituted by Peter the Great in 1714. The law was supposed to help the tax revenue for Russia by banning the allowance of noble families to divide their land and wealth among multiple children. This law effectively ended the practice of excluding women from inheriting patrimonial estates. [...] The Law of <b>Single</b> <b>Inheritance</b> was clarified in the decree of 1725. It sought {{to address the question}} of married daughterâ inheritance rights. The law mandated that if a man was survived by unmarried daughters, the eldest girl would inherit his estate, while the remaining sisters would divide his movable property. His married daughters would receive nothing, however, since they would have received dowries at the time they married.|$|E
50|$|The Ruby library ActiveRecord {{implements}} ORM. It {{creates a}} persistable domain model from business objects and database tables, where logic and data {{are presented as}} a unified package. ActiveRecord adds inheritance and associations to the pattern above, solving two substantial limitations of that pattern. A set of macros acts as a domain language for the latter, and the <b>Single</b> Table <b>Inheritance</b> pattern is integrated for the former; thus, ActiveRecord increases the functionality of the active record pattern approach to database interaction. ActiveRecord is the default âmodelâ component of the model-view-controller web-application framework Ruby on Rails, and is also a stand-alone ORM package for other Ruby applications. In both forms, it was conceived of by David Heinemeier Hansson, and has been improved upon {{by a number of}} contributors.|$|R

40|$|In {{classical}} genetics, {{the words}} genotype and pheno-type {{are commonly used}} in <b>single</b> factor <b>inheritance,</b> but sometimes in two or more factor inheritance. For a sim-ple recessive, the three possible genotypes are AA, Aa, and aa. The genotypes AA and Aa produce the same dominant phenotype, and aa produces the recessive phenotype. In a complex organism with many differentiated cells, there are many cell phenotypes, but in all these the genotype derived from the fertilized egg is the same (with rare exceptions). What then determines the phenotypes of specialized cells? It is due to all those mechanisms that ensure that a given set of genes will be active in any par-ticular cell type, and that another set will be inactive. These mechanisms are epigenetic, and they determine the epigenotype of that particular cell. Thus, a comple...|$|R
