5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{described}} as being as red as the hibiscus flower or as bright as a million suns. She is usually depicted as red or orange in complexion and sometimes as black. She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> is partially or fully clothed.|$|E
5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind feet for digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud {{on her feet}} that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E

5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15–36 months and males at 4–5 years. Mating may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2–4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.|$|E
25|$|The true {{form of a}} Churel is {{described}} as extremely ugly with saggy breasts, a black tongue, and thick rough lips although <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> {{is reported to have}} no mouth at all. She may have a pot belly, claw-like hands, and scruffy, long pubic hair. They are also described to have pig faces with large fangs or human-like faces with sharp tusks and long, wild hair. She is sometimes described as having a white front and a black back but she invariably has her feet turned backward and <b>sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> roams naked.|$|E

6000|$|... 'May be,' said Pancks. 'I expect so, but don't know. He {{has long}} had money (not overmuch as I make out) in trust to dole out {{to her when she}} can't do without it. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she's</b> proud and won't touch it for a length of time; <b>sometimes</b> <b>she's</b> so poor that she must have it. She writhes under her life. A woman more angry, passionate, reckless, and revengeful never lived. She came for money to-night. Said she had {{peculiar}} occasion for it.' ...|$|R

Legend says that a churel will hold a young man captive until he is elderly, or else uses him sexually until he withers, dies, and joins the spirit. Another tale narrates that a young man who is seduced by the churel and eats the food given to him, returns at dawn to the village, turned into an aged man.|$|E
25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} inside the tube web. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> will die after the spiderlings have hatched, {{and they will}} eat their mother. The spider can be lured to the {{entrance}} by gently touching the triplines with a stick in the evening or at night.|$|E

One pharaoh, Thutmose III, is depicted in his tomb as nursing from a sycamore tree that has a breast.|$|E
25|$|Only {{seventeen}} years old, Victoria had to perform many tedious official duties. Almost every evening, {{she had to}} appear at formal dinners, theatrical performances or public receptions.

25|$|McDuffie {{struggled}} in 1936, while battling stomach ailments that would haunt him {{in later years}} as well. He rebounded in 1937, going 10–4 with a 3.07 ERA, and hurled two victories over Satchel Paige in three matchups. He quickly became a favorite of Effa Manley, who along with his husband Abe Manley was co-owner of the Eagles. She took {{an active role in}} the team, serving as manager and scheduler. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> took too active a role, for instance when she tried to control the antics of McDuffie inside and outside the ballpark.|$|E

6000|$|The mother's {{voice was}} quite calm. [...] "It was not your fault, sir. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she's</b> this way, even when her best friends {{ask her to}} play. That's why I fear she {{will never be able}} to perform in concerts--she is liable to these break-downs." ...|$|R
25|$|After she assimilated many of {{the roles}} of Hathor, Isis's headdress was {{replaced}} with that of Hathor: the horns of a cow on her head, with the solar disk between them, and often with her original throne symbol atop the solar disk. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> also is represented as a cow, or with a cow's head. She is often depicted with her young child, Horus (the pharaoh), with a crown, and a vulture. Occasionally she is represented as a kite flying above the body of Osiris or with the dead Osiris she works her magic {{to bring him back}} to life.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{from a poor}} family, {{at the age of}} nine, Siti had to wake up at 4:00am to {{help her}} mother making and selling various {{homemade}} kuih in her neighbourhood, where <b>sometimes,</b> <b>she</b> also had to carry a makeshift table down three flights of stairs to the main road to set up a small stall. She commented that all the hardships have not only helped her to be more frugal when spending, but also to be more confident when communicating with the public. She also jokingly said that the whole experience has helped to improve her vocal skills as she has to shout to call for customers. Apart from participating in singing competitions, she also used to follow her uncle, Abdul Rahim Bachik to invitational shows like wedding ceremonies and dinner parties which have helped to expose her to performing live.|$|E
25|$|No {{images of}} Ceres survive from her pre-Aventine cults; the {{earliest}} {{date to the}} middle Republic, and show the Hellenising influence of Demeter's iconography. Some late Republican images recall Ceres' search for Proserpina. Ceres bears a torch, sometimes two, and rides in a chariot drawn by snakes; or {{she sits on the}} sacred kiste (chest) that conceals the objects of her mystery rites. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> holds a caduceus, a symbol of Pax (Roman goddess of Peace). Augustan reliefs show her emergence, plant-like from the earth, her arms entwined by snakes, her outstretched hands bearing poppies and wheat, or her head crowned with fruits and vines. In free-standing statuary, she commonly wears a wheat-crown, or holds a wheat spray. Moneyers of the Republican era use Ceres' image, wheat ears and garlands to advertise their connections with prosperity, the annona and the popular interest. Some Imperial coin images depict important female members of the Imperial family as Ceres, or with some of her attributes.|$|E
5000|$|... "Holly became {{this person}} on the record who appears {{in a lot of}} the songs, and at times you love her and at times you hate her. At times she's good to you and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she's</b> bad." [...] Ryan Key in {{discussion}} of the Holly Wood character ...|$|R

25|$|On 10 January 1864, Alexandra {{gave birth}} to a second son and last child, Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia. The {{following}} year, Alexandra became chairwoman {{of the board of trustees}} of the office of Empress Maria Alexandrovna which oversaw orphanages, founding homes, schools and hospitals. The area of medicine and nursing had a particular appeal to Alexandra, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>she</b> nursed the patients herself. In 1865, Alexandra founded a training institute for nurses in St Petersburg, the Pokrov of our lady commune. In spite of the differences in character and outlook, Alexandra and her husband lived in harmony for the first ten years of their married life. Initially, Grand Duke Nicholas respected and admired his wife's interest in charities and medicine as well as her being extremely religious. He financed a hospital in the city where her theories could be developed and put into practice and poor patients received care without charge.|$|E
25|$|Lancelot is Morgan's prime {{object of}} sexual desire but he {{consistently}} refuses her obsessive advances {{due to his}} great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan either courts, drugs, enchants and imprisons the knight on several occasions. One tale has Lancelot captured in Cart Castle (Charyot) by her and two other lustful enchantress, Queen Sebile (Sedile) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan, each of whom wants to make him her lover, but he refuses to choose and escapes with a help {{of one of their}} maidservants, Rocedon. Sebile and Morgan are close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Lancelot's brother Sir Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century Prophesies de Merlin; a resulting contest between them is won by Nimue with a help from Merlin. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored as usual. Morgan's other allies in Prophecies include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> is successful, such as when she sends Lucifer {{in the guise of a}} dragon against Sir Segurant.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
50|$|Elsa La Conti (Eruza Ra Konti) {{enlisted in}} the Western Europe Spirit Sector after losing her entire family to demons. Elsa is usually mild-mannered and straightforward, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>she's</b> also airheaded and too strict on herself. Her Arcana is Koshmar, the Arcana of Punishment, who saved her life when she was mortally injured {{in a fight with}} Clarice.|$|R
60|$|Nelly Bryant {{looked about}} the room wistfully. This {{was the sort of}} room <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> dreamed about. <b>She</b> loved its subdued light and the pulpy {{cushions}} on the sofa.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Cartwright looked pleased. Although she {{was rich}} and <b>sometimes</b> generous, <b>she</b> liked small economies.|$|R
