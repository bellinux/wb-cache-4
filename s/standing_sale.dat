40|$|Roundwood is a {{heterogeneous}} raw material, {{which means that}} different species, qualities and dimensions have different value potential for different end-uses. As a result, the value of bought roundwood raw material {{is dependent on the}} properties of the raw material as well as the selected end-use. These timber assortments are categorised as forest products and the payment is based more or less on timber assortment volumes with the prices negotiated between the seller and the buyer. The optimal pricing mechanism is related to <b>sale</b> type (<b>standing</b> <b>sales,</b> roadside sales or delivered sales) and measurement of raw material, but in general, the optimal pricing mechanism should include the following aspects: It should not restrict value optimization of raw material, it should be transparent and easy to understand and it should offer incentives to grow higher quality raw material. In this paper, five pricing mechanisms for clear-cutting stands were tested: timber assortment pricing, weighted timber assortment pricing, stem pricing, fractional stem pricing and price list pricing. Stem pricing and fractional stem pricing offers freedom to cut stems as wanted and, thus, optimise the raw material according to the existing market demand and the use of these pricing mechanisms in clear-cutting <b>standing</b> <b>sales</b> has advantages. In delivery sales, price list pricing has clear advantages. It gives the seller an indication of what kind of timber is valuable, and if the price list is correct the outcome of bucking should {{meet the needs of the}} buyer...|$|R

40|$|Layout: Anne Siika/MetlaThe {{majority}} of wood procurement in Europe is conducted by forestry contractors. Thus, {{the conditions for}} contractor services vary significantly in diffent regions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe the outsourced operations in wood procurement in Finland and Slovakia. Forest machinery and timber haulage are driven mostly by small enterprises in both countries. However, the contractual relations differ significantly. In Finland, forest industry companies generally buy their timber as <b>standing</b> <b>sales</b> and arrange harvesting and transportation with different contractors. Forest harvesting contractors have been responsible for industrial roundwood harvesting for more than 40 years. The biggest customer groups are large industry companies and state forests. In Slovakia, fundamental changes took place in the forest sector in the early 1990 s. Nowadays, forest owners typically sell wood to their customers and contract separately with contractors. In general, contractors try to offer as complex a range of services as possible (harvesting, silviculture, transportation, etc.). There are major differences in the amount of harvested timber and the structure in private holdings in these countries. Also, the level of mechanisation differs widely. Nearly all felling in Finland is conducted mechanically by harvesters. In Slovakia, most enterprises carry out manual harvesting operations...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the free {{standing}} insert has been intensely used since {{it seems to be}} an alternative media in communicating firms’sales promotion to customers. It is preferred by the manufacturers and by the intermediate firms because communication of this media to consumers is relatively easier and cheaper compared to other advertising tools. In this study, the concepts of "sales promotion, price discount and free standing in- sert" are described and a research is conducted to determine the decision of hyper/su- permarket customers about the free <b>standing</b> insert. <b>Sales</b> Promotion, Monetary Sales Promotion, Price Promotion, Price Discount, Price-Off, Free Standing Insert (FSI). ...|$|R

Even after becoming a public school, the school maintained its prestigious <b>standing.</b> After its <b>sale</b> to the Tel Aviv municipality and after and {{during the first few}} years after the creation of Israel the school continued to operate by David Rachavi at its previous address. The school was than relocated to Shprintsak Street in Tel Aviv. Dr. Joseph Fried replaced Rachavi from 1963 until 1975. In 1976 he was succeeded by David Ben-Zvi until 1980.|$|R
500|$|Upon release, Emotions {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, surprising many critics following {{the success of}} Carey's debut, which spent eleven weeks atop the chart. While selling far less than Mariah Carey, Emotions was eventually certified quadruple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of four million copies throughout the country, with estimated <b>sales</b> <b>standing</b> at 3,595,000 copies. Emotions achieved moderate success outside the United States, peaking within the top ten in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. Its success in Japan was strong, shipping one million copies there. The album has sold 8 million copies worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1970s, Brown Boveri {{struggled}} {{to expand into}} the US market. The company negotiated {{a joint venture with}} Rockwell, the American manufacturer of high-tech military and aerospace applications, but the deal fell through when the two companies could not agree on financial terms. While Brown Boveri counted a handful of major U.S. customers as its clients, among them large utilities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and American Electric Power's Nuclear Plant in south west Michigan DC Cook Unit 2 steam turbine, Brown Boveri's American market share was low considering the company's international <b>standing</b> (North American <b>sales</b> accounted for only 3.5 percent of total sales in 1974 and 1975), and the company continued to search for a means of effectively entering U.S. markets.|$|R

40|$|Active {{since the}} late 1970 s, the group has {{concentrated}} on developing compact and robust separation technology, principally for the offshore oil industry, but more recently, also for the food and process industries. Whilst {{the focus of the}} research has been liquid/liquid separation in hydrocyclones, a variety of other devices have been developed including granular media and electrostatic coalescers and gravitational effect separators. In carrying out this work, a wide range of flowing systems have been quantitatively examined (gas-liquid, solid-liquid and multi-phase) and related process engineering problems, such as fluid borne particle erosion, also studied. The development of the world’s first effective hydrocyclone for removal of contaminant oil from water led to numerous patents and extensive commercialisation with cumulative worldwide <b>sales</b> <b>standing</b> at almost $ 150 M.

2500|$|Following their Greatest Hits Tour, the Sugababes {{returned}} to the recording studio in mid-2007 to work on Change, their fifth studio album, {{and the first to}} feature Berrabah on all tracks. [...] "About You Now" [...] was released as the album's lead single in September 2007. Upon release, the song became the group's sixth UK number one hit and first Hungarian chart-topper. It remained atop the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. [...] "About You Now" [...] was nominated for a 2008 BRIT Award for Best British Single and is to date their highest-selling single, with <b>sales</b> <b>standing</b> at almost 500,000 copies. In the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records, [...] "About You Now" [...] was listed as the [...] "first track by a British pop act to top the singles chart solely on downloads".

60|$|At {{the head}} of the room stood the rostrum, where sat a gentleman with an {{extremely}} charming face. He was engaged in selling by auction so rapidly that the clerk at his side must have had difficulty in keeping a record of the lots and their purchasers. In front of him was a horseshoe table, round which sat buyers. The end of this table was left unoccupied so that the porters might exhibit each lot before it was put up for <b>sale.</b> <b>Standing</b> under the rostrum was yet another table, a small one, upon which were about twenty pots of flowers, even more wonderful than those on the large table. A notice stated that these would be sold at one-thirty precisely. All about the room stood knots of men (such ladies as were present sat at the table), many of whom had lovely orchids in their buttonholes. These, I found out afterwards, were dealers and amateurs. They were a kindly-faced set of people, and I took a liking to them.|$|R

It was during the campaign for Echo Park that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter <b>sales</b> <b>standing</b> at 293,000 as of February 2005. Grant said in a Melody Maker interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that [...] "It's the same with any band. That's just the way the music business is. There is only {{a certain amount of money}} a label will put into a band. I'm just being realistic. We've been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we're putting everything into this record and I'm just hoping that people like it". The album campaign helped the band in August 2001 win the [...] "Best British Live Act" [...] accolade at the Kerrang! awards, before ending the year supporting the Stereophonics, and then releasing the [...] "Just a Day" [...] single in December. In February 2015, [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] gained a silver certification for 200,000 physical sales, digital downloads and streaming points combined. Two years later, [...] "Just a Day" [...] also passed 200,000 sales.|$|R
