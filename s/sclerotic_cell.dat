40|$|Pericarp {{anatomy of}} genus Fagopyrum was {{examined}} {{on the basis}} of 15 species and two subspecies to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} inter-specific phylogenetic relationships within genus. Examined species have a similar mature pericarp structure, but differences among the species were found with respect to whether or not sclerotic cells are present, and what kind of is the <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cell</b> shape in the pericarp. By the comparisons with pericarp anatomical structures, they were classified into three groups. First group is composed of Fagopyrum esculentum, F. esculentum ssp. ancestralis and F homotropicum which have a circular sclerotic cells in all pericarp area. Second group is consisted of F tataricum, F. tataricum ssp. potanini and F cymosum which are differentiated into two zonation, inner zone and outer zone. The cell shape of inner zone is an annular sclerotic cells of multi-layered and that of outer zone is longitudinally elongated sclerotic cells in transverse section. Third group is also composed of F. callianthum, F capillatum, F gilesii, F gracilipes, F leptopodum, F lineare, F. macrocarpum, F pleioramosum, F rubifolium, F statice, and F urophyllum which have one-layered palisade pericarp. The phylogenetic analysis based on pericarp structure and external morphology was considerably consistent with ones proposed by previous authors. It is also suggested that pericarp characters are useful information for deducing phylogenetic relationships within genus Fagopyrum. On the other hand, character evolution {{on the basis of}} morphology including pericarp structures indicated that there are two symplesiomorphies in genus. One is folded cotyledons, the other is lustrous of achene surface. Key words: Fagopyrum, character evolution, pericarp anatomy, phylogeny...|$|E

40|$|Fonsecaea pedrosoi (F. pedrosoi), a major {{agent of}} chromoblastomycosis, {{has been shown}} to be {{recognized}} primarily by C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) in a murine model of chromoblastomycosis. Specifically, the β-glucan receptor, Dectin- 1, mediates Th 17 development and consequent recruitment of neutrophils, and is evidenced to have the capacity to bind to saprophytic hyphae of F. pedrosoi in vitro. However, when embedded in tissue, most etiological agents of chromoblastomycosis including F. pedrosoi will transform into the <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells,</b> which are linked to the greatest survival of melanized fungi in tissue. In this study, using immunocompetent and athymic (nu/nu) murine models infected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with F. pedrosoi, we demonstrated that T lymphocytes play an active role in the resolution of localized footpad infection, and there existed a significantly decreased expression of Th 17 -defining transcription factor Rorγt and inefficient recruitment of neutrophils in chronically infected spleen where the inoculated mycelium of F. pedrosoi transformed into the <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells.</b> We also found that Dectin- 1 -expressing histocytes and neutrophils participated in the enclosure of transformed <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> in the infectious foci. Furthermore, we induced the formation of <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro, and evidenced a significantly decreased binding capacity of human or murine-derived Dectin- 1 to the induced <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> in comparison with the saprophytic mycelial forms.

40|$|Monohexosylceramides (CMHs, or cerebrosides) {{have been}} {{reported}} as membrane and cell wall constituents of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi, presenting remarkable differences in their ceramide moiety compared to mammalian CMHs. Current evidence suggests that CMHs are involved in fungal differentiation and growth and contribute to host immune response. Here we describe a structural diversity between cerebrosides obtained from different forms of the human pathogen Fonsecaea pedrosoi. The major CMH species produced by conidial forms displayed the same structure previously demonstrated by our group for mycelia, an N- 2 ′-hydroxyhexadecanoyl- 1 -β-d-glucopyranosyl- 9 -methyl- 4, 8 -sphingadienine. However, the major cerebroside species purified from <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> carries an additional hydroxyl group, bound to its long-chain base. The structural difference between cerebrosides from mycelial and <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> was apparently not relevant for their antigenicity, since they were both recognized at similar levels by sera from individuals with chromoblastomycosis and a monoclonal antibody to a conserved cerebroside structure. Preincubation of fungal cells with anti-CMH monoclonal antibodies {{had no effect on}} the interaction of F. pedrosoi <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> with murine macrophages. In contrast to what has been described for other fungal species, sclerotic bodies are resistant to the antifungal action of anti-CMH antibodies.

Cell differentiation was evaluated by light and electron microscopy, which showed that treatment of mycelial forms with PAF results in the generation of sclerotic bodies with typical morphological characteristics. Biochemical features of PAF-induced <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> were also analyzed and compared with those from sclerotic forms induced by propranolol, a previously described differentiating agent of E pedrosoi. Chemical analyses of lipid and carbohydrate components from PAF- or propranolol-induced sclerotic bodies revealed that palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids were the major fatty acid components, while glucose, mannose, galactose and rhamnose were detected as the principal sugar constituents in these cells. Surface carbohydrate components of PAF- and propranolol-induced <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> were also evaluated, by flow cytometry analysis with twelve different lectins. the profile of reactivity of PAF- or propranolol-induced fungal cells with lectins was also very similar. Hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate by fungal cells demonstrated that the addition of PAF or propranolol to the mycelial cultures similarly promotes a significant increase in ecto-phosphatase activity. These results indicate that the differentiation of F pedrosoi mycelial cells induced by PAF generates authentic sclerotic forms, as confirmed by the analysis of morphological and biochemical attributes. Since PAF is synthesized in normal conditions by the human host, these observations may have a correlation with the differentiation of E pedrosoi in vivo. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

Sialidase-treated conidia reacted more intensively with peanut agglutinin (PNA), confirming the occurrence of sialyl-galactosyl linkages. Conidial cells agglutinated {{in the presence of}} influenza A and C virus strains, which confirmed the results obtained from lectin-binding experiments and revealed the presence of sialoglycoconjugates bearing 9 -O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu 5, 9 Ac(2)) surface structures. Western blotting analysis with peroxidase-labeled LFA demonstrated the occurrence of sialylglycoproteins in protein extracts from conidia and mycelia, with molecular masses corresponding to 56 and 40 kDa. An additional band of 77 kDa was detected in conidial extracts, suggesting an association between sialic acid expression and morphogenesis. Synthesis of sialic acids was correlated with sialidase expression, since both conidial and mycelial morphological stages presented secreted and cell-associated enzyme activity. Sialoglycoconjugates were not detected in F. pedrosoi <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> from in vitro and in vivo sources, which also do not express sialidase activity. the surface sialyl residues in F. pedrosoi are apparently involved in the fungal interaction with immune effector cells, since sialidase-treated conidia were less resistant to phagocytosis by human neutrophils from healthy individuals. These findings suggest that sialic acid expression in F. pedrosoi varies according to the morphological transition and may protect infecting propagules against immune destruction by host cells.

ABSTRACT: Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic fungal disease witch affects the skin, characterized for slowing development of polymorphic skin, that present infiltrated inflammatory granulomatous {{in the presence}} of <b>sclerotics</b> <b>cells,</b> characteristic of this illness. One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} evaluate the induction of scleroticts cells for natural mediums, with biomasses of Bactris gasipaes and Theobroma grandiflorum, whose respective species had induced in vitro similar <b>sclerotics</b> <b>cells</b> to those found in tissue of patients, in 10 and 2 days, respectively, what it made possible the production of a powder medium inductor, already donated to other groups that study the CBM. Another objective was to evaluate the histopathology of the CBM in the patients, before and during the use of itraconazole (ITZ). For this, the technique of ELISA for the cytokines was used TNF-α, circulating IL- 4 and IL- 10, and the immunohistochemestry of biópsias in different times of treatment - that it allowed to analyze the quantitative and qualitative alterations of the cellular types during 12 months of the treatment with ITZ in the 200 dose of mg/dia - with antibodies anti- CD 20, anti-CD 8 and anti-CD 68. How much the cytokines, the circulating IL- 10 did not show significant change, while IL- 4 and TNF-α had presented an increase of the levels throughout 12 months of treatment. In relation to the immunophenotyping, it had a significant reduction in the inflammatory process and the cellular infiltrated during 3 and 6 months of the treatment, whereas only to the 12 months had the significant regression of the number of <b>sclerotics</b> <b>cells.</b> The immunophenotyping disclosed that the macrophages are mainly located in the areas central areas of granuloma, whereas cells TCD 8 + are in the periphery and cells TCD 20 +, which were found throughout the tissues, with a significant increase after 6 months of the treatment, returning to the initial levels after one year. The cytotoxic macrophages and lymphocytes were having presented a significant increase after 12 months of treatment with ITZ. These results demonstrate that the formation of granuloma in the CBM is similar to those observed in other granulomatous infectious disease, and that the presence of IL- 4 and IL- 10 can be related with the persistence of fungi in the injuries and with the difficulty of cure observed in these patients.

They reacted with <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells</b> from patients' lesions {{as well as with}} sclerotic bodies cultivated in vitro, conidia, mycelia, and digested residues. Treatment of F. pedrosoi with purified antibodies against melanin inhibited fungal growth in vitro. the interaction of F. pedrosoi with phagocytes in the presence of melanin resulted in higher levels of fungal internalization and destruction by host cells, which was accompanied by greater degrees of oxidative burst. Taken together, these results indicate that melanin from F. pedrosoi is an immunologically active fungal structure that activates humoral and cellular responses that could help the control of chromoblastomycosis by host defenses.

40|$|The {{activity}} of a phosphatase was characterized in intact mycelial forms of Fonsecaea pedrosoi, a pathogenic fungus that causes chromoblastomycosis. At pH 5. 5, this fungus hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) to p-nitrophenol (p-NP) {{at a rate}} of 12. 78 +/- 0. 53 nmol p-NP per h per mg hyphal dry weight. the values of V-max and apparent K-m for p-NPP hydrolyses were measured as 17. 89 +/- 0. 92 nmol p-NP per h per mg hyphal dry weight and 1. 57 +/- 0. 26 mmol/l, respectively. This activity was inhibited at increased pH, a finding compatible with an acid phosphatase. the enzymatic activity was strongly inhibited by classical inhibitors of acid phosphatases such as sodium orthovanadate (K-i = 4. 23 mumol/l), sodium molybdate (K-i = 7. 53 mumol/l) and sodium fluoride (K-i = 126. 78 mumol/l) in a dose-dependent manner. Levamizole (1 mmol/l) and sodium tartrate (10 mmol/l), had no effect on the enzyme activity. Cytochemical localization of the acid phosphatase showed electrondense cerium phosphate deposits on the cell wall, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Phosphatase activity in F pedrosoi seems to be associated with parasitism, as <b>sclerotic</b> <b>cells,</b> which are the fungal forms mainly detected in chromoblastomycosis lesions, showed much higher activities than conidia and mycelia did. A strain of F pedrosoi recently isolated from a human case of chromoblastomycosis also showed increased enzyme activity, suggesting that the expression of surface phosphatases may be stimulated by interaction with the host.

40|$|We report herein {{a case of}} chromoblastomycosis {{caused by}} Fonsecaea (F.) pedrosoi in a 39 -year-old male, who showed multiple, asymptomatic, scaly {{erythematous}} plaques on the left shin for 12 months. Histopathologically, chronic granulomatous inflammation and either <b>sclerotic</b> or muriform <b>cells</b> were observed. The fungal culture produced typical black colonies of F. pedrosoi. The DNA sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the clinical sample was 100 % match to that of F. pedrosoi IFM 47061 (GenBank accession number AB 240943). The patient was treated with 200 mg of itraconazole daily, for 3 months. Skin lesions were improved. In Korea, only 9 cases of chromoblastomycosis, including this case, have been reported until now. The etiologic agent was F. pedrosoi {{in the majority of}} cases (6 / 9; 67 %). The incidence of chromoblastomycosis was slightly higher in female, and the upper limbs were more affected than the lower limbs in patients...|$|R
40|$|Lupus profundus (lupus {{erythematosus}} panniculitis) is {{an unusual}} clinical variant of lupus erythematosus (LE) in which the cutaneous inflammatory reaction occurs primarily in the deeper corium. The common clinical features of lupus profundus include asymptomatic, firm, and sharply defined nodules. The histologic findings are characterized by non-specific panniculitis composed of lymphoid cells, plasma cells, and histiocytes {{with varying degrees of}} necrobiotic changes with fibrinoid deposits (1). Subcutaneous dermatofibroma also presents with a depressed large subcutaneous nodule, in which fibrohistiocytic proliferation, storiform arrangement of spindle <b>cells,</b> <b>sclerotic</b> collagen, and interspersed trapping of collagen at the periphery of the lesion were the histopathologic findings (2). We report here a woman who had a hard and depressed gluteal lesion, which was clinically mimicking subcutaneous dermatofibroma, but histopathologically diagnosed as lupus erythematosus panniculitis. Case Report A 43 -year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic with a 2 -month history of a non-tender, hard, plaque-like lesion in her left gluteal region. On inspection, there wa...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Exercise may {{positively}} alter tumour biology through numerous modulatory {{and regulatory}} mechanisms {{in response to}} a variety of modes and dosages, evidenced in preclinical models to date. Specifically, localised and systemic biochemical alterations produced during and following exercise may suppress tumour formation, growth and distribution by virtue of altered epigenetics and endocrine–paracrine activity. Given the impressive ability of targeted mechanical loading to interfere with metastasis-driven tumour formation in human osteolytic tumour cells, it is of equal interest to determine whether a similar effect is observed in <b>sclerotic</b> tumour <b>cells.</b> The study aims to (1) establish the feasibility and safety of a combined modular multimodal exercise programme with spinal isometric training in advanced prostate cancer patients with sclerotic bone metastases and (2) examine whether targeted and supervised exercise can suppress sclerotic tumour growth and activity in spinal metastases in humans. Methods and analysis A single-blinded, two-armed, randomised, controlled and explorative phase I clinical trial combining spinal isometric training with a modular multimodal exercise programme in 40 men with advanced prostate cancer and stable sclerotic spinal metastases. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) the exercise intervention or (2) usual medical care. The intervention arm will receive a 3 -month, supervised and individually tailored modular multimodal exercise programme with spinal isometric training. Primary endpoints (feasibility and safety) and secondary endpoints (tumour morphology; biomarker activity; anthropometry; musculoskeletal health; adiposity; physical function; quality of life; anxiety; distress; fatigue; insomnia; physical activity levels) will be measured at baseline and following the intervention. Statistical analyses will include descriptive characteristics, t-tests, effect sizes and two-way (group × time) repeated-measures analysis of variance (or analysis of covariance) to examine differences between groups over time. The data-set will be primarily examined using an intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputations, followed by a secondary sensitivity analysis to ensure data robustness using a complete cases approach. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of Edith Cowan University and the Sir Charles Gairdner and Osborne Park Health Care Group. If proven to be feasible and safe, this study will form the basis of future phase II and III trials in human patients with advanced cancer. To reach a maximum number of clinicians, practitioners, patients and scientists, outcomes will be disseminated through national and international clinical, conference and patient presentations, as well as publication in high-impact, peer-reviewed academic journals...|$|R
40|$|Intrapulmonary {{lymph nodes}} (IPLNs) are {{located at the}} subpleural area and {{frequently}} simulate malignant tumors radiographically. 1 - 3 The radiographic and pathologic findings of IPLNs have been well documented, but, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, there is only one published description of the cytologic findings of this lesion. 4 Therefore, we wish to report a case of IPLNs as the first case with cytologic photomicrographs. A 56 -year-old female was admitted to our hospital after an examination showed abnormal multiple pulmonary shadows on a chest radiograph. She had no history of smoking. Computed tomography demonstrated two nodules in the right S 4 segment, measuring 7 and 4 mm in diameter (Figure 1). In the left S 9 segment, one nodule measuring 4 mm in diameter was also found. Laboratory data, including such tumor markers as CEA, CA 19 - 9, SCC and CA- 125, were within normal limits. Gallium scintigraphy did not reveal uptake in the nodules. Metastatic carcinoma was clinically suspected, and subsequently two nodules in the right S 4 segment was resected by thoracoscopic surgery. The nodules were black and located in the subpleural area. Imprint preparations were made from a cut surface of the tumors. The smears were fixed in 95 % ethanol before staining with hematoxylin and eosin. The smears revealed large, round cells consistent with histiocytes. The cells were individually scattered or appeared as loose clusters (Figure 2). The nuclei were round to oval. Some nuclei were indented or horseshoe shaped. Nuclear chromatin was finely granular and evenly distributed. Large nucleoli were frequently observed. The cytoplasm was faintly stained and contained varying amounts of black pigment. Polarized light microscopic examination revealed needle-shaped, birefringent crystals consistent with silica (Figure 3). There were a few, small lymphocytes in the background. Histologically, the two nodules were separately present in the subpleural area. The nodules were encapsulated with thin connective tissue and were composed of lymphatic sinus, macrophages bearing anthracotic pigment and small lymphocytes (Figure 4). Needle-shaped, birefringent crystals consistent with silica and silicates were present both intracellularly and extracellularly. In 1985, Kradin et al first reported the cytologic finding of intrapulmonary lymph nodes. 4 According to their description and our experience, the cytologic features of intrapulmonary lymph nodes seem to be the presence of dust-laden histiocytes, small lymphocytes and needle-shaped, birefringent crystals. The differences from lymphocytes seen in conventional lymph nodes is the infrequency of lymphocytes and the absence of large lymphocytes derived from germinal center. At present, a definitive diagnosis of IPLNs may be performed histologically. However, we think it is possible to cytologically diagnose the lesion in connection with clinical information. In our case, the smears imprinted from the cut surface of the IPLNs revealed adequate material for diagnosis. When IPLNs are a very small lesion or contain calcified and <b>sclerotic</b> areas, few <b>cells</b> can be removed from the lesions. In such conditions we recommend a scrape method using a surgical knife. To cytologically make a diagnosis of IPLNs, it is important to be aware of this diagnostic entity, which should be included in the differential diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary small nodules...|$|R
