The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E
5|$|Across the Western Caribbean, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, causing some minor damage. In Florida, a moderate storm tide caused coastal damage and flooding, while Alberto's outer rainbands produced several tornadoes. The storm was indirectly responsible for two drownings {{off the coast}} of Tampa Bay. In North Carolina, heavy rainfall caused locally severe flooding, and one child drowned in a flooded <b>storm</b> <b>drain</b> near Raleigh. The remnants of Alberto produced strong winds and left four people missing in Atlantic Canada. Overall, damage was minor along Alberto's path.|$|E

50|$|Most drains have {{a single}} large exit at their point of {{discharge}} (often covered by a grating) into a canal, river, lake, reservoir, sea or ocean. Other than catchbasins, typically there are no treatment facilities in the piping system. Small <b>storm</b> <b>drains</b> may discharge into individual dry wells. <b>Storm</b> <b>drains</b> may be interconnected using slotted pipe, to make a larger dry well system. <b>Storm</b> <b>drains</b> may discharge into man-made excavations known as recharge basins or retention ponds.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo make {{decisions}} about correcting illicit or inappropriate connections to <b>storm</b> <b>drains,</b> quantification of non-stormwater entries into <b>storm</b> <b>drains</b> was performed using a water flow balance approach, based on data analysis from 2008 to 2011 in a separate storm drainage system in a Shanghai downtown area of 374 ha. The study revealed severe sewage connections to storm drains; meanwhile, misconnections between surface water and <b>storm</b> <b>drains</b> were found to drive frequent non-stormwater pumping discharges at the outfall, producing a much larger volume of outfall flows in a short period. This paper presented a methodology to estimate quantities of inappropriate sewage flow, groundwater infiltration and river water backflow into the <b>storm</b> <b>drains.</b> It was concluded that inappropriate sewage discharge and groundwater seepage into <b>storm</b> <b>drains</b> were approximately 17, 860 m 3 /d (i. e., up to 51 % of the total sewage flow in the catchment) and 3624 m 3 /d, respectively, and surface water backflow was up to an average 28, 593 m 3 /d. On {{the basis of this}} work, end-of-storm pipe interceptor sewers of 0. 25 m 3 /s (i. e., 21, 600 m 3 /d) would be effective to tackle the problem of sewage connections and groundwater seepage to <b>storm</b> <b>drains.</b> Under this circumstance, the follow-up non-stormwater outfall pumping events indicate misconnections between surface water and <b>storm</b> <b>drains,</b> featuring pumping discharge equivalent to surface water backflow; hence the misconnections should be repaired. The information provided here is helpful in estimating the magnitude of non-stormwater flow entries into <b>storm</b> <b>drains</b> and designing the necessary pollution control activities, as well as combating city floods in storm events...|$|R

On Guam, the United States Navy ordered the release of ships from the local harbor. There, peaked at 251mm (9.90in) over a 24-hour period at Piti. At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, a gauge observed 100mm (3.95in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at a measured 105km/h (66mph) on September4. The winds caused power outage in localized areas and downed two telephone poles. Severe flooding occurred in Merizo after a <b>storm</b> <b>drain</b> became clogged with debris, inundating six houses.|$|E
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large <b>storm</b> <b>drain</b> outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E

When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a <b>storm</b> <b>drain,</b> the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E

Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a <b>storm</b> <b>drain</b> overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing it in half.

5|$|On 19January Rewa {{started to}} affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However {{it did not}} make its {{predicted}} landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100km (60mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore {{the brunt of the}} wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144mm (5.7in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a <b>storm</b> <b>drain.</b> Within Brisbane, 100homes and 20cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after the Gabba resembled a small lake.|$|E
25|$|If a water {{absorbing}} swale {{for each}} yard {{is combined with}} permeable concrete streets, <b>storm</b> <b>drains</b> can be omitted from the neighbourhood.
