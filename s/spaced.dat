5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of settlements within the Rhondda during the Norman period.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a phenomenological formalism {{in which the}} <b>space</b> structure is treated in terms of attachment <b>space</b> and detachment <b>space.</b> Attachment <b>space</b> attaches to an object, while detachment <b>space</b> detaches from the object. The combination of these <b>spaces</b> results in three quantum <b>space</b> phases: binary partition <b>space,</b> miscible <b>space</b> and binary lattice <b>space.</b> Binary lattice <b>space</b> consists of repetitive units of alternative attachment <b>space</b> and detachment <b>space.</b> In miscible <b>space,</b> attachment <b>space</b> is miscible to detachment <b>space,</b> {{and there is no}} separation between attachment <b>space</b> and detachment <b>spaces.</b> In binary partition <b>space,</b> detachment <b>space</b> and attachment <b>space</b> are in two separat continuous regions. The transition from wavefunction to the collapse of wavefuction under interference becomes the quantum <b>space</b> phase transition from binary lattice <b>space</b> to miscible <b>space.</b> At extremely conditions, the gauge boson force field undergoes a quantum <b>space</b> phase transition to a "hedge boson force field", consisting of a "vacuum" core surrounded by a hedge boson shell, like a bubble with boundary...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely <b>spaced</b> levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely <b>spaced</b> levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E

5|$|Typically for a stegosaur, Kentrosaurus had {{extensive}} osteoderm (bony {{structures in the}} skin) covering, including small plates (probably located on the neck and anterior trunk), and spikes of various shapes. The spikes of Kentrosaurus are very elongated, with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres. The plates have a thickened section in the middle, {{as if they were}} modified spines. The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn. Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains. Thus, the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain. A pair of closely <b>spaced</b> spikes was found articulated with a tail tip, and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly <b>spaced</b> in pairs along the path of an articulated tail.|$|E

Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
