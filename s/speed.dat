5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} high <b>speed</b> or full <b>speed</b> and low <b>speed</b> devices, it will {{by default}} disable communication to low <b>speed</b> device unless requested to switch to low <b>speed</b> mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all low <b>speed</b> devices, to allow the host to send a single low <b>speed</b> packet to low <b>speed</b> devices. After the low <b>speed</b> packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to low <b>speed</b> devices again.|$|E
5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other <b>speed</b> device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed <b>speed</b> environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low <b>speed</b> will misinterpret a high or full <b>speed</b> signal from the host.|$|E

30|$|Next, we {{examined}} the association between self-reporting on <b>speeding</b> in the survey and the objective measures acquired using Get Location, calculated for the sample as a whole. Using a Pearson Correlation Test, we found a statistically significant correlation between the reported tendency to engage in violations and {{the actual number of}} violations recorded (r[*]=[*] 0.294, p[*]=[*] 0.027). In other words, drivers who committed more <b>speeding</b> violations {{were also more likely to}} report more violations. We also found a positive and significant correlation between the magnitude of the sum required for a fine to deter drivers from <b>speeding</b> and the distance driven while <b>speeding</b> (r[*]=[*] 0.415; p[*]=[*] 0.001). In other words, drivers who cover more distance while <b>speeding</b> are more likely to require a higher fine to deter them from <b>speeding.</b> However, we did not find the same correlation between the distance driven while <b>speeding</b> and the magnitude of the reward necessary to deter one from <b>speeding.</b> We found no significant correlations between self-reported frequency of <b>speeding</b> and the distance covered while <b>speeding</b> or between the duration of <b>speeding</b> and the perceived level of risk.|$|R

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's <b>speed</b> {{approaches}} the <b>speed</b> of light, from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The <b>speed</b> of an electron can approach, but never reach, the <b>speed</b> of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a <b>speed</b> close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local <b>speed</b> of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform <b>speed</b> around the Sun. The actual <b>speed</b> with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so the <b>speed</b> with which the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital <b>speed</b> accounts {{for part of the}} equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top <b>speed</b> of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The <b>speed</b> of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical top <b>speed,</b> resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and <b>speed.</b> The equation can calculate the top <b>speed</b> of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E

5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top <b>speed</b> and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum <b>speed</b> would have been about , {{which is about the}} <b>speed</b> of a human sprinter.

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact <b>speed</b> of light, c in vacuum. Its <b>speed</b> would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called <b>speed</b> of light, c, would then not be the actual <b>speed</b> at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on <b>speed</b> that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the <b>speed</b> of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the <b>speed</b> of photons.|$|E

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no <b>speed</b> of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite <b>speed,</b> and that the <b>speed</b> of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite <b>speed,</b> and observed that the <b>speed</b> of light is much faster than the <b>speed</b> of sound.|$|E

5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the <b>speed</b> of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the <b>speed</b> of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the <b>speed</b> of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the <b>speed</b> of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the <b>speed</b> of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} the <b>speed</b> of light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source {{was interrupted by}} a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable <b>speed</b> of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation <b>speed</b> of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational <b>speed</b> of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for the <b>speed</b> of light. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's <b>speed</b> was about 5% too high.
