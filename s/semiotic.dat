5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the <b>semiotic</b> understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E

These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.|$|E

25|$|Biosemiotics is a {{relatively}} new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic assumption is that Homo sapiens is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence <b>semiotic</b> principles must apply also in the animal world.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, {{at its most}} basic level, can change the way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its <b>semiotic</b> effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered in conjunction with a secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their <b>semiotic</b> connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E

50|$|Semiosis or semeiosis is {{the process}} that forms meaning from any organism's {{apprehension}} of the world through signs. Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of <b>semiotics</b> include C. S. Peirce, John Deely, and Umberto Eco. Cognitive <b>semiotics</b> is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in <b>semiotics</b> and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices. The research on cognitive <b>semiotics</b> brings together <b>semiotics</b> from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.|$|R
25|$|Thought is {{a mental}} act that allows humans {{to make sense}} of things in the world, and to {{represent}} and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or <b>semiotic</b> mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{iconography}} {{which seeks to}} identify meaning, semiotics is concerned with how meaning is created. Roland Barthes’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of denoted meaning—the recognition of a visual sign, and the connoted meaning—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the <b>semiotic</b> art historian is {{to come up with}} ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.|$|E
25|$|A {{medium is}} the {{substance}} in which meaning is realized and through which it becomes available to others. Mediums include video, image, text, audio, etc. Socially, medium includes <b>semiotic,</b> sociocultural, and technological {{practices such as}} film, newspaper, a billboard, radio, television, theater, a classroom, etc. Multimodality makes use of the electronic medium by creating digital modes with the interlacing of image, writing, layout, speech, and video. Mediums have become modes of delivery that take the current and future contexts into consideration.|$|E

50|$|Per Aage Brandt {{founded a}} Center for <b>Semiotics</b> in 1995 at Aarhus University and {{subsequently}} a Master Education in Cognitive <b>Semiotics,</b> {{to investigate the}} connections between <b>semiotics</b> and cognitive science (with a strong focus on cognitive linguistics), and he has had several followers along this line such as Line Brandt (Center for <b>Semiotics</b> at Aarhus University), and Todd Oakley (Case Western Reserve University). The Center for <b>Semiotics</b> is currently constituted by Frederik Stjernfelt, Peer Bundgaard, Mikkel Wallentin, Svend Østergaard, Riccardo Fusaroli and Kristian Tylén. Bundgaard published an anthology in Danish which brings together texts from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, and <b>semiotics.</b> Stjernfelt has combined the inspiration from Peirce with that from Husserl. Wallentin is conducting neuro-imaging investigations. Tylén and Fusaroli develop behavioral and neuroscientific experimental approaches to sign usage and linguistic conversations.|$|R
25|$|The {{question}} of whether such symbols are writing, primitive or proto-writing, or merely non-writing symbols or signs for other purposes such as identification is a highly controversial one, and the debate still continues today. Proponents of the view that they are early Chinese writing tend to see evidence in comparisons of individual signs with individual oracle bone script characters. Others believe that Neolithic signs {{are part of an}} incipient <b>semiotic</b> system that eventually {{led to the development of}} mature Chinese writing.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Gee {{also argues}} that reading and writing {{should be viewed as}} more than just “mental achievements” {{happening}} inside people’s minds; they should also be seen as “social and cultural practices with economic, historical, and political implications”. So, in Gee’s view, literacies are not only multiple but are inherently connected to social practices. In order to expand the traditional view of literacy as print literacy, Gee recommends that we think first of literacy in terms of <b>semiotic</b> domains. By this, he means “any set of practices that recruits one or more modalities (e.g., oral or written language, images, equations, symbols, sounds, gestures, graphs, artifacts, etc.) to communicate distinctive types of meanings”. There is a seemingly endless and varied range of <b>semiotic</b> domains, including (but certainly not limited to) cellular biology, first-person-shooter video games, rap music, or modernist painting. Most pundits would describe this conception of literacies as a key element in {{what has come to be}} known as the New Literacy Studies. In short, this theoretical and methodological orientation emphasizes studying language-in-use and literacies within their contexts of social practice. It includes work by colleagues such as Brian Street, Gunther Kress, David Barton, Mary Hamilton, Courtney Cazden, Ron Scollon, and Suzie Scollon, among others.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{criticism}} is rejected by {{supporters of the}} social constructivist perspective because it misses {{the point that the}} very objects of mathematics are social constructs. These objects, it asserts, are primarily <b>semiotic</b> objects existing in the sphere of human culture, sustained by social practices (after Wittgenstein) that utilize physically embodied signs and give rise to intrapersonal (mental) constructs. Social constructivists view the reification of the sphere of human culture into a Platonic realm, or some other heaven-like domain of existence beyond the physical world, a long-standing category error.|$|E
50|$|Eco {{founded and}} {{developed}} {{one of the}} most important approaches in contemporary <b>semiotics,</b> usually referred to as interpretative <b>semiotics.</b> The main books in which he elaborates his theory are La struttura assente (1968; literally: The Absent Structure), A Theory of <b>Semiotics</b> (1975), The Role of the Reader (1979), <b>Semiotics</b> and Philosophy of Language (1984), The Limits of Interpretation (1990), Kant and the Platypus (1997), and From the Tree to the Labyrinth: Historical Studies on the Sign and Interpretation (2014).|$|R
