2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), <b>sanicle</b> (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E
50|$|Sanicula europaea (<b>sanicle,</b> wood <b>sanicle)</b> is a {{perennial}} plant {{of the family}} Apiaceae.|$|E
50|$|Sanicula laciniata is a {{flowering}} plant species {{of in the}} family Apiaceae. Common names include coastal blacksnakeroot, laceleaf <b>sanicle,</b> and coast <b>sanicle.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{plant has}} a short, thick stem growing {{up to about}} 36 centimeters in maximum height. The leaves have {{leathery}} blades measuring up to 8 centimeters long. They are heart-shaped or kidney-shaped and are divided into several large lobes. The inflorescence is a cluster of flowers {{at the top of}} the stem. Each cluster has up to three bisexual flowers and up to seven male flowers with nonfunctioning female parts. The flowers have purple petals, making it easy to identify among the <b>sanicles</b> present in Hawaii.|$|R
40|$|Results from phylogenetic {{analysis}} of nuclear rDNA {{internal transcribed spacer}} (ITS) sequences from a worldwide sample of Sanicula indicate that Hawaiian <b>sanicles</b> (Sanicula sect. Sandwicenses) constitute a monophyletic group that descended from a western North American ancestor in Sanicula sect. Sanicoria, a paraphyletic assemblage of mostly Californian species. A monophyletic group comprising representatives of all 15 species of S. sect. Sanicoria and the three sampled species of S. sect. Sandwicenses was resolved in all maximally parsimonious trees, rooted with sequences from species of Astrantia and Eryngium. All sequences sampled from eastern North American, European, and Asian species of Sanicula fell outside the ITS clade comprising S. sect. Sanicoria and S. sect. Sandwicenses. A lineage comprising the Hawaiian taxa and three species endemic to coastal or near-coastal habitats in western North America (Sanicula arctopoides, Sanicula arguta, and Sanicula laciniata) is diagnosed by nucleotide substitutions and a 24 -bp deletion in ITS 2. The hooked fruits in Sanicula lead us {{to conclude that the}} ancestor of Hawaiian <b>sanicles</b> arrived from North America by external bird dispersal; similar transport has been hypothesized for the North American tarweed ancestor of the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Asteraceae). Two additional long-distance dispersal events involving members of S. sect. Sanicoria can be concluded from the ITS phylogeny: dispersal of Sanicula crassicaulis and Sanicula graveolens from western North America to southern South America...|$|R
5|$|The woods {{surrounding}} the castle, {{known as the}} Taff Gorge complex, {{are among the most}} westerly natural beech woodlands in the British Isles. They contain dog's mercury, ransoms, <b>sanicles,</b> bird's-nest orchid, greater butterfly-orchid and yellow bird's nest plants. The area has unusual rock outcrops, which show the point where Devonian Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone beds meet; the Castell Coch Quarry is in the vicinity. To the southeast of the castle, a nine-hole golf course occupies the site of the former vineyard. The area is protected as the Castell Coch Woodlands and Road Section Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{recognizable}} as {{a relative of}} the carrots and parsnips with its thin stalk topped with small umbels of yellow or cream flowers. The origin of its poisonous reputation is unknown. [...] Yet despite the name, there are no current records of its toxicity in humans, though it or a related species might be toxic to horses or other stock animals. [...] It was called wene by the Miwok and used to treat venomous bites from snakes, perhaps providing {{a reason for the}} common name in English. Though they used other <b>sanicles</b> in the same manner. [...] The Karuk called the plant ikxash and traditionally ate the young leaves as a green, indicating the toxic reputation is undeserved.|$|R
