The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer.

Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} field <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to}} be {{frequently}} associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
5|$|In early February 1986 {{ten inches}} (254mm) of rain {{fell on the}} Sacramento region in 11 days, melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack and causing a huge flood to pour down the American River. The 1986 floods {{were some of the}} most severe {{recorded}} in the 20th century; Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging streams and rivers incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. The rating for Sacramento's levees, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was dropped to a 78-year flood in <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> after the 1986 event, which suggested that such weather occurred more frequently than previously believed. The floods tore out levees along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers through the Sacramento Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake filled to dangerously high levels with runoff from the North, Middle and South Forks of the American River.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>conducted</b> off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly {{sensitive}} to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>conducted</b> {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked {{population}} called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|The first metagenomic <b>studies</b> <b>conducted</b> using {{high-throughput}} sequencing used {{massively parallel}} 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E
