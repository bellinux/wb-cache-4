50|$|The Square, {{which is}} in fact triangular, was {{designed}} by Architects Allies and Morrison and is surrounded by new developments on three sides and the redeveloped Peace Gardens on the remaining side. The surface of the square {{is made up of}} a <b>suspended</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> covered with granite and sandstone paving. The surface is covered with hundreds of LED lights which are used to illuminate both square itself and the steel water features throughout it.The square is intended to form a link between the Winter and Peace Gardens and also the St Paul’s Place development, which is home to Sheffield’s tallest building. The square is surrounded in all sides by new or renovated structures, with the Peace Gardens and Town Hall {{on one side and a}} multitude of new buildings on the three remaining sides.|$|E

The retail building to the south is sited at a right angle to the larger restaurant building beyond. Both have concrete-tiled, hipped roofs with gablets infilled with glazing at each end. Both are two-storeyed and have deep overhangs and verandahs {{on the eastern side}} with the restaurant building's verandah returning on the northern side. The upper floors are <b>suspended</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> and steel portal frames support the roof.|$|R
2500|$|The {{steel columns}} of the OPT are tapered and curve upwards to join steel beams, welded with steel web {{stiffeners}} {{and holding the}} <b>suspended</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> for the main passenger terminal level. The architect, Lawrence Neild has himself described the expression of structure as [...] "an architectural metamorphosis that uncovered the rugged plate web steel structure and added a round tower framed with rolled I-beams and channels. The steel feels heavy and immovable against the floating ships." [...] This primary steel structure is set back from the water's edge, providing for the large cantilevered extendable gangways between the building and ship main decks {{as well as providing}} logistical and transportation access along the waterfront. In the original 1988 project, twin splayed escalators, which have since been demolished, were located at the southern end and made the circulation pattern comprehensible, providing a generous entrance area adjacent to Cadmans Cottage.|$|R

50|$|A dog-leg timber stair at {{the rear}} of the Station connects to {{entrance}} to the residential accommodation for the station superintendent above which contains three bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom and hall. A laundry, on a <b>suspended</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> supported by concrete piers, is off the landing of the dog-leg stair. The laundry was not able to be unlocked. The entrance to the residence opens off a small sheltered porch at the top of the stair through an arched doorway into a central hall. The smaller bedrooms and bathroom are through an arched opening to the west of the hall and the kitchen and living room open to the east and south of the hall. The cupboard to the east of the hall that housed the fireman's pole is now used for storage. The kitchen no longer functions as a kitchen but cupboards to the west and an arched recess and broom cupboard to the south remain. The bedroom to the northwest and the bathroom have been converted to toilets. The living room has an arched recess and opens to an enclosed verandah to the southeast. The wall separating bedrooms one and two has been removed. All rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted and battened ceilings. The battening to the ceiling in bedroom one forms a lozenge-like pattern.|$|E
40|$|Crack {{prevention}} {{is often a}} critical parameter {{in the design and}} construction of ground and <b>suspended</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs.</b> Often when the degree of restraint is high, uncontrolled cracking can influence the serviceability of a structure. Designers often use the specification of maximum values for standard 56 -day drying shrinkage tests as determined by Australian Standard AS 1012. 13 in an attempt to control cracking of concrete pavements. Previous research has shown that the development of tensile stresses, and hence the increased risk of crack formation and propagation, is linked to events that take place in the first four to six hours after placement. Other work has shown that the results from the AS 1012. 13 drying shrinkage test can be more variable than those for compressive strength data. In this paper, the results from an experimental program involving the construction and instrumentation of five <b>slabs,</b> made using <b>concrete</b> with nominal 56 -day drying standard shrinkage strains ranging from 450 microstrain to 800 microstrain, are reported. The aim was to investigate the relationship between early age shrinkage, which is not measured in the standard drying shrinkage test, standard 56 -day drying shrinkage strain values and actual strains in slabs...|$|R

40|$|Serviceability {{failure in}} {{buildings}} can occur when actual deflection exceeds an allowable deflection limit {{as a result}} of flexure. Excessive deflections may cause many serviceability problems {{to other parts of the}} building such as aesthetic, functional and structural problems. Over the past several years, numerous cases have been reported, in Australia and elsewhere, of flexural elements for which the calculated deflection is far less than the actual deflection. Hence, the primary objectives of this research are to develop an analytical model to evaluate the time-dependent deflections in post-tensioned <b>concrete</b> <b>suspended</b> <b>slabs</b> and validate this model by using real-life measurements of long-term slab deformations. For this purpose actual deflections of slabs and beams of a multi-level office building under construction are being measured. The building is a 11 -storey office building with post-tensioned one way-spanning slabs and band beams. This paper presents a comparison between measured on site deflections of slabs and beams during construction with calculated deflections using the simplified method given in AS 3600...|$|R

Through flexural test, the deformation process and failure mode of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with GFRP bars and steel bars are examined, respectively. The deflection, cracking load, ultimate load and concrete strain are compared between two kinds of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs.</b> From the test results, it is clarified that the moment-deflection curve of GFRP reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> {{can be divided into}} two stages. Before concrete cracks the behaviors of two kinds of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> are almost the same. However, the deflection of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with GFRP bars increases much faster after cracking and the stress-strain diagram is linear up to rupture with no discernible yield point. The ultimate load of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with GFRP bars is 1. 2 times of that of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with steel bars. Based on the test results, finite element analysis is performed in order to study the influence of reinforcement ratio.

40|$|Concrete is a {{material}} that is good in compression but weak in tension. Enhancing the tensile properties of concrete will lead to its greater application in construction.
