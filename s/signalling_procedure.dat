40|$|We {{develop an}} {{empirical}} approximation to the null steady-state {{distribution of the}} cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, defined as the distribution of values obtained by running a CUSUM with no upper boundary under the null state for an indefinite period of time. The derivation is part theoretical and part empirical and the approximation is valid for CUSUMs applied to Normal data with known variance (although the theoretical result is true in general for exponential family data, which we show in the Ap-pendix). The result leads to an easily-applied formula for steady-state p-values corresponding to CUSUM values, where the steady-state p-value is obtained as the tail area of the null steady-state distribution and represents the expected proportion of time, under repeated application of the CUSUM to null data, that the CUSUM statistic is greater than some particular value. When designing individual charts with fixed boundaries, this measure could be used alongside the average run-length (ARL) value, which we show by way of examples may be approximately related to the steady-state p-value. For multiple CUSUM schemes, use of a p-value enables application of a <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure</b> that adopts a false discovery rate (FDR) approach to multiplicity control.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the design of}} a radio resource control (RRC) protocol in the framework of long-term evolution (LTE) of the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project regarding provision of low cost/complexity and low energy consumption machine-type communication (MTC), which is an enabling technology for the emerging paradigm of the Internet of Things.

This paper elaborates the state-of-the-art approaches toward addressing the challenge in relation to the low energy consumption operation of MTC devices, and proposes a novel RRC protocol design, namely, semi-persistent RRC state transition (SPRST), where the RRC state transition is no longer triggered by incoming traffic but depends on pre-determined parameters based on the traffic pattern obtained by exploiting the network memory. The proposed RRC protocol can easily co-exist with the legacy RRC protocol in the LTE. The design criterion of SPRST is derived and the <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure</b> is investigated accordingly.

30|$|Geo-routing {{protocols}} usually {{operate in}} one of two modes: greedy forwarding [1] or face routing [7]. Under the former, a node chooses as forwarder, the neighbour with the shortest distance to the sink as long as such neighbour can be identified. However, in the case that a local minimum is reached, that is to say, if no neighbour is closer to the sink than the current node, the routing protocol should change its operating mode. This situation arises {{in the presence of a}} hole in the network, i.e. a large area not covered by nodes. In this case, a face routing mechanism must be initiated whose main task is to forward the packet along the boundary of the hole. However, it requires the network subgraph be planar, since intersecting links may cause a routing loop. In the presence of intersecting links, some planarization process must be done prior to forwarding the data. Such process consists on disabling some links in order to avoid routing loops. The planarization process can be performed following one of two approaches, beacon and beaconless planarization. The former requires that the current node gets to know the overall neighbourhood topology by exchanging beacon packets with its neighbours. Since this may be an intensive <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure</b> in terms of energy consumption and communication overhead, the latter approach avoids exchanging full knowledge and tries to construct a local planar subgraph by exchanging a limited number of control messages during the routing process.|$|E

In general, RRC connection establishment for LTE and NB-IoT are relatively simple. RRC connection establishment is a 3 -way handshake between UE and eNodeB, which is used to make the transition of UE from RRC Idle mode to RRC Connected mode. UE must make the transition to RRC Connected mode before transferring any application data, or completing any signalling procedures. RRC connection establishment procedure has mainly 3 steps. RRC connection request message sent by UE, RRC connection setup sent by enodeB, RRC setup complete messages send by UE. The RRC connection establishment procedure is always initiated by the UE but can be triggered by either the UE or the network. For example, the UE triggers RRC connection establishment if the end-user starts an application to browse the internet, or to send an email. Similarly, the UE triggers RRC connection establishment if the UE moves into a new Tracking Area and has to complete the Tracking Area Update <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The network triggers the RRC connection establishment procedure by sending a Paging message. This could be used to allow the delivery of an incoming SMS or notification of an incoming voice call.

30|$|Xap is a seed-borne {{pathogen}} with an epiphytic symptomless {{population and}} is able to go through a long epiphytic phase on bean plants (Beattie and Lindow 1995). In general, the epiphytic population of Xap in the field has two major parts; solitary cells (potentially planktonic) and biofilms. Using ERIC fingerprinting, it has been shown for Xap that strains in the two fractions of the population are genetically identical (Jacques et al. 2005). A similar result has been demonstrated for strains of plant-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens (Boureau et al. 2004). Biofilms which are present on the surfaces of leaves are similar to those in aquatic ecosystems and hospital environments and they include a large aggregation of bacterial cells embedded in polymeric materials like extracellular polysaccharides. Comprehensive reviews on biofilm formation by plant-associated bacteria were published by Danhorn and Fuqua (2007) and Morris and Monier (2003). Among the bacteria which can form biofilms, one which is closest to Xap, is X. campestris pv. campestris {{in which there is a}} cell to cell <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure.</b> This system is coded by rpf genes cluster, which were previously known as an important cluster in the pathogenicity of bacterium (Crossman and Dow 2004).

Instead of AHL, butyrolactones may act as signal molecules in quorum-sensing-like systems in Xanthomonas (von Bodman et al. 2003; Jacques et al. 2005). Regarding Xap, AHL has not been found in the bacterium population; however, butyrolactones have been confirmed to have a role in biofilm formation (Jacques et al. 2005).|$|E

40|$|The use of {{satellites}} for {{mobile communication}} applications {{has become a}} global issue. The use of handheld, vehicle mounted and transportable terminals is a key feature of Satellite Personal Communication Networks (S-PCNs). Due to the higher eirp requirements on the Earths surface and also because of their inherent delay, geostationary (GEO) satellites are not considered suitable for such applications. Instead, constellations of satellites at lower altitudes have been proposed for use in what are termed 2 nd generation mobile satellite communication systems. Low intensity regions in the Earths surrounding trapped radiation bands, have resulted in two altitude bands of specific interest, resulting in two constellation types - LEO (Low Earth Orbit) constellations at around 1, 000 km and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) constellations at around 10, 000 km. A satellite constellation consists {{of a number of}} satellites orbiting at the same altitude and inclination and phased in a specific way. The work reported in this thesis proposes a network control architecture for LEO or MEO based S-PCN systems. Air-interface signalling aspects are then considered for mobility management and call setup signalling. LEO and MEO constellation design aspects and properties are initially considered. Important implications on the control network are drawn based on constellation coverage and connectivity properties. Other system constraints such as terrestrial network interworking considerations as well as user, network operator and regulator requirements are also considered. Finally network and more specifically satellite control signalling is examined before a S-PCN architecture is proposed. The reference architecture results in constellation control being distributed globally with individual satellite control, at any one time, being located at a specific earth station. The use of two earth station types allows network administration to be separated from traffic channel carrying aspects. In order to reduce system setup cost and delay, the reuse of network related standards from the GSM terrestrial mobile communication system is envisaged. An equivalence is made between the S-PCN architecture and the GSMs terrestrial architecture. Network implementation aspects are considered for a 14 satellite MEO constellation. Network implications resulting from the use of LEO and MEO constellations are considered. After an examination of S-PCN traffic demand on a MEO constellation, mobility management signalling is considered. A new approach is proposed based on the use of a positioning system. The performance of this approach is examined from a system signalling viewpoint for both LEO and MEO constellations and a method to minimise the required amount of signalling is described. The air interface <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure</b> for location update, based on a modified GSM network layer protocol, is simulated from a delay point of view for both LEO and MEO constellations. User-originated, user-terminated and user-to-user call setup signalling were also simulated and their delay performance examined. The importance of random access channel delay and of user cooperation with the link were highlighted as aspects which have a significant influence on the average signalling delay. Finally, the effect of common and dedicated control channel system signalling on satellite power consumption, based on busy hour call setup and mobility management signalling estimates, was examined for a MEO constellation. From this, conclusions can be made on the signalling power efficiency of S-PCN systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{cooperative}} {{medium access control}} (MAC) schemes are designed {{for the sake of}} improving the achievable transmit rate and for reducing the transmit energy dissipation of cooperative communication systems relying on realistic greedy - rather than altruistic - relay nodes (RNs). Based on the system’s objective functions (OF), novel distributed relay selection schemes are developed for selecting the best relay node (RN) set. In order to investigate the effect of the proposed MAC schemes on the performance of the cooperative communication systems considered, the system’s stability is analysed with the aid of queueing theory. Specifically, we first consider a cooperative spectrum leasing system (CSLS) supporting a licensed source node (SN) and a licensed destination node (DN) as well as multiple unlicensed greedy RNs, which require rewards for providing cooperative transmission assistance. A ’win-win’ (WW) cooperative framework (WWCF) is formulated for sake of improving the achievable transmit rate and for simulanteously minimizing the energy dissipation of the co- operative spectrum leasing system considered. Based on the proposed WWCF, the licensed SN intends to lease part of its spectrum to the unlicensed RNs in exchange for cooperative support, leading to an improved transmit rate, while simultaneously reducing the transmit power. The unlicensed RNs also have an incentive to provide cooperative transmission assistance for the SN, since in exchange for relaying assistance they are allowed to access the licensed spectrum for transmitting their own data, and even to maintain their own target Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, a distributed WW cooperative MAC protocol is developed for implementing the proposed WWCF by designing a specific <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure</b> and the format of both the data frame control messages as well as a distributed relay selection scheme. More explicitly, a novel backoff algorithm is designed for distributively selecting the best RN in order to optimize the system’s OF formulated by our WWCF. Our simulation results demonstrated that both substantial rate improvements and considerable energy savings are achieved by implementing the proposed distributed WW cooperative MAC protocol. However, encountering a low service rate at the MAC layer may excessively increase the length of queue in the buffer storing the incoming packet. Hence, the queueing system may become unstable due to the low service rate limited by an inferior MAC protocol design. Hence we conceived a queueing model for our cooperative spectrum leasing system relying on the proposed distributed WW cooperative MAC protocol. In order to simplify the stability analysis, some idealized simplifying assumptions are invoked and a non-Markovian analysis method is used for investigating the transmission probability of each node and for deriving the average departure rates at both the SN and the RNs operating {{under the control of the}} proposed distributed WW cooperative MAC protocol. Our simulation results confirmed that an increased stable throughput is provided by the proposed distributed WW cooperative MAC protocol for both the SN and RNs compared to the benchmark schemes. As an improved extension of the proposed WWCF, a WW reciprocal-selection-based framework (WWRSF) is formulated for a cooperative spectrum leasing system hosting multiple licensed transmission pairs and multiple unlicensed transmission pairs. The SN of a licensed pair of nodes is referred as the primary transmitter (PT), while the SN of an unlicensed transmission pair is termed as the secondary transmitter (ST). Based on the proposed WWRSF, the PT intends to lease its spectral resources to an appropriate secondary transmitter (ST) in exchange for cooperative transmission assistance for the sake of minimizing its transmit power and simultaneously satisfying its transmit rate requirement. The ST has an incentive to collaborate with the best PT for the sake of minimizing the ST’s transmit power under the constraint of its QoS requirement, whilst simultaneously winning a transmission opportunity for its own traffic. Based on the OFs of the proposed WWRSF, a distributed WW reciprocal-selection-based medium access scheme (DWWRS-MAS) is designed, which is capable of producing the best cooperative pairs set for the sake of reducing the transmit power of both the PT and of the ST in each cooperative pair, whilst simultaneously satisfying their transmit rate requirements. This is achieved with the aid of the proposed distributed reciprocal selection between the active PTs and STs, which have the capability of providing successful cooperative transmission assistance. Moreover, we analyse both the queueing stability and the algorithmic stability of our cooperative spectrum leasing system exploiting our DWWRS-MAS. In comparison to the benchmark schemes considered in the literature, the proposed DWWRS-MAS is capable of achieving a performance, which is comparable to that of the optimal schemes in terms of the system’s transmit power and system’s achievable transmit rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{indicate}} that a signalling effect occurs when stimuli are presented during the terminal link of a concurrent-chains procedure, which signal whether or not probabilistic reinforcement is forthcoming {{at the end of}} the trial. The effect of these signals is a reduced preference for the richer alternative. This thesis includes five experiments aimed to investigate this. The overall purpose of this research is to investigate the effect on preference of differential signalling of reinforcement that differs in terms of the variable being signalled. Furthermore, these experiments are aimed at investigating the manner in which signalling affects preference when multiple dimensions of reinforcement are varied in a <b>signalling</b> <b>procedure.</b> Asking the question how does signalling affect sensitivity to various dimensions of reinforcement and how does this change when more than one dimension is varied? The first experiment involved a simple replication of previous work with percentage-reinforcement procedures. It further extends that work by signalling the size of the reinforcer rather than its probability. Pigeons were given the choice between two alternatives with identical-duration initial and terminal links. Choice of one alternative (uncertain) led to one of two possible signalled outcomes, reinforcement (3. 5 s) or blackout, with a probability of. 5. Choice of the other alternative (certain) always resulted in food (3. 5 s) {{at the end of the}} delay. When the scheduled outcome on the uncertain alternative was differentially signalled, there was a moderate preference for the certain side. Moreover, when the scheduled outcome on the uncertain side was not differentially signalled, preference for the certain side became more extreme. This result replicates the signalling effect. With a similar design, another three conditions manipulated the magnitude of primary reinforcement, rather than its probability. When primary reinforcement was arranged like this, a weaker signalling effect was obtained. Two further experiments investigated the effect of signals on preference for alternatives that differed in either relative variability or expected magnitude of reinforcement, while the other variable was held constant. In Experiment 2, pigeons were offered the choice between two alternatives that differed in relative variability of reinforcement. Each alternative delivered one of two possible reinforcer magnitudes at the end of a terminal link: these magnitudes were either the same (fixed) or were different (mixed). In some conditions, terminal-link outcomes were signalled and in others they were not. Results showed that pigeons preferred fixed over signalled mixed magnitudes of reinforcement, and signalled mixed over unsignalled mixed magnitudes of reinforcement. Thus, these alternatives could be ordered in terms of preference: fixed, signalled mixed and unsignalled mixed. Finally, signalling does indeed moderate the preference for fixed over mixed magnitudes. In the third experiment, pigeons completed a two-component signalled concurrent-chains procedure in which the relative expected magnitude varied across alternatives as all other dimensions of reinforcement were held constant. Therefore, this experiment investigated the effects of signalling on preference between alternatives differing in relative expected magnitude of reinforcement. A slight signalling effect was obtained, with slightly reduced preference in the signalled relative to the unsignalled condition. Overall, these two experiments confirm that signalling acts on the preference for fixed magnitudes of reinforcement and to a lesser extent, preference for the larger of two expected magnitudes of reinforcement. The final two experiments investigated the effect of signals on preference in a procedure that varied parametrically either relative probability and immediacy of reinforcement, or probability and magnitude of reinforcement. The effects of relative reinforcer immediacy or magnitude and probability on choice in concurrent chains were examined, under conditions in which terminal-link outcomes (reinforcement or extinction) were either signalled or unsignalled. Pigeons responded in a three-component concurrent-chains procedure with either independent or interdependent initial links. The percentage of reinforcement was varied across conditions, while the immediacy or magnitude of reinforcement was varied across components. Both signalled and unsignalled conditions were arranged. Generalised-matching analyses revealed a strong signalling effect: sensitivity to relative reinforcer probability was greater in the unsignalled compared to signalled conditions. However, sensitivities to relative immediacy and magnitude were also greater in the unsignalled conditions. Overall, the data suggest that signalling reinforcement and extinction outcomes may attenuate sensitivity to all terminal-link variables, not just reinforcer probability. These experiments have investigated the signalling effect using a variety of methods. They have contributed several replications of the effect, and added valuable information regarding the effects on preference of signalling reinforcement outcomes. The most impressive finding of this research is that signalling has a global effect on sensitivity to all dimensions of reinforcement and that models of conditioned reinforcement are best suited to analyse these results...|$|E

40|$|Trabajo presentado al Workshop on High Performance Switching and Routing 2006, Poznan (Polonia), 7 - 9 de junio de 2006 Burst {{preemption}} is {{the most}} effective technique to provide Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation in Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks. Nonetheless, in conventional OBS architectures, when preemption happens the control packet corresponding to the preempted burst continues its travel to the destination node reserving resources at each node of the path. Therefore, an additional <b>signaling</b> <b>procedure</b> should be carried out to release these unnecessary reservations. In this paper we present novel control architecture to efficiently apply burst preemption without the need of the <b>signaling</b> <b>procedure.</b> Analytical and simulation results prove the effectiveness of this proposal. This work has been partially funded by the e-Photon/ONe project (IST FP 6 - 001933) and the MEC (Spanish Ministry of Education) under contract TEC 2005 - 08051 -C 03 - 01...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the time course of}} associative recognition using the response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure,</b> whereby a stimulus is presented and followed after a variable lag by a signal indicating that an immediate response is required. More specifically, {{we examined the}} effects of associative fan (the number of associations that an item has with other items in memory) on speed–accuracy tradeoff functions obtained in a previous response signal experiment involving briefly studied materials and in a new experiment involving well-learned materials. High fan lowered asymptotic accuracy or the rate of rise in accuracy across lags, or both. We developed an Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model for the response <b>signal</b> <b>procedure</b> to explain these effects. The model assumes that high fan results in weak associative activation that slows memory retrieval, thereby decreasing the probability that retrieval finishes in time and producing a speed–accuracy tradeoff function. The ACT-R model provided an excellent account of the data, yielding quantitative fits that were as good as those of the best descriptive model for response signal data...|$|R
