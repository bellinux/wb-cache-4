40|$|Advantages and {{disadvantages}} of bone marrow biopsies taken from the posterior iliac crest using the <b>Silverman</b> <b>needle</b> were evaluated. Sixty-three biopsies were carried out in patients on whom previous aspirations of the bone marrow space were unsuccessful. Open surgical biopsy was thus avoided {{in all but one}} case. Only local anesthesia was required. In 12 cases the first attempt to obtain material with the <b>Silverman</b> <b>needle</b> was unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|I {{have carried}} out 22 biopsies in 20 Patients, in fifteen I used a Vim _ <b>Silverman</b> <b>Needle,</b> {{and in the}} {{remainder}} a curetting type Needle, In 12 cases (60 %) the diagnosis that was made; in 3 cases, inadequate tissue, was obtained; in two cases a fibromuscular tissue, in one case a fatty tissue and in one case the specimen was of hepatic tissue. Even with the small biopsy specimen obtained with the Needle {{it is easy to}} recognize malignant tissue if present...|$|E
40|$|The {{abnormal}} electrophoretic {{patterns of}} the serum proteins in the acute stage of virus hepati-tis were first described by Gray and Barron in 1943 (1) and have since been confirmed by sev-eral investigators (2 - 5). In {{the last few years}} there has been considerable interest (6 - 13) in cases of hepatitis progressing to chronic liver dis-ease, or developing post-necrotic cirrhosis. Ex-cept for the study by Martin (4), however, little information has been presented on the serum proteins after the acute stage of the disease. The present investigation was undertaken to observe the alterations of the serum proteins dur-ing the course of virus hepatitis, including its later stages. METHODS Electrophoretic runs were performed with standard apparatus and technique, the experimental details having been given in an earlier report (14). The tests of hepatic function were performed by the usual methods as pre-viously described (14), alkaline phosphatase being re-ported in Bodansky units. In our experience (15), the thymol turbidity test with buffer pH 7. 55 has not in-frequently given values of 4 or 5 units in normal indi-viduals. CASE MATERIAL Ten volunteer subjects with normal tests of hepatic function served as controls, the data having been pre-viously reported (14). Twenty-one clinically typical cases of hepatitis were studied. Histologic verification of parenchymal in-volvement compatible with virus hepatitis was obtained in 14 cases, the tissue having been secured by one or more Vim <b>Silverman</b> <b>needle</b> biopsies or at laparotomy, and in two cases (E. H. and K. H.) at autopsy. On the basis of history the cases were considered to be infectious hepatitis with exception of two (T. H. and K. H.) re-garded as homologous serum hepatitis, having received blood and plasma within 60 to 90 days prior to onset. For the purposes of study, the material was divided into the following three groups...|$|E
40|$|Case 1 : A 38 -year-old {{housewife}} {{was admitted}} to our clinic on January 1973 because of fever and lymphocytosis of 4 -months' duration. Leukocytosis (25, 500 /m㎥) with a marked lymphocytosis (70 %) was present in peripheral blood. Twenty-four out of this 70 % of lymphocytes were markedly atypical, showing indented or lobated nuclei and rather abundant basophilic cytoplasm. These cells were also seen in bone marrow in 2. 6 %. Phase contrast and electron microscopic observation revealed these cells to be rather mature atypical lymphocytes. Negative Paul-Bunnell test, low antibody titer for EB virus, and poor blstogenesis to stimulation by phytohemaggulutinin and T-cell nature of these lymphocytes were demonstrated. Prominent hepatosplenomegaly was characteristic though lymphoadenopathy was absent. Peripheral leukocyte counts increased progressively up to 20. 4 × 10 (4) /m㎥ while blasts were scarecely seen. In spite of administering Neocarzinostatin, vincristine and prednisolone. the patient died of pneumonia three months after admission. Necropsy using a <b>Silverman</b> <b>needle</b> revealed cytomegalic inclusion bodies in the lung and massive infiltration of, what appeared to be, atypical lymphocytes into the liver, spleen and kidney. Case 2 : A 56 -year-old male {{was admitted to}} the Okayama University Hospital at Misasa on March 1974, complaining of high temperature of 2 -weeks' duration. Leukocyte counts in peripheral blood was 7, 550 /m㎥ with atypical lymphocytes, which were quite similar in shapes as well as in maturities to those seen in the Case 1 and were seen in 23. 5 %, whereas they were 7. 8 % in the bone marrow. Fever continued without responding to various antibiotics and prednisolone. Leukocyte counts were increased up to 23, 600 /m㎥ within two weeks and he died of massive interstitial pneumonia one month after the admission. Necropsy with a <b>Silverman</b> <b>needle</b> revealed cytomegalic inclusion bodies in the lung and infiltrations of atypical lymphocytes into the liver, spleen and kidney. Infectious mononucleosis can be ruled out on the basis of progressive and fatal clinical courses and other specific laboratory findings, although infection by Herpes type virus might play some role at the terminal stage of the disease. As the increase of atypical lymphocytes is so prominent in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, these 2 cases probably belong to lymphocytic leukemia; acute lymphocytic leukemia can easily be omitted because no blasts were seen. On the other hand, these cases cannot be categorized as conventional chronic lymphocytic leukemia in various points, showing atypical lymphocytes with variegated shapes and sizes, much shorter surviving time than that and poor response to therapy. Differentiation of these cases from "lymphosarcoma cell leukemia" is also made by their shorter clinical courses than that leukemia and absence of very characteristic nucleoli seen in that leukemia. Maturity of the cells from our cases also differ from those in lymphosarcoma cell leukemia; cells in our cases are maturer than those of that leukemia. "Prolymphocytic leukemia" reported by Galton et al. may be a disease entity to be most compatible with our cases. Marked lymphocytosis, short survival time, poor response to therapy, hepatosplenomegaly and absence of peripheral lymphoadenopathy accord well with the clinical features described by them. The characteristic cells, however, in the peripheral blood of prolymphocytic leukemia are somewhat different from those seen in our cases. The cells of that leukemia have a large vesicular nucleolus in almost every cases without appreciable clefts, indentations or lobations of nucleus, whereas less conspicuous nucleoli and more irregular nuclei in shape were frequently observed in our cases than in prolymphocytic leukemia. Incidentally, Akihama et al. reported a case quite resembling our cases, and proposed a new clinical entity which should be differentiated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia due to several reasons as stated before. Because of, however, the lack of proper autopsies and limited numbers of cases experienced so far, it will be too premature to state that these 3 cases, including that of Akihama et al., should be regarded as a new clinical entity. Further studies on the similar cases to ours will be needed to decide {{as to whether or not}} our 2 cases are indeed a variant of prolymphocytic leukemia...|$|E
