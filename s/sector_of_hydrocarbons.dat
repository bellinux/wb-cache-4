Es as? como se fortalece la aplicaci?n del Supply Chain Management siendo la integraci?n global de los procesos dentro de una empresa; que va desde el desarrollador de un producto o el proveedor de una materia prima hasta la {{empresa que}} entrega el producto o servicio al consumidor final. A trav?s de esta red fluyen, se transforman, se distribuyen y se venden materiales, recursos, servicios y productos. De manera muy general la cadena de abastecimiento est? integrada por cinco elementos: Proveedores, Transportes, la Empresa, los Clientes y la Comunicaci?n entre ellos. La r?pida interacci?n entre estos elementos es {{indispensable}} y genera una ventaja competitiva a la empresa que sepa utilizarla a su favor. El presente trabajo se desarrolla como Proyecto final del Curso de Profundizaci?n Supply Chain Management para alcanzar los objetivos como Proyecto opci?n de Grado; Utilizando como base la empresa INDEQ LTDA, dedicada al Montaje, construcci?n y mantenimiento de redes el?ctricas, de control e instrumentaci?n en el sector de hidrocarburos, petroqu?micas e industrias; La cual se encuentra ubicada en Agua Azul Casanare Colombia.

50|$|Petroleum {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> which can be either crude oil or natural gas. Exploration and Production are deemed to fall within the upstream <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> {{the oil and gas}} industry. Exploration, by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from subsurface reservoirs. Petroleum geology and geophysics focus on provision of a static description <b>of</b> the <b>hydrocarbon</b> reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.|$|R

As of today exploration of natural bitumens, which is however possible only under innovative approaches, is the most important method <b>of</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> production.

40|$|Selected {{microbial}} parameters were monitored in sediments from {{a pristine}} and an oil-field salt marsh. Although numbers of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and fungi were significantly {{greater in the}} oil field, the values did not show a strong correlation with levels <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (r = 0. 43 and r = 0. 49, respectively). However, a high correlation was noted between ratios of hydrocarbonoclastic and total aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and levels <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{as well as the}} relative concentration <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (ratio <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> to chloroform extractables) (r = 0. 87 and r = 0. 77, respectively). Data suggest that this first ratio is a more valid microbial indicator <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> abundance than other factors examined. Significant differences in the ratio of pigmented to total colony-forming units, the ratio of different to total colony-forming units, and the diversity index were noted between the natural and oil-field marsh.

40|$|Petroleum and gas seeps on {{the ground}} surface are direct {{indicators}} <b>of</b> accumulations <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the subsurface and could reflect the migration <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in a sedimentary basin. Quantitative analyses of the spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seeps and their spatial associations with geological features could aid in deducing geological controls on their occurrence. In this study the Fry analysis was applied to study the spatial pattern <b>of</b> mapped <b>hydrocarbon</b> seeps, whereas spatial association analyses were implemented to quantify the spatial association of mapped seeps and their alteration products with geological features. The spatial pattern analysis <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> seeps showed that oil seeps followed prominent NW-SE and NE-SW trends while gas seeps followed NW-SE and N-S trends suggesting that NNE-SSW and NW-SE fractures are possible migration pathways for hydrocarbons to reach the surface.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the thermal history of folded and thrust units is crucial to define the pattern of tectonic loading and the time-space evolution of an orogen where tectonic exhumation processes occurred at shallow crustal levels. In the present study, a well-constrained {{reconstruction of}} the thermal maturity in the axial zone of the southern Apennines has been achieved by the combined use of different thermal indicators in diagenesis. The major results are: (i) documentation of a jump in thermal maturity from the Apenninic Platform derived tectonic unit (from immature to early mature stages <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> maturation) to the Lagonegro Basin derived tectonic units (late diagenetic zone); (ii) documentation of along-strike slighter variations in the Lagonegro units, concerning thermal maturity (thus maximum burial temperatures).

30|$|In deep strata, {{there are}} {{multiple}} sets and multiple varieties <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> sources (including shale, carbonate, paleo-reservoir asphalt, and inorganic hydrocarbons) and multiple hydrocarbon-generating points, which experienced a number <b>of</b> periods <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> generation and expulsion and multiple hydrocarbon migration pathways (faults, unconformities, carrier systems, and combinations). For source rocks that experienced many periods of evolution, the results of comparison using a single biomarker will be seriously affected by the degree of maturity. For multiple sets of source rocks, the results of analysis using the carbon isotope method {{will be affected by}} the sedimentary environment and climate conditions. Therefore, integrated analysis is required for the determination <b>of</b> deep <b>hydrocarbon</b> sources, including geological (altitude, log response, color, and mud content) and geochemical (biomarker, carbon isotope) analysis.

40|$|International audienceAn in situ {{experiment}} {{has been}} carried out inbioturbated Mediterranean coastal marine sediments (Gulfof Fos) in order to study the influence <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> ondenitrification after 1, 4 and 6 months. In theabsence <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the control sediments, the presenceof macrofauna stimulated denitrificationby 160 %. This stimulation is induced by sediment reworkingthat favours both direct NO- 3 supply fromthe water column and the penetration of O{ 2 }, which in turnstimulated nitrification, the other source ofNO- 3 in sediment. The presence <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in theexperimental sediments either stimulated orinhibited the denitrification.

In the present study, the combined use of different thermal indicators in diagenesis allowed the {{reconstruction of}} the thermal maturity in the axial zone of the southern Apennines. Our major results include: (i) the documentation of a break in thermal maturity from the Apenninic Platform derived tectonic unit (from immature to early mature stages <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> generation) to the Lagonegro Basin derived tectonic units (late diagenetic stage). This jump may be attributed to different amounts of tectonic loading that were emplaced on top of the different stratigraphic-structural units during Neogene chain building; (ii) the documentation, within the Lagonegro units, of along-strike variations of thermal maturity (thus maximum burial temperatures). This can be related to changes in the amount of tectonic burial associated with lateral variations of thrust sheet thickness; (iii) the recognition of different ages of exhumation characterizing the southern and northern <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> the study area. In the southern sector exhumation is younger, and post-dates the emplacement of the allochthonous units onto the Apulian Platform carbonates (here in the late mature stage <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> generation) exposed in the Mt.
