5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B.

5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation.

40|$|Topic: This {{critical}} {{review of the}} literature integrates findings across varied literatures and identifies areas for continued study on the prevalence, correlates, and impact of substance use (alcohol and illicit drugs) on social role functioning among emerging adults with <b>serious</b> mental <b>health</b> conditions. Purpose: This population is of interest because of high comorbidity rates between substance use and <b>serious</b> mental <b>health</b> conditions and the added difficulties posed by their co-occurrence during the transition to adulthood. This {{critical review}} presents the epidemiology of substance use in emerging adults with <b>serious</b> mental <b>health</b> conditions compared to emerging adults without these conditions, as well as what is known about predictors and consequences of substance use in this population. Sources Used: PsychINFO and PubMed along with relevant published literature. Results: This review summarizes what is known about the impact of these cooccurring problems on the transition of emerging adults from school and training environments to adult work roles. Though this group presents with unique challenges, few programs have been developed to address their specific needs. This paper synthesizes what is known empirically about approaches with this population, discussing those that might be useful for emerging adults with comorbid <b>serious</b> mental <b>health</b> conditions and substance use problems, particularly in supporting their educational and vocational development. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Emerging adults with co-occurring <b>serious</b> mental <b>health</b> conditions and substance use problems are underserved by current mental health systems. Recommendations focus on how to promote mental health and social role functioning through comprehensive intervention programs that provide continuity of care through the transition to adulthood...|$|R

5|$|Jack Russells are an {{energetic}} breed {{that rely on}} {{a high level of}} exercise and stimulation and are relatively free from <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> complaints. Originating from dogs bred and used by Reverend John Russell in the early 19th century, from whom the breed takes its name, the Jack Russell has similar origins to the modern Fox terrier. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed's parent societies – which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russells have appeared many times in film, television, and print - with several historical dogs of note.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E

Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{four million}} people in Vietnam {{were exposed to the}} defoliant, with around one million now {{suffering}} <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> issues. The chemical is capable of damaging genes, resulting in deformities among the offspring of exposed victims. The U.S. government has documented higher cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed veterans. Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000km2 or 11,969mi2) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more <b>serious</b> <b>health</b> effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
