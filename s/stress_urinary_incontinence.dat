40|$|Introduction: Both {{pregnancy}} and childbirth are important {{risk factors for}} <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> in women. For its prevention, exercies of the pelvic floor musculature {{have been shown to}} be effective. Guidelines for <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> management recommend offering pelvic floor muscle training to women during their first pregnancy as a preventive measure. Objective: To update the information provided in the scientific literature on <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> during postpartum and possible forms of treat it. Methodology: A systematic bibliographic review was carried out in the following databases: PUBMED, COCHRANE, CINHAL, MEDLINE, SciELO and SCOPUS. The date was restricted to the last 5 years (2012 - 2017), in Spanish, English and Portuguese. Restrictions were made regarding the type of study, and Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) were considered for this review. Results: After reviewing the literature consulted, it is concluded that the training of the pelvic floor musculature is beneficial to prevent the occurrence of <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> during {{pregnancy and}} the postpartum period. Conclusions: The results obtained in this review are consistent with previous studies and bibliographic reviews of the same topic.

In addition, one death from suicide was reported in a Cymbalta clinical pharmacology study in a healthy female volunteer without SUI.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} results of {{modified}} MMK operation with vaginal repair in female stress incontinence and to study the prognostic variables that determine the success. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> was treated by modified MMK operation in 59 and by Kelly’s vaginal repair in 42 women. All were assessed preoperatively by detailed history, clinical examination. No sophisticated urodynamic studies were done. Follow up was done initially at 3 months, then at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Better results were obtained with modified MMK operation (88. 1 %) compared to vaginal repair (69 %). Results were excellent in type I incontinence {{and in the absence}} of pelvic floor relaxation. Hysterectomy did not seem to improve the results. Complication rates were acceptable with modified MMK operation. CONCLUSION: Though laparoscopic Burch colposuspension is the preferred management in female <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence,</b> this modality is not available at all centers. For institutions which provide basic gynaecological services, we recommend modified MMK operation as a primary surgery for female <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> to obtain higher cure rates and to minimize the incidence of recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> following vaginal repair.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{examine the}} {{pathophysiology}} of "stress induced <b>urinary</b> incontinence" (<b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> evoked by abdominal straining) {{in patients with}} spinocerebellar degeneration.  METHODS—Micturitional symptoms of 184 patients with spinocerebellar degeneration who were admitted to hospital were studied repeatedly. Urodynamic studies were made in symptomatic patients, and consisted of uroflowmetry, measurement of residual urine, urethral pressure profilometry, medium fill water cystometry, and external sphincter EMG RESULTS—Twenty nine (15. 8 %) patients with spinocerebellar degeneration showed <b>stress</b> induced <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Twenty of the 29 patients had detrusor overactivity, low compliance detrusor, or residual urine, resembling urgency and overflow types of incontinence (complicated form). The other nine had none of these findings (pure form), but showed decreased maximum urethral closure pressure in four, absence of bulbocavernosus reflex in two, absence of voluntary sphincter contraction in one, incompetent urinary storage even at the first sensation in two, and high amplitude and polyphasic neurogenic changes in three of five patients studied, indicative of neurogenic sphincter dysfunction.  CONCLUSIONS—Stress induced <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in spinocerebellar degeneration had various underlying mechanisms. Some of the patients only showed evidence of pudendal denervation, which can cause external sphincter weakness and may reflect lesions of the sacral Onuf's nucleus and the pudendal nerve.
