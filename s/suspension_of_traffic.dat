These overflows are usually a fill-up of boulders amalgamated with concrete and supplemented with reinforced concrete pipes serving as water under passage.

50|$|On the {{breaking}} up of a severe frost {{in the winter}} of 1854-5, a great part of the timber bridge was broken down by the ice, and all communication between the county of Radnor and the town of Hay was stopped. During the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> a boat was put upon the river by the inhabitants of Hay and neighbourhood, a little above the fallen bridge, for the convenience of foot passengers. In 1861 the lease expired, and consequently the Commissioners were empowered to make what arrangements they liked. They found it necessary to rebuild the bridge,* but they had no remedy against the original lessees. They entered into negotiations with Mr. Thomas Savin (the contractor for the Hereford, Hay, and Brecon Railway), with the result that in 1862 he agreed with the Commissioners to rebuild the bridge in consideration of having the tolls assigned to him for 99 years. The present bridge was completed in 1865, and the Commissioners then granted a lease to Mr. Savin for 99 years. The lease dated from 7 April 1862. The lease was afterwards transferred to T. E. Williams (Peterchurch), William Farr (Dorstone), and John Andrew. A new site has recently been purchased for a toll-house by the Commissioners from the Midland Railway Company, and a toll-house erected thereon by the lessees. The present bridge, which cost between £7,000 and £8,000, was designed by W. E. Hughes, of London.|$|E

During the time of its inauguration, the bridge had separate lanes for cyclists and footpaths for pedestrians. The bridge was damaged in November 1985 due to a rush of flood water, resulting in the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> vehicular <b>traffic</b> over the bridge.

Hitler's Directive No. 17 expanded the scope of the air offensive from the English Channel to British airfields.

50|$|The {{original}} Maslenica Bridge {{was designed}} by Vojislav Draganić of Inženjerski Projektni Zavod (IPZ) between 1955 and 1960. By 1989, wear caused by heavy traffic and inadequate maintenance became significant, including cracks on the cross-girders and a pier. That led to a half-year-long <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>traffic</b> across the bridge while it was repaired. The issues with the spandrel structure and the piers were remediated at that time by strengthening the pier and column cross-sections and by repairs to the cross-girder joints. During the summer of 1990, the bridge was once again in full operation, followed by another period of restricted use while the rehabilitation works were completed.|$|R

30|$|As {{stated in}} the {{previous}} section, interaction between sand in neighboring cells (Eq. (2)) is necessary to reproduce bedforms with plausible shapes. Dynamic interaction between grains is a theme of physics of multiparticle systems or granular dynamics, and it is generally complicated. For specific topics, however, simplified models based on granular dynamics can reproduce real phenomena; an example <b>of</b> this is <b>traffic</b> flow. Although the present model for starved beds is built phenomenologically {{on the basis of}} the continuous bed-contact load, it has similarities to a model for traffic flows. <b>Traffic</b> flow is <b>of</b> interest both in the fields of physics and in civil engineering, where cars are regarded as grains and their flow considered a type of granular flow (e.g., Chowdhury et al. 2000). In such studies, the relation between car-flow phases (i.e., “grain-flow phases”) and the abundance of cars (density of grains) has been investigated. The grain-flow phase is a class or state of transportation in a traffic flow, and the traffic viewpoint is different from the transport modes of geomorphology and sedimentology (such as rolling, sliding, saltation, and <b>suspension).</b> Previous studies <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow have shown that car-flow phases are connected with car transportation rates (Chowdhury et al. 2000). Car transportation rates correspond to sand flux for sediment beds, which is a quantifiable factor. In geomorphology and sedimentology, while interconnectional properties among different levels of interaction (for example, grain−fluid, bedform−fluid, and bedform−bedform) have been identified (e.g., Kocurek et al. 2010), differences in the grain-flow phase have not been clearly identified. Here, we review a previous model <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow and compare it with the present model in order to understand the relation between sand flux and the state of sand transportation on starved beds.|$|R

Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.
