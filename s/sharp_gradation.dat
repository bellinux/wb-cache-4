60|$|The {{eight months}} had been well spent, and, in {{addition}} {{to what he had}} learned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of himself. Along with his humbleness because he knew so little, there arose a conviction of power. He felt a <b>sharp</b> <b>gradation</b> between himself and his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement. What he could do,--they could do; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told him there was more in him than he had done. He was tortured by the exquisite beauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there to share it with him. He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits of South Sea beauty. The creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than Ruth. And then, in splendor and glory, came the great idea. He would write. He {{would be one of the}} eyes through which the world saw, one of the ears through which it heard, one of the hearts through which it felt. He would write--everything--poetry and prose, fiction and description, and plays like Shakespeare. There was career and the way to win to Ruth. The men of literature were the world's giants, and he conceived them to be far finer than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.|$|E
40|$|The Jakarta mega-urban region (MUR) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} such regions in the world. In this article, we revisit Castles’s seminal 1967 article, based on the 1961 Population Census of Indonesia, on the {{educational}} and ethnic composition of Jakarta. Using data from the full-count 2010 Population Census, we examine spatial patterns in the educational gradients of the population across the Jakarta MUR and look to determine whether these patterns can be explained by internal migration and ethnic composition at the kecamatan (subdistrict) level. We find that population movement from the core to the outer areas has softened the historically extremely <b>sharp</b> <b>gradation</b> in educational attainment across the MUR. We show the dominance of the Sundanese and Bantenese ethnic groups in the rural hinterlands of the MUR, where the average educational attainment is relatively low, and note this question of rurality versus ethnicity when interpreting our results...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The vitamin B₁₂ {{concentrations}} {{in both the}} water and sediments of Klamath Lake were found to vary significantly during a one-year period. The patterns of B₁₂ distribution were remarkably similar among the three main sites. In all cases there was an extremely <b>sharp</b> <b>gradation</b> in concentration in relation to depth of sediment, with the highest concentrations being found at the water-sediment interface. Maximum {{concentrations in}} the water layer occurred shortly after the onset of bloom conditions in mid May 1969. In the upper sediment layers, however, maximum concentrations occurred in early fall, concurrent with the die-off of the bloom, followed by an abrupt decrease shortly thereafter. Concentrations of up to 400 μμg/ml of water (June 1969) and 1. 8 μg/g of dry sediment (September 1969) were demonstrated. In conjunction with the analysis of environmental variations of B₁₂, various aspects of its production and depletion were examined. Of 42 bacterial isolates from Klamath Lake water and sediments 20 were found capable of producing 50 μμg or more B₁₂/ml of culture medium. Mixed cultures of Klamath Lake organisms were found capable of producing up to 23 mμg B₁₂/ml of medium. This is more than 30 times the highest rate found using pure culture techniques. Phytoplankton samples were found to contain up to 5 μg B₁₂/g dry material and significant B₁₂ production was found to occur in unialgal cultures of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Degradation of B₁₂ occurred in sterilized sediment samples {{as well as in}} a sediment-perfusion column containing an initially high concentration of the vitamin...|$|E
