40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{greatest}} economic benefit {{can be achieved by}} the Space Shuttle Orbiter's use as a satellite <b>servicing</b> <b>platform</b> if the following conditions are fulfilled: (1) the international user community must build serviceability features into its satellite and orbital platform designs, based on a common set of guidelines; (2) the various tools required for satellite servicing must be developed in a timely manner; and (3) servicing costs must be kept as low as possible, in order to appeal to the greatest number and variety of satellite operators. A three-part program development schedule is proposed, beginning with near-Orbiter servicing in low earth orbit, continuing with servicing at orbital heights between the low and geosynchronous at greater distances from the Orbiter, and culminating in the early 1990 's {{with the use of the}} Space Operations Center (SOC) platform for servicing at all orbital heights...|$|E

The SRV will be used to ferry satellites to and from the GSSP. Technicians will be transferred from Earth to the GSSP and back in an Apollo-derived Crew Transfer Capsule (CTC). These missions will use advanced telerobotic equipment to inspect and service satellites. Four of these missions are tentatively scheduled per year.

40|$|AbstractMany IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> (e. g., cloud {{computing}} platforms) are built as closed systems. They {{do not allow}} their customers to interoperate with other platforms or port their data to other platforms. As switching to a different system is costly, customers of a closed IT system can be considered locked in. Consequently, potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, do not adopt cloud services. Opening up an IT <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> however, reduces users’ concerns about lock-in and its associated switching cost. It is even predicted that an IT <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> gets more attractive, if it opens up. This paper validates this prediction by analyzing the level of openness (i. e., interoperability, portability, and usability) of {{cloud computing}} platforms on their adoption. For the validation, we develop a value creation model for IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms.</b> Based on this value creation model and a specification of requirements of open cloud computing platforms, {{the relationship between the}} openness of IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> and the adoption of IT <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> (i. e., attractiveness) is analyzed in detail.

The <b>service</b> <b>platform’s</b> added value lies in the distribution of information that has been adapted to a specific user’s needs. This means that the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> needs to learn about the user’s needs and requirements in the first place, notably by collecting and processing the data that are relevant for the user’s situation.

40|$|The Large Deployable Reflector (LDR), a NASA {{concept of}} a very large, orbiting, far {{infrared}} submillimeter telescope is described. To be launched in the 1990 s, LDR has a projected life of 10 years and is to be serviced every 2 to 3 years. A System Concept and Technology Definition Study of LDR for NASA Ames is currently being conducted. Study results indicate that launch of a 20 m LDR, operating in a 700 to 800 km orbit, requires two shuttle loads. The components of LDR are assembled in a lower parking orbit, and the system is checked out and then transferred to the operational orbit. Furthermore, for servicing, LDR {{may have to be}} retrieved to the same lower orbit (and later returned to operational altitude) by an orbit transfer vehicle. These requirements bring up the question of a suitable assembly, checkout, and <b>servicing</b> <b>platform.</b> The deployment process is time consuming and may require special equipment not necessarily available from the orbiter itself.

40|$|During {{the last}} 40 years, {{the mass of}} the {{artificial}} objects in orbit increased quite steadily at the rate of about 145 metric tons annually, leading to a total tally of approximately 7000 metric tons. Now, most of the cross-sectional area and mass (97 % in LEO) is concentrated in about 4500 intact objects, i. e. abandoned spacecraft and rocket bodies, plus a further 1000 operational spacecraft. Simulations and parametric analyses have shown that the most efficient and effective way to prevent the outbreak of a long-term exponential growth of the catalogued debris population would be to remove enough cross-sectional area and mass from densely populated orbits. In practice, {{according to the most recent}} NASA results, the active yearly removal of approximately 0. 1 % of the abandoned intact objects would be sufficient to stabilize the catalogued debris in low Earth orbit, together with the worldwide adoption of mitigation measures. The candidate targets for removal would have typical masses between 500 and 1000 kg, in the case of spacecraft, and of more than 1000 kg, in the case of rocket upper stages. Current data suggest that optimal active debris removal missions should be carried out in a few critical altitude-inclination bands. This paper deals with the feasibility study of a mission in which the debris is removed by using a hybrid engine module as propulsion unit. Specifically, the engine is transferred from a <b>servicing</b> <b>platform</b> to the debris target by a robotic arm so to perform a controlled disposal. Hybrid rocket technology for de-orbiting applications is considered a valuable option due to high specific impulse, intrinsic safety, thrust throttle ability, low environmental impact and reduced operating costs. Typically, in hybrid rockets a gaseous or liquid oxidizer is injected into the combustion chamber along the axial direction to burn a solid fuel. However, the use of tangential injection on a solid grain Pancake Geometry allows for more compact design of the propulsion unit. Only explorative tests were performed in the past on this rocket configuration, which appears to be suitable as de-orbiting system of new satellites as well as for direct application on large debris in the framework of a mission for debris removal. The paper describes some critical aspects of the mission with particular concern to the target selection, the hybrid engine module, the operations and the systems needed to rendezvous and dock with the target and the disposal strateg...|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> is increasing, while studies on this phenomenon remain scarce and insufficient. Most of the researches focus on products, market segmentation and how platform triggers innovation and there's a lack of researches that focus on services, the fast growing industry nowadays. In analyzing the <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> {{it is important to}} understand the interactions between different players, such as application developers, content providers, network operators, and users. For that purpose, a value network analysis which analyzes the interactions for creating value between the key players is more suitable than the common value chain analysis which is one-directional and sequential. This thesis adopts the value network approach in an attempt to analyze the two different types of <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> that is, social networking <b>platform</b> and mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform.</b> The Social Networking Service (SNS) is evolving beyond the bounds of a simple personal network and is gradually transforming into a social networking platform where SNS information is used to develop various new services. This thesis examines the positioning and interaction of the key players for the social networking platform and the values that the key players can gain and capture. The mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> is becoming more important, as 3 G mobile technologies are mature and widespread and the smartphone market is growing rapidly. For the mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform,</b> the market players are engaged in a severe competition to control the market through various strategies. The biggest current issue in the mobile market is the movement to open platform strategy to build an ecosystem in which third-party developers can participate. This thesis also examines the positioning and interaction of the key players surrounding the mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> and the values that the key players can gain and capture. Ultimately, this thesis aims to suggest <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> strategies for <b>service</b> <b>platform</b> providers and third party developers from the perspectives of social networking <b>platform</b> and mobile <b>service</b> <b>platform.</b> For that purpose, case studies are conducted in depth. In this thesis, the term "service platform" is defined as a set of interfaces provided for the development of applications or contents as service and software grow into one. by Jang Hoon Yoo.
