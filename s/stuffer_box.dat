50|$|The {{unprocessed}} yarn {{is provided}} on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At {{a speed of}} up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a “figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special <b>stuffer</b> <b>box,</b> the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).The heat setting process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After heat setting, the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a heat setting machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.|$|E
40|$|Crimp {{frequency}} {{during the}} <b>stuffer</b> <b>box</b> crimping process {{is of great}} importance for controlling morphology of crimped fibers. A fiber is considered as a viscoelastic rheological fluid, and an approximate formulation for crimp frequency is obtained revealing the main factors affecting the crimping process...|$|E
40|$|The {{velocity}} of axially moving slender fiber of viscoelastic fluid {{is an important}} factor in mass-production of crimped fibers in <b>stuffer</b> <b>box</b> crimping and bubble electrospinning. A governing equation for fiber crimp is obtained by the Hamilton’s principle, and the natural frequency and critical axially moving velocity are obtained analytically by considering the thermal effect. It is concluded that a high temperature gradient can greatly enhance the production ratio and guarantee the fundamental transverse vibration. Additionally the effects of the tensile axial load and amplitude on transverse vibration are also elucidated...|$|E
40|$|A quem a correspondência deve ser enviada The {{microbiological}} quality of beef and meat products is {{strongly influenced by}} the conditions of hygiene prevailing during their production and handling. Without proper hygienic control, the environment in slaughterhouses and butcher shops can act as {{an important source of}} microbiological contamination. To identify the main points of microbiological contamination in the beef processing chain, 443 samples of equipment, installations and products were collected from 11 establishments (1 slaughterhouse and 10 butcher shops) located in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The {{microbiological quality}} of all the samples was evaluated using Petri dishes to obtain counts of mesophilic aerobes (AC), total coliforms, Escherichia coli (EC), yeasts and molds (YM). The main contamination points identified in butcher shops, in decreasing order, were stainless steel boxes, beef tenderizers, grinders, knives, mixers, sausage <b>stuffers,</b> plastic <b>boxes,</b> floors and drains. In the slaughterhouse, these points were sausage stuffers, platforms, floors and drains. The most severely contaminated products were fresh sausages and ground beef. This information about the main points of microbiological contamination in the beef processing chain is expected to aid professionals responsible for hygiene in similar establishments to set up proper hygienic procedures to prevent or reduce microbiological contamination of beef and meat products...|$|R

40|$|Edward McGowan (1807 - 1893) {{left behind}} a {{controversial}} career as a former Pennsylvania legislator and police superintendent {{when he came to}} San Francisco in 1849. There he entered Democratic politics and earned the nickname "the ballot <b>box</b> <b>stuffer.</b> " He was acquitted when the Vigilance Committee indicted him for complicity in the killing of James King of William in 1856, but his power in California was at an end. He later served in the Confederate Army and had brushes with the law in Canada before returning to San Francisco in his old age. Narrative of Edward McGowan (1857; reprinted 1917) presents his version of his role in James King's shooting by James Casey in May 1856. Next he discusses the subsequent creation of the Vigilance Committee and his flight from the vigilantes and his life as a fugitive in the Santa Barbara area. He closes with a lengthy discussion of the promise that prompted him to emerge from hiding to stand trial.
