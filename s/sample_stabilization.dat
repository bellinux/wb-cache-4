40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{proportional}} output feedback control can stabilize any relative-degree one, minimum-phase system if the sign of the feedback is correct and the proportional gain is high enough. Moreover, there exist simple adaptation laws for tuning the proportional gain (so-called high-gain adaptive controllers) which do not need to know the system and do not attempt to identify system parameters. In this paper the authors consider sampled versions of the highgain adaptive controller. The motivation for sampling arises from the possibility that the output of a system may not be available continuously, but only at sampled times. The main point of interest is the need to develop techniques for adapting the sampling rate, since the stiffness of the system increases as the proportional gain is increased.

The stability of six commercial drugs in blood and blood spots was investigated under various conditions with or without heat stabilization at 95 °C. Oseltamivir, cefotaxime and ribavirin were successfully stabilized by heating whereas significant losses were seen in unheated samples. Amodiaquine was stable with and without heating.

40|$|After tissue or {{body fluid}} sampling, proteases and other protein-modifying enzymes can rapidly change {{composition}} of the proteome. As a direct consequence, analytical results will reflect a mix of in vivo proteome and ex vivo degradation products. Vital information about the presampling state may be destroyed or distorted, leading to variation between samples and incorrect conclusions. <b>Sample</b> <b>stabilization</b> and standardization of sample handling can reduce or eliminate this problem. Here, a novel tissue stabilization system which utilizes a combination of heat and pressure under vacuum was used to stop degradation in mouse brain tissue immediately after sampling. It was found by biochemical assays that enzymatic activity was reduced to background levels in stabilized samples. Western blot analysis confirmed that post-translational phosphorylations of analyzed proteins were stable and conserved for up to 2 h at room temperature and that peptide extracts were devoid of abundant protein degradation fragments. The combination of reduced complexity and proteolytic inactivation enabled mass spectrometric identification of several neuropeptides and endogenous peptides including modified species at higher levels compared to nonstabilized samples. The tissue stabilizing system ensures reproducible and rapid inactivation of enzymes. Therefore, the system provides a powerful improvement to proteomics by greatly reducing the complexity and dynamic range of the proteome in tissue samples and enables enhanced possibilities for discovery and analysis of clinically relevant protein/peptide biomarkers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sampling arises {{simultaneously}} with {{input and output}} delays in networked control systems. When the delay is left un-compensated, the sampling period is generally required to be suf-ficiently small, the delay sufficiently short, and, for nonlinear sys-tems, only semiglobal practical stability is generally achieved. For example, global stabilization of strict-feedforward systems under <b>sampled</b> measurements, sampled-data <b>stabilization</b> of the nonholo-nomic unicycle with arbitrarily sparse <b>sampling,</b> and sampled-data <b>stabilization</b> of LTI systems over networks with long delays, are open problems. In this paper, we present two general results that address these example problems as special cases. First, we present global asymptotic stabilizers for forward complete systems under arbitrarily long input and output delays, with arbitrarily long sam-pling periods, and with continuous application of the control input. Second, we consider systems with sampled measurements and with control applied through a zero-order hold, {{under the assumption that}} the system is stabilizable under sampled-data feedback for some sampling period, and then construct sampled-data feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization under arbitrarily long input and measurement delays.

40|$|Much {{controversy}} exists {{about whether}} or not NH q 4 is translocated in the xylem from roots to shoots. In this paper it is shown that such translocation can indeed take place, but that interference from other metabolites such as amino acids and amines may give rise to large uncertainties about the magnitude of xylem NH q 4 concentrations. Elimination of interference requires <b>sample</b> <b>stabilization</b> by, for instance, formic acid or methanol. Subsequent quantification of NH q 4 should be done by the OPA-fluorometric method at neutral pH with 2 -mercaptoethanol as the reducing agent since this method is sensitive and reliable. Colorimetric methods based on the Berthelot reaction should never be used, as they are prone to give erroneous results. Significant concentrations of NH q 4, exceeding 1 mM, were measured in both xylem sap and leaf apoplastic solution of oilseed rape and tomato plants growing with NO 3 as the sole N source. When NO 3 was replaced by NH q 4, xylem concentrations increased with increasing into glutamine, but root GS activity and sap NH q 4 external concentrations and with time of exposure to NH q 4. Upto 11 % of the translocated N was constituted by NH q 4. Glutamine synthetase (GS) incorporates NH q 4 expression were repressed when high levels of NH q 4 were supplied. Ammonium concentrations measured in xylem sap sampled just above the stem base were highly correlated with NH q 4 concentrations in apoplastic solution from the leaves. Young leaves tended to have higher apoplastic NH q 4 concentrations than older non-senescing leaves. The flux of NH q 4 (concentration multiplied by transpirational water flow) increased with temperature despite a decline in xylem NH q 4 concentration. Retrieval of leaf apoplastic NH q 4 involves both high and low affinity transporters in the plasma membrane of mesophyll cells.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} century by means of the {{electromagnetic}} levitation with Co_ 8 _ 0 Pd_ 2 _ 0 for the first time a liquid could be brought into the neighbourhood of a ferromagnetic phase transition. Albrecht et al. succeeded then 1997 the formation of the magnetic order in a supercooled Co_ 8 _ 0 Pd_ 2 _ 0 melt. By a new <b>sample</b> <b>stabilization</b> the measurement range has been extended by an important interval. So longer measurement times respectively deeper supercoolings in the neighbourhood of the Curie point are possible. By means of an extended modulation calorimetry both the specific heat capacity c_p and the coupling constant #kappa#_c_o_u_p between sample and the alternating field of the levitation coil has been temperature-dependently determined. Thereby for fixed solid samples sharp maxima of the heat capacity at the Curie point resulted. Also the temperature slope of #kappa#_c_o_u_p could be distinctly reduced to the magnetic susceptibility. For the liquid and by this freely floating samples the modulation calorimetry in the present arrangement was proved to be unsufficient. Otherwise than in a solid according to calculations of S. Dietrich and B. Groh in a drop a vortex-shaped domain structure of the ferromagnetic order is to be expected. For the study of this structure a measurement apparatus for the magnetooptical Kerr effect was constructed. By it it is possible to determine the rotation of polarized light at the magnetized surface of the liquid Co_ 8 _ 0 Pd_ 2 _ 0 samples. By this way conclusions on the forming magnetic structure could be drawn. In the paramagnetic region both a dependence on the applied magnetic field and a distinct temperature dependence of the Kerr angle could be stated. This reflects well the slope of the susceptibility in the same temperature range. In the neighbourhood of the Curie temperature so rotational angles of up to 0. 08 were measured.

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) {{uses the}} {{principles}} of hydro- dynamic focusing, light scattering, light excitation, and emission of fluorochrome molecules to generate specific multi-parameter data from particles and cells. FCM became rapidly a routine method for clinical decision-making in clinical diagnostic laboratories, e. g. for lymphocyte subset enumeration, CD 34 + cell enumeration and HLA-B 27 screening. Therefore, various efforts to standardize testing and reduce variability between laboratories have been undertaken. Also, clinical cell analysis by flow cytometry has entered the same process of development of instrumental validation, internal and external quality control (QC), and External Quality Assessment (EQA) as any other laboratory medicine activities. In this thesis, we analyze {{the impact of these}} standardization efforts on clinical cell analysis by FCM with special attention to external quality assurance programs which currently are operational in the Benel! ux countries. Firstly, we retrospectively analyzed the results of 7 EQA send-outs to assess the quality of flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening. The HLA- B 27 pos samples were correctly classified as positive by the large majority of participants, the classification of HLA-B 27 neg samples as negative was less straightforward. Ten samples were correctly classified as such by 97 % of the participants, whereas only 64 % of the participants correctly classified the remaining eight samples as HLA-B 27 neg. Inspection of the reactivity patterns of the individual mAb with HLA-B 27 neg samples revealed that ABC-m 3 showed very little cross-reactivity apart from its well-known cross-reactivity with HLA- B 7, whereas the cross-reactivity patterns of GS 145. 2 and FD 705 were more extensive. However, the small sample size (n= 18) and the distribution of HLA-B antigens other than HLA-B 27 did not allow assignment of specificities to these cross-reactions. Therefore, we further analyzed the cross-reactivity patterns of commercially available anti-HLA-B 27 mAb (i. e., ABC-m 3, FD 705, and GS 145. 2) with an extensive cell panel with other HLA-B antigens. Test cells were selected as to express HLA-B antigens with known serologic cross-reactions (HLA-B 7, B 12, B 13, B 16, B 17, B 22, B 37, B 40, B 41, B 42, B 47, and B 48). Cells without B 27 cross-reactive antigens (B 5, B 8, B 14, B 15, B 21, and B 35) and cells positive for B 27 were included as controls. All mAbs tested showed cross-reactivity, ranging from weak (Â±) to strong (+), with different antigens and different degrees of intensity. If one mAb had been used for HLA-B 27 screening, many false- positive B 27 assignments would have yielded. This problem largely can be avoided by the combined use of two different mAb. The combination of FD 705 and GS 145. 2 yielded the best results. Tise finding resulted in a proposal for a standard operating procedure for flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, which is p! ublished and nowadays adopted by Current Protocols in Cytometry. In addition, we evaluated the suitability of long-term stabilized whole blood specimens as positive or negative procedure controls for flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, and as test samples in an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 9 blood bank donors with known HLA-B typing. Commercially available HLA-B 27 mAb were tested periodically between 1 week and 12 months and the forward scatter (FSC), sideward scatter (SSC), and fluorescence signals of lymphocytes were compared as a function of time. Furthermore, a pilot send-out with stabilized blood samples of 4 blood bank donors was distributed among the participants to the Benelux EQA scheme for HLA-B 27 screening and results were compared with historical EQA data obtained using non-stabilized blood samples from the same donors. Matrix effects were observed, however there were no major effects on FSC and SSC characteristics of lymphocytes. Fluorescence of stabilized samples increa! sed as compared to fresh samples, but the discrimination between HLA-B 27 positive and HLA-B 27 negative samples remained feasible post stabilization in most cases. In the pilot EQA send-out the results obtained with stabilized samples were less concordant due to variable quality of these samples. In our opinion, long-term stabilized whole blood samples may be useful as true HLA-B 27 positive and true HLA-B 27 negative control cells for daily and longitudinal quality control of flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, and may be used for EQA purposes. However, long-term stabilized samples are not suitable for reagent validation purposes. Extensive quality control of stabilized samples is necessary before distribution to the laboratories. Secondly, to assess the effect of multiple variables on CD 34 + cell enumeration, we analyzed the results of 9 EQA send-outs in the Benelux countries. Therefore, robust multivariate regression, divergent to the statistics performed in most other studies, was used. We studied the effect of methodological aspects of CD 34 + cell counting on assay outcome and whether or not this exercise was effective in reducing between-laboratory variation. Five variables were associated with significant bias of absolute CD 34 + cell counts: (i) laboratory, (ii) gating strategy; (iii) CD 34 mAb fluorochrome; (iv) type of flow cytometer, and (v) method of sample preparation. In addition, laboratory and platform methodology (i. e., single vs. dual) contributed significantly to the variability of this assay. Our approach, i. e., EQA with targeted training and feedback in response to reported results, has been successful in reducing the variability of CD 34 + cell enumeration between participants. Thirdly, to assess the effect of multiple variables on CD 3 + T-cell, CD 4 + T-cell, CD 8 + T-cell, NK-cell, and CD 19 + B-cell enumeration, we analyzed the results of 10 EQA send-outs in the Benelux countries. Again, robust multivariate regression was used. We studied the effects of the methods used on assay outcome, and whether or not this EQA exercise was effective in reducing between-laboratory variation. Five variables were associated with significant bias of absolute lymphocyte subset counts: (i) platform methodology, (ii) sample preparation technique, (iii) gating strategies, (iv) <b>sample</b> <b>stabilization,</b> and v) laboratory. Platform methodology, <b>sample</b> <b>stabilization,</b> and laboratory also affected assay variability. With time, assay variability tended to decline; this trend was significant for B-cell counts only. Participants tended to standardize their techniques mainly with respect to sample preparation and gating strategies, but less with absolute counting techniques.

Low pH has better stability on metastable t-ZrO 2 compared to high pH. Strong reducing agent (NaBH 4) gives better stability on t-ZrO 2 upto 600 °C compared to NH 4 OH. Reduction technique controls the crystallite size and slowly converts to m-ZrO 2 as the calcination temperature increases. From the thermal as well as microstructural studies it was concluded that the stabilization of t-ZrO 2 is dependent on the initial pH of the precursor, calcination temperature and also on the crystallite size of the ZrO 2...|$|R

M. A.) and, after <b>stabilization</b> <b>samples</b> {{can be obtained from}} right (R. H. V.) and a left (L. H. V.) hepatic vein, the portal vein (P. V.) and a peripheral artery (A.). Total hepatic (T. H. B. F.) and portal (P. B. F.) venous blood flows can be calculated using Fick's formula and mean values (c. p. m. /cc) of samples. Radio-hippuran was utilized in 13 dogs. When comparing blood flows (cc/min) measured from R. H. V. and L. H. V. samples, a mean difference of 33. 5 % was found between paired values...|$|R
40|$|Plasma vitamin C level may be {{associated}} with risk of some chronic diseases. The rapid degradability of vitamin C in biological <b>samples</b> necessitates its <b>stabilization</b> with meta-phosphoric acid or similar agents. However, in most cohort studies, prospectively collected biological samples are not treated with stabilizing agents before long-term frozen storage and it is not known whether vitamin C can be properly measured in such samples. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the degree of vitamin C degradation in plasma <b>samples</b> stored without <b>stabilization</b> for 7 to 11 years at 196 C. Spearman’s correlation coefficients indi-cate a moderate correlation between baseline and final plasma vitamin C levels in both men (r = 0. 57, P < 0. 0001) and women (r = 0. 52, P < 0. 0001). Samples were also categorized based on low or high baseline levels of plasma vitamin C, with the latter category showing the highest rate of loss per year of frozen storage in men (1. 96 Mmol/L, P value for difference < 0. 0001; percent loss 24. 6 %) and women (2. 35 Mmol/L, P value for difference < 0. 0001; percent loss 24. 2 %), as determined by multiple regression analysis adjusted for smoking status, age, and body mass index. In men, both baseline and final plasma vitamin C values were lower in smokers than never smokers, but for both men and women the rate of vitamin C loss during storage was not significantly different between smokers and never smokers. The results of this study show that vitamin C can be measured with reasonable reliability in plasma samples frozen for long periods of time without addition of any stabilizing agents.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design methodology of digital fuzzy controller(DFC) for the systems with time-delay. We propose the fuzzy feedback controller whose output is delayed with unit sampling period and predicted. The analysis {{and the design}} problem considering time-delay become very easy because the proposed controller is syncronized with the <b>sampling</b> time. The <b>stabilization</b> problem of the digital fuzzy system with time-delay is solved by linear matrix inequality(LMI) theory. Convex optimization techniques are utilized to solve the stable feedback gains and a common Lyapunov function for designed fuzzy control system. Furthermore, we develop a control system for backing up a computer-simulated truck-trailer with the consideration of time-delay. By using the proposed method, we design a DFC which guarantees {{the stability of the}} control system in the presence of time-delay...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the design}} of a MEMS based {{differential}} amplifier is investigated. The goal of this investigation is to design, fabricate and characterize a differential amplifier whose performance is based on a physically coupled, but electrically isolated fully differential mechanical transconductor input stage that is fabricated using SOI-MEMS technology. The MEMS sensor will act as a vibrating capacitor input stage. It will provide galvanic isolation and up-modulation of the input signal as it vibrates. The galvanic isolation facilitates low-leakage inputs and a very wide input common mode voltage range. The up-modulation provides a means for achieving a low input referred offset voltage and low-noise via the use of correlated double <b>sampling</b> or chopper <b>stabilization.</b> At the system level, this amplifier consists of two major loops: the drive loop an...|$|R
40|$|Five {{low-rank}} {{coal combustion}} fly ash samples extensively characterized in previous projects {{were used as}} a pool of candidate materials for potential use as waste stabilization agents. Two of these fly ash samples were selected because ettringite formed in the solid in long-term leaching experiments, and an associated reduction in leachate concentration {{of at least one}} trace element was noted for each <b>sample.</b> The <b>stabilization</b> experiments were designed to evaluate the removal of relatively high concentrations of boron and selenium from a simulated wastewater. Sulfate was added as one variable in order to determine if high concentrations of sulfate would impact the ability of the ettringite to include trace elements in its structure. The following conclusions can be drawn from the information obtained in this research: CCBs (coal combustion by-products) can be useful in the chemical fixation of potentially hazardous trace elements; indication of ettringite formation alone is not adequate for selecting a CCB for waste stabilization applications; moderate sulfate concentrations do not promote or inhibit trace element sorption; ettringite formation mechanisms may impact trace element fixation and need to be elucidated; laboratory demonstration of the CCB with the stabilization process being proposed is necessary to verify the efficacy of the material and process; and the final waste form must be evaluated prior to management according to the required regulatory procedures...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} is made for the XPS analysis of food products (mainly spray-dried powders, which reveal a considerable surface enrichment in lipids) and of microorganisms and related systems (extracellular polymer substances and biofilms). This survey {{is used as a}} background for discussions and recommendations regarding methodology. Sample preparation methods reviewed are freeze drying, analysis of frozen hydrated specimens and adsorption of surface-active biocompounds on model substrates. Peak decomposition is a way to increase the wealth of information provided by the XPS spectra. It should be performed after a check that <b>sample</b> charge <b>stabilization</b> is satisfactory. Moreover, ensuring the precision needed to make comparisons within sets of samples may involve a trade-off between imposing constraints and generating information. The examination of correlations between spectral data in the light of chemical guidelines is useful to validate or improve peak decomposition and component assignment, and may also upgrade the chemical information regarding speciation. Further upgrading may be achieved by expressing marker XPS data in terms of concentrations of compounds of interest. Different methods of computation are discussed, providing a composition in terms of ingredients, classes of biochemical compounds, or various organic and inorganic compounds. As an alternative or complement to this deterministic approach, multivariate analysis of suitable spectral windows provides spectral components, which may be used for comparing samples, and which may have a direct chemical relevance or be used to identify features of interest...|$|R
40|$|A new multi-scale, {{stabilized}} {{method for}} Q 1 /P 0 finite element computations of Lagrangian shock hydrodynamics is presented. Instabilities (of hourglass type) {{are controlled by}} a stabilizing operator derived using the variational multi-scale analysis paradigm. The resulting stabilizing term {{takes the form of}} a pressure correction. With respect to currently implemented hourglass control approaches, the novelty of the method resides in its residual-based character. The stabilizing residual has a definite physical meaning, since it embeds a discrete form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Effectively, the proposed <b>stabilization</b> <b>samples</b> and acts to counter the production of entropy due to numerical instabilities. The proposed technique is applicable to materials with no shear strength, for which there exists a caloric equation of state. The stabilization operator is incorporated into a mid-point, predictor/multi-corrector time integration algorithm, which conserves mass, momentum and total energy. Encouraging numerical results in the context of compressible gas dynamics confirm the potential of the method...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{oxidation}} {{is involved}} in regulatory physiological events {{as well as in}} damage to tissues and is thought to {{play a key role in}} the pathophysiology of diseases and in the aging process. Protein-bound carbonyls represent a marker of global protein oxidation, as they are generated by multiple different reactive oxygen species in blood, tissues and cells. <b>Sample</b> preparation and <b>stabilization</b> are key steps in the accurate quantification of oxidation-related products and examination of physiological/pathological processes. This review therefore focuses on the sample preparation processes used in the most relevant methods to detect protein carbonyls after derivatization with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine with an emphasis on measurement in plasma, cells, organ homogenates, isolated proteins and organelles. Sample preparation, derivatization conditions and protein handling are presented for the spectrophotometric and HPLC method as well as for immunoblotting and ELISA. An extensive overview covering these methods in previously published articles is given for researchers who plan to measure protein carbonyls in different samples...|$|R
