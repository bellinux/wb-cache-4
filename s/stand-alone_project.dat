The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>project,</b> outside of the series leading up to The Defenders. Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making [...] "the best 13 episodes of Daredevil season two" [...] at the time, but did say, [...] "I'm never going to discourage a network from looking at one of our characters and encouraging us to do more....If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more of that person, terrific." [...] In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered The Punisher, confirmed Bernthal's involvement and named Steve Lightfoot as showrunner. Woll reprises her role as Karen Page in the series.|$|E

This report refers to these proposals as <b>stand-alone</b> <b>projects.</b> In the short term, <b>stand-alone</b> <b>projects</b> may have significant merit as they can result in the provision of additional infrastructure or improved relations between state and local stakeholders.

40|$|What is {{the nature}} of China’s {{educational}} partnerships with Africa? This chapter examines China’s investment in human resource development in Africa, especially in higher education, through several programmes including long- and short-term training of Africans in China, Confucius Institutes, <b>stand-alone</b> <b>projects,</b> and the 20 + 20 scheme for higher education cooperation between China and Africa. It investigates several apparent differences between China’s aid discourse and practice and those of traditional Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) donors. It asks how the enduring continuity of China’s discourse on mutual benefit and common good in educational aid can be explained. Can what looks like a one-way partnership in terms of financing really, in fact, be symmetrical...|$|R

50|$|Like most of {{the films}} in the series, the premise of this film was {{repurposed}} from a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>project.</b> Various scripts were written for Die Hard 3; {{a number of them}} were ultimately rejected by Bruce Willis on the grounds that a number of them felt like retreads of the action movies that came {{in the wake of the}} first film.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} and development activity {{has been devoted}} over the last 20 years to determining and codifying, in standards and certification programs, the knowledge and practices that are considered necessary for competent performance of project managers. Although not explicitly stated as such, these efforts are essentially geared toward threshold competence represented by minimum standards for project management knowledge and practice considered necessary for effective workplace performance. Further, they are primarily designed for management of single or <b>stand-alone</b> <b>projects</b> for which goals and methods can be well defined. On such projects, minimum standards for knowledge and practice can provide a shared vocabulary and assist in achieving a relatively consistent level of performance {{for a majority of}} project management practitioners. However, the adequacy of these mainstream practice standards, knowledge guides, methodologies, and recommended best practices in addressing the experienced complexity of projects, has been increasingly questioned by both researchers and practitioners...|$|R

The film was never released in the United States or in Europe, but is available on DVD (without English subtitles) through Panorama Entertainment. Oddly, and possibly due to rights issues, the film is built as a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>project</b> despite casting Fan Siu-wong in the title role, sporting the camouflage poncho seen in flashbacks and in the manga.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} a number of external influences on targets for education in developing countries and on national plans {{for the development of the}} education sector. Both the external pressure to develop Poverty Reduction Strategies in developing countries and the Millennium Development Goal process influence national education targets and plans. The paper argues that key inputs to education are increasingly driven by non-educators and examines the influence of non-educators on teacher recruitment and deployment, classroom construction and textbooks. The paper identifies the trend among multilateral and bilateral donors to provide financial assistance through general budget support and examines some of the international evidence on the impact on education systems of: (i) <b>stand-alone</b> <b>projects,</b> (ii) assistance provided within sector-wide approaches, and (iii) general budget support. World Bank evaluations of each mode of support to education within Uganda are then examined and discussed. The paper concludes with some lessons for educators.

40|$|Efforts {{have been}} {{underway}} since 1989 {{to assess the}} prospects for biomass-to-electricity projects in Yunnan Province. Results of prefeasibility studies for specific projects suggest that they are both financially and technically viable. Because of low labor costs and favorable climate biomass can be grown on marginal and underutilized land and converted to electricity at costs lower than other alternatives. Bases on current plantation establishment rates, the potential size of the biomass resource can easily support over 1 GW of electric generating capacity in small-sized (up to 20 - 40 MW) cogeneration and <b>stand-alone</b> <b>projects.</b> These projects, if implemented, can ease power shortages, reduce unemployment, and help sustain the region`s economic growth. Moreover, the external environmental benefits of biomass energy are also potentially significant. This report briefly summarizes the history of biomass assessment efforts in Yunnan Province and discusses in more detail twelve projects that have been identified for U. S. private sector investment. This discussion includes a feasibility analysis of the projects (plantation-grown biomass and its conversion to electricity) and {{an estimate of the}} biomass resource base in the general vicinity of each project. This data as well as information on power needs and local capabilities to manage and operate a biomass-to-electricity project are then used to rank-order the twelve projects. One cogeneration and one stand-alone facility are recommended for additional study and possible investment...|$|R
